 We consider the problem of id entifying authoritative users in Yahoo! Answers. A common approach is to use link analysis techniques in order to provide a ranked list of users based on their degree of authority. A major problem for such an approach is determining how many users shoul d be chosen as authoritative from a ranked list. To address this problem, we propose a method for automatic identification of authoritative actors. In our approach, we propose to model the authority scores of users as a mixture of gamma distributions . The number of components in the mixture is estimated by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) while the parameters of each component are estimated using the Expectation-Maximi zation (EM) algorithm. This method allows us to automati cally discriminate between authoritative and non-authoritative users. The suitability of our proposal is demonstrated in an empirical study using datasets from Yahoo! Answers.

Internet surfers use the Web to fi nd various information related to a wide range of topics. In this context, Internet search engines relevant documents relative to a specific topic. Internet search engines are extremely useful. Without access to a search engine, many of us would be paralyzed. Web users are also constantly looking for new online services to complement search engines. Am ong these services are question-answering forums where users come to ask and answer questions and share their knowledge. In thes e online services, users also form communities around shared interests in a wide variety of topics. There are generally three types of users in question-answering communities [1]: 1) users who only ask questions; 2) users who only answer questions and 3) user s who ask and answer questions. It is obvious that a user who answers another user X  X  question generally has more expertise on the subject than the asker [1]. Answerer people provide advice to askers without the promise of a return on their investment [2]. On the other hand, an asker prefers to receive answers from au thoritative users with expertise on the specific subject. In this context, identifying prominent actors in question-answering communities is of great importance. One typical example of a question-answering forum is Yahoo! Answers 1 . Yahoo! Answers is a very popular service and already reports millions of users. According to [3] it captures 96% of the question and answer market share. This success can be attributed to the significant number of participants with different skills and expertise. Hence, locating different sources of authoritative knowledge by estimating the authority of each user becomes a crucial issue to improve the content and the quality of the service that Yahoo! Answers offers its users. Several other reasons motivate the identification of authoritative actors in Yahoo! Answers. For instance, routing each newly asked question to appropriate experts significantly helps in providing askers with efficient, helpful service, by minimizing the effort and time askers must invest to find or receive good answers to their questions. Moreover, enhancing the visibility of authoritative users on the site and connecting askers with experts can play a critical role in fostering communities around shared interests. The formation of such communities encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing between users. In addition, authoritative users can participate efficiently and saliently in improving the quality of the site content by selecting useful information from the huge mass of information available in Yahoo! Answers. The problem of identifying author itative users in a community of users has recently received growing attention from the research community [4, 5, 6]. Most of the existing approaches that attempt to discover authoritative actors represent the environment as a graph in which nodes represent users and arcs represent the interactions between them. The authority score is generally measured by means of a graph-based ranking algorithm such as http://answers.yahoo.com/ HITS [7] or PageRank [8] or one of its variants, AuthorRank [6] and ExpertiseRank [1]. The output of graph-based ranking algorithms is a ranked list of users based on their degree of authority on subjects of interest. Based on this list, the top K users are considered as most authoritative. The weakness of such an approach resides in the unprincipled selection of the value of K . In general, the value of K is chosen solely on the basis of specific knowledge of an application. However, in many real-life applications, such as the ones suggested for Yahoo! Answers, it is very difficult to set the more power to the selected users. An inappropriate choice of the value of K can have a very negative impact on the quality of the service. Furthermore, since there are a large number of categories in Yahoo! Answers, setting appropriate values of K for each category is a very difficult task if performed manually, by inspecting users X  behavior for each of them. In this context, automating the process of discovering authoritative actors in Yahoo! Answers becomes an absolute necessity. To our knowledge, no principled method for choosing the value of K has yet been published. This motivated our effort to design a method for automatically discri minating between authoritative and non-authoritative users, rather than simply producing a ranked list. To the best of our knowledge, the method that we propose is the first attempt to systematically discover authoritative actors in question-answering forums. In our approach, we propose to model the authority scores of users as a mixture of gamma distributions . The number of components in each mixture is estimated by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while the parameters of each component are estimated by the EM algorithm. Based on exte nsive experiments on datasets extracted from Yahoo! Answers, we found that authority scores can be modeled as a mixture of two gamma distributions. One of these two components, we will s how, corresponds to authoritative actors. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes Yahoo! Answers. In S ection 3, we provide a brief overview of recent related work. In Section 4, we analyze the suitability of several link analysis techniques and choose the most appropriate one for our problem. S ection 5 describes in detail our approach for the identification of authoritative actors. Section 6 presents the application of our technique on Yahoo! Answers. Our conclusion is given in Section 7. Yahoo! Answers is an online community-based question-answering service organized according to a taxonomy of topics. In general, such Web-based communities become very popular places for people to ask and answer questions in order to help each other. An ever-growing number of users participate in Yahoo! Answers. As a result, it now hosts a very large number of questions and answers in a wide variety of domains. Participants can thus save time in their quest for information because they can get an answer relatively quickly or find what they are looking for among the existing questions and answers. In addition, users actively participate in regulating the whole system. A user can report abusive behavior by other users who are violating the community guidelines. A user can al so mark interesting questions, evaluate answers and vote for the best answers. As described in [9], the central elements of the Yahoo! Answers system are the questions. Each question has a life cycle. It starts in an  X  X pen X  state where it receives several answers. Then at some point (determined by the aske r, or by an automatic timeout in the system), the question is considered  X  X losed, X  and can receive no further answers. At this stage, a  X  X est answer X  is selected either by the asker or by other users via a voting procedure; once a best answer is chosen, the question goes into the  X  X esolved X  state and becomes, in principle, a browsable piece of information. One of the most important feature of the question life cycle described above is the interacti on between the user who asks a question (the asker) and the user w hose answer is selected as best answer (the best answerer). When an asker chooses a best answer, he provides a quality rating for the answer. Such an interaction between users allows the generation of a weighted directed graph G representing the flow of best answer selection among the users involved. The graph G is denoted G = (V, E, W) , where V is a set of nodes representing users (asker or best answerer). A directed edge has chosen user v 2 as the best answerer for his question. Finally, W is the set of weights w ij associated with each edge connecting a pair of users ( v i , v j ). The magnitude of the link between two users is the frequency corresponding to how often one user who asks a question chooses the other user as best answerer. Figure 1 illustrates the graph G . As can be seen from this figure, there are three different types of users: 1) users who usually only ask questions; 2) users who usually only answer questions and 3) users who help each other and share their knowledge. Users who usually only ask questions Users who usually only answer questions Users who help each other An interesting property of the graph G is that users are usually bounded by shared interests and not social relationships. Users come to the site to ask and an swer questions related to their interests. Often, askers take th e time to choose the best answers. Therefore, the link structure depicted in Figure 1 reflects choices people make about what informa tion is useful, interesting and authoritative. Our hypothesis is th at the connection  X  X sker  X  best answerer X  implies a much stronger social bond than any other social relationship allowed in th is service. In addition, as mentioned in [1], in a question and answer community, the direction of the links carries more information than just shared interests. It is obvious that the link between asker and best answerer usually indicates that the best answerer has a particular skill, experience, or expertise on a specific topic that the asker does not have. The nature of the links between users (askers and best answerers) described above suggests that Yahoo! Answers is a valuable source of knowledge and seems partic ularly well suited to the task communicate what they know. In this context, Yahoo! Answers offers an interesting case study since its content is highly multidisciplinary and therefore attracts users from a wide variety of fields; e.g., medicine, biology, mathematics, physics, philosophy, etc. Since Yahoo! Answers is organized by categories (belonging to the taxonomy we mentioned previ ously), our goal consists in identifying authoritative users for each category. For this purpose, we exploit the structure of the graph representing the interaction between users (asker  X  best answerer) in each category. The problem of identifying authoritative users in a community is mainly related to the problem of expert identification. Most of the recent work in this domain represents the environment by a graph or a network [1, 4, 5, 6, 10]. Such representations allow for the application of  X  X ink analysis X  techniques and gr aph-based ranking algorithms in order to analyze the properties of each node (user status). The output of these algorith ms is a list of all nodes (users) ranked according to their authoritative level. Campbell at al. [4] describe a system that identifies expertise from email. For this purpose, a gr aph-based ranking algorithm and a content-based technique that ta kes into account only email texts are used. Based on the results in [4], the graph-based algorithm seems more suitable for the purpose of expert identification than a content-based approach. Dom et al. [5] compare various ranking algorithms, including HITS and Pa geRank, on both artificial and email networks. The experiment s in [5] show that PageRank performs better than other ranking algorithms. Liu et al. [6] explore the co-authorship network of past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital library conferences in order to measure the prestige of an author (prestige is closely related to the notion of expertise [1]). The co-a uthorship network is represented as a graph where each author is represented as a node and the collaboration relationship between actors (co-authorship) is represented as an edge. The authors in [6] propose three representations of their co-authorship network: 1) a non-weighted undirected graph; 2) a non-weighted directed graph and 3) a weighted directed graph. To inve stigate these graphs, several link analysis techniques, such as betweenness centrality and PageRank, are applied. A modifi ed version of PageRank named AuthorRank is also proposed in order to analyze weighted directed graphs. The results in [6] show the clear advantage of the use of AuthorRank and PageRank in the co-authorship network. In [10], an entropy model that combines information theory with statistical techniques is proposed to identify important nodes (authoritative users) from a graph. Important nodes are those which have the most effect on the graph X  X  entropy when they are removed from the graph. The algorithm described in [10] comprises two phases. First the entropy of the whole graph is calculated. Second, the nodes in the graph are removed one by one and at each step the entropy of the remnant graph is estimated. The output of the algorithm is a ranked list of nodes based on the graph entropy. The authors in [10] illustrate the suitability of their approach for the identification of interesting (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron / ). Expert identification from question-answering communities has been the object of study in recent work [1]. Zhang et al. [1] analyze data from the Java forum. The data is represented as a graph in which nodes correspond to users and arcs represent the interactions between users w ho ask a question and users who answer a question. The authors evaluate several graph-based ranking algorithms, including HITS and ExpertiseRank (a PageRank-like algorithm). The experiment in [1] reveals that a simple link-based metric could be a powerful tool for measuring the expertise level of users fro m question-answering communities. The problem of ranking users in question-answering forums was also studied in [11]. Instead of using graph-ranking algorithms, the authors propose a Bayesian-based approach to obtain a posterior estimate of user X  X  cr edibility. Further details and a survey on the problem of identifying authoritative actors can be found in [12]. Given the graph structure described in Section 2, we now turn to the problem of analyzing the properties of each node (user status). As mentioned in the previous sec tion, link analysis techniques are widely used for this purpose since they provide a score of the relative authority of each node in the graph. A number of link analysis algorithms have been proposed [1, 7, 8]. The fundamental question now is what sort of model would work best for our application. In what fo llows, we discuss some important link analysis techniques which are close to the context of our study and then choose the most appropriate one for our application. We also argue why some techniques are not yet well suitable to the task of our study. PageRank and HITS were the pioneering approaches that introduced Link Analysis Ranking, in which hyperlink structures are used to determine the relative authority of a Web page. The PageRank assumption is that a node transfers its PageRank values evenly to all the nodes it connects to. A node has high rank if the sum of the ranks of its in-links is high. This covers both the case where a node has many in-links and that where a node has a few highly ranked in-links. The idea of PageRank has an intuitive parallel for question-answering forums. To clarify this, let X  X  take the example given in B  X  X  questions, then C should receive a high authority score, since he is able to answer the questions of someone who himself has some expertise. However, this is not usually true in Yahoo! Answers. To clarify this point, let X  X  take for instance the category  X  X rogramming &amp; Design X . In such a category, users ask questions related to different subjects of programming such as Java, C++, PHP, etc. In this context, if user B answers user A  X  X  questions, which are about Java, and user C answers B  X  X  questions, which are about PHP, it is not possible to state that C is more expert than B , because B and C have different expertise. The former has expertise in Java while the latter has expertise in PHP. The example described above is frequent in Yahoo! Answers since this latter is organized in categories corresponding to large subject areas. In deed, in the same category, we can find users who have expertise on specific t opics but ask questions about other topics. This stimulates the interaction between Yahoo! Answers participants and encourages them to help each other frequently. We claim that PageRa nk provides interesting results when the interactions between users are around one specific subject only. The study in [1] illustrates this by using a PageRank-like algorithm called E xpertiseRank on data from the Java forum, in which the interactions between users are exclusively about Java programming. Kleinberg, in his seminal paper [7], introduced the HITS algorithm. The fundamental assumption of HITS is that in a graph there are special nodes that act as hubs. Hubs contain collections of links to authorities [7]. A good hub is a node that points to good authorities, while a good authority is a node pointed to by good hubs. In the context of our st udy, askers can act as hubs and best answerers can act as authoritie s. HITS associates two scores to each node: a hub score and an au thority score. However, based on experiments we performed on data from Yahoo! Answers, the algorithm HITS does not yield satisfactory results. The following two examples illustrate this point. Example 1. Consider the graph depicted in Figure 2. Similar to the graph illustrated in Figure 1, the nodes in this graph correspond to users (askers or best answerers) and the directed edges represent the interactions between them. Since HITS is principally designed to work with directed non-weighted graphs, we did not consider the weight of edge in this example. In Yahoo! Answers, as described in Section 2, when an asker chooses the best answerer, he or she provides a  X  X uality X  rating. In other words, the interaction between the asker and the best answerer represents an endorseme nt of the quality of the answer of the best answerer. In this particular setting, as we can see from Figure 2, nodes 1, 2 and 3 should be ranked higher since they are frequently chosen as best answerers. However, the HITS algorithm assigns high authority sc ores to nodes 1, 2, 10, 11 and 12, but a near-zero authority score to node 3. This is because, the fact that node 6 points to node 1, which has a strong authority, increases its hub score, causes the authority scores of nodes 10, 11 and 12 to increase. On the other hand, nodes that point to node 3 have relatively small hub scores in comparison to the other nodes that point to nodes 1 and 2. Therefore, node 3 receives a very low authority score with the HITS algorithm. While this behavior of HITS could be very interesti ng in the context of Web-page ranking, it is not suitable in our study. Example 2. Figure 3 represents an example taken from [14]. In this graph, there are two components. Nodes N1 X  X 7 correspond to the first component, while nodes N8 X  X 15 correspond to the second component. This exampl e corresponds to some real situations in Yahoo! Answers. The HITS algorithm will allocate high authority scores to the nodes N9 X  X 15 , while giving zero authority score to node N1 [14]. The reason for this is quite similar to example 1. Specifically, the fact that node N8 points to many nodes contribute to increase its hub score. Hence, causing the nodes N9 X  X 15 to receive higher authority scores. However, intuition suggests that node N1 is the most authoritative since it represents an answerer with a large number of best answers. This particular behavior of HITS is not surprising since its main idea is based on mutually reinfo rcing relationships between hubs and authorities. In some cases, such a strategy has a negative impact since it gives an inappropriate hub/authority score to a node. In other contexts, including th e expert identification, similar behavior of HITS was also observed [1, 5, 13, 14]. We conclude that HITS is not an appropriate choice for our application. On the other hand, HITS is a powerful tool for ranking Web pages since its concept of hubs and authorities (which mutually reinforce each other during the ranking process) fits well with the hyperlink structure of the Web [7]. A deeper investigation on hubs and aut horities framework defined by Kleinberg can be found in [14]. Note that HITS (like PageRank) was originally designed to rank nodes from directed non-weighted gr aphs. However, interactions between Yahoo! Answers participants are represented as directed weighted graphs. Here it is evident that using PageRank or HITS on our data will lead one to ignore a crucial type of information: the magnitude of interaction between users. Liu et al. [6] and Zhang et al. [1] propose AuthorRank and ExpertiseRank, respectively, which extend Page Rank slightly by taking link weights into account. However, since these two algorithms are PageRank-based, they exhibit th e same behavior as PageRank on our data. Therefore, in the context of our application, AuthorRank and ExpertiseRank could not be used to accurately identify authoritative users. Zhang et al. [1] also propose th e Z-score measure in order to estimate the expertise level of pa rticipants in question-answering forums. The Z-score of a user is given by ) ( / ) ( q a q a z  X   X  = where a is the number of answers and q is the number of questions posted by a user. The intuition underlying the Z-score is that it is highly probable that a user who answers many questions is an authority. On the other hand, if a user asks many questions, this implies that it is likely this user has no authority on a specific topic. The experiments in [1] show that the Z-score provides accurate results, comparable to those of ExpertiseRank, and better than those of HITS. However, in our a pplication, such a measure cannot be used. For instance, in the category  X  X rogramming &amp; Design X , we have a user A who is expert in C++ and in terested in PHP. This user answers many questions related to C++ and usually his answers are chosen as best answers. On the ot her hand, the same user asks many questions about PHP programming sin ce he has a lack of expertise negative, which means that this user could not be considered as an authority. measure the authority of users in our application entails a severe loss of information. As with PageRa nk and ExpertiseRank, the Z-score provides useful results on data in which the interaction between users concerns only one topic [1]. A simple technique that can be used to measure the authority of Yahoo! Answers participants is the InDegree. As the name implies, with the InDegree technique the authority of a node (user) is measured by the number of nodes th at link to this node. A node with a high InDegree is likely to be a good authority. However, looking at our graph structure depicted in Figure 1, if we measure the InDegree of the nodes based only on the number of in-links we would be ignoring important informati on. It is clear that we need a weighted graph analysis. In the context of our study, the InDegree of a node will thus be measured based on the sum of the weights of edges that point to this node. In [7], Kleinberg provides a solid argument against the InDegree technique, claiming that it is not sophisticated enough to capture the authoritativeness of a node in the context of a Web hyperlink environment. However, the graph representation that we adopt in our study is radically different from that studied by Kleinberg in [7]. As described in Section 2, our gr aph representation reflects choices people make about what informa tion is useful, interesting and authoritative. A link from an asker A to the best answerer B denotes an endorsement for the quality of B  X  X  answer. In this context, the InDegree technique can be used to rate the authority of each user. In our case, the InDegree of a user is simply the number of best answers given by that user. In Yahoo! Answers, it is reasonable to assume that a user with a high number of best answers in a specific category has some expertise on one or several topics of discussion in that category. For instance, a user who answers 100 questions with 50 best answers among them is better than a user who answers 200 questions with 0 best answers. This is because, in Yahoo! Answers we are not only interested in users who answer many questions, but also in authoritative users, i.e., trusted s ources of correct information. On the other hand, the reader should be aware that it is possible that some spammers create several acc ounts with different pseudonyms. Such users can ask and answer th eir own questions and choose their answers as best answers. Here, it is clear that by doing so, the value of the InDegree of theses user s will increase. However, such behavior does not have a major impact on the estimation of the authority level because the commun ity will usually identify theses users and report such so-called  X  X busive behaviors X . As a consequence, the accounts of such users are deleted from the system by moderators. For all of the above reasons, we su rmise that the InDegree technique is more appropriate for our app lication. Below, we develop a technique to automatically identify authoritative users. After analyzing the behavior of several link analysis techniques on Yahoo! Answers and clarifying why the InDegree technique (i.e., number of best answers) is the most appropriate one for our application, we now turn to solving the problem of identifying authoritative users for each category in the Yahoo! Answers taxonomy. A simple approach is to rank users based on their InDegree and select the top K users as authorities. However, as described in Section 1, in some applications such as Yahoo! Answers, it is difficult to set appropriate values for K . In an attempt to provide an automatic solution to this problem, we developed a systematic and efficient way to discriminate between authoritative and non-authoritative users. Let X ={x 1 , x 2 , ..., x N } be the set of N users having at least one best answer in a specific category CAT . The InDegree of a user x category CAT . We normalize the InDegrees in such a way that score of the authority of each us er. Intuitively, a large value of y means that x i belongs to the set of authoritative users, while a small In order to identify authorities in each category, we are interested in all sets of x i having large values of y i . Estimating the histogram is a flexible tool to describe some statistical properties of the normalized InDegree y i . For the purpose of clarification, we extract data from the category  X  X ngineering X . The histogram of the normalized In Degree of users in this category figure suggests the existence of tw o components. One of these two one represents large values of y i ( 0.04 &lt; y i the first component represents non-authoritative users while the second one represents authoritative users. The fundamental question now is how to formally disti nguish between authoritative and non-authoritative users. For this purpose we propose to model the normalized InDegree y i of all the users in a specific category as a mixture distribution. The probability density function ( pdf ) is therefore estimated and the status of each user in a specific category is identified. As mentioned above, the histogram depicted in Figure 4 suggests the existence of two components with different shapes and/or heavy tails. This interesting obser vation inspires us to use the gamma mixture model. Formerly, we expect that the normalized InDegree follows a mixture density of the form: where G l (.) is the l th gamma distributi on with parameters  X   X  representing, respectively, the shape and the scale parameters of the l th component; and The density function of the l th component is given by where ) ( As mentioned above, each gamma component G l in equation (2) has two parameters: the shape parameter  X  l parameter  X  l . The shape parameter allows the distribution to take on a variety of shapes, depending on its value [15]. When  X  the distribution is highly skewed and is L-shaped. When  X  we get the exponential distribution. In the case of  X  distribution has a peak (mode) in (  X  l -1) /  X  The skewness decreases as the value of  X  l flexibility of the gamma distribution and its positive sample space make it particularly suitable to model the distribution of the normalized InDegree y i . The use of a mixture of gamma distributions allows us to propose a flexible model to describe the distribution of the normalized InDegree y i . To form such a model, we need to estimate m , the number of components, and the parameters for each component. A standard approach for estimati ng the parameters of the gamma components G l is the maximum likelihood technique [16]. The likelihood function is defined as where N l is the size of the l th component. The logarithm of the likelihood function is given by To find the values of  X  l and  X  l that maximize the likelihood these parameters and set the result equal to zero: and This yields the equation where  X  (.) is the digamma function given by The digamma function can be approximated very accurately using the following equation [17]. The parameter  X  l can be estimated by solving equation (7) using the Newton-Raphson method. Its estimated value substituted into equation (6) to determine Let us focus now on the problem of estimating m , the number of components in the distribution. Based on the histogram depicted in Figure 4, we can assume that the normalized InDegree could be modeled as a mixture of two ga mma components. However, this is just a visual observation; there is no proof which guarantees that there are indeed two components. To address this issue, we will now describe a strategy we adopt for estimating the optimal number of components in a mixture. One popular approach [18] to estimating the number of components m is to test values of m from 1 to m_max ( m_max is an input parameter which repr esents the maximum number of components) against a perform ance measure and choose the number of components that optim izes the perform ance measure. For this purpose, we implement a standard two-step process. In the first step, we calculate the maximum likelihood of the parameters of the mixture for a range of values of m (from 1 to m_max ). The second step involves calculating an associated criterion and selecting the value of m which optimizes the criterion. A variety of measures have been proposed to estimate the number of components in a da taset [18, 19]. In our method, we use a penalized likelihood criterion, called the Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC ). BIC was first introduced by Schwartz [20] and is given by where L is the logarithm of the likelihood at the maximum likelihood solution for the mixture model under investigation, and N is the number of paramete rs estimated. The number of components that minimizes BIC(m) is considered to be the optimal value for m . Typically, the maximum likelihood of the parameters of the distribution is estimated usi ng the EM algorithm [21]. This algorithm requires the initial parameters of each component. Since EM is highly dependent on initialization [22], it will be helpful to perform initialization by mean of a clustering algorithm [22]. For this purpose we implement the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm (FCM) [23] to partition the set of y i into m components. Based on such a partition we can estimate the parameters of each component and set them as initial parameters for the EM algorithm. The procedure for estimating the number of components is summarized in Figure 5. Based on extensive experiments on data extracted from a large numbers of categories from Yahoo! Answers, we found that the optimal number of components in a mixture is always two. This suggests that the normalized InDegrees are well fitted by two gamma components, the first representing non-authoritative users with small values of InDegr ee while the second represents authoritative users with large values of InDegree. The pdf of the normalized InDegree represented in Figure 4 is illustrated in Figure 6. Input : {y i }, m_max Output : the optimal number of components m ; begin for m = 0 to m_max do end ; end Based on the analysis above, it is r easonable now to assume that the normalized InDegree could be mode led as a mixture of two gamma components. The following steps can then be implemented to efficiently discriminate authoritative from non-authoritative users. 1. For a given category, estimate the InDegree of each user; 2. Normalize y i , where  X  3. Estimate the pdf of the normalized InDegree with m = 2; classification decision about the membership of y component. Based on this algorithm, we can definitively discriminate between authoritative and non-authoritative users in a specific category by selecting the component which repr esents large values of InDegree y . In the following section we devise an empirical study designed to illustrate the suitability of our approach. In this section, we put our appro ach at work using data from Yahoo! Answers. It worth to point out th at there is no standard method in the literature that our technique could be compared to. To the best of our knowledge, the method that we propose is the first attempt to automatically discriminate author itative and non authoritative users, while existing approaches provide a ranked list of users only. Furthermore, for the reasons men tioned in section 4, we do not consider techniques such as HITS [7] and PageRank [8] (and their derivatives such as ExpertiseRank [1]) for comparison since they are not well suited for the task of our study. On the other hand, there is also a shortage of standard be nchmark data which could be used to evaluate approaches designed to identify expert/authoritative users. All these make the evaluation of the proposed method a challenging task. In this particul ar context, we have adopted a principled way of evaluating the technique presented in this paper. In the following, we saliently illustrate the suitability of our method. First, we describe the datasets used in our experiments, and then we report the results of our experi ments and provide discussions. We report experiments on datasets which represent users X  activities over one full year (from May 2006 to April 2007), for six categories:  X  X ngineering X ,  X  X io logy X ,  X  X rogramming &amp; Design X ,  X  X athematics X ,  X  X hysics X  and  X  X hemistry X . Since we are attempting to identify authoritative actors in each category, our datasets contain interactions be tween askers and best answerers only. The dataset statistics are reporte d in Table 1. Note that, due to commercial-in-confidence, all the datasets statistics are reported in percentage. As illustrated in this tabl e, more than half of the users in each category ask questions only. This indicates that Yahoo! Answers is really a place where users come to get answers to their questions by relying on other users X  expertise in different topics. interested in sharing their knowledge by answering questions only. This repartition of users X  activities is very common into many other categories not described here. It can however be less clear in some other categories where users are engaging into discussions more than into knowledge sharing (this is the case for example in the  X  X olitics X  category). We use our approach to identify authoritative users in each category, as presented in Table 1. As mentioned in Section 5.1, in all cases we found that the normalized InDegrees are well fitted by two gamma components. The com ponent that contains large InDegree values represents authorita tive users. In general, we found that only a few hundreds users who are authoritative. Table 2 provides an idea of the percentage of authoritative users identified in each category. Table 2. Percentage of authoritative users in each category In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we looked at authoritative users in the site and manually evaluated their answers. Since there are millions of question and answers in Yahoo! Answers, it is impossible for us to investigate all of the users manually. We thus selected a few hundreds of authoritative users from the categories  X  X rogramming &amp; Design X  and  X  X athematics X . We specifically chose these two categories because they are close to our domains of expertise.
 We performed a thorough analysis and observed that all of the selected users are very active, w ith a strong presence on the site. In most cases, they provide detailed answers of good quality to a large number of questions. Furthermore, we investigated each selected user X  X  profile page (in Yahoo! Answers, profile pages allow individuals to provide informa tion about themselves and their expertise). This yielded very in teresting and encouraging results. For instance, we found that the sel ected users in the  X  X athematics X  category included math teachers and graduate students. In the category  X  X rogramming &amp; Design X , there were a number of software engineers, We b programmers and students. Such users are valuable sources of knowledge. In our investigation we also observed that such users play a significant role in regulating the w hole system on the site. In several cases, they provide an objective evaluation of the answers of other users through the voting mechanis m available on the site. We believe such users are potential candidates to perform a given organizational role on the site. Based on these encouraging results, we expect that other authoritative users identified by our approach in other categories display similar behavior to the users we analyzed from the categories  X  X rogramming &amp; Desi gn X  and  X  X athematics X . To confirm our claim, we now investigate the quality of the content generated by all the identified authoritative users in a more systematic way. content generated by all the identified authoritative users. We expect these users to generate high-quality content (i.e., questions and answers of high quality). Hence, evaluating the quality of the content generated by authoritative users can also be a validation of the suitability of our method. For this purpose, we use the quality metric described in [9] as the  X  X ol d standard X  for evaluation. Due to space limit, we provide, in the following, a brief description of this approach. Further details can be found in [9]. The work in [9] addresses the problem of identifying high-quality content in community-driven que stion-answering sites. The approach combines the analysis of the textual content with the user feedback on the site in order to estimate a quality score for each question and answer. The quality score described in [9] is the confidence score of a binary classifier trained on high and low quality examples. The value of the quality score is always between 0 and 1. When the question or answer is of high quality, the value of the quality score is close to 1. On the other hand, a question or answer with low quality receives a very small quality score value (close to 0). The experiments in [9] illustrate that such an approach to identifying high-quality content achieves an accuracy close to that of humans. Figure 7 shows the average quality score of authoritative users in each category. As we can see from this figure, the average quality score of authoritative users in each category is generally between 0.7 and 0.77, which is a relatively high quality score. This result represents another source of confirmation concerning the suitability of our approach for identifying users that contribute significantly to generate high-quality content in Yahoo! Answers. Moreover, such results also indicate that askers are very selective in choosing the best answerers. We can thus rely on them and on their judgment with a pretty high level of confidence. In this paper we addressed the problem of the automatic identification of authoritative users in a Web-based question-answering community. Specifically, we analyzed data from Yahoo! Answers, a large-scale community question-answering site. We represented our environment as a weighted directed graph built from the interactions between askers and best answerers. The behavior of several link analysis techniques on our data was analyzed. We concluded that a simple technique such as the InDegree is the most appropriate for rating the authority level of each user. In order to automatically identify authoritative users in each category, we proposed a probabilistic approach based on a mixture model. First, we estimated the normalized InDegree of each user in each category. Next, we analyzed their statistical properties. We found that the normalized InDegrees are well fitted by two gamma components. One of these two co mponents, which contains large values of InDegree, represents authoritative users. We illustrated the suitability of our proposal on datasets extracted from a number of different categorie s. Experiments showed that our approach is able to automatically identify authoritative users in each analyzed category. Moreover, we evaluated the content generated by the identified authoritative users. Our results clearly demonstrate that such users contribute significantly to the generation of high-quality content. Such results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach for identifying prominent users who are rich sources of knowledge. The work of the first author was done while internship at Yahoo!.
