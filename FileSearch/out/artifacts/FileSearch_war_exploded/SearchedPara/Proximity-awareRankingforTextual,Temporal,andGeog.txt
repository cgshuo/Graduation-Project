 Temporal an d geograph ic information n eeds are frequent and important bu t not well served by stand ard IR systems. Recent approaches add ress such n eeds by extracting a nd normalizing temporal and geograph ic expressions from doc-uments. They calculate specific scores for the temporal and / or geograph ic parts of a query. However, all app roaches as-sume ind epen dence between the differen t query parts.
In this paper, we presen t a new model to rank documents acc ording to combined textual, temporal, and geographic queries. The ind epen dence assumption b etween the query parts is eliminated by calculating proximity scores. Thu s, documents are regarded to be more relevant if terms and expressions satisfying the differen t query parts occ ur close to each other in a document. As our evaluations based on the NTCIR-GeoTime data show, our proposed model out-performs baseline models that do not use proximity infor-mation.
 H.3 .3 [ In format ion Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  Retrieva l mod els ; H.3.1 [ Informat ion Storage and Retrieval ]: Content Analysis and Ind exing X  Li ngu istic processing temporal and geograph ic information, ranking, proximity
In many types of documents, temporal and geograph ic inform ation p lays a pivotal role. Unfortunately, users X  tem-poral and geograph ic information n eeds are not well handled by stand ard IR systems although such aspects of queries are important in many search scenarios. For example, Nunes et al. report that 1.5% of the queries in an analyzed query log contain explicit temporal information [11]. Zhang et al. at-test the importance of geograph ic information b y reporting that 12 .7% of the queries in an analyzed query log contain some kind of geograph ic information [19 ].

There probably would be even more search queries that includ e temporal and geograph ic information n eeds if there were better ways to properly query for documents whose content is constrained to specific time intervals or geographic regions. However, in queries as well as in documents, tem-poral and geograph ic expressions are usual ly treated in the same way as regular terms.

A typical search scenario with a combination of a textual, temporal, and geograph ic information n eed is to query for documents about events, which are composed of a specific time and some specific place. Assume, for example, the in-formation need  X  X orld records between 1965 a nd 1974 in Central Europe X . Here , one is faced with two problems: (i) the time interval and the geograph ic region h ave to be in-terpreted as such kind of inform ation, and (ii) temporal and geograph ic expressions in the documents have to be verified if they belong to the specified interval and region, respec-tively. However, if temporal and geograph ic expressions are not identified and n ormalized, a search engine cann ot assign differen t relevance scores to different documents. Consider the two simple documents  X  X n 1972 , he set a world record in Mun ich X  a nd  X  X e set a world record in Beijing in 2008 X  . By identifying temporal and geograph ic expressions, it is possi-ble to use the knowledge that Mun ich is located in Central Europe while Beijing is not, and that 1972 is within the in-terval 1965 to 1974 , while 2008 is not. This issue is even more problematic if relative expressions such as  X  X en years later X  or  X  X n the following month X  o cc ur in a document.
To a dd ress the above shortcomings, there recently have been app roaches to incorporate temporal i nformation [2], geograph ic information [12 ], and b oth [9] into retrieval mod-els. However, all app roaches assume that the textual, geo-graph ic, and temporal i nform ation n eeds formulated in a query are ind epen dent of each other. Thus, for such queries, the models calculate ind epen dent scores for each p art and fin ally combine them into a single score for ranking docu-ments. However, this independ ence assumption is problem-atic because the proximity among e xpressions in a document satisfying the query terms is disregarded. Similar to the pre-vious example, assume the two simple documents (A)  X  X e set a world record in 1972 . . . he died in 2008 X  X  nd (B) X  X e set a world record in 2008 . . . he was born in 1972 X  , (A) should be given a higher relevance score for the example query du e to the proximity between  X  X orld record X  a nd  X 1972 X  in the document.

Another aspect not considered by related app roaches is that t he spatial and temp oral proximity of expressions in documents to the temporal and spatial query terms is not considered at all . Assume the simple query  X  X orld record 1990 Germany X . Also as sume there is no document satis-fying both the temporal and spatial i nformation n eeds bu t there are three documents (A) X  X n 1991 he set a world record in Germany X , (B)  X  X n 1990 he set a world record in France X , and (C) X  X n 1992 he set a world record in Japan X . Documents (A) and (B) seem to be close to satisfying the information need as 1990 is temporally close to 1991 , and France is spa-tially close to Germ any. Both are temporally and spatially in closer proximity than  X 1992 X  and  X  X apan X  in (C).
In this paper, 1 we presen t a novel ranking a pp roach that effectively considers both the proximity of text, temporal, and geograph ic expressions in documents and the spatial and temporal proximity of expressions to query terms. For this, we bu ild on the well-known and widely used ranking model Okapi BM25 [13] and extend it to incorporate the above two proximity features. For determining temporal and geo-graph ic proximity, we employ stand ard distance metrics for time and space as well as spatial i nformation associated with geograph ic expressions in documents. Using the semantics of distances and p roximity in space and time naturally al-lows to increase the nu mber of ranked documents because documents not fully satisfying the temporal and geograph ic queries can be judged based on their distance to the inter-val/region of interest . Both temporal and geograph ic ex-pressions detected in documents are suitably encoded for ef-ficient look-ups to determine documents relevant to queries that formulate temporal and spatial information n eeds.
Temporal and geograph ic inform ation retrieval are often considered separately. Current research trends and chal-lenges in temporal IR such as temporal clustering o f search results are discussed in [1]. While there are some app roaches to improve search results by taking into a cc oun t document creation times, e.g., to favor recent documents [3, 7], there is only little work using temporal i nformation mentioned in documents for querying. Berberich et al. do so by integrating temporal information into a language model for add ressing temporal information n eeds [2]. In contrast to using tem-poral i nform ation for querying, there is more work in ge-og raph ic IR to use geograph ic information extracted from documents for querying document collections, e.g., STEW-ARD [8], SPIRIT [12], and several works that app eared in the Geograph ic Information Retrieval Workshop series.
Recently, there have been approaches to combine tem-poral and geograph ic IR. For example, event-centric search and exploration of document collections with events being considered app ropriate combinations of temporal and ge-og raph ic expressions occ urring in d ocuments is presented in [15]. However, the authors do not provide a ranking a p-proach for their framework. In p articular, none of the above app roaches consider any proximity aspects of expressions in the documents matching temporal/geograph ic parts of search queries.

In add ition to the methods outlined above, the geographic and temporal i nformation retrieval challenges NTCIR-Geo-Time were organized [5, 6]. In comparison to our work, the focus of these challenges is on querying for temporal and ge-og raph ic answers, i.e., to process queries of the form  X  X hen
Our ac companying techn ical report contains more detailed information to several aspects introdu ced in this paper [17]. and where did something happ en X . As pointed out by the organizers, the results s how that X  X emantic questions require semantic processing to deliver results beyond b ag -of-words search X  [4]. That is, temporal and geograph ic information embedded in d ocuments should b e hand led in a special way. Most similar to our work is a Lucene extension to process temporal and geograph ic queries [9]. However, they assume that the textual, temporal, and geograph ic parts of a query are independ ent of each other and d o not t ake into accoun t the proximity in the documents between terms satisfying the differen t query parts. This is a crucial weakness as proxim-ity of query terms in documents plays already an important role in stand ard (commercial) search engines. The same ind epen dence assumption for query terms is also made in the methods proposed in [2] and [12] for temporal and geo-graph ic queries, respectively.

Clearly, there has been substantial work on showing that using information about t he proximity of terms matching query terms in d ocuments significantly improves se arch re-sult, e.g., by add ing a proximity score to Okapi BM25 [13 ]. In our work, we extend these ideas in two ways. (i) We de-velop a proximity measure for terms and expressions s atis-fying the textual, temporal, and geograph ic parts of a query and thu s eliminate the independ ence assumption adopted in previous app roaches on temporal and /o r geograph ic IR. For this, we use the results of the detailed analysis of different methods to determine the proximity between query terms described in [18]. (ii) Taking the full semantics of temporal and geograph ic expressions in d ocuments and queries into acc ount, as s uggested in the context of the NTCIR-GeoTime challenges, our app roach furthermore add s temporal and ge-og raph ic proximity aspects to the ranking a pp roach.
Given a document collection D and a search query com-posed of a textual, a temporal, and a geog raphic part, return a list of documents d i  X  D ranked b y a score measuring how w ell the combined information n eed is satisfied. The score should consider the documents X  relevance on all parts of the information n eed and a proximity score covering the distance between terms s atisfying the different parts of the inform ation n eed in the documents.
Key to our proposed app roach is that in a preprocessing step for a g iven corpus, temporal and geograph ic expressions in d ocuments are identified as s uch and n ormalized in a way that allows for efficient comparison and matching.
To a cc omplish these preprocessing tasks, so-called tempo-ral tag gers and geo-taggers are used. They aim at identifying terms in a document (or query) t hat corresp ond to temporal or geograph ic concepts, respectively. The result of a tem-poral tagg er, when app lied to a document, i s basically a set of triples, each triple consisting o f the term(s) forming the temporal expression t , the offset p ( t ) of the expression in the document, and the normalized value v ( t ). Similarly, for a geograph ic expression g found in a document, a g eo-tagg er returns the e xpression g , i ts offset p ( g ) in the document, and its normalized value v ( g ), which can b e a complex ob-ject such as a point or bound ing box. Profiles. Given a document collection D , all documents d  X  D are preprocessed with a temporal tag ger and a g eo-tagger. Thu s, the temporal and geograph ic expressions in the documents are extracted, normalized to their standard values, and organized in tem poral and geograp hic do cume nt profil es , respectively as: Queries. A query consists of a textual part q text (terms), a temporal part q temp (one or more time intervals), and a g eo-graph ic part q geo (one or more geograph ic regions s pecified by, e.g., bound ing boxes). Thu s, we define a query as:
The document profiles are fin ally used to validate q temp and q geo and to determ ine the temporal and geograph ic proximity  X  based on n ormalized values  X  between expres-sions in the documents and the query parts. In S ection 5 and in [17 ], we give more details on p ossible query interfaces and h ow profiles are compu ted and managed for a g iven doc-ument collection in a preprocessing step for sub sequent effi-cient lookup and ranking tasks required by our framework.
Based on the just described assumptions, we now incre-mentally develop our proximity 2 -aware ranking model. (i) For the individu al components q text , q temp , and q present in a search query, single scores are calculated. (ii) Given a document, based on the distances between terms and expressions in the document satisfying the differ-ent query parts, a score is calculated ( term proximity score ). (iii) There will typically be documents not directly satis-fying q temp and q geo . Assume, e.g., if q temp =  X  X arch 2013 X  bu t in a document t he only temporal expression found is  X  X ecember 2012 X  . For such d ocuments, still positive tempo-ral and geograph ic scores can b e calculated. For this, the temporal and geographic distances between expressions in the documents and the time interval and region specified in a query are considered ( tem poral and geographic proximity ).
For the textual part q text of a query, we calculate a score s text using Okapi BM25 [14]. This measure is mainly based on the term frequ ency c ( w , d ) and the inverse document fre-quency (first fraction in Equation 1, with df ( w ) being the nu mber of documents containing term w ). Given q text and a document d  X  D with | D | = N , it is defined as:
Note that the score is length-normalized using the length d len of a document d and the average document length D avgl of all documents in D . The parameters k 1  X  [1 . 2 , 2 . 0] and b = 0 . 75 calibrate term frequency scaling a nd length n or-malization scaling [10]. For every document d i  X  D , this formula determines a textual score s text ( q text , d i ) represent-ing the relevance of document d i with respect t o q text
Based on the key concepts of s text , we want t o calcu-late the scores s temp and s geo representing how w ell a doc-ument satisfies the other two query parts q temp and q geo respectively. A difference between validating q x (with q { q temp , q geo } ) and validating q text is that q x may consist of one or more time intervals/geograph ic regions and q text sists of one or more terms. More importantly, the regular terms considered in s text and intervals/regions have differ-ent characteristics. While the terms matching q text directly occ ur X  X s is X  X n documents (after preprocessing such as s tem-ming), expressions that may match q x have to be validated based on their normalized values and , in add ition, do not necessarily have to completely match q x . These differences have to be taken into a cc oun t when calculating s temp s geo following the idea of computing s text .

Given a query q x and a document profile xdp ( d ) of a doc-ument d (with xdp ( d )  X  { tdp ( d ) , gdp ( d ) } ) , the normalized values of expressions in xdp ( d ) can (i) be inside q x , (ii) over-lap q x , or (iii) be outside q x . Assume, for example, the normalized query time interval q temp = [1965 , 1974]. The expression  X 1972 X  correspond s to case (i),  X 196 0s X  to case (ii), and  X 1960 X  to case (iii ). Note that for case (i), an ex-pression may cover different parts of a query interval/region. For example,  X  X eptember 197 2 X  X nd  X 1972 X  X  re both in q temp bu t cover different parts of it du e to their different granu lar-ities. Berberich et al. assume for their app roach to satisfy temporal i nformation needs that the more of the query time interval i s covered by a temporal expression, the more rele-vant t he temporal expression [2]. However, we argue that it is only important whether an expression is within q x or not, and that t he coverage of q x can b e better determined b ased on all expressions in xdp ( d ), as we will justify below.
Due to the three different ways how expressions in a profile xdp ( d ) are related to a query part q x , we cann ot simply use the term frequency as for terms matching q text . Thus, we calculate the wei ghted val ue freq uency , vf , which agg regates the value weight vw of every expression x  X  xdp ( d ): vw ( v ( x ) , q x ) :=
The first two cases (i) an d (ii) are straightforward: if v ( x ) is inside q x , we want vw to be 1. If v ( x ) overlaps q vw to represent the proportion of v ( x ) being inside of q vw ( X  1960 s X , q temp ) = 1 2 an d vw ( X 20 th century X , q
For the third case (iii), however, that is, if v ( x ) is outside q , we do not want vw to be simply 0 as we want t o dis-tinguish if v ( x ) is (t emporally/spatially) close to q Thus, we introdu ce the first important proximity parameter of our model to calculate the distance  X  between the normal-ized value v ( x ) and q x . This allows to score also documents with s x &gt; 0 (with s x  X  { s temp , s geo } ) t hat do not contain expressions directly satisfying q x . We use the distance  X  in relation to the  X  X ize X  of q x , which is denoted | q x | . If q temporal expression, then, depen ding o n the granu larity of q , it can be the nu mber of days, months, or years covered by q x . Similarly, if q x is a geograph ic expression, the size of q is s imply the area described by q x (based on its normal-ized value). Given two expressions q x 1 and q x 2 of the same type, intuitively, the following cond ition should h old: This is, the same distance between a normalized value v ( x ) and a normalized query value should result in a lower value weight if the size of the query interval/region is smaller.
The desired behavior of the value weight function vw ( v ( x ) , q with  X  &gt; 0 can b e described as follows: the smaller  X  ( v ( x ) ,q the lower vw ( v ( x ) , q x ) with its first derivative being nega-tive an d its second d erivative being positive. This concave behavior is obtained by an exponential term of the form value weight function vw ( v ( x ) , q x ) as defined in Equation 2.
In summary, an important ingredient of our novel ranking model is that for the temporal and geograph ic ranking func-tions, we use the weighted value frequ ency instead of the stand ard term frequency for regular terms. This app roach app ropriately considers the semantics of temporal and geo-graph ic expressions in terms of proximity of time intervals and geograph ic regions, respectively.
In the Okapi BM25 for the textual ranking score s text , the second important feature besides the term frequency is the inverse document frequency. It carries information about how characteristic a document is for a query with respect to the document collection. For our modifications to BM25 for calculating the temporal and geograph ic scores, we combine information about t he document collection with informa-tion about the coverage of the query interval/region. Given q x (with q x  X  { q temp , q geo } ) and a document profile xdp ( d ) distinct normalized values in xdp ( d ) and the nu mber of dis-tinct normalized values in the combined document profile of all documents xdp ( D ) overlapp ing q x . To a void that t he coverage is zero or und efined if a document or the docu-ment collection contains no normalized values overlapp ing with q x , we add 0.5 to both coun ts. This is important since temporal and geograph ic scores should be positive in both cases for the temporal and geograph ic proximity introdu ced in Section 4.3.1 to work effectively. By this, the coverage of a document without values overlapping with q x is larger than 1 a nd the coverage is the same for all documents if no values in the document collection overlap with q x . coverage ( d, q x ) :=
In our opinion, when being faced with a temporal or geo-grap hic query formulated as time intervals or geograph ic re-gions, the most relevant document does not necessarily cover the whole interval or region bu t contains many different nor-malized values in the interval or region of interest compared to o ther documents. Thus, we use Equation 3 as corpus-depen dent coverage instead of using the plain coverage of q or the inverse document frequ ency as for terms.
Replacing the inverse document frequency by the coverage and the term frequency c by the weighted value frequ ency vf
Figure 1: Ideal shape of the proximity function. in Equation 1, the temporal an d geograph ic scores s x (with s  X  { s temp , s geo } and q x  X  { q temp , q geo } ) are calculated as:
In the same way as s text is defined in Equation 1, these scores are length-normalized, an d the parameters k 1 and b are used to calibrate the scaling behavior.
The relevance scores described in the previous sections represent ind epen dent scores for the query parts q text and q geo with respect t o a document. While previous ap-proaches combine such independ ent scores into a fin al rank-ing score for a document, we argue that t his independ ence assumption is problematic. As ill ustrated in the example in Section 1, i nformation about t he proximity in a document between terms and expressions satisfying q text , q temp q geo should b e considered to reward documents in which the proximity among matching expressions is small, and to pe-nalize documents where such a proximity is large.

Tao a nd Zhai analyzed different ways to measure the prox-imity between query terms matching a textual query in doc-uments [18]. In their comparison of five measures, the mini-mum pair distance (shortest distance of two different query terms , independent of the nu mber of query terms ) perform ed best. Although we are faced with a slightly different prob-lem here, because the terms and expressions for which we want to measure the proximity are of different t ypes, we use their stud y as basis for developing the function to calculate the proximity score s prox . For this, we transfer the mini-mum pair distance into a minimum triple distance . Given a document, such a distance then is naturally defined as the shortest distance among a term w of q text , a temporal expression t satisfying q temp , and a g eograph ic expression g satisfying q geo , denoted prox ( w , t, g ). Clearly, the closer w, t , and g are tog ether in a document, the higher should be the ranking for that document with respect t o the query.
In contrast t o the original proximity measure for two terms, there is no need that t he three terms /expressions w , t , and g , respectively, occur within a few tokens, bu t it should be awarded if they occ ur within a few sentences. Thus, in-stead of the original concave function, we use the following proximity transformation function (containing cub ic term s in b oth n ominator and d enominator):
The behavior of Equation 5 is shown in Figure 1. As-suming a typical sentence length of 20 to 25 tokens [10], the function only slightly penalizes proximities within one or two sentences, bu t significantly penalizes proximities larger than three sentences since s prox is convex for proximities smaller than 50 tokens and concave for larger proximities.
Having defined the separate scores for the textual, tempo-ral, geograp hic, and p roximity ranking, we are now fin ally faced with the same problem as similar app roaches, namely, how to combine the single scores in a meaningful way. A typical way that also allows to specify weightings for the single scores is to use a linear combination. For this, we first normalize the s text , s temp , and s geo scores by the max-imum score for the given query, denoted  X  s text ( q ) etc. Thus, for each query the highest textual, temporal, and geograph ic scores is set to 1 . The proximity score is already normalized, as described in the previous s ection. We therefore obtain the following score for a query q and d ocument d : s ( q , d ) :=(1  X   X  t  X   X  g ) s text
The weights  X  t an d  X  g are used to weight the importance of the three query components q text , q temp , and q geo add ition,  X  is used to weight t he importance of the prox-imity measure. In the next section, we briefly present our evaluation, which is further detailed in [17].
Evaluating a combination of textual, temporal, and ge-og raph ic information n eeds is difficult since there are no benchmarks from IR challenges such as TREC 2 in which a query consists of a textual, a temporal, and a g eograph ic part. However, recently, the NTCIR-GeoTime challenges add ressed a similar problem, namely ranking documents of a g iven d ocument collection for a query having temporal and /o r geograph ic aspects [5, 6].
For our evaluation, we used the NTCIR-8 GeoTime dataset consisting o f 25 queries (called topics). As document collec-tion, the 2002 to 2005 a rticles of the New York Times corpus are used (315 ,417 documents). 3 In add ition to the topics, relevance judgments for each topic are also pub licly avail-able. 4 In the context of the GeoTime challenge, for each query the top-100 ranked documents of each system of the participating teams were judged resulting in 17 ,423 judg-ments in total. Many of the topics in the GeoTime data are of the form  X  X here and when happ ene d X X  , bu t there are also some queries with explicit temporal constraints (5), explicit geograph ic constraints (7), or both (1). Note that t he vary-ing nu mbers of positive judgments (3 to 335 ) for the topics directly ind icate the different levels of topic difficulty.
To be able to process all GeoTime queries and n ot only those with explicit temporal and geograph ic constraints, we adapt our proximity 2 -aware model in the following way: In the absence of explicit temporal or geograph ic constraints, no s temp and s geo are calculated, respectively. However, since all queries have at least a latent t emporal and geo-graph ic aspect (  X  X hen X  a nd  X  X here X ), we calculate s prox tween terms matching the textual query and all temporal and geograph ic expressions in the documents.

The parameters for s text , i .e., for the BM25 model, are set to stand ard values ( k 1 = 1 . 2 a nd b = 0 . 75) . The  X  -parameters of Equation 6 for weighting the single scores s text , s temp , and s geo are set as follows: if a temporal and a g eograph ic c onstraint are specified,  X  t and  X  g are set to 0.2, otherwise, they are set to 0 . This is motivated b y the intuition that t he textual relevance is more important than the temporal and the geograph ic relevance on its own. If a document satisfies either the temporal or the geograph ic constraint in add ition to q text , i t should b e considered more relevant than a document not satisfying q text bu t both the temporal and the geograph ic constraints.
Preprocess ing: For temporal tagging and geo tagging, we use HeidelTime [16] and Yahoo ! Placemaker 5 , respec-tively. In add ition, the Porter stemmer is app lied to the documents and stop words are removed. Note that t hese pre-processing steps do not influ ence the efficiency of the query processing a nd that all tasks are performed on a document level and can thus be parallelized.

Query process ing: The textual query is processed in the same way as the documents, i.e., using the Porter stem-mer and remo ving stop words. For the temporal query, we assume that the intervals are specified u sing normalized val-ues, e.g.,  X 2001 -11 to 20 01-12 X  . For the geograph ic query, we assume that query regions are formulated u sing their bound -ing box information. These assumptions are suitable for our evaluation since we translated the original descriptive Geo-Time topics into q text , q geo , and q temp as s hown in Table 1. Note, however, that other types of query interfaces are pos-sible, e.g., a map interface and a time-slider, or the textual formulation of the temporal and geograph ic queries.
Strategy and indexes: In [17], we detail app lied strate-gies and u sed indexes for efficient evaluation of the textual, temporal, and geograph ic c onstraints, and for calculating the combined ranking score s ( q , d ) defined in Equation 6.
BL-text : The most simple way to handle temporal and geograph ic inform ation n eeds is to include them in the tex-tual part of the query without t reating the temporal and geograph ic expressions in the query and in the documents in a special way. The BL-text queries are shown in Table 1.
BL-boo l : Once temporal and geograph ic expressions are extracted and n ormalized, and the temporal and geograph ic inform ation n eeds are form ally described as time intervals and regions, respectively, we rank the documents according to q text , and u se q temp and q geo as boo lean constraints. This is a very strong baseline, which already uses the semantics of temporal and geograph ic expressions  X  a feature usually not used b y standard search engines. Thus, all documents not satisfying the temporal and geograph ic information n eeds are discarded. If there are no temporal or geograph ic con-straints, documents without any temporal or geograph ic ex-pression are discarded.

In addition, we present results for our newly introdu ced ranking model with  X  = 0 . 5. 6 The queries used as q text q geo , and q temp are also given in Table 1. h ttp://developer.yahoo.com/geo/placemaker/ .
See [17 ] for a detailed study of different  X  values.
As evaluation metrics, we used precision at k (P@ k ), av-erage precision at k (AP@ k ) an d n ormalized discoun ted cu-mulative ga in at k documents (nDCG@ k ). AP and n DCG have also been used to evaluate the systems of the NTCIR-8 GeoTime participants [5].

In Table 2, the e valuation results of the two baseline mod-els and of our new ranking model are presented. Ind epen -dent of the e valuation metrics and the nu mber of documents ( k ), the first baseline BL-text is outperformed by the sec-ond BL-boo l. This shows how important it is to consider the semantics of temporal and geograph ic expressions.
The proximity 2 -aware ranking model outperforms both baseline app roaches. The best results are achieved with  X  set t o 0 . 5, i.e., a medium weighting o f the term proximity feature. The results demonstrate in particular that t he im-provements over both baselines are most remarkable when evaluating the top ranked documents ( k = 5 and k = 10 ). Since the relevance of the top-ranked documents is most crucial for search engines, this shows the importance of tak-ing into accoun t t he term proximity between regular terms satisfying q text and expressions s atisfying q temp and q add ition to considering the semantics of temporal and geo-graph ic expressions (BL-boo l). 7
In this paper, we presen ted a new model to rank doc-uments for a combination of textual, temporal, and geo-graph ic information n eeds. In add ition to calculating sin-gle scores for each p art, we developed a proximity mea-sure to determine the distance in the document between terms and expressions satisfying differen t query parts. Thus, our model eliminates the coun ter-intuitive assumption of in-depen dence between the query components, which d istin-guishes our model from previous works. As our evaluation demonstrates, the extraction and n ormalization of temporal and geograph ic expressions is a prerequisite to satisfy tempo-ral and geograph ic information n eeds. Taking into acc ount the proximity improves ranking results even further.
Currently, we are app lying our model to identify tempo-ral and geograph ic highlights, i.e., to answer queries that contain temporal and geograph ic c onstraints bu t no textual parts. This allows to determine documents that are most rel-evant for time-region combinations s uch as  X  X un ich 1972 X  . This app roach could be the basis of a g eo-temporal event search engine.
Since the GeoTime topics are very heterogeneous with re-spect to explicit constraints an d d ifficulty (see, [5]), we per-formed a detailed analysis of the evaluation results [17].
