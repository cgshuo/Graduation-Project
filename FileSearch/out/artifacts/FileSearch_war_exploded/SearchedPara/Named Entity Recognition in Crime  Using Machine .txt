 With the rapid g rowth of the World Wide Web, the vol u me of crime information available is g rowin g exponentially. Media channels, especially print and broadcast media, have been replete with reports of crime and violence. As a res u lt, the process of man u ally analyzin g and processin g the extensive data has become a diffic u lt task. The p u blic, jo u rnalists, crime analysts, and policemen depend on reso u rces reported information from crime doc u ments are cr u cial for many applications and can play a red u cin g f u t u re crimes. Usef u l and hi g hly important information and entities, s u ch as the victims and their names, names of or g anizations, crime locations, u sed weapons, and crime types, sho u ld be extracted. The crime domain has been chosen as an area in this st u dy beca u se of its social importance. Named entity reco g nition system m u st be developed to process crime news and topics and detect new reports on a specific crime type. This system is beneficial to u sers, s u ch as the p u blic, in obtainin g aware-ness on crimes committed in the past and at present. This st u dy aims to propose NER model that u tilizes two techniq u es (S u pport Vector Machine (SVM) and Na X ve Bayes(NB)) to extract data incl u din g weapons, crime locations, and nationalities of both the victim and the s u spect. This model is tar g eted to be more effective than previo u sly developed models. In the recent decade, several st u dies have been performed on crime data minin g . The res u lts are often u sed in developin g new software applications for detectin g and analyzin g crime data. [1] desi g ned ne u ral network-based entity extraction techniq u es named entity reco g nition (NER) has five entity identifier types that crime investi g ators believe wo u ld be u sef u l in their crime investi g ations. The five types are  X  X erson X ,  X  X ddress X ,  X  X ehicle X ,  X  X arcotic dr ug  X , and  X  X ersonal property X . Res u lt showed that the system achieved enco u ra g in g precision recall rates for person names and narcotic dr ug s, b u t did not perform well for addresses and personal properties. The limitation of this st u dy is that only two named entities, namely, person name and crime, location of crime, nationality of the victim, nationality of the s u spect, and the association between the weapons and the type of crime. [2] described a r u le-based prototype for identifyin g types of crime in a text in the crime domain, which u tilizes a list of keywords and a matchin g al g orithm for classification. [3] had worked on addressin g the crime pattern detection problem by u sin g a cl u sterin g al g orithm to help detect crime patterns and to hasten the process of solvin g crimes. The k-means cl u sterin g techniq u e was employed with some improvements to s u pport the process of identification of crime patterns in act u al crime data acq u ired from the office of a sheriff. Res u lt showed that the most important attrib u te in crime patterns are  X  X ace X ,  X  X  g e X ,  X  g ender X , and  X  X eapon X . [4] combined IE and principles of the co g nitive interview. The IE system combined a lar g e crime-specific lexicon, several General Architect u re for Text En g ineerin g (GATE) mod u les, and an al g orithm to reco g nize relevant entities. The co g nitive interview is a psycholo g ical techniq u e in which people recall information abo u t an incident. Commonly extracted cr ime-related entities are race, g ender, a g e, weapons, addresses, narcotic dr ug s, vehicles, and personal properties. In this paper, crime entities are combined to 15 cate g ories, namely,  X  X ct/event X ,  X  X cene X ,  X  X eople X ,  X  X ersonal property X ,  X  X ehicle X ,  X  X eapon X ,  X  X ody part X ,  X  X ime X ,  X  X r ug  X ,  X  X hoes X ,  X  X lectronic X ,  X  X hysical feat u re X ,  X  X hysical condition X ,  X  X air X , and  X  X lothin g  X . Res u lt showed hi g h precision recall for narrative types. [5] also created another similar system that reco g nized crime-related information besides the type of crime. The newer system has the capability to extract the nationalities of the victim and the extracted by the previo u s model. The system u tilized an indicator in the Arabic lan gu a g e, which did not work correctly for En g lish beca u se the En g lish lan gu a g e has its own m u ltiple indicator terms. [6] s ugg ested a model that relies on nat u ral lan gu a g e processin g methods and adopted the Semantic Inferential Model. The model u tilized collaborative environments on the Internet. The system is called Wiki Crimes and can extract two main crime entities, namely, crime scene and crime type from online web sites. [7] developed an IE model that foc u sed on the extraction of information specific to theft crimes, specifically the crime location (address), from newspaper articles. Theft information was extracted from newspaper articles in three different co u ntries: New Zealand, A u stralia, and India. The model implemented entity reco g nition to reveal if the sentence indicated a crime location or not and the conditional random field approach, which is a machine learnin g method, to check whether or not a sentence shows the crime location. In Constr u ctin g a system for NER u sin g a machine learnin g approach req u ires many which involves the followin g phases: 1. Lan gu a g e reso u rce constr u ction phase 2. P re-processin g phase 3. Feat u re extraction phase 4. Crime entity extraction and classification phase 5. Eval u ation phase The followin g s u bsection will describe each of the phases. 3.1 Language Resource Construction The u se of a s u pervised machine learnin g techniq u e relies on the existence of an-notated trainin g data. S u ch data are u s u ally created man u ally by h u mans or experts in a relevant field. The data u sed in this research were collected from the Malaysian National News A g ency (BERNAMA). The weapons, locations, and nationalities mentioned in the doc u ments were annotated man u ally. Each file consisted of an article by a jo u rnalist reportin g on one or more crimes. 3.2 Pre-processing Phase The pre-processin g phase is a hi g hly important phase in any system that u ses a machine learnin g framework. Before extraction and classification, each doc u ment u nder g oes the pre-processin g phase that has the followin g steps: 1. Tokenizin g of words dependin g on the white space and p u nct u ation marks 2. Stop word removal: Removin g p u nct u ation marks, diacritics, non-letters, and stop words. 3. P art of Speech ( P OS) disambi gu ation is the ability to comp u tationally crime text annotated with P OS ta g s. 3.3 Feature Extraction Feat u re extraction is an important step in any classification system beca u se it improves the efficiency of the classification tasks in terms of speed and effectiveness of learnin g . This phase aims to convert each word to a vector of feat u re val u es. This and crime locations from online crime doc u ments. These feat u res are g ro u ped into affixes, and feat u res based on the context. Table 1 details these feat u re sets. The word in the corp u s is represented u sin g the followin g feat u re vector. 3.4 Machine Learning and Classification Most of the machine learnin g approaches has two phases in which trainin g is first performed to g enerate a trained machine and then followed by a classification step. In this st u dy, we will eval u ate specific machine learnin g approaches. However, to extract the crime entities, namely, nationalities, weapons, and crime locations from online crime doc u ments, the followin g machine learnin g classifiers are u sed: SVM Classifier. S u pport vector machine (SVM) is an effective machine learnin g techniq u e first introd u ced by [8]. SVMs are pop u lar in the machine learnin g comm u nity beca u se of their u se of text cate g orization. The SVM classification method has been proven by many researchers as one of the most effective classification methods based on its performance on text classification and entities reco g nition [9-13]. Adoptin g the str u ct u ral risk minimization principle from the comp u tational learnin g theory, SVMs seek a decision s u rface to separate the trainin g data points into two classes and to make decisions based on the s u pport vectors selected as the only effective elements in the trainin g set. M u ltiple variants of SVMs have been developed [10]. In this paper, o u r disc u ssion is limited to linear SVMs beca u se of their pop u larity and hi g h performance. The optimization proced u re of SVMs (d u al form) is aimed to minimize the followin g : Naive Bayes. The Na X ve Bayes (NB) al g orithm is a widely u sed al g orithm for review implement, and comprise better-performin g al g orithms. Given a feat u re vector table, Two models (i.e., the m u ltinomial model and the m u ltivariate Berno u lli model) are commonly u sed in the application of the NB approach to text cate g orization. NB ass u mes a stochastic model of doc u ment g eneration and implements the Bayes  X  r u le. To classify the most probable class c* for a new doc u ment d, NB comp u tes: The NB classifier calc u lates the posterior probability as follows: The performance of the machine learnin g al g orithms is meas u red on man u ally labeled crime corp u s. The corp u s contains 500 doc u ments collected from the Malaysian National News A g ency (BERNAMA). Each file consisted of an article by a jo u rnalist reportin g on one or more crimes. The weapons, locations, and nationalities mentioned in the doc u ments were annotated man u ally. Fi g . 3 show a sample of the annotated of the u sed data set. 
All al g orithms are eval u ated u sin g 10-fold cross-validation. The objective of this step-u p is to filter the parameters and select the best methods for crime entity extraction. The performance meas u res u sed to eval u ate the named entity reco g nition systems participatin g in the CoNLL-02, CoNLL-03, and JNL P BA-04 challen g e tasks of named entities fo u nd by the learnin g system as correct. Recall is the percenta g e of complete name of the entity, is identified. Definitions of the performance meas u res u sed are s u mmarized below. The same performance meas u res are employed to eval u ate the res u lts of the baseline experiments. In this experiment, the overall performance of each of two classifiers on crime entity extraction was examined. The two classifiers, NB and SVM, are applied on the entire feat u re space. Table 2 shows a s u mmary of the experimental res u lts u sin g the NB and SVM classifiers in extractin g the nationalities of the victim and the s u spect, weapons, and crime locations. 
As shown in Table 2, the hi g hest performance on extractin g weapons, nationalities, and crime locations from crime doc u ments is exhibited by the SVM classifier. SVM u ses a refined str u ct u re that acknowled g es the relevance of most feat u res. SVM also has the ability to handle lar g e feat u re spaces. Therefore, probability is a g ood choice in the crime data set as the feat u re set cases of each example freq u ently occ u r. clearly demonstrate the appropriateness of the application of machine learnin g comprehensive and comparative st u dy of machine learnin g for all crime entity extraction techniq u es. This paper presented a crime NER based on machine learnin g classification approaches, namely, NB and SVM, in extractin g nationalities, weapons, and crime locations from online crime doc u ments. This st u dy collected a new corp u s of crime and man u ally labeled validated by experiments. Finally, the res u lts demonstrated that the SVM classifier and crime locations from online crime doc u ments. 
F u t u re research may be tar g eted at developin g a lar g e crime corp u s and desi g nin g a g eneral framework for crime IE and analysis, which incl u des a u tomatic classification of crime type, identification of weapons u sed in each crime, identification of nationalities of both victim and s u spect, identification of crime location, and analysis on the association between the u sed weapons and the type of crime.
