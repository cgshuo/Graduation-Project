 DARPA has been investing in data science and building open source tools for applications ranging from counter threat finance, through radar operations and cancer research, to anti-human trafficking. This presentation will cover previous work at DARPA, experience building real-world applications for defense and law enforcement to analyze data, and the future of computer science as an enabler for content discovery, information extraction, relevance determination, and information visualization. The talk will be a mix of background, detailed examples, and software demonstration. It will cover the importance of anchoring in applications, minimization of design-to-testing time, development with users-in -the-loop, error tolerance of machine learning, design for diverse user populations, and the necessity of open source software integration. It will conclude by covering a few next directions for special projects at Microsoft. H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Application  X  Data mining Open Source Tools; Data Mining Applications. Chris White is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft working o n special projects. He was recently a Program Manager at DARPA developing advanced technologies for data science, where he created DARPA  X  s leading programs XDATA, Memex, and the Open Catalog as part of the President  X  s Big Data Initiative. His work has been applied to domains including countering human trafficking and counter terrorism, where it has been featured on 60 minutes, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, TEDx, and Google  X  s Solve for X. He previously served DARPA as the Agency  X  s country lead in Afghanistan. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recognized DARPA and his efforts in Afghanistan with a Joint Meritorious Unit Award for support in a combat environment. Prior to DARPA he was a fellow at Harvard  X  s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and holds a PhD in electrical engineering from the Johns Hopkins University.
