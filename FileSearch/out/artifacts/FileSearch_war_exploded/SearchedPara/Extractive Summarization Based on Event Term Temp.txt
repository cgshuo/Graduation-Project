 Extractive summarization selects the most representative sentences from source documents. Under the extractive summarizatio n framework, event has been regarded as an effective concept representation in recently emerged event-based summariza-tion, which extracts salient sentences from single document or multiple documents and re-organizes them in a machine-generated summary according to how important the events that sentences describe are. With regard to the definition of events, in con-junction with the common agreement that event contains a series of happenings, we formulate events as  X  X Who] did [What] to [Whom] [When] and [Where] X  at sentence level in the context of event-based summarization. In this paper, we focus on  X  X id [What] X  and approximately define verbs and action nouns in source documents as event terms that characterize or partially characterize event occurrences. 
Notice that in addition to the quality and the quantity of the informative contents conveyed in the extracted sentences, the relations among the extracted sentences, such as temporal relations in news articles, and structure of the final summary text should be a matter of concern. The sentence relations in source and summary text, if appro-priately defined and identified, are a good means to reflect the text cohesion, i.e. the but also over a succession of a number of n earby related words spanning a topical unit delineate portions of the text that have a strong unity of meaning. Lexical chains have been investigated for extractive summarization in the past. They are regarded as a direct result of units of text being  X  X bout the same thing X  and having a correspondence to the structure of the text. Normally, nouns or noun com-series of events via the set of sentences and take both informative content and struc-ture of the source text into consideration. We look for the event term temporal critical chain in the event term temporal relation graph and use it to represent the source text and to generate the final summary. We concentrate on verb chains, other than noun chains, aiming at improving event-based summarization and lexical cohesion of the generated summaries. Here, event terms and event term chain characterize informa-tive content and text cohesion, respectively. 
To compute the event term temporal criti cal chain, event terms are connected to construct an event term temporal relation graph based on the happens-before relations provided in VerbOcean. This type of relations indicates that the two verbs refer to two temporally disjoint intervals or instances [16]. The DFS-based (Depth-First Search) algorithm is applied in searching the temporal critical chain. Then the event terms in the temporal critical chain are used to evaluate sentences. The sentences with the highest significance scores are extracted to form the final summary. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 introduces the proposed event-based summarization approach based on event term temporal relation graph and critical chain. Section 4 then presents experiments and discussions. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests the future work. Daniel et al. [1] pilot the study of event-based summarization. They recognize a news topic as a series of sub-events according to human understanding of the topic and investigate whether identifying sub-events in a news topic can help capture essential information in order to produce better summaries. Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou [2] then define the concept of atomic events as a feature that can be automatically ex-tracted. Atomic events are defined as the relations between the important named enti-ties. The proposed approach is claimed to outperform conventional tf*idf approach and experimental results indicate that event is indeed an effective feature for produc-order those events are reported and produce a revised up-to-date summary at regular time intervals. Afantenos et al. [5] discuss the techniques to summarize events hap-pened in predictable time synchronously. Relations between events are defined on the axes of time and information source. Lim et al. [4] group source documents on time slots by the time information given in newspaper articles or publication dates. They build the local or global term cluster of each time slot and use it to identify a topical sentence as the representative for the time slot. Jatowt and Ishizuka [6] introduce the approaches to monitor the trends of d ynamic web documents, which are different versions of documents on the time line. Based on distributions, terms are scored in order to identify whether they are popular and active. They employ a simple regres-sion analysis of word frequency and time. Wu et al. [7] investigate whether time fea-tures help improve event-based summarization. After anchoring events on the time line, two different statistical measures, tf*idf and x 2 , are employed to identify impor-tance of events on each date. 
The concept of lexical chain is originally proposed to represent the discourse struc-ture of a document by Morris and Hirst [8]. They define lexical chain as a cluster of semantically related terms and construct lexical chains manually from Roget X  X  The-saurus according to the distance between the occurrences of related nouns and use lexical chain as an indicator of lexical cohesion of the text structure and the semantic context for interpreting words, concepts an d sentences. Barzilay and Elhadad [9] first introduce lexical chain in single document summarization. They produce a summary of an original text relying on a model of the topic progression in the text derived from lexical chains. The lexical chains are computed using relatedness of nouns determined in terms of the distance between their occurrences and the shape of the path connect-ing them in the WordNet thesaurus. Following the same line of thought, Silber and McCoy [10, 11] employ lexical chains to extract important concepts from the source document and make lexical chains a computationally feasible candidate as an inter-metrics and sentence extraction techniques in summary generation. Zhou et al. [13] adapt lexical chains derived from WordNet based on noun compounds, noun entries and name entities to multi-document and query based summarization. Reeve et al. [14, 15] apply lexical chain based summarization approach to biomedical text. They build concept chains to link semantically-r elated concepts. The concepts are not derived from WordNet but domain-specific semantic resources, such as UMLS Metathesaurus and semantic network. The resulting concept chains are used to identify candidate sentences useful for summarization.

At present, the applications of temporal information in summarization are mostly based on time information in the source document or publication date. Meanwhile, the lexical chains mentioned above are all based on nouns, derived from WordNet or domain specific knowledge base. In this paper, we derive temporal information from the temporal relations among event terms and regard the event term temporal chains as the immediate representation of the source documents. structed based on happens-before relation in VerbOcean. Then we explain how the event term temporal critical chain is determ ined from the temporal graph. Finally, sentence selection based on the significance of the event terms in the temporal critical chain is introduced. 3.1 Event Term Temporal Relation Graph Construction In this paper, we introduce VerbOcean, a broad-coverage repository of semantic verb relations, into event-based extractive summarization. Different from other thesaurus like WordNet, VerbOcean provides five types of semantic relations among verbs at into summarization. In this paper, only happens-before temporal relation is explored. When two events happen, one may happen before the other. This is defined as hap-pens-before temporal relation in VerbOcean. Examples of happens-before relations are illustrated below. 
The happens-before temporal relations on a set of event terms can be naturally rep-resented by a graph, called event term temporal relation graph. We formally define the event term temporal relation graph connected by temporal relation as G=(V, E), where V is a set of event term vertices and E is a set of edges temporally connecting event terms. Fig.1 below shows a sample of event term temporal relation graph built from a DUC 2001 document set. 
As we know, the graph is directed if the relation has the property of the anti-symmetric and undirected otherwise. Certainl y, the event term temporal relation graph is a directed graph because happens-before relation in VerbOcean clearly exhibits the conspicuous anti-symmetric property. For example, one may  X  X uestion X  something  X  X uestion X  happens-before the one represented by the term  X  X riticize X . So, a directed edge from  X  X uestion X  to  X  X riticize X  appears in Fig . 1. 
The happens-before relation is also anti-reflexive because each event term cannot happens-before itself. This means that there is no self-loop at each term vertex. There are no parallel edges between any two adjacent term vertices either. Therefore, we can For example, there is no edge from  X  X egar d X  to  X  X epeat X , but the edges exist from  X  X egard X  to  X  X gnore X  and from  X  X gnore X  to  X  X epeat X  in Fig. 1. 3.2 Event Term Temporal Critical Chain Identification The event term temporal graph based on happens-before relation is not a fully con-nected graph. For example, there are eigh t sub-graphs or components in the graph illustrated in Fig. 1. Among them, a maximal weakly connected component, which contains the maximal number of the event terms, can be found. We assume that the event terms in the maximal weakly connected component reflect the main topic of original documents since such a component normally involves much more connected (i.e. relevant) event terms than any other components on the graph. Referring back to Fig. 1, the maximal weakly connected component contains 118 event terms, while the second largest weakly connected component contains only 8. Note that, for illustra-tion purpose, only a partial maximal weakly connected component is shown in Fig. 1. 
Some maximal weakly connected sub-graphs are cyclic. The graph in Fig. 2(a), a part of maximal weakly connected sub-graph in Fig. 1, is cyclic. We can see that there are cyclic relations among the three event terms  X  X ssue X ,  X  X eceive X  and  X  X llocate X . In such a situation, the edge whose terminal term vertex has the maximal in-degree is removed in order to avoid the infinite loop in the identification of the event term tem-vertices. The connection remains. For exampl e, we remove the edge from  X  X eceive X  to  X  X llocate X  in Fig. 2(a) and obtain a directed acyclic graph in Fig. 2(b).

From the directed acyclic graph, we extract all the source vertices and the sink ver-tices. The source vertex is defined as a vertex with successors but no predecessors, i.e. the edges being incident out of it but no edge being incident on it. On the contrary, the being incident on it but no edge being incident out of it. All source vertices and sink vertices in the directed acyclic graph of the maximal weakly connected component in Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 3. 
All directed paths from each source vertex to each sink vertex in the directed acyclic graph of the maximal weakly connected component are computed by the DFS-based algorithm. The longest path is defined as the event term temporal critical chain. The directed paths in Fig. 4 (a)-(d) are four event term chains found in Fig. 1 and the one in Fig. 4(a) is identified as the event term temporal critical chain.
Afterwards, we evaluate the sentences that contain the event terms in the chain and determine which ones should be extracted into the final summary based upon the event term temporal critical chain computation. 3.3 Sentence Selection To apply the event term temporal critical ch ain in summarization, we need to identify the most significant sentences that best describe the event terms in the chain. Consid-ering terms are the basic constitution of sentences, term significance is computed first. Since this paper studies event-based summarization, we only consider event terms and compute the significances of the event terms in the maximal weakly connected component of an event term temporal relation graph. 
Two parameters are used in the calculation of event term significance. One is the occurrence of an event term in source documents. The other is the degree of an event term in an event term temporal relation graph. The degree of a term vertex in the directed graph is the sum of the in-degrees and out-degrees of that term. one sentence containing this term in source documents. We extract only one sentence for each event term to represent the event in order to avoid repeating the same or quite similar information in the summary. For sentence selection, the sentence significance is computed according to the event terms contained in it. Based on event term occurrences, the significance of a sentence is calculated as where i TFS and m TFS are the sum of the term occurrences of the i th sentence and the maximum of all the sentences that contain event terms in the temporal critical chain, respectively. 
Alternatively, we can use degrees of event terms to calculate the significance of a sentence. where mum of all the sentences which contain event terms in the temporal critical chain, respectively. 
It should be emphasized here that the event terms under concern in Equations (1) and (2) must be the ones in the maximal weakly connected component of the event term temporal relation graph. We evaluate the proposed summarization approach based on the event term temporal relation graph and critical chain on the DUC 2001 corpus. The corpus contains 30 English document sets. Among them, 10 sets are observed to contain descriptions of event sequences. They are the main concern of this paper. All final summaries are generated in 200 words length. 
The number of term vertices in the weakly connected component for each of 10 sets is illustrated in Fig. 5. Each bar denotes all weakly connected components of an event term temporal relation graph and the length of each series represents the vertex number in the weakly connected component. In Fig. 5, we can see that the numbers of the term vertices in maximal weakly connected components are actually much larger than the numbers of the term vertices in other components on the event term temporal relation graphs. For example, the maximal weakly connected component of the docu-graph. The other three document sets, i.e.  X  X 05a X ,  X  X 13c X  and  X  X 50i X , occupy above 90% vertices. The minimum of the vertex number of the maximal weakly connected component in the  X  X 04a X  document set also includes almost 30% vertices. The as-sumption that the main topic of a document set can be represented by the maximal weakly connected component is not unreasonable. The maximal weakly connected component roughly describes all the events about main topic of the source documents in detail. 
The final summary shown in Fig. 6 is generated from the event term temporal rela-tion graph in Fig. 1 and the event term tempor al critical chain in Fig. 4(a) according to the calculation of sentence significance based on the vertex degree. The correspond-ing source document set is about the topic  X  X hether to exclude illegal aliens from the decennial census and the final vote result of the Congress X . We can see that the final summary indeed talks about the resident census history, the exclusion announcement, event term temporal critical chain contributes to the cohesion of the final summary. The summary has apparently shows temporal characteristic in sentence sequences, from resident census history, exclusion announcement and reasons for agreement and rejection to Senate vote result at the end. 
To evaluate the quality of generated summaries, an automatic evaluation tool, called ROUGE [17] is used. The tool presents three ROUGE values including uni-gram-based ROUGE-1, bigram-based ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-W which is based on longest common subsequence weighted by the length. 
In Fig. 7, the tf*idf approach is based on term frequency and inverse document fre-quency (a well-known statistical feature used in automatic summarization). We calculate tf*idf weights for all the words excluding stop-words and evaluate sentence significance occurrence approach, Equation (1) is adopted to calculate the significance of the sentence comparative experiment results for the selected ten document sets are illustrated below. 
Except for the document sets  X  X 31f X  and  X  X 56k X , the experiment results based on event term occurrence in the critical tem poral chains are all better than those based on tf*idf. In particular, event term occurrence achieves about 47.2% improvement on ROUGE-1 comparing to tf*idf for the document set  X  X 24d X . 
Table 1 above shows the average ROUGE scores of event term occurrence and tf*idf approaches on the ten selected document sets. The ROUGE-2 score of the event term occurrence approach is comparatively about 39.2% better than the tf*idf ap-proach. Our approach also shows more advantageous than the tf*idf approach on both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-W. We highlight the ROUGE-2 scores here because we take semantic relevance between the events into account but tf*idf does not. 
Google X  X  PageRank [18] is one of the most popular ranking algorithms. It is a kind of graph-based ranking algorithm deciding on the importance of a node within a graph by taking into account the global informa tion recursively computed from the entire graph. After constructing the event term temporal relation graph, we can also use the PageRank algorithm to calculate the significance of the terms in the graph. Because the calculations of sentence significance using PageRank and vertex degree are both based on the links among the vertices in the graph, we compare the ROUGE scores of the event term temporal critical chain based summarization using the vertex degree in sentences selection to those of PageRank-based approach. The experiment results of them are illustrated in the following Fig. 8. 
Except for the document sets  X  X 31f X  and  X  X 57k X , the experiment results of event term degree approach are quite close to those based on the PageRank algorithm. For  X  X 57k X , the ROUGE-1 score of the event term degree approach is 0.38744 while the same of the PageRank algorithm is only 0.31385. It is about 23.4% of improvement. Table 2 below compares the average ROUGE scores of the two approaches. The ROUGE-1 score of the event term degree approach is about 2.5% above the ROUGE-1 score of the PageRank algorithm while the ROUGE-2 scores of them are quite simi-lar. This is mainly because both the degree and the PageRank approaches take the semantic relevance between event terms into consideration in the calculation of sig-nificances of event terms and sentences. 
Table 3 finally compares the average ROUGE scores of the ten document sets se-lected for the experiments above and the other twenty document sets in the DUC 2001 corpus with term occurrence and event term degree respectively. The ROUGE-1 aver-age scores of the twenty document sets are much worse than the average scores of the ten document sets, i.e. about 15.7% lower using term occurrence and 17.6% lower using event term degree. The similar conclusions can be drawn on ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-W. This suggests that the proposed event-based approaches indeed can han-dle those documents describing events or event sequences much better. But they may not suit event irrelevant topics. 
While the previously presented results are evaluated on 200 word summaries, now words and the experiments results based on Degree and PageRank are in Table 4. 
The experiment results in Table 4 show that our approach using event term degree makes much better results in 50 and 100 words summaries. We can also find that our approach prefers shorter summaries comparing with the PageRank approach in 400 words summaries. Of course, we need to test on more data in the future. In this paper, we investigate whether temporal relation between events helps improve performance of event-based summarization. By constructing the event term temporal graph based on the semantic relations derived from the knowledge base VerbOcean and computing weakly connected components, we find that the maximal weakly con-nected component can often denote the main topic of the source document. 
Searching in the maximal weakly connected component with DFS-based algo-rithm, we can discover an event term temporal critical chain. The event terms in this chain are supposed to be critical for generating the final summary. In experiments, the significance of these terms is measured by either term occurrence in source docu-ments or the degree in the constructed graph. The ROUGE results are promising. Term occurrence significantly outperforms tf*idf and term degree is also comparative to well-known PageRank. 
In the future, we will introduce the other types of VerbOcean verb semantic rela-tions into event-based summarization. Besides the temporal critical chain in the event term relation graph, we will investigate the other possible event term temporal chains in the semantic computation. We also plan to combine the surface statistical features and the semantic features during the selection of representative sentences in order to generate better summaries.
