 Max Chevalier 1 Introduction available within the World Wide Web (Web), i.e. user behavior. 2 Book description Structure, and Usage . X  X  It shows how Data Mining techniques can be applied to the Web. The book content is relatively close to other books dealing with Web Data Mining. It is evaluate his understanding of the chapter. 2.1 Section 1: Web structure mining This section is composed of two chapters addressing the way documents (web pages) can deals with Information Retrieval techniques.
 2.1.1 Chapter 1: Information retrieval and web search weighted (thanks to tf.idf formula). The chapter also presents the way documents can be document ranking process are proposed. It deals with:  X  Techniques that exploit users X  feedbacks, techniques. Similarity search relies on many well-known Cosine and Jaccard measures. To sum up this chapter introduces main techniques covering the Information Retrieval prising that this chapter is the longest one of this book. 2.1.2 Chapter 2: Hyperlink-based ranking basics of Social Networks Analysis and points out hyperlink techniques used by famous Authorities and Hubs concepts. 2.2 Section 2: Web content mining evaluation of clustering and classification techniques. 2.2.1 Chapter 3: Clustering many clustering techniques such as:  X  k-Means clustering exploiting statistical measures to construct clusters,  X  Probability-based techniques 2.2.2 Chapter 4: Evaluating clustering clusters:  X  Similarity-based criterion functions ( sum of squared errors ),  X  Probabilistic criterion functions ( Category utility ),  X  MDL-based model and feature evaluation ( evaluating regularities in data ),  X  Classes-to-clusters evaluation ( accuracy )  X  Precision, recall, F-measure ( error cost )  X  Entropy (  X  X  X mpurity X  X  of cluster content ) 2.2.3 Chapter 5: Classification techniques as well as evaluation of such techniques:  X  Cross-validation evaluation measure (Leave-one-out cross validation LOO-CV)  X  Nearest-neighbor algorithm ( k-NN ),  X  Feature selection ( based on Entropy/Information gain ),  X  Na X   X  ve Bayes algorithm ( Probabilistic method ),  X  Numerical approaches based on regression ( SVM ),  X  Relational learning (rule-based learning) like FOIL. 2.3 Section 3: Web usage mining lastly, modeling for web usage. 2.3.1 Chapter 6: Introduction to web usage mining This chapter first introduces the basics of a standard Web Usage Mining process and the want to quickly implement a Web Usage Mining tool.
 2.3.2 Chapter 7: Preprocessing for web usage mining directly exploited to limit noise and so improve the usage modeling.
This chapter illustrates the main steps:  X  User identification (labeling data with a user ID),  X  Session Identification (splitting the user data into different sessions) Thanks to this preprocessing process, data can be analyzed. 2.3.3 Chapter 8: Exploratory data analysis for the web usage mining It illustrates five different indicators:  X  Number of visit actions ,  X  Session duration ,  X  Relationship between visit actions and session duration ,  X  Average time per page ,  X  Duration for individual pages .
 information like patterns, user behavior... 2.3.4 Chapter 9: Modeling for web usage mining this chapter presents:  X  Clustering method: Birch clustering algorithm ,  X  Affinity analysis: A priori algorithm (association rule),  X  Discretizing the numerical variables: Binning ,  X  Regression trees: Cart and C4.5 algorithm . 3 Discussion Mining for advanced undergraduate and graduate level courses. Moreover since it can be read in a non-linear this book can be used in a variety of ways. all algorithms and statistical computations particularly for undergraduate students.
First of all I think the bibliography is quite limited. It could be completed with more Information Retrieval techniques, does not quote famous references like Baeza-Yates and it). These additional readings concern association rules X  X damo ( 2001 ), Social Network Analysis X  X asserman and Faust ( 1994 ) and Web communities X  X hang et al. ( 2006 ). the related publications.

Furthermore, structured document IR (applied for instance to XML) that can be applied to the  X  X  X lean X  X  web content is not discussed in this book. Chap. 1. Moreover, Chap. 4 is dedicated to the clustering evaluation since Chap. 5 com-bines classification and evaluation.
 power of this book relies on:  X  Numerous and relevant exercises (with solution on the Companion Web site), teachers.

From a researcher point of view I prefer reading the book from Liu ( 1998 ) that have a expectations.
