 In this work we tackle the problem of link prediction in co-authoring network. We apply a topological dyadic su-pervised machine learning approach for that purpose. A co-authoring network is actually obtained by the projection of a two-mode graph (an authoring graph linking authors to publications they have signed) over the authors set. We show that link prediction performances can be substantially enhanced by analyzing not only the co-authoring network, but also the dual graph obtained by projecting the original two-mode network over the set of publications.

In this paper we report on ongoing system development that aims at computing academic collaboration recommen-dation by mining publicly available bibliographical databases. Recently, few systems have been proposed in the literature in order to cope with the problem of recommending new contacts within the space of international conferences and meetings [14, 6]. Recommendation computation in these systems are mainly based on matching profiles of partici-pants to a meeting. Real world experimentations of such systems have showed the utility of the concept [14]. Follow-ing the same goal, we propose a new approach for academic collaboration recommendation based on mining the evolu-tion of co-authorship networks.

A co-authorship network can be modeled by undirected graph G = &lt; V,E &gt; where V , the vertices set, represents au-thor X  X  set, and E is the graph X  X  link set. A link e = ( v E expresses the fact that authors v i and v j has co-signed a paper. In this work, we study the problem of new collabora-tion recommendation by applying a link prediction approach to this type of networks [13]. The link prediction problem is defined as follows. Let &lt; G 1 ,...,G t &gt; be a temporal se-quence of snapshots of a given network (i.e. graph). A link prediction approach attempts to predict what new links in the graph G t +1 will appear between nodes belonging to a graph G i, 1  X  i  X  t but have never linked before.

Co-authorship networks has been extensively studied in the field of social network analysis [16]. Some earlier link prediction approaches has also been applied to this type of data [13, 9, 17]. However, none of these earlier work take into account that a co-authorship network is actually a projected graph: a projection of a bipartite graph link-ing authors to publications. A bipartite graph G is defined as follows: G = &lt; &gt; ,  X  ,E &gt; where &gt; and  X  are two mu-tually exclusive sets of nodes and where endpoints of ties, composing the E set, come from different sets. A unimodal graph can be obtained from a bipartite one by projecting the graph over one of its node sets. For example, the pro-jection over the &gt; set is defined by a unimodal graph where nodes from &gt; set are tied if they are linked to at least n common nodes in the initial bipartite graph G . In a more formal way, let  X  g ( x ) be the set of neighbors of node x in a graph g . Projections of a bipartite graph G are then defined as follows:
Figure 1 illustrates both projection of a sample bipartite graphe.

In this work we show through experimentation on real bib-liographical data that taking into account the original bipar-tite nature of the publication network can enhance substan-tially the performances of obtained link prediction models. Different link prediction approaches are proposed in the sci-entific literature. A quick overview of existing methods is presented in section 2. The applied approach, follows the same general idea of works presented in [9, 17, 15], where the link prediction problem is expressed as two-class dis-crimination problem, allowing hence to apply classical su-pervised machine learning approach for learning prediction models. This approach will be presented in section 3. Our approach has been validated on real bibliographical data ex-tracted from the, now well known, DBLP 1 bibliographical server. Experiments and obtained results are described and commented in section 4. Finally, we conclude in section 5.
We classify current approaches for link prediction in social networks according to the following three criteria:
In this work, we apply a dyadic topological approach. This will be sketched in the next section. http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/  X  ley/db/
Following this approach, also applied in [9, 17, 15], the link prediction problem is reformulated in terms of a two-class discrimination problem: linking and not-linking . In machine learning community we talk usually about positive class (the linking class here), and the negative class (not-linking). Learning a classification model requires having a training data that describes examples of both classes. For sake of clarity we explain hereafter how to generate training data for link prediction in the case of a simple unimodal graph. Then we show how to adapt this approach for two-mode social networks.

The training data set is constructed as follows. Let G A a graph that summarizes in some way the temporal sequence of networks G = &lt; G 1 ,...,G t &gt; . Frequently, G A computed as follows: G A =  X  i  X  [1 ,t ] G i . An example will be generated for each couple of nodes ( x,y ) that are not linked in G A but both belonging to the same connected component. For each such couple of nodes we compute a set of topological attributes that characterize their roles in the network. Three types of topological measures can be computed. These will be described briefly in next subsections. First, we introduce some basic notations that help in describing the different topological metrics. Let  X  G ( x ) be the set of direct neighbors of a node x in graph G . This will be denoted  X ( x ) when there is no ambiguity concerning the considered graph . k E k refers to the cardinality of set E . Since graphs we handle in our study are not oriented, the degree of a node x in graph G is then equal to k  X  G ( x ) k .
One well known effective link score measure is preferential attachment (PA) proposed in [2]. This is simply defined by the product of involved nodes degrees: PA ( x,y ) = k  X ( x ) k  X  k  X ( y ) k . Building on this example, we propose new link score measures using other node-based topological mea-sures such as: the PageRank [4], the hub and the authority indicators computed by the HITS algorithm [11] and the different centrality measures [21]. Notice, that a score can combine different types of measures computed for involved nodes. For instance, following the basic idea of the HITS algorithm defining good authority nodes (resp. hub nodes) as those pointed by (resp. pointing to) good hub (resp. au-thority) nodes, we define a link score, denoted HITS , using these measures as follows: HITS ( x,y ) = max ( Auth ( x )  X  Hub ( y ) ,Auth ( y )  X  Hub ( x )). A kind of generalization of the preferential attachment would be to compute the product of involved node X  X  PageRanks: AP P R ( x,y ) = PR ( x )  X  PR ( y ) where PR ( v ) is the PageRank of node v .
Another type of link scores is based on evaluating the overlap between neighborhoods of involved nodes. The most frequently applied measures in this context are the following: 1. Common Neighbors (denoted CN ( x,y )): k  X ( x )  X   X ( y ) k , 2. Jaccard X  X  coefficient (denoted JC ( x,y )): k  X ( x )  X   X ( y ) k 3. The Adamic-Adar measure proposed in [1] (denoted
A third class of link X  X  score is based on evaluating paths linking involved nodes 2 . The simplest attribute to compute is the shortest path between x and y . We denote this at-tribute by SP ( x,y ). Another measure, frequently applied in affiliation network analysis, is Katz coefficient proposed in [10]. It consists of computing a weighted sum of all paths be-tween x and y . More formally, the score of a link &lt; x,y &gt; is given by: Katz ( x,y ) =  X   X  l =1  X  `  X k path ( ` ) x,y k , where path is the number of paths between x and y of length ` .  X  is a positive parameter which favors shortest paths. In [7], it is shown that the value of attribute Katz for two nodes i and j is given by the element K [ i,j ] where K is a matrix given by K = ( I  X   X   X  A )  X  1  X  I , A is the adjacency matrix of the considered graph and I is the identity matrix. The computation of matrix K converges to the above formula if  X  is smaller than the inverse of the largest proper value of matrix A . Other measures based on random walks through the considered graph [7].
In order to take into account the original two-mode na-ture of the co-authorship network we propose in this work to compute for each example (see section 3.1) two sets of topological attributes:
Next we show the effect of introducing these indirect at-tributes on the performances of the obtained prediction mod-els. Superscript d (resp. i ) is used to denote direct (resp. indirect ) attributes.
In a first validation study of our approach we have ex-tracted several publications networks form the DBLP bib-liographical server. We use publications over a period of 4 consecutive years in order to learn a model. The class label-ing is obtained from a network constructed over the next two
Recall that we compute examples for nodes belonging to a same connected component, hence at least one path exist between each couple of nodes. years following the end of the learning graph. The choice of having 4 years for learning and two years for labeling has been made in an empirical way. Three different sets has been used. Characteristics of these sets, in terms of nodes and links number are summerized in the following table 1.
For each dataset, we generate the set of positive and neg-ative examples as described in 3.1. Applied measures are the following:
Table 2 shows the number of both positive and negative examples computed from each dataset. Obtained examples sets are, naturally, highly skewed rendering the learning task more a difficult one. For each experiment, we computed the performances of the prediction model in two cases: 1) using direct attributes only and 2) using both direct and associated indirect attributes. For indirect attributes com-putations the max aggregate function is applied, except for the shortest path attribute for which min function is used. Different supervised classifiers, provided by the Weka [8] ma-chine learning framework has been tested. Results reported here are those provided by the AdaBoost classifier using sim-ple decision trees (J48 package in Weka ). Performances are computed using a standard 10-cross validation procedure. Retained evaluation metrics are the classical precision, re-call and F1-measure metrics, computed for the positive (i.e. linking) class only.
Obtained results are shown on figure 2. For all three datasets we observe a clear enhancement, especially in terms of precision of obtained prediction when using indirect topo-logical attributes. Actually, because co-authorship graph is a projection of a bipartite graph, it lakes for a lot of informa-tion about the papers. Indirect attributes we introduce allow to compute affinity, or similarity between authors based also on the characteristics of the publication graph.
In this paper we studied the problem of link prediction in a special type of networks obtained by the projection of a bipartite graph over a set of nodes. We have introduced Figure 2: Performances of obtained prediction mod-els. Results are given for the positive class only. new topological metrics that can reflect the likelihood (or the score) of a link between two nodes that are computed in the dual graph: the graph obtained by the projection of the original bipartite graph but over the other set of nodes. These metrics are used in a dyadic topological supervised machine learning approach for link prediction. We showed, through experimentation over real world data that new met-rics do enhance obtained results, especially in terms of pre-diction precision. We have considered here unweighted net-works and we have ignored temporal issues when composing the learning graphs. We are working now on adapting the proposed approach in order to handle weighted temporal networks.
