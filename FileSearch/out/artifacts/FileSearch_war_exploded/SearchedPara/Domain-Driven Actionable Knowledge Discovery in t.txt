 Actionable knowledge discovery can afford important grounds to business decision makers. In the panel discussions of SIGKDD 2002 and 2003 [2, 7], it was highlighted by panelists as one of the Grand Challenges for extant and future data mining. This situation partly results from the scenario that extant data mining is a data-driven trial-and-error process [2] where data mining algorithms extract patterns from converted data via some predefined models based on experts X  hypothesis. Data mining is presumed as an automated process producing automatic algorithms and tools without human involvement and the capability to adapt to external environment constraints. 
However, data mining in the real world, for instance financial data mining, is highly constraint-based [8, 11]. Constrai nts involve technical, economic and social aspects. The real-world business problems and requirements are often tightly embedded in domain-specific business rules and process with expertise ( domain constraint ). Patterns actionable to business are often hidden in large quantities of data with complex structures, dynamics and source distribution ( data constraint ). Often mined patterns are not actionable to business even though they are interesting to research. There exist big interestingness gaps between academia and business ( interestingness constraint ). Furthermore, interesting patterns often cannot be deployed to real life if they are not integrated with business rules, regulations and processes ( deployment constraint ). There could be other types of constraints such as knowledge constraint, dimension/level constraint and rule constraint [8]. is essential to slough off the superficial and captures the essential information from the data mining. However, this is a non-trivial task. Tricks may not only include how suitable process-centric support with a suitable deliverable to business. Even many methodologies are studied, they either view data mining as an automated process, or deal with the constraints in a case-by-case manner. Our experience [3] and lessons learned in data mining in capital markets [6] show that the involvement of domain knowledge and experts, the consideration of constraints, and the development of in-depth patterns are essential for filtering subtle concerns while capturing incisive issues. Combining these aspects together, it ca n advise the process of real-world data motivation to develop a practical framework, called domain-driven in-depth pattern discovery (DDID-PD), for the discovery of actionable knowledge from the real world. depth pattern mining process in domain-specific context. It exploits key components including (i) constraint mining, (ii) incorporating domain knowledge through human-mining-cooperation, (iii) in-depth mining , and (iv) loop-closed mining. Mining constraint-based context requests to deve lop workable mechanisms to deal with comprehensive constraints. The involvement of domain experts and their knowledge can reduce the complexity of the knowledge discovery process in the constrained world. In-depth pattern mining discovers actionable patterns. A system following the DDID-PD framework can embed effective supports for domain knowledge and experts X  feedback, and refines the lifecycle of data mining in an iterative manner. 
Taking financial data mining as an example, this paper introduces some case studies deploying the DDID-PD framework to mine actionable trading strategies for improving trading performance and costs. It shows that the DDID-PD can benefit the actionable knowledge mining in a more realistic and reliable manner than data-driven methodology such as CRISP-DM [13]. The existing data mining methodology, for instance CRISP, generally supports autonomous pattern discovery from data. The DDID-PD, on the other hand, highlights a process that discovers in-depth patterns from constraint-based context with the involvement of domain experts/knowledge. This section outlines key ideas and relevant research issues of the DDID-PD. 2.1 Pattern Actionability model M . In DDID-PD [4], the following concepts measure pattern actionability, i.e., whether or not, or to what extent, P can be used to answer real business needs. D
EFINITION 1. Technical Interestingness  X  The technical interestingness tech_int () measures how interesting the pattern is from technical perspective. It is measured through certain technical metrics specified fo r a data mining method. For instance, the following logic formula indicates that an association rule P is technically interesting if it satisfies a user-defined min_support and min_confidence . D
EFINITION 2. Business Interestingness  X  The business interestingness biz_int () of a pattern is determined by some domain-oriented social and/or economic criteria accepted by real users. In stock data mining, a stock price predictor P is interesting to trading if it satisfies the profit and roi ( return on investment ) requests. D
EFINITION 3. Actionability of a pattern  X  The actionability of a pattern act () indicates to what degree it satisfies both technical and business interestingness. If both technical and business interestingness or a hybrid interestingness measure integrating both aspects are satisfied, it is called an actionable pattern. Such kind of patterns are not only interesting to data miners, but generally interesting to decision-makers. 2.2 Actionable Knowledge Discovery Process The components of the DDID-PD are shown in Figure 1, where we highlight those processes specific to DDID-PD in thicken boxes. The lifecycle of DDID-PD is as follows, but be aware that the sequence is not rigid, some phases may be bypassed or moved back and forth in a real problem. Every step of the DDID-PD process may involve domain knowledge and the interaction with real users or domain experts. 
The DDID-PD process highlights four highly correlated procedures that are critical for the success of data mining in the real world. They are (i) constraint mining , (ii) in-depth mining , (iii) human-cooperated mining , and (iv) loop-closed mining . The following sections discuss them respectively. 2.3 Constraint Mining Specifically, in Section 1, we list several types of constraints, which play significant roles in a process effectively discovering knowledge actionable to business. In practice, many other aspects such as data stream and the scalability and efficiency of algorithms may be enumerated. In DDID-PD, constraints are domain-specific, functional, nonfunctional and environmental. These ubiquitous constraints form a constrained context for actionable knowledge discovery. All the above constraints must, to varying degrees, be considered in relevant phases of DDID-PD. In this case, the analysis is called constraint mining [8, 11]. 
Some major aspects of domain constraints include the domain and characteristics of a problem, domain terminology, specific business process, policies and regulations, user profiling and favorite deliverables. Potential matters to satisfy or react on domain constraints could consist of building domain model, domain metadata, semantics and ontologies [5], supporting human involvement, human-machine interaction, qualitative and quantitative hypotheses and conditions, merging with business processes and enterprise information infrastructure, fitting regulatory measures, conducting user profile analysis and modeling, etc. Relevant hot research areas include interactive mining, guided mining, and knowledge and human involvement. 
Constraints on particular domain data may be embodied in terms of aspects such as very large volume, ill-structure, multimedia, diversity, high dimensions, high frequency and density, distribution and privac y, etc. Data constraints seriously affect the development of and performance requirements on mining algorithms and systems, and constitute some grand challenges to data mining. As a result, some popular researches on data constraints-oriented issues are emerging such as stream data mining, link mining, multi-relational mining, structure-based mining, privacy mining, multimedia mining and temporal mining. 
What makes this rule, pattern and finding more interesting than the other? In the real world, simply emphasizing technical interestingness such as objective statistical measures of validity and surprise is not adequate. In DDID-PD, social and economic interestingness such as user preferences an d domain knowledge are also considered in assessing whether a pattern is actionable or not. 
Furthermore, DDID-PD advocates the delivery of an interesting pattern integrated with the domain environment such as business rules, process, information flow, presentation, etc. In addition, many other realistic issues are considered. For instance, a software infrastructure may be established to support the full lifecycle of data mining; the infrastructure needs to integrate with existing enterprise information systems and workflow; parallel KDD [10] with parallel supports are implemented on multiple sources, parallel I/O, parallel algorithms and memory storage; visualization, privacy and security should receive much-deserved attention. 2.4 In-Depth Mining In general, data mining publications tend to push the use of specific algorithms rather than answer real business needs. As a result, patterns interesting to data miners often can not achieve business benefits when deployed. We call them generic patterns. Such situations have hindered the deployment and adoption of data mining in real applications. Therefore it is essential to evaluate the actionability of a pattern and focus on discovering actionable patterns satisfying both tech_int ( P ) and biz_int ( P ) to support realistic and reliable decision-making. This is in-depth pattern mining . Its business needs in a workable manner. 
In-depth patterns mining targets to improve both technical ( tech_int() ) and business ( biz_int() ) interestingness in the above constraint -based context. Technically, it could be through enhancing or generating more effective interestingness measures [12]. It could also be through developing alternative models for discovering deeper patterns. Some other options include rule reduction, model refinement or parameter tuning by optimizing generic pattern set. Additionally, techniques can be developed to deeply understand, select and refine the target data set. 
In in-depth mining, more attention should be paid to business requirements, objectives, domain knowledge and qualitative intelligence of domain experts for their impact on mining deep patterns. This could be through selecting and adding business features, considering domain and background knowledge in modeling, supporting interaction with domain experts, fine tuning parameters and data set by domain experts, optimizing models and parameters, adding factors into technical interestingness measures or building business measures, improving result evaluation mechanism through embedding domain knowledge and human involvement, etc. 2.5 Human Cooperated Mining The real requirements for discovering actionable knowledge in constraint-based context determine that real data mining is more likely to be human involved rather than automated. Human involvement is embodied thro ugh c ooperation between humans (including users and business analysts, mainly domain experts) and data mining system. This is achieved through the compensation between human qualitative intelligence such as domain knowledge and field supervision, and mining quantitative intelligence like computational capability. Therefore, real-world data mining likely presents as a human-machine-cooperated interactive knowledge discovery process. 
In DDID-PD, the role of human (mainly domain users and experts) could be embodied in the full period of data mining from business and data understanding, business modeling and learning to the evaluation, refinement and interpretation of algorithms and resulting outcomes. For instance, experience, metaknowledge and imaginary thinking of domain experts can guide or assist with the selection of features designing interestingness measures by injecting business concerns, and quickly evaluate mining results. This assistance may largely improve the effectiveness and efficiency of mining actionable knowledge. In general, human often serve on the feature selection and result evaluation. DDID-PD views that human could be an essential constituent of or the centre of data mining system. The complexity of discovering actionable knowledge in constraint-based context determines to what extent human must be involved. As a result, human mining cooperation could be, to varying degrees, human-centred or guided mining [2, 8], or human-supported or assisted mining, etc. 
To support human involvement, human mining interaction, or in a sense presented as interactive mining [1, 2], is absolutely necessary. Interaction often takes explicit form, for instance, setting up direct interaction interfaces to fine tune parameters. Interaction interfaces may take various forms as well, such as visual interfaces, virtual reality technique, multi-modal, mobile agents, etc. On the other hand, it could also go through implicit mechanisms, for example accessing a knowledge base or communicating with a user assistant agent. Interaction quality relies on performance such as user-friendliness, flexibility, run-time capability and understandability. 2.6 Loop-Closed Mining Actionable knowledge discovery in a constraint-based context is likely to be a closed rather than open process. It encloses iterative feedback to varying stages such as sampling, hypothesis, feature selection, modeling, evaluation and interpretation in a human-involved manner. On the other hand, real-world mining process is highly iterative because the evaluation and refinement of features, models and outcomes cannot be completed once, rather is based on iterative feedback and interaction before reaching the final stage of knowledge and decision-support report delivery. 
The above key points of the DDID-PD indicate that real-world data mining cannot mining infrastructure to discover actionable knowledge from constraint-based scenarios in a loop-closed iterative manner. To this end, agent-based data mining infrastructure [14] presents good facilitie s since it provides good supports for both autonomous problem-solving and user modeling and user agent interaction. In stock data mining [6], we deploy the DDID-PD to mine actionable trading patterns. Our objective is to develop actionable trading strategies which can not only trigger profitable trading signals, but also result in the proper measurement and support of market dynamics. For space limit, we only illustrate two case studies here. There is other work under development in terms of domain-driven perspective such as trading strategy-stock correlation analysis, broker-based association analysis, and so forth. 3.1 Designing Actionable Trading Strategy A quality trading strategy can be designed from scratch via analyzing market dynamics and microstructure. For instance, in real trading, traders often trade multiple stocks to manage risk. DDID-PD based technology extracts evidences about what stocks are correlated with others, and disc over trading patterns effective on multiple instruments. A typical example is the pairs trading strategy, which is based on the correlation analysis between stocks. We find th at an effective pairs trading strategy is not only dependent on correlations but also considering constraints and domain knowledge such as relevant market factors. 
The design of an actionable strategy is a human-mining interaction process supporting iterative development, back-testing, refinement and optimization of development and evaluation system called F-Trade 1 . Figure 2 shows signals for a stock pair in ASX market. Figure 3 further shows the impact of business factors  X  distance and weight on return and the number of triggered signals. 
The exercise in testing ASX Top 32 stocks from January 1997 to June 2002 shows that DDID-PD based strategy has led to some interesting emergence beyond the normal mining algorithm design and domain expectation.  X  Pair relationship between stocks and the combination of the above four factors  X  All 13 correlated stocks mined in Top 32 ASX come from different sectors. This 3.2 Mining Actionable Trading Strategy There exist many generic trading strategies in the literature and trading houses. Let X  X  take the very common moving average strategy MA( sr , lr ) as an instance. It actually indicates a generic correlated trading pattern between indicators short-run moving average ( sr ) and long-run moving average ( lr ). A LGORITHM 1: A generic strategy MA ( sr , lr )
Generally speaking, this pattern doesn X  X  work in market trading. The actionability of a MA instance is determined in terms of the performance in real data, traders X  interestingness and market dynamics such as transaction cost. To this end, the involvement of domain knowledge is quite significant for finding actionable rules. Using the DDID-PD ideas, we improve the generic MA and design an in-depth rule MA( t , sr , lr ,  X  x ,  X  y , h , d ) as follows. 
This in-depth rule considers the following constraints and background knowledge, which make it more adaptable to market dynamics compared with MA( sr , lr ). 
Furthermore, we built interaction in terfaces to support the definition and refinement of both technical and business parameters. Figure 4 illustrates some of can trigger the process in terms of either Automated execution or Interactive mode with the involvement of users. In Interactive mode, technical analysts can advise the above process as well as refining technical factors for setting data mining process and tuning algorithm parameters. Business analysts can supervise the construction of features, fine tune the parameters, and set evaluation criteria for the business concerns. For instance, the measure sharpe_ratio is used for evaluating the business actionability of an identified rule. where r P is expected portfolio return, r R is risk free rate, and  X  P is portfolio standard deviation. Higher sharpe_ratio means more return with lower risk. Additionally, the system supports ad-hoc execution. Users can tune the parameters and interestingness measure at run time to evaluate the strategy. DDID-PD assists us in finding a collection of actionable rules. For instance, in ASX interday data, MA(4, 19, 0.033) could be an actionable rule using training data from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000 and testing set between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2001. The number of trading signals generated by this rule is much sharpe_ratio has a greatly improved positive scope compared with (a) the results of a generic MA rule. This demonstrates that DDID-PD driven strategy mining can improve strategy actionability. Actionable knowledge discovery is significant and also very challenging. It is nominated as one of Grand Challenges of KDD in the next 10 years. The research on this issue may change the existing situatio n where a great number of rules are mined while few of them are interesting to business, and promote the widely deployment of data mining into business. This paper has developed a new data mining framework, referred to as Domain-Driven In-Depth Pattern Discovery (DDID-PD). It provides a systematic overview of the issues in discovering actionable knowledge, and advocates the methodology of mining actionable knowledge in constraint-based context through human-mining system cooperation in a loop-closed iterative refinement manner. The main phases and components of the DDID-PD include almost all phases of the CRISP-DM. It has enclosed some big differences from the CRISP-DM. For instance, (i) some new essential components, such as constraint mining, in-depth mining, the involvement of domain experts and knowledge, are taken into the lifecycle of KDD for consideration, (ii) in the DDID-PD, the normal steps of CRISP-DM are enhanced by dynamic cooperation with domain experts and the consideration of constraints and domain knowledge. These differences actually play key roles in improving the existing knowledge discovery in a more realistic and reliable way.
