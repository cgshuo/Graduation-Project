 Current Information Retrieval systems for digital cultural heritage support only the actual search aspect of the in-formation seeking process. This demonstration presents the second PATHS system which provides the exploration, anal-ysis, and sense-making features to support the full informa-tion seeking process.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval; H.5.3 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interfaces exploration; information seeking; interactive information re-trieval; demonstration Current Information Retrieval (IR) systems in the domain of digital cultural heritage provide good access for experts through the standard search-box paradigm [8], as these users are familiar with the collections, have specific information needs, and know which keywords to use to satisfy these in-formation needs. However, for users who are new to the collections or do not have a specific information need the search box presents an almost insurmountable obstacle [9]. Additionally these IR systems only support a small fraction of the information seeking process [3, 5], forcing users to augment the IR systems with other tools.

To support the whole information seeking process for both experts and novices, IR systems are required that provide an initial overview over the collection [2], functions for explor-ing collections [4] such as thesauri [7] and faceted browsing [1], somewhere to collect potentially relevant items [5], and finally the ability to organise the items into a sense-making structure.
 The PATHS (Personalised Access To cultural Heritage Spaces) project aims to address this issue through a combi-nation of content pre-processing and front-end application functionality. The demo presented in this paper showcases the second PATHS prototype that has been developed based on the experience of building, using, and evaluating the first prototype. While the prototype uses cultural heritage data, it can be applied to data-sets from other domains as well.
When a new user comes to the PATHS system, they are offered two main avenues for overviewing and exploring the collection. One is a set of guided tours, called paths , that have been curated both by experts and other users, and represent a more focused version of the paths concept intro-duced by [6]. These paths take the user on a trip through an aspect of the collection, providing a first introduction to the kind of information available. The second avenue is through the use of an automatically generated thesaurus that pro-vides topic-based exploration support. Figure 1 shows the textual visualisation that enables the user to explore and drill down into the thesaurus. Tag-cloud and map-based vi-sualisations are also provided to support users with different cognitive styles. The inset in figure 1 shows the map-based visualisation, which creates a novel, two-dimensional seman-tic map of the thesaurus that supports a visual exploration of the collection.

As the user explores the collection they can collect indi-vidual items into their workspace. This allows them to keep track of what they have explored and of items that might help them to fulfil their information needs. The items in the workspace can be annotated and arranged to support the analysis of what the user has found.

When the user has found a sufficient number of items to fulfil their information need they can arrange the items into a path structure to support the final sense-making step in the information seeking journey (fig. 2). The path is an ordered structure of items that supports branching and Figure 2: Overview over an example path on the topic of  X  X ailways X , showing the ability to structure the information by creating multiple branches. user-annotation of each step in the path, creating the user X  X  narrative through parts of the collection. Potential uses for the path s are as a personal overview over a topic that can evolve as the user further explores the collection, as a virtual exhibition or story created by a collection curator, or as a learning object to support teaching activities.
The PATHS demo will provide a guided tour to the PATHS system and demonstrate how a user can explore the col-lection, collect items and then form these into the sense-making path structure. Participants can then explore the prototype system on their own, which will be provided at http://www.paths-project.eu . The demo will provide ac-cess to a sub-set of the data available in Europeana 1 , cov-ering approximately 1.8 million items from the English and Spanish collections. http://www.europeana.eu
