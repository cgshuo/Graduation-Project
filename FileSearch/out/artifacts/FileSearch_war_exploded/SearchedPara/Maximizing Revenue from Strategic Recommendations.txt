 Suppose your sole interest in recommending a product to me is to maximize the amount paid to you by the seller for a sequence of recommendations. How should you recommend optimally if I become more inclined to ignore you with each irrelevant recommendation you make? Finding an answer to this question is a key challenge in all forms of marketing that rely on and explore social ties; ranging from personal recommendations to viral marketing.

We prove that even if the recommendee regains her ini-tial trust on each successful recommendation, the expected revenue the recommender can make over an infinite period due to payments by the seller is bounded. This can only be overcome when the recommendee also incrementally regains trust during periods without any recommendation. Here, we see a connection to  X  X anner blindness X , suggesting that showing fewer ads can lead to a higher long-term revenue.

If you recommend a book at Amazon solely due to the monetary incentive given by Amazon X  X  referral scheme 1 and your friends realize this, then they are likely to lose trust in your recommendations. If they regain trust whenever you make a relevant recommendation, how can you maximize your long-term revenue, and is this revenue bounded or not? The importance of  X  X ord-of-mouth X  (WOM) for marketing
This research was supported by a Google Research Award and the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) grant ICT 10-002. https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/ has long been known [4, 10, 9]. According to [4],  X  X OM was seven times as effective as newspapers and magazines, four times as effective as personal selling, and twice as effective as radio advertising in influencing consumers to switch brands X . WOM is the causal effect behind  X  X rand congruence X  where friends tend to use the same products [13, 15].

In our scenario the recommender is selfish and only makes paid recommendations to maximize her own revenue. Here, in a sense, the friend making the recommendation is no more trustworthy or altruistic than a web search engine showing sponsored search results. In these settings we believe the trust between the recommender and the recommendee to be dissipating. We see this as closely related to  X  X anner blindness X  [3, 5], where people have become so overloaded and fed up with advertisement that they stop to notice it completely. Seen from this angle, our findings show that advertisers might have to stop showing advertisements on a regular basis if they want to retain customers X  trust without seeing click-through-rates converge to zero.
In a recent paper truthful constant-factor approximation mechanisms for the so-called influence maximization prob-lem were given [14]. In this problem a subset of early adopters has to be selected and incentivized to influence their peers in a given social network. Our problem is different as we con-sider personal recommendations and explicitly model the re-lationship between the recommender and the recommendee.
In our model the recommendee loses trust for each un-successful recommendation. This is more likely when she has the feeling that the recommendations are  X  X ishonest X . How honest recommendations can be ensured when there are several recommenders is studied in [8]. The approach suggested by the authors involves evaluating/ranking rec-ommenders based on the rating given to their recommended items by other people. This, however, requires a public mar-ket where potential buyers can look for recommendations, which is not the case for personal recommendations.
The problem of trust decay is related to  X  X anner blind-ness X  [3, 6, 5] where web users become  X  X lind X  to ads due to overexposure. Cast to this setting our mathematical model suggests that, even if web users X  interest is  X  X efreshed X  by a single relevant, clicked advertisement, the long term rev-enue of advertisers will stagnate as click-through-rates fall to zero. The only solution is to stop showing banner ads for a while so that users can  X  X nlearn X  to ignore all advertising. This approach is also suggested in a recent patent [12].
In typical literature on sponsored search auctions [11] it is assumed that the web search engine X  X  expected revenue for showing a particular ad is the ad X  X  click-through-rate (CTR) multiplied by the price the advertiser will be charged when her ad gets clicked. Usually, only a single round is considered or, when there are budget constraints [1, 7], the CTRs are assumed to be constant during the duration of the game. If, however, it is assumed that CTRs drop for all ads for each unsuccessful advertisement shown then, in the long run, this puts more emphasis on showing ads with high CTR, regardless of how much their advertisers can be charged for a single click. Although different objective functions for the search engine have been considered [1], the setting of revenue maximization with trust decay has not been studied.
One could argue that a recommendation is, ultimately, just an advertisement and that an advertisement is just a recommendation. To highlight the differences between dif-ferent kinds of advertisement in general, we present a clas-sification scheme using the following three dimensions.
To demonstrate the generality of this schema, we use it to classify a number of different advertising scenarios. 1. Billboards. A chain of pizza restaurants puts up bill-2. Sponsored search. A web search engine shows targeted 3. Testimonial. You liked a book and you write a testi-4. Direct recommendation. A friend asks you for advice
There are other important differences, e.g. concerning the conversion rates, but these differences are consequences of the X  X xiomatic X  X ifferences above and a personalized, altruis-tic  X  X dvertisement X  from a highly trusted source will always have a higher conversion rate than a general, commercial  X  X ecommendation X  from a disreputable source.

To the best of our knowledge there has been no work fo-cusing on the strategic behavior of recommenders in a set-ting with decaying trust. We view the introduction of this problem as one of our contributions.

We first show that, not surprisingly, the total expected revenue of the recommender is bounded when the recom-mendee can only lose and does not regain trust (Section 2.2). Then we prove that the total expected revenue is still bounded over an infinite (!) sequence of recommendations, even when trust is reset to an initial level on each successful recommen-dation (Section: 2.3). Finally, we show that when trust is regained incrementally when no recommendations are made, the recommender X  X  optimal total expected revenue is un-bounded in the long run and that she can recommend both too aggressively and too passively (Section 2.4). We study the following problem: There are n products. For each product the recommender has two options:  X  X ecom-mend X  X r X  not recommend X . A recommendation is successful if the buyer buys the product. For a successful recommen-dation the recommender gets a constant reward of r and this reward is the same for all products. Initially, the probability p of success is p 0 &lt; 1. With each unsuccessful recommenda-tion this probability drops from its current value to p = l where l&lt; 1isthe loss rate . The probability p can be seen as an estimate of the recommendee X  X  trust in the recommender and a high value of l corresponds to a slow loss in trust. This basic model is analyzed in Section 2.2. We also consider ex-tensions of this model where trust (= p ) can increase again in two ways. First, we assume that p is reset to p = p 0 on each successful recommendation. This setting we refer to as  X  X ith reset X  and it is analyzed in Section 2.3. Second, we introduce a factor g  X  1 and each time the recommender does not recommend anything trust is regained and p is up-dated to p =min( g  X  p, p 0 ). This setting we refer to as  X  X ith recovery X  when g&gt; 1 and it is analyzed in Section 2.4.
In all settings the recommender X  X  sole goal is to maximize the overall expected reward M n ( p 0 ,l,g ) for the given param-eters p 0 , l and g. We are interested in the asymptotic behav-ior of M n ( p 0 ,l,g ), i.e. in R ( p 0 ,l,g ) = lim n  X  X  X  Before looking at the theoretical analysis, the following sec-tion experimentally demonstrates the different behavior of the optimal total expected reward in these settings.
Figure 2 gives experimental results for n = 200, r =1, p =0 . 5, l =0 . 66, g = 1 (in the setting  X  X ithout recovery X ) and g =1 . 33 (in the setting  X  X ith recovery X ). It shows that the expected reward of the optimal strategy converges in the setting  X  X ithout recovery X  and diverges in the setting  X  X ith recovery X . In the setting  X  X ithout recovery X  the expected reward converges to 2 . 25 if the probability of success is not reset and to 5 if it is reset to p 0 on a single successful recom-mendation. The figure also shows that the expected reward of the heuristic  X  X ecommend product 1, k +1,2 k +1,etc. X  converges for k =2where l  X  g k &lt; 1 and diverges for k =3 and 4 where l  X  g k &gt; 1. Finally, it shows that the expected reward grows faster for k =3thanfor k =4 . Figure 2: Without any recovery (red and green lines) the total expected reward converges. This also holds, even with recovery, for the  X  X ggressive X  heuristic (purple line) which recommends every sec-ond item. The other three settings, described in detail in Section 2.1, lead to an asymptotically un-bounded reward.
Here we consider the case where g = 1 (= no recov-ery) and assume that the probability of success is not reset to p 0 on a successful recommendation. As the probabil-ity of success remains unchanged if no recommendation is given, the optimal strategy is to recommend all products. Therefore we can rewrite R ( p 0 ,l ):= R ( p 0 ,l, 1) as follows: R ( p 0 ,l )= p 0 ( r + R ( p 0 ,l )) + (1  X  p 0 ) R ( lp solve analytically.

So, not surprisingly, if trust can only be lost and if both p &lt; 1and l&lt; 1, then the total expected reward the recom-mender can achieve is finite, even when there is an infinite sequence of items to recommend.
Now let us analyze the case where still g = 1 (= no re-covery) but each successful recommendation leads to reset of p to p 0 . Again, the optimal strategy is to recommend all products as there is no gain from not recommending. In this setting, we can rewrite R ( p 0 ,l ) as follows: R ( p (1  X  q )  X  ( r + R ( p 0 ,l )), where q denotes the probability that there will be not a single successful recommendation over the infinite sequence. This recurrence can be solved (i.e. lim n  X  X  X  M n ( p 0 ,l ) is finite) if and only if q&gt; 0 . lemma 1. Let dilog(x) = 1 Then, for all 1 &gt;p 0  X  0 , q  X  (1  X  c ) exp dilog (1  X  c )
Proof. The probability that there will be not a single successful recommendation is: Hence it suffices to show that  X  k =0 (1  X  c k +1 ) &gt; 0. Taking the ln( ) of both sides we get where we need to prove this inequality. Note that the ex-pression ln(1  X  c k +1 ) is strictly increasing in k and hence ln(1  X  c k +1 )  X  k k  X  1 ln(1  X  c x +1 ) dx . This gives the bound ln(1  X  x )is  X  dilog(1  X  x ) / ln( x ) . We get Since dilog( x ) is continuous and dilog(1) = 0 (see Lemma 2), we get For 0 &lt;x&lt; 1wehave0  X  dilog(1  X  x ) &lt; 2 e  X  1 + 1 (see Lemma 2). For 0 &lt;x&lt; 1wehaveln( x ) &lt; 0 . It follows that lemma 2. Let dilog ( x )= x tonously decreasing and 0  X  dilog ( x ) &lt; 2 e  X  1 +1 . In fact, the tight upper bound of dilog( x )  X   X  2 / 6 &lt; 2 e is known [2], but we choose to give the following elementary proof of Lemma 2 to have a self-contained argument.
Proof. Let f ( t )=  X  ln( t ) / (1  X  t ). Then f ( t )=  X  t )+ln( t )) / (1  X  t ) 2 &lt; 0for0 &lt;t&lt; 1. So 1 t = x t = x f ( t ) dt +(1 f ( t )  X  X  X  ln( t ) / (1  X  e  X  1 ). So, e  X  1 t = x f ( t ) dt This is largest when x  X  0 where the whole expression be-comes 2 e  X  1 and so 1 t = x f ( t ) dt &lt; 2 e  X  1 +1for0 Note that f ( t ) is continuous at t = 1 with lim x  X  1 f ( t )=1 (using e.g. the l X  X opital Rule). So trivially dilog(1) = 0. As f ( t ) &gt; 0 this gives the desired lower bound. Using Lemma 1 we can prove the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Let dilog(x) = 1 and  X  ( c )=(1  X  c ) exp ( dilog (1  X  c ) / ln( c )) .Then,forall 1 &gt;p 0  X  0 , This proves that even if the probability of success is reset to p on a single successful recommendation, the total expected reward over an infinite period is bounded.
Finally, we consider the setting where g&gt; 1(=withre-covery). Here the probability of success is set to min( p if no recommendation was given. Hence it might be better not to recommend all products to avoid that that proba-bility p converges to zero. Let M n ( p 0 ,l,g ) denote the ex-pected reward of the optimal strategy. To obtain bounds for M n ( p 0 ,l,g ), let us consider, as a heuristic, the algorithm A ( k ) that recommends product 1, k +1, 2 k +1, etc. We write A n ( p 0 ,l,g ) to denote this algorithm X  X  expected revenue.
Theorem 2. Let  X  be the smallest integer such that l  X  g  X   X  1 . If k&gt; X  ,then,forall 1 &gt;p 0 ,l&gt; 0 and  X  &gt;g
Proof. The expected reward for the first recommenda-tion is p 0  X  r. Since k&gt; X  , the expected reward for every other recommendation is also min( p 0 ,p 0  X  l  X  g k  X  1 )= p Since there are exactly n/k recommendations, this shows This is instructive as it shows that (a) for k&gt; X  the ex-pected reward A ( k ) n ( p 0 ,l,g )of A ( k ) does not converge as n tends to infinity and (b) for k &gt;k&gt; X  the expected re-ward A ( k ) n ( p 0 ,l,g )of A ( k ) grows slower (and is ultimately lower) than the expected reward A ( k ) n ( p 0 ,l,g )of A the reward M n ( p 0 ,l,g ) of the optimal strategy is at least as high, this also shows non-convergence of R ( p 0 ,l,g )=
Theorem 3. Let  X  be the smallest integer such that l  X  g  X   X  1 . If k  X   X  ,then,forall 1 &gt;p 0 ,l&gt; 0 and  X  &gt;g there exist p 0 and l such that
Proof. If k&lt; X  , then the revenue maximization prob-lem with parameters p 0 , l ,and g on the products 1, 2, 3, etc. is equivalent to the revenue maximization problem with pa-rameters p 0 = p 0 , l = l  X  g k  X  1 &lt; 1, and g =1onthe products 1, k +1,2 k + 1, etc. The claim follows from The-orem 1.
 Whereas Theorem 2 shows that recommending too seldomly is sub-optimal, Theorem 3 shows that recommending too often is even worse.
We believe that our work motivates a number of research questions. How exactly do web users respond to being shown irrelevant advertisements? Is it possible to revive their inter-est in banner ads?
