With the continuous rise of multimedia, the question of how to access large-scale multimedia databases efficiently has become of crucial importance. The extensive spread of mobile devices and the rapid expansion of the internet al-low users to generate, process, store, and share multimedia data in everyday situations. As an example, the major-ity of social networking sites such as Facebook 1 , Twitter Tumblr 3 , and Instagram 4 comprise millions of users that create multimedia data at billion-scale every single day.
The multitude of data and the versatility of information access challenge todays X  multimedia databases. In many application areas including information retrieval, data min-ing, and computer vision, users are no longer satisfied with keyword-based access but want to search, browse, explore, and analyze multimedia databases by content-based charac-teristics of the multimedia objects. One fundamental op-eration underlying this content-based information access is similarity search which aims at retrieving the most similar multimedia objects with respect to a query.

In order to carry out similarity search for query-like mul-timedia objects, the way of modeling similarity is of major significance due to its impact on efficiency and effectiveness. In fact, similarity search requires a formal definition of a similarity model that provides methods for modeling and comparing content-based properties of multimedia objects. The need for effective and efficient similarity models is inher-ently given in the fields of content-based image retrieval [16, 56], video retrieval [26], and audio retrieval [41] and in many other research fields, such as data mining [13, 22, 46, 66], information retrieval [39], pattern recognition [18], and com-puter vision [57].

A generic approach to model similarity between multi-media objects consists in representing their content-based properties by individual-binning feature signatures [4, 52], which can be compared by means of distance-based similar-ity measures [4, 8] such as the Earth Mover X  X  Distance [52], the Signature Quadratic Form Distance [10], and the Sig-nature Matching Distance [6]. One advantage of these sim-ilarity models is the user-customizable applicability in var-ious domains. By comparing object-specific feature quan-tizations with distance-based similarity measures, these ap-proaches can be tailored to individual multimedia objects and adapted to the users X  notions of perceptual similarity.
Similarity search in multimedia databases by feature sig-natures and distance-based similarity measures requires ef-ficient query processing and indexing approaches since the computation time complexity of a single distance computa-tion is at least quadratic in the number of individual bins of the corresponding feature signatures [4]. Processing queries http://facebook.com http://twitter.com http://tumblr.com http://instagram.com in million-scale multimedia databases still remains one of the major challenges.

In this paper, we address the problem of efficient and ac-curate k-nearest-neighbor query processing in multimedia databases comprising millions of feature signatures. To this end, we propose and investigate the concept of gradient-based signatures which approximate the information con-tained in a feature signature with respect to a common generative model. Moreover, by binarizing gradient-based signatures, we show that our proposal is able to process k-nearest-neighbor queries in a multimedia database compris-ing 5 million images with high accuracy in approximately 0.5 seconds. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sec-tion 2 presents preliminary information and outlines related work. Section 3 introduces gradient-based signatures while Section 4 provides further theoretical insights. The binariza-tion methods for gradient-based signatures are investigated in Section 5. The results of the performance analysis are given in Section 6 before we conclude the paper with an outlook on future work in Section 7.
The content-based properties of multimedia objects are frequently described by means of features f 1 ,...,f in a feature space ( F , X  ) that is additionally endowed with a function  X  : F  X  F  X  R for comparing two individual features. By indicating the relevance of each feature, a multimedia object is mathematically modeled by a feature representation X : F  X  R . Thus, a feature representation X is a function which relates each feature f  X  F with a weight X ( f )  X  R where the weight of zero is designated for features which are not relevant for the representation of the corresponding multimedia object. Those features which are assigned non-zero weights are named as representatives and are defined for a feature representation X by the set R X = { f  X  F | X ( f ) 6 = 0 } X  F . Restricting a feature representation X to a finite set of representatives R X  X  F yields a feature signature , whose formal definition is given below.
 Definition 1. (Feature signature) Let ( F , X  ) be a feature space. A feature signature X  X  defined as:
A feature signature X allows us to define a finite set of contributing features, i.e. features with a weight unequal to zero, individually for each multimedia object. In the remain-der of this paper, we assume that the weights of the feature signatures are non-negative, i.e.  X  X  X  R F ,f  X  F : X ( f )  X  0.
In order to elucidate the idea of a feature signature, we depict two example images and their corresponding feature Figure 1: Two example images and visualizations of the corresponding feature signatures. signatures in Figure 1. The representatives of the feature signatures are visualized by colored circles with diameters indicating their weights and are based on position, color, and texture information. As can be seen in this example, feature signatures are able to visually approximate image content by utilizing individual representatives of contribut-ing features. More theoretical details regarding this feature representation model can be found in [4].
One well-known approach for the comparison of feature signatures is the Earth Mover X  X  Distance [52], which is a transformation-based approach that measures the cost of transforming one feature signature into another one. The Earth Mover X  X  Distance between two feature signatures sible flows F = { f | f : F  X  F  X  R } as EMD  X  ( X,Y ) = of non-negativity, i.e.  X  x,y  X  F : f ( x,y )  X  0, source, i.e.  X  x  X  F : P y  X  F f ( x,y )  X  X ( x ), target, i.e.  X  y  X  F : P min { P
The Perceptually Modified Hausdorff Distance [45] and the Signature Matching Distance [6] are matching-based ap-proaches. They define a distance value between two fea-ture signatures X,Y  X  R F by making use of a matching the Signature Matching Distance is defined for any match-ing and any cost function as SMD  X  ( X,Y ) = c(m X  X  Y c(m Y  X  X )  X  2  X   X  c(m X  X  Y ) for 0  X   X   X  1, the Percep-tually Hausdorff Distance is defined as PMHD  X  ( X,Y ) =
The Signature Quadratic Form Distance [10] is a correla-tion-based approach which adapts the generic concept of correlation to feature signatures. The Signature Quadratic Form Distance is defined based on the similarity correlation  X  X,Y  X  s = P x,y  X  F X ( x )  X  Y ( y )  X  s ( x,y ) between two feature signatures with respect to a similarity function s : F  X  F as SQFD s ( X,Y ) =  X  X,X  X  s  X  2  X  X  X,Y  X  s +  X  Y,Y  X  s 1
Depending on the type of multimedia data and the in-tended notion of similarity, different types of distance-based similarity measures can thus be used.
Similarity search in large-scale multimedia databases by feature signatures and distance-based similarity measures re-mains a challenging issue. If the distance-based similarity measure satisfies the metric postulates, metric access meth-ods [15, 24, 65] are able to avoid a time-consuming sequential scan and to process k-nearest-neighbor queries efficiently.
A fundamental approach underlying many access methods is the multi-step approach which has been investigated and extended in [1, 20, 25, 32, 33, 55].

In addition to metric access methods, many efficient query processing and indexing approaches have been proposed for the Earth Mover X  X  Distance [2, 3, 51, 53, 58, 59, 60, 62, 64] and the Signature Quadratic Form Distance [7, 9, 11, 12, 36, 37] including the utilization of multi-core CPU and many-core GPU architectures [34, 35].

Except for the latter, none of the aforementioned ap-proaches is able to process k-nearest-neighbor queries in mul-timedia databases comprising millions of feature signatures with a query response time of less than one second.
The idea of our proposal is akin to that of Fisher scores derived from generative probability models. Given a genera-tive probability model p ( x |  X  ) with parameters  X  over a multi-dimensional Euclidean space R d , the Fisher score with re-spect to a set { x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x n } X  R d of pairwise disjoint Eu-clidean vectors is defined as U x =  X   X  log p ( { x 1 ,x 2 Intuitively, the Fisher score U x describes how the parame-ters of the generative probability model have to be adapted in order to better fit the set { x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x n } . The similarity between two Fisher scores U x and U y is defined in [28] via a Gaussian Kernel as k ( U x ,U y ) = e  X  1 2 ( U x  X  U y and further simplified to the Fisher kernel [29] as k ( U U x  X  F  X  1  X  U y , where F  X  1 denotes the inverted Fisher informa-tion matrix that is frequently approximated by the identity matrix.

The Fisher framework described above provides a model which handles variable length data that is represented by sets of pairwise disjoint Euclidean vectors and concerns the global dependencies within the data. It thus combines the advantages of both discriminative and generative models and has been applied to various domains such as speech recognition [42], text mining [19], DNA analysis [29], hand-written word-spotting [50], image classification [54], image categorization [48], image retrieval [49], web audio classifica-tion [43], and relevance feedback-based video retrieval [40].
The application of the Fisher framework is restricted to sets of pairwise disjoint Euclidean vectors. In this work, we advance the concept of the Fisher framework and propose its application to feature signatures of multimedia objects.
Given a large-scale multimedia database comprising mil-lions of multimedia objects, how to approximate the content-based properties of the corresponding feature signatures in order to carry out similarity search efficiently and with high accuracy? We propose to address this issue by means of gradient-based signatures .

Gradient-based signatures aggregate feature signatures with respect to a generative model. Instead of explicitly mod-eling the content-based properties of a multimedia object via the representatives and weights of the corresponding feature signature, we propose to implicitly model these properties via the gradients of the log-likelihood function of the model parameters with respect to the given feature signature. To this end, we suppose that any generative model p  X  R F over a feature space F is completely characterized by its param-eters  X  . For instance, a Gaussian mixture model, which is defined for all x  X  R d as g ( x |  X  ) = P n k =1  X  k  X N ( x |  X  is characterized by the parameters  X  = {  X  k , X  k [ i ] , X  k  X  n  X  1  X  i,j  X  d } . For the sake of convenience, we denote the parameter space of all possible parameters by  X .
Given a generative model p  X  R F , we introduce the like-lihood of the parameters  X  with respect to a given feature responding features from the feature space F . The formal definition is shown below.

Definition 2. (Likelihood of parameters with respect to a given feature signature) Let ( F , X  ) be a multi-dimensional Euclidean feature space, i.e. F = R d , and  X  be the parameters characterizing a gen-erative model p  X  R F . The likelihood of parameters  X  with respect to a given feature signature X  X  R F is defined as: As can be seen in the definition above, the likelihood L (  X  | X ) of the parameters  X  for a given feature signature X is determined by multiplying the density values p ( f |  X  ) of all features f  X  F . More precisely, the likelihood can be restricted to the representatives R X  X  F of the correspond-ing feature signature X and can thus be computed in linear time complexity O ( | R X | ) as L (  X  | X ) = Q f  X  R provided a constant time complexity for evaluating the gen-erative model and the exponentiation.

Intuitively, the likelihood L (  X  | X ) describes how likely a feature signature X is generated by a generative model p with respect to a certain parameterization  X  . The value of the likelihood function, however, is not a suitable means of aggregation in order to express and compare the content-based properties of multimedia objects. Instead of using this single figure, we propose to take into account the gradients of the logarithm of the likelihood function for a given feature signature of a multimedia object. By assigning each model parameter  X   X   X  to its gradient, i.e. its partial derivative, we define a gradient-based signature as a function from the parameter space  X  to the real numbers R . In this way, we facilitate the definition of gradient-based signatures with respect to any generative model as shown below.
 Definition 3. (Gradient-based signature) Let ( F , X  ) be a multi-dimensional Euclidean feature space, parameters  X   X   X  characterizing a generative model p  X  R F , the gradient-based signature X  X  :  X   X  R is defined for all  X   X   X  as:
A gradient-based signature X  X   X  R  X  aggregates the rep-resentatives of a feature signature X  X  R F according to the parameters  X  of the underlying generative model p and de-scribes how to adapt the model parameters  X  in order to bet-ter fit the feature signature X . In this way, the complexity in terms of storage space of a gradient-based signature X is bounded by the model parameters and it holds for the representatives R X  X  of a gradient-based signature X  X  that R
X  X   X   X  . If two gradient-based signatures are defined based on the same parameters  X  , i.e. if they are defined with re-spect to a common generative model, their comparison can be carried out in linear time complexity O ( |  X  | ), as shown in the following section.
Given two gradient-based signatures that are defined with different parameterizations  X , X  0  X   X , their comparison can be carried out via any signature-based similarity measure, cf. Section 2.2, in an at least quadratic computation time complexity O ( |  X  | X |  X  0 | ). To this end, the parameter space  X  has to be endowed with an appropriate ground distance  X  :  X   X   X   X  R that models the dissimilarity between any two parameters.

In order to avoid a quadratic computation time complex-ity for a single comparison, we assume a common generative model with parameters  X  underlying the gradient-based sig-natures. In this case, all gradient-based signatures share the same parameters  X   X   X  which can be aligned prior to query processing and compared in a bin-by-bin manner. In fact, two gradient-based signatures X  X  and Y  X  can be thought of as vectors x  X  = [  X   X  1 log L (  X  | X ) ,...,  X   X  |  X  | R in a multi-dimensional Euclidean space R |  X  | which can be compared by means of classic vector space approaches such as the cosine similarity and the Minkowski distance. Definition 4. (Cosine similarity) Let ( F , X  ) be a feature space and X  X  ,Y  X   X  R  X  be two gradient-based signatures. The cosine similarity cos : R R
 X   X  R between X  X  and Y  X  is defined as: Definition 5. (Minkowski distance) Let ( F , X  ) be a feature space and X  X  ,Y  X   X  R  X  be two gradient-based signatures. The Minkowski distance L p R  X   X  R  X   X  R between X  X  and Y  X  is defined for p  X  R  X  0 as:
As can be seen from the definitions above, both cosine similarity cos ( X  X  ,Y  X  ) and Minkowski distance L p ( X between two gradient-based signatures X  X  and Y  X  show dif-ferent properties. While the similarity value defined by the cosine similarity is attributed to the angle between the corre-sponding vectors x  X  and y  X  , the dissimilarity value defined by the Minkowski distance depends on the parameter-wise differences X  X  (  X  )  X  Y  X  (  X  ) =  X   X  log L (  X  | X )  X  X  X  The computation time complexity of both approaches is lin-ear in the number of parameters and thus lies in O ( |  X  | ).
The combination of gradient-based signatures and Min-kowski distances epitomizes an efficient and indexable sim-ilarity model for similarity search in large-scale multimedia databases. Before we study the performance of the proposal, we give some theoretical insights in the following section.
Modeling the content-based characteristics of multime-dia objects by means of gradient-based signatures inevitably leads to the question of which generative model to be chosen. In the remainder of this section, we thus provide closed-form expressions for mixture models with a particular fo-cus on Gaussian mixture models. In addition, we deepen our knowledge by investigating the Euclidean distance on gradient-based signatures.
A frequently encountered generative model in the con-text of multimedia data and in particular for modeling the content-based features of images is the Gaussian mixture model [5, 21, 23, 31, 38, 47, 61, 63]. A Gaussian mix-ture model comprises a finite linear combination of normal distributions and thus provides an expressive yet compact way of generatively describing a distribution in a feature space F . There are many reasons for utilizing normal dis-tributions [14]: First, they are very tractable analytically. Second, they have familiar symmetrical bell shapes. Third, they approximate a large variety of probability distributions according to the central limit theorem. The formal definition of a Gaussian mixture model is given below.
 Definition 6. (Gaussian mixture model) Let ( F , X  ) be a multi-dimensional Euclidean feature space, i.e. F = R d . A Gaussian mixture model g  X  R F with pa-defined for all f  X  F as: where the normal distribution N ( f |  X  k ,  X  k )  X  R F is defined as N ( f |  X  k ,  X  k ) = 1  X  Any Gaussian mixture model over a multi-dimensional Euclidean feature space F = R d is completely described by the parameters  X  = {  X  k , X  k [ i ] , X  k [ i,j ] | 1  X  k  X  n  X  1  X  i,j  X  d } reflecting the prior probabilities  X  k  X  R + such that P k =1  X  k = 1, the means  X  k  X  R  X  k  X  R d  X  d for 1  X  k  X  n .

Before we propose closed-form expressions for computing the gradients with respect to the means and variances of a Gaussian mixture model for a given feature signature, we first show that the computation of the gradients for any mixture model is in general attributed to its components. Theorem 1. (Gradients for mixture models) Let ( F , X  ) be a multi-dimensional Euclidean feature space, i.e. F = R d , X  X  R F be a feature signature, and  X  = S n be the parameters of a mixture model p  X  R F with n  X  N components. For all parameters  X   X   X  it holds that:
Proof.
The theorem above provides a formal means of deriving the gradient  X   X  log L (  X  | X ) of each parameter  X   X   X  by adding the gradients  X   X   X  k  X  p ( f |  X  k ) of all mixture compo-nents 1  X  k  X  n for each feature f  X  F . As an exam-ple, for a Gaussian mixture model g with parameterization attributed to the gradients  X   X   X  k  X N ( f |  X  k ,  X  k ) of the nor-mal distributions of the mixture components. The following lemma is finally devoted to the closed-form expressions of gradients with respect to the means and variances of Gaus-sian mixture models with diagonal covariance matrices. Lemma 1. (Gradients for Gaussian mixture models) Let ( F , X  ) be a multi-dimensional Euclidean feature space, i.e. F = R d , X  X  R F be a feature signature, and  X  = {  X  eters characterizing a Gaussian mixture model g  X  R F with diagonal covariance matrices, i.e.  X  i 6 = j :  X  k [ i,j ]  X  where the responsibility  X  ( k | f ) of mixture component k for a given feature f  X  F is defined as  X  ( k | f ) =  X  k  X N ( f |  X 
Proof. By making use of Theorem 1, one can show that  X  Differential calculus yields that  X   X  k second statement can be shown analogously.

Lemma 1 finally provides a way of computing gradient-based signatures by means of closed-form expressions. The computation of the gradients  X   X  k  X  k [ i,i ] log L (  X  | X ) for a given feature signature X  X  be restricted to the corresponding representatives R X  X  F Therefore, the time complexity of a single gradient compu-tation lies in O ( | R X | X   X  ) where  X  denotes the computation time complexity of evaluating the responsibility  X  ( k | f ).
Computing gradient-based signatures prior to query pro-cessing makes sense for very large multimedia databases. If the multimedia database is updated frequently and/or the generative model changes dynamically, interrupting query processing for the sake of databasing gradient-based sig-natures inevitably leads to the problem of high query la-tency. In order to counteract this issue, we show how to compute the Euclidean distance between two gradient-based signatures in an ad-hoc manner by means of the Signature Quadratic Form Distance between the corresponding feature signatures in the following section.
The Euclidean distance L 2 ( X  X  ,Y  X  ) between two gradient-based signatures X  X  ,Y  X   X  R  X  with respect to the param-eters  X   X   X  of a generative model p  X  R F is equivalent to the Signature Quadratic Form Distance SQFD s the corresponding feature signatures X,Y  X  R F by utiliz-ing the similarity function s  X  ( f,g ) = P  X   X   X   X   X  log p ( f |  X  )  X   X   X  log p ( g |  X  ). This is formally shown in the theorem below. Theorem 2. (Equivalence of L 2 and SQFD ) Let ( F , X  ) be a feature space and  X   X   X  be the parameters characterizing a generative model p  X  R F . It holds for all fea-ture signatures X,Y  X  R F and corresponding gradient-based signatures X  X  ,Y  X   X  R  X  with respect to the parameters  X  of p that: where the similarity function s  X  : F  X  F  X  R is defined for all f,g  X  F as s  X  ( f,g ) = P  X   X   X   X   X  log p ( f |  X  )  X  X  Proof.
 Consequently, the statement is shown.

The similarity function s  X  ( f,g ) is a dot product evaluated according to the parameters  X   X   X  between the gradients  X   X  log p ( f |  X  ) and  X   X  log p ( g |  X  ) of the corresponding features f,g  X  F . The similarity function s  X  ( f,g ) yields a large positive value if the gradients of both features f and g point into the same direction for many parameters  X   X   X  , i.e. if the adaption of parameters in order to maximize the log-likelihood function is similar for both features f and g . The more gradients point into different directions, the smaller the value of the similarity function s  X  ( f,g ).

To summarize, the similarity function s  X  ( f,g ) utilized within the Signature Quadratic Form Distance is less influ-enced by the distance between the features f and g but their relationship to the parameters of the underlying generative model.
Binarizing gradient-based signatures leads to compact con-tent-based feature representations of multimedia objects. Consider for instance a feature signature X  X  R F with n = | R
X | representatives over a d -dimensional Euclidean fea-ture space F = R d . Storing this feature signature requires n + ( n  X  d ) floating point values which typically comprise 4 bytes each. In contrast, if we consider a generative model with parameters  X  , the number of floating point values of the corresponding gradient-based signature X  X   X  R  X  is re-duced to |  X  | . Binarizing this gradient-based signature X will further significantly reduce the storage space from |  X  | floating point values to |  X  | bits.

The most intuitive approach to binarize a gradient-based signature consists in substituting positive weights by a value of one and non-positive weights by a value of zero. We de-note this approach as natural binarization which is defined for a gradient-based signature X  X   X  R  X  and for all param-eters  X   X   X  as follows:
The natural binarization exploits the fact that the gradi-ent-based signature X  X  describes how to adapt the model parameters  X  in order to maximize the likelihood L (  X  | X ). The increase or decrease of a single parameter  X   X   X  can thus be easily expressed by means of a binary notation.
The individual data distribution within each single pa-rameter  X  , however, is completely ignored by the natural binarization. To this end, we further propose to binarize gradient-based signatures according to the expectation val-ues E[  X  | X ] = 1 | a given training data set X  X  R  X  . We denote this approach as expectation binarization which is defined for a gradient-based signature X  X   X  R  X  and for all parameters  X   X   X  as follows:
A binary gradient-based signature X b E  X  describes how each single parameter  X  deviates from the expectation value E[  X  | based on the training data set X . Since this approach may be sensitive to outliers in the training data set X , we addi-tionally propose to replace the expectation value by the me-dian value. We denote this approach as median binarization which is defined for a gradient-based signature X  X  and for all parameters  X   X   X  as follows: where M[  X  | X ] is defined as the median of parameter  X  with respect to the training set X .

The dissimilarity between two binary gradient-based sig-natures is evaluated by the logical operation XOR, i.e. by counting the number bit differences. The question of which binarization method will lead to the highest retrieval per-formance is evaluated in the following section.
Evaluating the performance of distance-based similarity search approaches is a highly empirical discipline. It is nearly unforeseeable which approach will provide the best re-sults with respect to the qualities of accuracy and efficiency. To this end, we evaluated the proposed (binary) gradient-based signatures on different benchmark image databases.
The Holidays database [30] comprises 1,491 holiday photos corresponding to a large variety of scene types. It was designed to test the robustness, for instance, to rota-tion, viewpoint, and illumination changes. The UKBench database [44] consists of 10,200 images showing different objects or scenes that are photographed from four different viewpoints. Both databases provide ground truth informa-tion including queries that are used to evaluate the accu-racy of the approaches. The ImageNet database [17] is a large-scale image database with more than 14 million het-erogenous images. We use this database to evaluate the scal-ability of our approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the MIRFlickr database [27] includes 1 million images crawled from Flickr 5 and is used for training the generative models and binarization methods.

We computed feature signatures for each image of the aforementioned databases by first extracting local feature descriptors, denoted by PCT, describing the relative spa-tial information of a pixel, its CIELAB color value, and its coarseness and contrast values as described in [6] and then clustering the extracted feature descriptors by the k-means algorithm. In this way, we obtained feature signatures with 10 up to 100 representatives over a 7-dimensional feature space F = R 7 . In addition, we trained Gaussian mixture models with diagonal covariance matrices comprising 10 up to 50 components over the aforementioned feature space by utilizing features from the MIRFlickr database. Based on these Gaussian mixture models and feature signatures, we computed gradient-based signatures with resect to the pa-rameters  X   X  = {  X  k } n k =1 of the Gaussian mixture models, since these parameters indicate superior quality in terms of accuracy within preliminary investigations in comparison to other parameters. http://flickr.com
We implemented all approaches in Java 1.8 and conducted the experiments on a single-core 3.4 GHz machine equipped with 16 GB of main memory.
In the first series of experiments, we investigated the per-formance of gradient-based signatures in terms of accuracy by means of the mean average precision measure, which pro-vides a single-figure measure of quality across all recall lev-els [39]. The mean average precision measure is evaluated on the 500 and 2,550 selected queries of the Holidays and UKBench databases for gradient-based signatures based on Gaussian mixture models of sizes 10, 30, and 50 and fea-ture signatures of sizes 10, 20, 50, and 100. The results with respect to different (dis)similarity measures are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen in this figure, the combina-tion of gradient-based signatures and Manhattan distance achieves the highest mean average precision values for both databases. On average, increasing the number of compo-nents of the Gaussian mixture model and the size of the underlying feature signatures results in higher retrieval accu-racy. On the Holidays database, the maximum mean average precision value of 0.77 is achieved with gradient-based signa-tures obtained from a Gaussian mixture model of size 40 and feature signatures of size 90. On the UKBench database, the maximum mean average precision value of 0.78 is achieved with gradient-based signatures obtained from a Gaussian mixture model of size 50 and feature signatures of size 100. By additionally weighting the parameters of the gradient-based signatures with the approximation of the Fisher in-Figure 4: Mean average precision values for gradient-based signatures with respect to different binarization methods as a function of the size of the ImageNet database. formation matrix as proposed in [48], the performance in-creases to mean average precision values of 0.78 and 0.82 on the Holidays and UKBench database, respectively.

In the second series of experiments, we evaluated the per-formance of binary gradient-based signatures. To this end, we compared the different binarization methods natural X b expectation X b E  X  , and median X b M  X  , as proposed in Section 5, with non-binarized gradient-based signatures and the Man-hattan distance. The results in terms of mean average preci-sion values are depicted in Figure 3. Binary gradient-based signatures show the same tendency as gradient-based signa-tures. Increasing the number of components of the Gaussian mixture model and the size of the underlying feature signa-tures results in higher retrieval accuracy. The highest mean average precision values of 0.73 and 0.75 on the Holidays and UKBench databases are achieved with the expectation bina-rization method and Gaussian mixture models of size 40 and 50 and feature signatures of size 80 and 100, respectively.
We furthermore evaluated the scalability in terms of ac-curacy of binary gradient-based signatures by increasing the Holidays database with additional images from the Ima-geNet database. The corresponding mean average precision values are shown in Figure 4. As can be seen in the fig-ure, the loss of accuracy by utilizing binary gradient-based signatures instead of gradient-based signatures is approx-imately 10%. By increasing the Holidays database with 5 million images, gradient-based signatures endowed with the Manhattan distance achieve a mean average precision value of 0.67 while the corresponding binary gradient-based signatures achieve a mean average precision value of 0.59.
The performance in terms of accuracy of (binary) gradient-based signatures in comparison to the state-of-the-art signa-ture-based approaches is summarized in Table 1. In partic-ular, we compare different variants of our approach to the Earth Mover X  X  Distance (EMD), the Perceptually Modified Hausdorff Distance (PMHD), the Signature Matching Dis-tance (SMD), and the Signature Quadratic Form Distance (SQFD). We report the highest mean average precision val-ues and the corresponding signature size as well as as the size of the Gaussian mixture model where appropriate. Accord-ing to Table 1, gradient-based signatures ( X  X  , L 1 ) in combi-nation with the Manhattan distance are able to outperform the well-known Earth Mover X  X  Distance and the Signature Quadratic Form Distance. The Earth Mover X  X  Distance is Table 1: Comparison to the state-of-the-art signature-based approaches on the Holidays and UKBench databases.

 even outperformed by making use of binary gradient-based signatures ( X b E  X  , XOR) and the logical operation XOR. The highest performance in terms of accuracy is reached by the Signature Matching Distance on the Holidays database and the Perceptually Modified Hausdorff Distance on the UK-Bench database.

Summarizing, the performance results reported above show that gradient-based signatures are able to outperform state-of-the-art signature-based approaches in terms of ac-curacy. The suitability of gradient-based signatures for effi-cient similarity search in multimedia databases comprising millions of feature signatures is indicated by means of Ta-ble 2, where we summarize the average query response times for 100-nearest-neighbor queries in a multimedia database comprising 5 million gradient-based signatures. The queries are processed via a sequential scan, i.e. without any addi-tional indexing structure.

While the query response times for gradient-based signa-tures ( X  X  , L 1 ) endowed with the Manhattan distance sig-nificantly increase from approximately 0.4 seconds to 1.6 seconds when increasing the size of the underlying Gaus-sian mixture model, the query response times for binary gradient-based signatures ( X b  X   X  , XOR), which are compared via the logical operation XOR, increase only marginally and approximately stay around a value of 0.5 seconds.

The query response times show that gradient-based sig-natures are orders of magnitude faster than conventional signature-based approaches. According to [6], the Signature Matching Distance is one of the most efficient signature-based distance function that performs 1 million distance computations for feature signatures of size 10 in approxi-mately 1.4 seconds. For a feature signature size of 100, the Signature Matching Distance requires approximately 82.2 seconds.
To conclude, our extensive performance analysis shows that the problem of similarity search in large-scale multi-media databases comprising millions of feature signatures can be solved efficiently and with high accuracy by means of gradient-based signatures. Moreover, by making use of binary gradient-based signatures, we are able to process k-nearest-neighbor queries with a sequential scan in a multi-media database comprising 5 million images with high accu-racy in approximately 0.5 seconds on a single-core machine without any additional indexing structure.
In this paper, we have addressed the problem of efficient and accurate similarity search in multimedia databases com-prising millions of feature signatures. Since query processing and indexing based on the feature signature approach re-mains one of the major challenges for large-scale multimedia databases, we have proposed and theoretically investigated the concept of gradient-based signatures which approximate the content-based properties of multimedia objects that are represented by feature signatures with respect to a common generative model. We have shown that gradient-based signa-tures are able to outperform state-of-the-art signature-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

As future work, we intend to investigate indexing and query processing approaches for gradient-based signatures. This work is funded by DFG grant SE 1039/7-1. [1] R. Agrawal, C. Faloutsos, and A. N.
