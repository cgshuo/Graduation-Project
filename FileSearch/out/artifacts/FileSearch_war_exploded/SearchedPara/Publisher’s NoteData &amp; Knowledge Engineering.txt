 It is with great sadness that Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering records the unexpected passing of one of its founding editors Dr. R.P. van de Riet (1939 X 2008).
 Reind was an instrumental part of Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering, and will be remembered for his longstanding contribu-tions, interacting with, and educating over 5000 authors and countless referees. Reind has shaped Data &amp; Knowledge Engi-neering right from its very inception in 1983 up to his recent guest editorship of the 25th anniversary issue, fittingly celebrated at ER-08 in Barcelona.
 Seeing him there, one would never have guessed that a man with so much heart would ultimately have it fail too soon. Reind will be sorely missed by colleagues across the globe, and our thoughts are with his family.
