The importance of contextual info rmation has been recognized by researchers and practitioners in many disciplines, including e-commerce personalization, informa tion retrieval, ubiquitous and mobile computing, data mining, marketing, and management. While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of existing approaches focuses on recommending the most relevant items to users and does not take into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, weather, or the company of other people. Therefore, this workshop aims to bring together researchers with wide-ranging backgrounds to identify important research ques tions, to exchange ideas from different research disciplines, and, more generally, to facilitate recommender systems (CARS). In particular, topics of interest for this workshop include (but are not limited to):
