 Chat mediums are becoming an important part of human life in societies and provide time to find out information in chat mediums. A system can be developed to help final goals is to develop a system that automatically determines persons with criminal liminary study in chat mediums. In order to do this, conversations are acquired from a specially designed chat medium and real chat mediums and then statistical and se-used to determine weighting coefficients of the proposed discrimination function and to evaluate the semantic analyzer for identification. sex-identification [6], [7], [8], [9]. In this paper, a comparative study about sex identi-fication techniques is presented to automati cally monitor chat conversations. The rest language are given in Section 2. Proposed discrimination function for sex identifica-tion is presented in Section 3. A detailed description of methods used in the system is given in the same section. The implementation and results are discussed in Section 4. The conclusion and future work are given in Section 5. Many world languages have a common noticeable characteristic so that they could have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) but Turkish lan-guage has only one (neuter). Hence, unlike Turkish, some words may reveal the sex of chatters in English. For example,  X  X en onun karde  X  iyim X  in Turkish may be trans-lated into English as  X  X  am his brother/sister X . Therefore, the identification of chatters X  sex from a conversation in Turkish may be more difficult than in English. 
In real-time and informal environment of IM (Instant Messages) systems, Turkish chat messages are very different from conventional Turkish. Therefore, chat language includes acronyms, short forms, polysemes, synonyms and misspelled terms. A simple identification system is proposed for binary subject. This system consists of discrimination and semantic analyzer units. Here, the proposed function includes some important parameters such as words, word groups, and weighting coefficients. A semantic analyzer is also employed to enhance accuracy of the system. This simple identification system is explained under the following titles. 3.1 Classifying Words for Sex Identification concepts and subjects as possible in a chat medium [4], [5]. These groups are abbrevia-and shouting, sex and age related words, question words, particle and conjunction words, and other words group. Word groups are built by considering the conceptual relations and usage frequency of words used by female or male chatters. 
Due to the nature of chats, contents of conversations vary completely. Hence, the feature vectors and words in the conversations also changes dynamically. Therefore, new words are added to each word group when a new male or female dominant word is accounted in a conversation. 3.2 A Discrimination Function for Sex Identification medium. This function considers each word in conversations separately and collec-tively. Therefore, statistical information rela ted to each chosen word is collected from the Specially Designed Chat Medium (SDCM) and Real Internet Medium (RIM) [3], [4], [5]. By using the statistical information, a weighting coefficient is determined for each word in each word group. Practically, a normalized weighting coefficient (in 0.0-1.0 interval) of each word is determined. For each conceptually related word group, a sexual identity value is calculated by equation (1). word group and varies related to the number of words in the interested text, j w rep-w =1.0 else  X  varies from 0.5 to 1.0. 
As explained before, words are also classified in several groups according to their con-the proposed discrimination function is formed for sex identification as Equation (2). weighting coefficients of each group are dete rmined according to dominant sexual iden-determined between 0.0 and 0.5. On the other hand, chatters may be identified as male when  X  is determined between 0.5 and 1.0. Here, the accuracy of the results increases so that it shows female or male gender when  X  approaches to 0.0 and 1.0 respectfully. 3.3 A Simple Semantic Analysis Method to Enhance the Sex Identification For further improvement of the accuracy of the identification, a semantic analyzer is added to the system. Semantically, some sentence structures in a conversation such as (1) Baskan sen naber e What is the news, and so (2) TaRaNTuLa ben murat de  X  ilim abisiyim I am not Murat, His older brother (3) TaRaNTuLa slm Hi (4) Baskan  X mer abi ?  X mer? (5) TaRaNTuLa zekeriya Zekeriya (5) Baskan ooo aslan zekeriya abi Dear Lion Zekeriya (6) Baskan ben ahmet I am Ahmet questions, answers and addressed sentences may reveal the sex of the chatter [3], [4]. For example,  X  X hat is your name? (ismin neydi?)  X  Ahmet X ,  X  X ame? (ismin?)  X  conversations, many addressed sentences may also be used such as  X  X i Ahmet (Mer-haba Ahmet) X ,  X  X ow are you Davut (Nas X ls X n? Davut) X  and etc. 
In the semantic analysis, idiomatic expressions, phrases, expressions and the rela-tions between subjects and suffixes are especi ally analyzed for the identification. For example,  X  X t this rate you won X  X  be able to get married (O zaman sen evde kal- X r-s X n because the sentence,  X  X ou won X  X  be able to get married X , is used for female persons in Turkish. Here, the personal suffixes used in the semantic analysis are  X  X  and -singular first person and singular second person respectively. As another example,  X  X ak X   X   X kl X y X m (I am handsome) X  can morphologically be analyzed as yak X   X   X kl X -(y) X m. Here,  X  X andsome X  determines the dominant sex as male and the suffix  X -(y) X m X  de-termines the singular first person. Then, the chatter can be identified as male. 
In the application, the semantic analyzer analyses each sentence in the conversation and generates outcomes as male, possible male, no results (neuter), possible female single semantic decision about sex of the chatter. Hence, semantic relations may con-Equation (3) combines statistical and semantic identification outputs and produce the final identification output. where  X  is the final result that identifies the sex of the chatter, sta statistical and semantic weighting coefficients, and sta semantic identifications respectively. In this paper, we have presented performances of different similarity measurement methods. About two hundreds conversations have been collected from SDCM. Forty-nine of the conversations including ninety-eight chatters (forty-four female and fifty-sets and the same feature vectors are also obtained on WEKA X  X  SVM and NB imple-mentations [9], [10]. The test results are given in Table 2. These approaches including the proposed method show similar performances without the semantic analysis. On the other hand, experimental results show that our system with the semantic analysis method performs better than the other systems in sex identification. The decision accuracy of our system reaches to 88.8%. 
More than one hundred conversations are collected from RIM: mIRC (mIRC is a shareware Internet Relay Chat) and forty-two of them are chosen randomly. The test results are given in Table 2. The decision results of the identification systems are listed in the table. These results show that general accuracy of our system reaches to 92.9%. 
About 1.27 MB of text data were obtained from more than two hundred conversa-tion system ran on PC with P4-3.2 GHz CPU and 512 MB RAM. For sex identification, these conversations are processed in 4.34, 8.75 and 10.93 minutes on the proposed, NB for large-scale mining applications. Mining chat conversations are becoming more important and provide quite useful information about people in a society. Hence, a simple discrimination function with semantic analysis method is defined for sex identification in conversations. Our sim-ple and computationally less expensive sex identification system with semantic analy-sis method provides better performance comparing to the other methods. The results show that the proposed identification function is quite useful for binary classification such as sex identification. This identification system with the discrimination function achieves accuracy about 90% in the sex identification. 
Although some satisfactory results are obtained, the system still needs to be im-proved and tested on larger data sets. Our experiments and results show that the pro-posed methods for sex identification may also be applied to other concepts and sub-jects such as topic detection. the future implementation of the system, the problem will be considered to minimize or eliminate these misleading sentences.
