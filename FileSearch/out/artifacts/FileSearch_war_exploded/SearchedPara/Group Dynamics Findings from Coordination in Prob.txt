 We present the results of group dynamics and their effect on success in problem solving / decision making meetings. We use a novel multiple input environment for collaboration and data collection, and a hidden profile task given to groups, whose goals are to find the correct solution. We observe that groups elect 0, 1 or 2 leaders, and the best results are obtained by the groups with a single leader. Prior acquain-tance (familiarity), does not show any effect on the success or on the group strategies. Groups with a single leader tend to be more successful, and leaders expressed their authority verbally rather than by through the collaborative system.

The success of problem solving and decision making in meetings is highly influenced by the way group dynamics emerge. We make use of a shared multiple-input system Figure 1: Wall Display, Meeting Table, Keyboards and Mice. (using either multiple keyboards and mice or multiple pen) with a single display screen as an SDG (single display group-ware), and a hidden profile task designed by Stasser [4], to evaluate how groups collaborate and how their internal dy-namics are created, and to observe the impact of these on the performance of the groups. Several authors have evalu-ated similar settings. Rienks and Zhang [3] are looking into participation levels, Matthews and Whittaker [2] are looking at teams from the individual X  X  perspective. Kelly and Fisher [1] are analyzing structures that emerge from collaborations in teams.
The setup includes a front projected display and a meeting table placed in front of it (Figure 1).

The meeting table has a wave like shape (Figure 2) de-signed to facilitate positioning for both face-to-face interac-tion and the public display visibility. The system is equipped either with a wireless mouse and keyboard (Figure 1), or with a digital pen and paper (PP, Figure 2). The public display as well as the input devices are connected to a single computer. Figure 2: Meeting table in the Pen and Paper setup.
We conducted a user study recruiting 66 participants who formed groups of 3 (2 teams) and 4 (15 teams) people. The hidden profile task required the participants to play the role of detectives in identifying a perpetrator, by combining in-formation from investigation transcripts and records that were distributed as booklets (one per participant). The in-formation in the booklets contained parts that were com-mon (replicated on all booklets), but also parts that were available only on individual booklets. To solve the task, the participants needed to collaborate in order to success-fully merge information from all booklets. The task time was capped to two hours, but we recorded the actual dura-tion for each team. Groups were successful if they correctly identified the perpetrator.

During the study, we had three types of information col-lection: logs of system use by participant; a wizard-of-oz observer attending the meeting (in the background), count-ing the number of utterances (separated on task-related or coordination-related), and the number of gestures (to the screen and to the material); and the participants filling in a pre-test questionnaire with prior information, and pref-erences and a post-test questionnaire with their perception about the task, social aspects, coordination, etc.
We collected and grouped the data into individual and group results, and used statistics (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and Linear Regression) to evaluate the relations between certain factors, using the R environment. Leadership was assessed by the observers, and we categorized it into groups with 0, 1, and 2 leaders. Familiarity of the group was con-sidered negative if at most 2 (of 4) people knew each other previously, and positive if at least 3 people knew each other, but in the vast majority of the cases, they either didn X  X  know anyone at all, or everyone knew everyone. Some individual ranked features were evaluated at the group level by com-puting the mean of the individual values for people in that group.
First, we did not find any impact of the group familiar-ity on performance or other elements measured, including success ( H[2] = 0.457, p = .499 ). However, the perceived level of consensus was higher in successful groups compared to unsuccessful groups ( H[2] = 6.583, p = .01 ). Another measure that had a relation with success was the gestures towards the board, in the sense that successful groups did less gestures ( H[2] = 4.3012, p = . 038). An explanation for such a result could be that the large number of gestures were caused by confusion, which also lead to poor performance. On the other hand, in those the groups where individuals felt they participated more, they also felt that their con-tributions were taken into account more ( F[2,17] = 24.46, p&lt;. 001).

In terms of leadership, 73% of groups with one leader were successful, whereas only 16% of groups with 0 or 2 leaders were successful ( H[3] = 5.2391, p =0 . 073).
We found that leaders did not do significantly more oper-ations on the shared screen ( F[2, 17] = 0.007494, p = . 932). On the other hand, leaders had significantly more total ut-terances than non-leaders ( H[2] = 5.5761, p = . 018). There-fore we conclude that leadership was expressed through ver-bal communication, and not through monopoly over the shared space.

Another finding was that participants who made more ges-tures towards the display also had more organizational ut-terances ( F[2, 66] = 12.27, p&lt;. 001). This supports the hypothesis that more gestures were made in the presence of more confusion, and participants tried to over-organize to reduce this confusion.
We presented findings about leadership, success and fa-miliarity of groups performing a hidden profile task. Lead-ership is certainly an important aspect that requires more fine-tuned research, because it can prove instrumental in ex-plaining certain patterns and in predicting the success of the groups. We plan to analyze different other ways of defining leadership, including defining formulas for leadership based on contribution and adjusting the thresholds for such mea-surements towards optimal values.
