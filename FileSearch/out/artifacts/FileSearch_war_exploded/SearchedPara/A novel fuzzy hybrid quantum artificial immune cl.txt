 1. Introduction que which is widely used in data mining, and classi fi cation. An immune kernel clustering network (IKCN) was proposed based on the combination of the arti fi cial immune network and the support vector domain description (SVDD) for the unsupervised image segmentation. The clustering results of the local support vector hyperspheres were combined to yield a global clustering solution by the minimal spanning tree (MST). The proposed methods were compared with two common clustering algorithms for the arti -cial synthetic data set and several image data sets. The experi-mental results were obtained ( Huang and Jiao, 2008 ). During the last decade arti fi cial immune systems have drawn much of the researchers' attention. All the work that had been done was developing many interesting algorithms which came in useful when solving engineering problems such as data mining and analysis and many others. This novel approach and a new way of performing suppression was proposed in colonial selection result in a very effective and stable immune algorithm for both unsu-pervised and supervised learning. Further improvements to the cluster analysis by means of the proposed algorithm and immune
K -means were introduced. Interesting and useful improvements of the proposed approach by means of negative selection algorithms were proposed and discussed ( Bereta and Burczy  X  ski, 2009 ). Based on immunodominance in the biological immune system and the colonial selection mechanism, immune dominance clone multi-objective clustering algorithm (IDCMC) was presented. The clustering task was a multi-objective optimization problem which was more robust with respect to the variety of cluster structures of different datasets than a single-objective clustering algorithm. The genetic algorithm-based clustering technique and the original
K -Means algorithm in solving most of the problems were tested ( Ma et al., 2009 ). Based on this principle, some effective and ef fi cient arti fi cial immune algorithms had been proposed and applied to a wide range of engineering applications. For solving on-line supervised two-class classi fi cation problems, the general framework of the proposed algorithm was described and several essential issues related to the learning process were also dis-cussed. It was shown empirically by the experimental results that the proposed algorithm exhibits competitive classi fi cation accu-racy ( Zhang and Yi, 2010 ). Arti fi cial immune systems were computational systems inspired by the principles and processes of the natural immune system. In this study, a new arti fi immune classi fi er with swarm learning was proposed to solve these three problems. The proposed algorithm used the swarm learning to evolve the antibody population. Therefore, the method
The results were compared to other classi fi cation techniques and the method was competitive to other classi fi ers algorithms ( Aydin et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, the paper disclosed clustering perfor-mance measures which were more applicable to measure the clustering quality in a non-stationary environment compared to the clustering performance measures for stationary environments. The proposed clustering performance measures were used to compare the clustering results of three networks based on arti fi models, since the adaptability and self-organizing behaviors of the natural immune system inspired the modeling of network based arti fi cial immune models for clustering of non-stationary data ( Graaff and Engelbrecht, 2011 ). Spectral angle mapping distance was used to measure af fi nity between two feature vectors using a genetic algorithm-based optimization which helped the model to fi cation accuracy, local homogeneity of classi fi ed images and model sensitivity to training sample size were examined ( Gong et al., 2011 ). Arti fi cial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm which was one of the most recently introduced optimization algorithms simulated the intelligent foraging behavior of a honeybee swarm. Clustering analysis that is used in many disciplines and applications was an important tool and a descriptive task seeking to identify homo-geneous groups of objects based on the values of their attributes. The simulation results indicated that ABC algorithm could ef ciently be used for multivariate data clustering ( Karaboga and Ozturk, 2011 ). The paper introduced accuracy boosting extension to a novel induction of fuzzy rules from raw data using arti immune system methods. The result accuracy of these methods was signi fi cantly lower than accuracy of fuzzy rules obtained by the method presented in that study ( M  X   X  yk and Unold, 2011 ).
Recent years, some swarm intelligence-based methods for clustering were proposed and achieved encouraging results. It presented a Hybrid Arti fi cial Bee Colony (HABC) algorithm for data clustering. The incentive mechanism of HABC was enhancing the information exchange (social learning) between bees by introdu-cing the crossover operator of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to ABC. The results showed that the HABC algorithm achieved better results than the other algorithms and was a competitive approach for data clustering ( Yan et al., 2012 ). It described an immune-inspired system based on alternate theory about the self  X  oneself distinc-tion theory which de fi ned the negative selection process as a mechanism of fuzzy system based on the af fi nity between antigen and T-cells. Upon detection of faults, a participatory clustering algorithm was used to classify these faults and tested to obtain the best set of parameters to achieve the most accurate clustering for the tests in the application being discussed in the article Costa Silva et al. (2012 ). The quantum clustering (QC) algorithm suffered from the issues of getting stuck in local extremes and computa-tional bottleneck when handling large-size image segmentation. The multi-elitist immune clonal quantum clustering algorithm (ME-ICQC) was proposed. In the proposed framework, elitist population was composed of individuals with high af fi nity which was considered to play dominant roles in the evolutionary process. Compared with existing algorithms, the ME-ICQC achieved an improved clustering accuracy with more stable convergence, but it was not signi fi cantly better than other optimization techniques combined with QC ( Gou et al., 2013 ). Multi-objective clustering algorithms were preferred over its conventional single objective counterparts as they incorporate additional knowledge on proper-ties of data in the form of objectives to extract the underlying clusters present in many datasets. It was observed that hybrid evolutionary algorithms provided an improved performance com-pared to that of individual algorithm in many cases. An automatic Multi-objective Immunized Particle Swarm Optimization cluster-ing algorithm (MOIMPSO) was proposed which was based on a recently developed hybrid evolutionary algorithm Immunized PSO. In addition the algorithm provided a single best solution from the Pareto optimal archive which it mostly satis fi es com-pared to that of the standardized automatic clustering algorithms such as MOCK, MOPSO and MOCLONAL ( Nanda and Panda, 2013 ).
Arti fi cial immune systems based on natural immunity system could be successfully applied for classi fi cation, optimization, recognition and learning in real-world problems. In that study, a reinforcement learning based arti fi cial immune classi proposed as a new approach which was used as a reinforcement learning to fi nd better antibody with immune operators. The comparative results with supervised and unsupervised based arti fi cial immune system, negative selection classi fi er and resource effectiveness of the proposed new method ( Karakose, 2013 ).
An improved arti fi cial immune algorithm with a dynamic threshold was presented. The calculation for the af fi nity function in the real-valued coding arti fi cial immune algorithm was modi by considering the antibody's fi tness and setting the dynamic threshold value ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). Evolutionary algorithms may resolve some of the issues associated with non-Gaussian distribu-tion; the solutions provided by evolutionary algorithms may get trapped in local optimum. A hybrid approach using evolutionary algorithms was proposed to improve the accuracy of linear dis-criminate analysis ( Chiu et al., 2009 ). Recently, the human immune systems had aroused researcher's interest due to it useful mechan-isms which can be used and exploited for information processing in a complex cognition system. Simulation results showed that the immune algorithm can successfully obtain the global optimum.
Therefore, this method had a potential application in other optimi-zation problems ( Ji and Jonathan Wu, 2010 ). To deal with sequen-cing the assigned operations on all machines, an arti fi cial immune algorithm (AIA) based on integrated approach was proposed. This algorithm used several strategies for generating the initial popula-tion and selecting the individuals for reproduction. The numerical experiments were conducted by using benchmark problems.
Consequently, the computational results validated the quality of the proposed approach ( Bagheri et al., 2010 ). Due to the complexity of the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling
Problem (RCPSP), a metheuri stic algorithm called Arti fi
Immune Algorithm (AIA) which was inspired by the vertebrate immune system was adopted to solve this problem. In order to con fi rm the performance of the proposed algorithm, the algo-rithm applied to various test problems available in the literature and the reliability of it was compared with well-reported benchmark algorithms ( Mobini et al., 2011 ).
 Clustering algorithm was critical to market segmentation.
The immunity-based ant clustering algorithm was proposed which integrated the ant algorithm and the arti fi cial immune system.
Ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO), a novel meta-heuristic approach for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems, was utilized to generate good solutions to the clustering problems.
Then, the arti fi cial immune system was adopted to search for optimization of clustering problems. Hypothesis tests were con-ducted to test the signi fi cance among our proposed method and other known clustering methods ( Mohammadi et al., 2012 ). An adaptive hierarchical arti fi cial immune system (RA-AHAIS) was proposed to solve the optimization problem. A series of simulation experiments were arranged to analyze the effects of time slots and frequency. The numerical simulation results indicated that the proposed RA-AHAIS was an effective reader-to-reader anti-collision method and performed better in tag identi fi cation cap-ability and computational ef fi ciency than the other methods such as genetic algorithm (RA-GA), particle swarm optimization (RA-PSO) and arti fi cial immune algorithm for resource allocation (RA-AIS) ( Li et al., 2014 ). An Arti fi cial Immune System approach was presented for solving generation scheduling problem of a
Genco comprised of thermal and wind energy systems. In this work, the impact of wind energy on short term generation scheduling problem was analyzed through the adaptive search which was inspired from the Arti fi cial Immune System. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated and the results for the near optimal schedule were discussed ( Lakshmi and
Vasantharathna, 2014 ). 2. Quantum arti fi cial immune algorithm rising intelligence algorithm. Based on evolutionary game theory and QICA, a quantum-inspired immune algorithm embedded with evolutionary game (EGQICA) was proposed to solve combination optimization problems. Replicator dynamics was used to model the behavior of the quantum antibody and the memory mechan-ism was also introduced in that work. Experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm maintained a good diversity and achieved superior performance ( Wu et al., 2009 ). A quantum-inspired immune clone algorithm (QICA) and wavelet packet (WP) were proposed based on adaptive multi-scale Bandelet (QICAWP-
AMB) for image representation. Moreover, in order to locate the optimal direction in each square, the QICA algorithm was employed to obtain more accurate geometric fl ows. Experiments on image coding were taken to compare the ef fi ciency of our proposed method with that of Wavelets ( Yang et al., 2010 ). An ef fi cient quantum immune algorithm (QIA) was presented for hybrid fl ow shop problem (HFSP). The objective was to fi optimal job sequence that minimizes the mean fl ow time. Immune algorithm (IA) and quantum algorithm (QA) were used to solve the problem. To improve the performance of IA, an effective IA was proposed with new adaptive crossover and fractional parts muta-tion operators which were called AIA. A randomly replacing strategy was employed to promote population diversity of QA and namely RRQA. In order to achieve better results, the paper proposed a quantum immune algorithm (QIA) which combined IA with QA to optimize the HFSP. The simulation results showed that the proposed AIA signi fi cantly enhanced the performance of IA ( Gao and Wang, 2011 ). For fi nding Pareto-optimal solutions to multi-objective optimization problems, a novel quantum immune algorithm based on quantum computing and immune system was proposed. Simulation results on six standard problems showed the proposed algorithm was able to fi nd a much better spread of solutions and it had better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the vector immune algorithm (VIS) and the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic system (NSGA-II) ( Niu et al., 2012 ). A potential evolution formula was embedded into the af fi nity function calculation of multi-elitist immune clonal opti-mization and the updated cluster center based on the distance matrix and the multi-elitist immune clonal quantum clustering algorithm (ME-ICQC) were proposed. In the proposed framework, elitist population was composed of individuals with high af which was considered to play dominant roles in the evolutionary process. The diversity of population could be well maintained by general subgroup evolution of ME-ICQC. Compared with existing algorithms, the ME-ICQC algorithm achieved an improved cluster-ing accuracy with more stable convergence. But it was not signi fi cantly better than other optimization techniques combined with QC. The experimental results also showed that the algorithm performed well on multi-class, parameters-sensitive and large-was an emerging intelligent method andit's a calculation model designed on the basis of the biological immune system's functions, features and mechanisms. It had strong ability in study, reorgani-zation, memorization and character extraction, so it can solve many complex problems challenging the traditional calculation algorithms. Compared with the existing computational intelli-gence methods such as genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and so on, immune algorithm has the following advantages: the mutation operator is implemented on the memory unit but not all individuals obtain the global optimal solution soon. The diversity of immune algorithm is presented by using immune clonal selection strategy to overcome the premature problem. It can overcome the parameter sensitivity issue and converge more quickly than the other algorithms by using immune selection strategy. Therefore, AIS have become a research focus in recent years and has been widely applied in many application fi elds.
A novel solution for cluster based on arti fi cial immune is presented in this paper. To achieve cluster centers, we use clone selection and variation in arti fi cial immune net algorithm instead of taking mean value as cluster center. In this new algorithm, best is overcome; therefore the iteration process is also reduced. The tive traditional algorithms on solution of clustering question.
However, there are still a lot of problems in the arti fi clustering algorithm. Based on the concept of immunodominance, antibody clonal selection theory and quantum bit strategy, a Quantum-inspired Immune Clonal Multi-objective Optimization
Algorithm (QICMO) is proposed. This paper introduces a new improved quantum immune clustering algorithm which combines the immune algorithm with the quantum algorithm. It fi rst introduces the quantum computing algorithm. We fi nd it inter-esting that the QICMO algorithm gets a shorter global convergence time. Secondly, we discuss fuzzy theory and method on the immune algorithm. Then, carry on an in-depth study on the quantum immune clustering algorithm, and to make the appro-priate adjustments and verify that it is better than the immune algorithm and quantum genetic algorithm. In order to improve the ef fi ciency of the quantum immune algorithm, this paper proposed a quantum immune algorithm where the algorithm takes qubit as chromosome. Each chromosome generated multiple and parallel immune chains which are mapped to multiple optimized solutions by separating qubit into multiple. The expanded immune chains may expand the searching space effectively and increase evolu-tionary rate for quantum immune algorithm. It introduced the dynamic adjusting rotation angle mechanism and quantum rota-tion gate to guide individual evolution and used quantum not-gate to prevent immune algorithm occurring premature convergence.
The quantum arti fi cial immune clustering algorithm suffers from the issues of getting stuck in local extremes and computational bottleneck when handling large-size image segmentation. It can help to fi nd the global optimal solution or near-optimal solution for most tested tasks. These different functions are implemented by the dissimilar mutation strategies or crossover operators. The bi-group exchanges the information of excellence antibodies using the hyper-cube co-evolution operation. Co mpared with the other clustering algorithms, the quantum arti fi cial immune clustering algorithm can achieve an improved clustering accuracy with more stable conver-gence and the combined quantum arti fi cial immune clustering algo-3. Cloud model
The existing clustering algorithms as well as clustering tech-nology are combined with fuzzy theory. Cloud model which is proposed based on the traditional fuzzy mathematics and prob-ability statistics theory is a conversion model between qualitative concept and quantitative values. The cloud model was proposed by Li et al. (2014) and was a novel uncertainty reasoning technology.
The theoretical basis of fuzzy set is the classical set theory, whereas the cloud model is based on both fuzzy set and prob-ability measure. Furthermore, fuzzy set theories focused only on fuzziness, while cloud model integrated fuzziness and randomness together to map qualitative concepts and quantitative data ( Liu et al., 2010 ). In addition, cloud model can be extended to a multi-dimensional space. The process of urban growth is fi lled with uncertainties, including randomness, fuzziness and their interre-lationship. Furthermore, the driving factors of urban growth and development are usually complex. Therefore, their integrated uncertainty affected on urban growth should be considered together in a multi-dimensional space ( Deng et al., 2010 ). Multi-dimensional cloud model provided such an applicable method.
Cloud model is an effective tool in uncertain transformation between qualitative concepts and their quantitative expressions. They integrate fuzziness and randomness using digital character-istics such as expected value Ex , entropy En and hyper entropy He . In the normal cloud model based on adaptive mutation operator, expected value Ex is the typical sample of discourse domain which can be the most representative concept. Corresponding to the center of the cloud gravity, Entropy En is the synthetic measure of the random probability and fuzziness of the qualitative concept. Hyper-entropy  X  He  X  measures the uncertainty of entropy, which can also be considered as the entropy of En . By the side of the origin of coordinate with expected value of 0, the larger En is the greater coverage of cloud drops; the larger He is the more discrete of the cloud drops. It is obvious that expected value re fl stability of mutation, entropy re fl ects the span of mutation, and Hyper-entropy  X  He  X  re fl ects the accuracy of mutation. Hyper-characteristics of the cloud are shown in Fig. 1 .

The hybrid sets which contain fuzziness and probabilities are de fi ned over continuous universe of discourse. Domain  X 1 ;  X 1 X  of all elements in total contribution to the concept of C and expression formula can be expressed as C  X  and  X 
C  X  A  X  x  X  n  X  x =  X 
Domain  X  Ex 3 En ; Ex  X  3 En  X  of all elements in total contribution to the concept can also be expressed as C
The contribution of different areas of the cloud droplet swarm on the qualitative concept is shown different in Fig. 2 .
X , En and He 2 obey normal distribution are probability density functions of En .

The following formula can be applied to different implementa-tion models as follows: f  X  x
 X  X  1 ffiffiffiffiffiffi f  X  x j
En  X  X  1 ffiffiffiffiffiffi f  X  x
 X  X  1 ffiffiffiffiffiffi f  X  x  X  X  f f  X  x
 X  X  f  X   X  y  X  f X  X  x  X   X  y  X   X 
We can calculate digital characteristic entropy estimate values by En ^  X  X  characteristic. The excess entropy estimate values is given as
He  X  q
Super entropy will be the fuzziness and randomness asso-ciated; it re fl ects on the cloud thickness and hyper entropy is bigger. Two fi gure contrast can be seen; big super entropy diagram cloud droplets of discrete degree are big and the entropy of small cloud droplets is relatively concentrated. The cloud model simula-tion results of the phenomenon of cloud droplets experiments are shown in Fig. 3 .

Cloud model also used two-order Gaussian distribution to produce cloud drops whose distribution displays high kurtosis and fat tail with power-law decay. In sociology and economics, many phenomena have been found to share high kurtosis and fat tail because of preferential attachment in evolution processes. This paper tries to investigate the relation between Gaussian distribu-based on Gaussian distribution with iterations to depict more uncertain phenomena. If the Gaussian distribution has 1st order
Gaussian distribution, then order 1 x 1 probability density funct-ion is expressed as a random variable: f  X  x  X  X  X  1 =
For three of the higher order Gaussian iterations with simple parameters, we study the changing trend of its mathematical properties and make lots of experimental analysis. The following formula can be applied to the calculation of cloud model, where if u i  X  r i  X   X  i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; n  X  , then E  X  X i  X  X  u i
Var  X  x i  X  X   X  n 1  X   X  cloud transform a qualitative question, the effectiveness evalua-tion of the combinatorial clustering algorithms, into a quantitative question, and considers the fuzzy factors and random factors effects appearing in the evaluating cause. In the cloud model, En determines the steepness of the normal cloud; the greater the En , the cloud covering the level range is wider otherwise the more narrower. According to  X  3 En  X  rule of normal cloud, we take in the algorithm which affects the degree of discrete cloud droplets.

Entropy Weight (SEW) calculating index's weight are introduced and deal with the conversion from qualitative remark to quanti-tative. In this paper, the analytic hierarchy process is combined with fl oating cloud and interval algorithm to calculate C  X 
Ex i ; En i ; He i  X  .If C i  X  X  Ex i ; En i ; He i  X  A  X  C i then C  X  X  Ex ; En ; He  X  can be de fi ned by the following equation:

C n C j : He  X j Ex i n Ex j j n
In order to deal with the uncertainty of image segmentation, fuzzy sets were introduced into the fi eld of image segmentation and some methods were proposed in the literature. From the perspective of scene understanding and image interpretation, a segmentation method was proposed. There are various imple-mentation approaches of the cloud model, resulting in different kinds of cloud model. The normal cloud model is the most commonly used model which is based on the normal distribution and the Gaussian membership function.

In order to validate the four images with bimodal histogram and four images with multimodal histogram the experimental analysis was selected. Fuzzy set theory provides a method to transform image histogram into corresponding membership func-tions and carry out the image segmentation. However, traditional fuzzy sets do not consider the uncertainty of membership function and membership degree; the paper proposes a kind of image segmentation approach based on the cloud model, which considers the randomness and fuzziness of membership simulta-neously. For a random variable of the cloud model, its membership degrees are multiple, which fi t a probability distribution. For the images with bimodal histogram, the paper compares the segmen-tation results of the proposed algorithm. 4. The integrated fuzzy hybrid quantum arti fi cial immune algorithm based on cloud model
In order to overcome the de fi ciency of the traditional method for determining threshold value of the health state, it proposed Ex Ex-0.67En Ex+0.67En Ex+3En Ex-3En a health state grade dividing algorithm based on arti fi cial immune system (AIS) and cloud model. It used the cloud model to soften and dividethestategradeandrealizethehealthstategradedividing automatically and optimally. At last, the algorithm was applied to in complex mechanical system diagnosis to improve the diagnosis accuracy. Uncertainty problem still existed in the arti fi diagnosis method. An immune cloud model was proposed to solve the uncertainty problem. The cloud model proposed by Li Deyi professor was improved to adapt the arti fi cial immune diagnosis method. The result of immune cloud model showed that the immune cloud model was ef fi cient ( Meng et al., 2012 ).

Fuzzy arti fi cial immune algorithm is originally devised to exploit system under investigation. However, acquisition of the knowledge which is needed to create fuzzy rule bases is often seen as a dif and time-consuming process. Furthermore, this process requires deep insight into the system of interest. To automate the knowledge acquisition process, many attempts have been made to transform broadened and adaptive fuzzy arti fi cial immune algorithm has been developed for automatically extracting knowledge from datasets. Over time, adaptive fuzzy arti fi cial immune algorithm has been used to theseadaptivearti fi cial immune algorithms have been developed by soft computing such as genetic algo rithms, particle swarm optimiza-tion algorithm, evolutionary programming and probabilistic methods.
A novel quantum immune clustering algorithm based on cloud model (C-FHQAI) is proposed in this paper. Using quantum cloud-to-species evolution of gene populations and qualitative operation of the control and quantum based on cloud model adaptive strategy revolving door update operations, the scope of the search space can be adaptively controlled by this clustering algorithm under the guidance of qualitative knowledge. It can avoid the local optimal clustering solution under the conditions of the larger search space. A typical function of comparative experiment results shows that this clustering algorithm can avoid trapping in local optimal solution and it can enhance the ability of global optimiza-tion. It can converge to the global optimal clustering solution quickly and it has good clustering application value.
In this proposed algorithm, the antibody is encoded according to the phase and uncertain information which is measured by information entropy accurately. We propose a neighborhood search strategy by descending order of population entropy. For the degree of similarity between the antibodies, we give a measure based on the same individual entropy variable median, and the antibody diversity is evaluated through reproduction probability. The mathematical description of the novel quantum immune clustering algorithm based on quantum immune mechanism and cloud model (C-FHQAI) is as follows.
 The number of group is K and the sample size of each group is L . The numerical characteristics of the different group dataset which are described as  X  Ex 1 ; En 1 ; He 1 ; Ex 2 ; En 2 ; He He calculation formulas: Ex  X  Ex 1 ; Ex 2 ; ... ; Ex n 1 ; Ex n  X  X  Ex  X  X 1 ; X 2 ; ... ;  X  Ex 1

At the same time, we can calculate the sample mean and variance from ^ x 2 1 ; ^ x 2 2 ; ... ; ^ x 2 n . 1 n  X  1 n 1 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :
Then, we can obtain the estimates of En 2 and He 2 as follows: ^
En 2  X  1 2 ^
He 2  X  E  X  x 2  X  ^ En 2 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; :
The paper puts forward two kinds of measurements based on close degree between the cloud model which is maximum and minimum based on cloud model (MMCM) for calculations. Its value of C 1  X  Ex 1 ; En 1 ; He 1  X  and C 2  X  Ex 2 ; En 2 accordance to the following formula:
And then, according to the principle of the discrimination of cloud model, the numerical characteristics are discriminated into an image class represented by cloud model.

Cloud is a quantitative and qualitative uncertainty conversion model which is proposed based on the traditional fuzzy set theory and probability statistics. When complex mechanical system is running, the signals are random and uncertain. So the cloud model adapts to complex mechanical system. But in the fault diagnosis, the three characteristics of cloud model cannot re fl ect the fault features. Uncertainty problem still exists in the arti fi diagnosis method. In this paper, an immune cloud model is proposed to solve the uncertainty problem. The cloud model proposed is improved to adapting to the quantum arti fi cial immune clustering algorithm.

In a quantum process all transitions of the neurons must be designated by unitary operators. Hence, in place of the fi a neuron, we have a less spectacular unitary transformation that simply performs a rotation of the state vector or the qubit. The need for a phase change during fl ipping is for unitarity, as can be seen easily when real coef fi cients are used for the qubit super-position. The control and target bits of the quantum can be shown by the following: j c  X   X  a j 0  X   X  b j 1  X  and j t  X   X  c j 0  X   X  d j 1  X   X  20  X 
A Q-bit individual as a string of n Q-bits in the C-FHQAI algorithm is de fi ned as follows: a b "#
C-FHQAI algorithm is shown by the following: j a j 2  X j b j 2  X  1 and j c j 2  X j d j 2  X  1  X  22  X  j c 0  X   X j c  X  and j t 0  X   X  X  ac  X  bd  X j 0  X   X  X  ad bc  X j 1  X  algorithm include the information of eight states such as , j 001  X  , j 010  X  , j 011  X  , j 100  X  , j 101  X  , j 110  X  drawn as a conclusion that the evolutionary computing with Q-bit representation has a better characteristic of population diversity than other representations. Another interesting aspect of a quan-tum gated machine is that it is potentially closer to biological systems than the present electronic machines, because quantum gates acting on photon nodes may have connectivity with the nodes that is unattainable in electronic devices that have only one or two inputs and outputs. The operation of the C-FHQAI algo-rithm should involve time too and can be expressed as j t  X   X  U  X  t ; t 0  X j 0  X   X  24  X  as the following: U  X  t  X  d t ; t  X  X  U  X  t ; t 0  X  X  id t H  X  25

In this paper, we introduce the concept of information entropy and improve and integrate the fusion quantum evolu-tionary based on information entropy in the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm. In the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm, the antibody is encoded according to the phase and uncertain information is measured by information entropy accurately. We propose a neighborhood search strategy by descending order of population entropy.
 mechanical system fault diagnosis and accuracy of the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm, we introduce skewness and kurtosis (SK) into the cloud model. The SK represents the asymmetry degree of the practical distribution's center relative to ideal distribution's center. The numerical calculations of SK can be calculated as the following:
SK  X 
When SK Z 0, it means the practical distribution moves to the right relative to ideal distribution. When SK r 0, it means the practical distribution moves to the left relative to ideal distribu-tion. Kurtosis Ku (KK) represents the convex pingdu of sample's density function. The numerical calculations of KK can be calcu-lated as the following:
KK  X  1 n  X  n
Then the immune cloud model has fi ve characteristic values and can be denoted with vector  X  Ex ; En ; He ; SK ; KK  X  apply the cloud model work well for a large scale and multi-class data sets clustering, SK and KK are introduced into the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm based on cloud model. 5. Numerical example
The quantum clustering algorithm suffers from the issues of getting stuck in local extremes and computational bottleneck when handling large-size image segmentation. By embedding a potential evolution formula into af fi nity function calculation of multi-objection immune clonal optimization, the C-FHQAI cluster-ing algorithm is proposed updating the cluster center based on the distance matrix. In the proposed framework in the paper, elitist population is composed of individuals with high af fi nity who are considered to play dominant roles in the evolutionary clustering process. The diversity of population can be well maintained by general subgroup evolution of the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm.
We interestingly fi nd that the results of C-FHQAI algorithm performance by these functions such as Rastrigin, Griewank, Rosenbrock, Ackley, bubbles_dyn, and dropwavefcn are shown in
Figs. 4  X  9 correspondingly.
These different functions are implemented by the dissimilar mutation strategies or crossover operators. The bi-group exch-anges the information of excellence antibodies using the hyper-cube co-evolution operation. Compared with existing clustering algorithms, the multi-objection C-FHQAI clustering algorithm achieves an improved clustering accuracy with more stable con-tion clustering techniques combined with the quantum clustering algorithm. Cloud model uses three n umerical characteristics, namely Ex (expectation), En (entropy) and He (hyper entropy), to depict the intension of a concept which provides a way to simulate the optimization process. Complement ary mutation strategies provide guarantee for the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm that maintains the population diversity and speeds up the convergence speed and improves stability. It can help to fi nd the global optimal solution and near-optimal solution for most tested tasks. Simulation experi-ments for standard numerical optimization problems show that the proposed algorithm has better search capability, higher search precision and better stability.

We fi nd out interesting things that the experimental results also show that our clustering algorithm performs well on multi-class, parameters-sensitive and large-size datasets. Based on the data analysis and numerical simulation, we interestingly fi multi-class parameters-sensitive result of the C-FHQAI algorithm is as shown in Fig. 10 .

The feasibility and effectiveness of this algorithm are testi by comparing with random on clustering effect. We get the corresponding dynamic cluster result by the C-FHQAI algorithm as shown in Fig. 11 .We fi nd that experimental results demonstrate the improved algorithm can enhance the clustering performance and the clustering accuracy of the C-FHQAI algorithm.
According to different thresholds of groups, we get the corre-sponding dynamic cluster result by the C-FHQAI clustering algo-rithm as shown in Fig. 12 .

The quantum immune algorithm is speci fi cally applied to clustering, and is proved by experiment; the quantum immune algorithm based on clustering algorithm in some aspects of the classi fi cation performance is superior to other common clustering algorithms. Most of the existing clustering algorithms (k-means, FCM and its variants) will not work well for a large scale, multi-class data sets. The C-FHQAI clustering algorithm achieves an improved clustering accuracy with more stable convergence based on cloud model. At last, the feasibility and effectiveness of the C-
FHQAI clustering algorithm is testi fi ed by us with iris data on clustering effect as shown in Fig. 13 .

The comparative experiments validate the proposed algorithm based on the cloud model and prove that it is good for the images with both bimodal and multimodal histograms. The future research will focus on expanding the proposed algorithm to color image segmentation and multispectral remote sensing image classi fi cation.

Feature selection is an effective algorithm for reducing the size of text feature space. So far, some effective methods for feature selection have been developed. For the purpose of acquiring the optimal number of features, these methods mainly depend on observation or experience. In this paper, by combining the performance algorithm for feature automation selection (FAS) is proposed. By using FAS, the feature set can be obtained auto-matically. Besides, it can effectively amend the distribution of features by using cloud model theory. Analysis and open experi-mental results show the selected feature set has fewer features and better classi fi cation performance than the existing methods.
The usual quantum arti fi cial immune Algorithm (QAI) is better than the quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) in global searching abilities, overcoming the problem of early-ripeness in function optimization. However, previous research demonstrates that when applying QAI to combination optimization problems, it is incom-petent of searching the best solution, slow of the processing speed of convergence and the solutions may fl uctuate in a large scope.
A novel fuzzy hybrid quantum arti fi cial immune clustering algo-rithm based on cloud model (C-FHQAI) is proposed and inspired by the biology immunity mechanism. It makes use of not only cellular hyper mutation but also receptor editing operation to realize af fi nity mature that will lead to the best match between the antibody and the antigen, meanwhile a memory cell of the best individual descended is added to the mechanism to avoid population devolution. Aimed at the solution kidnap problems, the algorithm combines greedy strategy with an extended boundary to complete the receptor editing operation of each generation antibodies population. The experimental results are shown in
Table 1 . improve the population quality and search for the best solution robustness is better than QAI and QGA. The C-FHQAI algorithm proposed in this paper has more effective advantages than the other two algorithms in terms of accuracy, solution of the overall effectiveness, and the number of iterations of the algorithms. sonal uncertainties about collecting data clustering from a group of individuals. The experimental results show that our proposed method model may be a suitable model for large-size data clustering. ing algorithms for the arti fi cial synthetic data set and several image data sets, including the synthetic Iris images and the Glass images, and encouraging experimental results are obtained. As described above, the data is given in two pieces: the training set (the fi rst 75%) and the test set (the last 25%). The results of the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm for the problems are given in
C-FHQAI clustering algorithms outperform whereas the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm's result is better than that of the other algorithms only for one problem (the glass problem) in terms of classi fi cation error. Moreover, the average classi fi cation error percentages for all problems are 13.13% for the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm and 15.99% for the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm.
Average classi fi cation error percentages experimental results of the other clustering algorithms (S-PSO, Bayes, Ann, RBF, Star, Bagging, Boost and Tree) are as shown in Table 2 .

In summary, by the embedding of potential evolution formula the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm has solved the sensitivity problem to scale parameter by the designing effective immune operators and the mechanism of cluster center updating. It has solved the problems of slow iteration and local extreme by computing the minimum of potential function based on the distance matrix and the single antibody evolution. The C-FHQAI clustering algorithm has also solved the problem of large-scale data processing bottleneck, although it is not necessarily better than other optimization techniques combined with QC. In detail, if the sample size is less than 100,000, the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm is implemented, or else the QC clustering algorithm is done. The experimental results on UCI standard datasets have shown the good performance of the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm. The segmentation results on arti fi cial synthetics texture images and medical images indicated that the C-FHQAI algorithm is applicable to large-size data.

Firstly, in our proposed algorithm, the collected data intervals are preprocessed to remove the bad ones. Secondly, the fuzzy statistical method is used to compute the histogram of the surviving intervals. Then, the generated histogram is fi tted by a the parameters of a Cloud model to obtain the parametric of the clustering algorithm. We generate arti fi cial datasets to validate proposed algorithm for multi-class datasets clustering perfor-mance. The experimental results are as shown in Table 3 .
The experimental results show that our proposed clustering algorithm based on cloud model is not only much thinner but can also capture suf fi cient uncertainties. And it is obvious that expected value re fl ects the stability of mutation, Entropy re the span of mutation and Hyper-entropy re fl ects the accuracy of mutation which can enhance the process of evolution and get rid of the local extremes. Cloud model represents both interpersonal and intrapersonal uncertainties about collecting word data from a group of individuals.

The results of the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm show that the algorithm achieves a fast speed in convergence and accuracy in solution. Based on cloud model which makes good balance between randomness and fuzziness, a quantum adaptive immune clone algorithm is proposed. The quantum rotate gate, a key operator of quantum evolutionary algorithm for optimization and mutation operation, is used instead of cloud operators.
Dynamic adjustment of searching range in evolutionary process the algorithm have strong ability in global search. In the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm, we simply apply the mechanism of cluster center updating with a property of quantum clustering which could in fl uence the clustering results. More robust cluster center updating methods and af fi nity function designing methods could also further improve quantum clustering. In the C-FHQAI cluster-ing algorithm, the cluster center is updated by introducing one step iterative operator and substituting the Euclidean distance for density-sensitive distance measure to search for the cluster centers of data with manifold structure. Besides, it is also worthy to study effectively preventing premature construction with more appropriate communication and collaboration strategy among multi-elitist populations. 6. Conclusion
The hybrid clustering algorithms are applied in several fi such as statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining which are to partition a given set of data or objects into 0 0.5 1 0 5 0 0.5 1 0 2 4 0 0.5 1 0 2 4 0 0.5 1 0 1 2 0 0.5 1 0 1 2 objects and character recognition and document retrieval. The hybrid clustering algorithms problems are the kind of important optimization problems in our real life which are dif fi cult to satisfying solution within a limited time. According to these studies, there are many different kinds of clustering algorithms which can be applied. In addition, it is critical to have a suitable algorithm for the effectiveness of a clustering method. In this paper, we have developed the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm. A large scale dataset may have great number of samples and large number of clusters as well. The C-FHQAI clustering algorithm can avoid getting a local optimal value and improve the stability of algorithm.

Based on cloud model, which makes good balance between randomness and fuzziness, the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm is proposed. The quantum rotate gate, a key operator of the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm for optimization and mutation operation, is instated by cloud operators. Dynamic adjustment of searching range in evolutionary process of the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm these reasons, which make the algorithm have strong ability in global search and make algorithm avoid falling into local optimum effectively. Simulation experiments for standard numerical opti-mization problems show that the proposed algorithm has better search capability, higher search precision and better stability with high accuracy and good performance. The results from various simulations using arti fi cial data sets show that the proposed hybrid clustering algorithms have better performance than other clustering algorithms such as GA, PSO and ACO. Through several experiments, better clustering results can be found by hybrid clustering algorithm than the corresponding dynamic clustering algorithm.

These experiments show that the hybrid clustering algorithm based on similarity is better than conventional clustering method in terms of calculating complexity and clustering effect. In this work we have given the full description of implementations details of the hybrid algorithms to improve its performance. We have tested the proposed C-FHQAI clustering algorithms in differ-ent synthetic and real clustering problems, obtaining very good results that improve classical approaches. So it is very important to do our research on hybrid clustering algorithms. In addition to the extension of the application domain, our future studies can investigate the hybrid clustering algorithms to improve its cluster-ing solution quality.
