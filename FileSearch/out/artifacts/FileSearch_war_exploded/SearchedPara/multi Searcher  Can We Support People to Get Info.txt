 The goal of the proposed tool multi Searcher is to answer this research question: can we expect people to be able to get information from text in languages they can not read or un-derstand? The proposed tool multi Searcher provides users with interactive contextual information that describes the translation in the user X  X  own language so that the user has a certain degree of confidence about the translation. There-fore, the user is considered as an integral part of the retrieval process. The tool provides possibilities to interactively se-lect relevant terms from contextual information in order to improve the translation and thus improve the cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR) process.

The increasing diversity of internet web sites has created millions of multilingual resources in the World Wide Web. Therefore, there is an urgent need to bridge barriers be-tween languages in order to access this flood of multilin-gual information. In the past little attention was paid to develop multilingual interaction tools where users are re-ally considered as an integral part of the retrieval process. However, the involvement of the user in CLIR systems by reviewing and amending the query had been studied, e.g., using Keizai [4], Mulinex [1] and recently MIRACLE [3]. These interfaces provide query translation from the source language into the target languages using bilingual dictionar-ies. Furthermore, they use a sort of  X  X uery assistant X , which enables interactive disambiguation of the query translation process: supporting the user in selecting the correct trans-lations out of a list of possible translations. In Mulinex the mated by counting the number of individual occurrences of each possible translated q uery term in the corpora.
When the user query is translated, it is looked up in the target language documents index in order to obtain the rel-evant documents (contextual information) for the transla-tion. In order to get the equivalent documents in the source language the parallel corpora is queried. Since it is pos-sible that some retrieved documents will be very similar  X  which would result in duplicate contextual information  X  the documents retrieved from the source language are automat-ically grouped and contextual information is selected only once from each cluster. As shown in Fig. 1, the finally selected contextual information is not provided to the user as raw text, but instead a classified representation of each contextual information term will be presented: each term of the contextual information is colored according to its re-lated type and can be selected as disambiguating term (the user X  X  query terms green, suggested terms by the tool based on high frequent co-occurrences in the context of the query bold blue and underlined, all remaining terms blue except stop words that are not selectable and black). For exam-ple, consider the following case where the user submitted the Arabic query  X  dyen alh . kwmh  X . T h e q u e r y term  X  alh . kwmh  X  has two translations (the govern-ment or the administration), while the other term  X  dyen  X  has several possible translations .e.g. (Religion) or (Debt). Based on the MI score translation alternatives are displayed in ranked order together with their contextual information. Thus the user has the possibility to select the suitable trans-lation. Here, the translations provided by the system (the government religion) and (the government debt) are correct even though they are used in a different context. This is due to the fact that (government) appears frequently in the context of  X  X eligion X  or  X  X ebt X . As shown in Fig. 1, the user is interested in the second ranked translation (debt government). Using the contextual information, the user can select one or more terms to i mprove the translation. To simplify the user X  X  task, the tool automatically proposed rel-evant terms (highlighted in bold blue and underlined), .e.g., ( X  X ayment X ,  X  X inancial X ,  X  X ending X ,  X  X oan X ). Once the user selects, for example, the interactive term  X  or lending), the tool re-translates the modified query and displays the new translations ( X  X ebt government loan X ,  X  X ebt government lending X  and  X  X ebt administration loan X ), to the user. Using search engine integrated web services, the user can, with a simple mouse click, confirm the translation which will then be sent to his favorite search engine, retrieving the results and displaying them.
We selected randomly 20 Arabi c queries from the corpora that included at least one ambiguous word having multiple translations. The number of senses per test word ranged from 1 to 14, and the average was 4.3. The number of query translation combinations ranged from 4 to 200 with the av-erage being 29.1. In order to evaluate the performance of the tool, we used two measurements: applicability and pre-cision. The applicability is the proportion of the ambiguous words that the algorithm could disambiguate. The precision is the proportion of the correct ed disambiguated senses of
