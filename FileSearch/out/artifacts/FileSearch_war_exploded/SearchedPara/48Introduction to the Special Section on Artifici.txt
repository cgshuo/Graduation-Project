 Space exploration poses a number of challenges for software and hardware systems including extreme environments, challenging measurement and sensing problems, re-quirements for high reliability due to high mission costs and human involvement, and the need for autonomy in spacecraft. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence has much to offer in many areas of space exploration.

This special section covers a range of uses for intelligent systems for space-related activities ranging from decision support fo r space systems operations on the Interna-tional Space Station (which appeared in an earlier volume), data mining to support scientific analysis of remotely sensed data for Martian geology, autonomous targeting of science instruments for the Mars Exploration Rovers, and unsupervised learning to enable summarization of remotely sensed data for future missions such as an Aerobot to Titan. The broad array of applications of AI to space systems and space science provides a hint of the breadth and depth of this fertile area for work.
 In  X  X lanning Solar Array Operations on the International Space Station, X  Sudhakar Reddy, Jeremy Frank, Michael Iaturo, Matthew Boyce, Elif Kurklu, Mitchell Ai-Chang, and Ari Jonsson, describe the Solar Arra y Constraint Engine (SACE), a system to provide decision support and situational awareness to plan solar array configurations for the International Space Station (ISS). SACE uses the EUROPA planning system (also used for Mars Exploration Rovers operations), demonstrating NASA X  X  reuse and evolution of general planning and scheduling systems. The solar array application highlights some of the complex operations problems posed by space mission operations including complex operations flows (such as the handoff of operations of the ISS be-tween control centers), complex geometric c onstraints, and decision support rather than completely autonomous planning. This article appeared earlier in Volume 2 Issue 4, July 2011.

In  X  X ynamic Landmarking for Surface Feature Identification and Change Detec-tion, X  Kiri Wagstaff, Julian Panetta, Adnan Ansar, Ronald Greeley, Mary Hoffer, Melissa Bunte, and Norbert Sch  X  orghofer describe methods for automatically analyz-ing images to detect and track changes in surface features as applied to Mars imagery analysis. In their approach, landmark features are automatically extracted and com-pared to reveal when/if/how surface features related to wind, impact, or even surface liquids evolve, appear, and/or disappear over time. This work highlights the challenges of working with extremely large datasets (e.g. Mars imagery) and complex physical phenomenology. The developed techniques offer great promise in assisting scientific teams in understanding key physical factors influencing the surface of Mars.
In  X  X EGIS Automated Targeting for the MER Opportunity Rover, X  Tara Estlin, Ben-jamin Bornstein, Daniel Gaines, Robert C. Anderson, David R. Thompson, Michael Burl, Rebecca Castano, and Michele Judd de scribe software that allows the MER Op-portunity rover to automatically retarget instruments based on autonomous onboard analysis of wide field-of-view imagery. This software represents a dramatic step for-ward in enabling scientist inputs to select high-quality science targets without a hu-man in the loop. This software has been in use since late 2009 and has been named the 2011 winner for the NASA Software of the Year competition.
 In  X  X sing Clustering and Metric Learning to Improve Science Return of Remote Sensed Imagery, X  David S. Hayden, Steve Chien, David R. Thompson, and Rebecca Castano, investigate the use of unsupervised learning methods to select a representa-tive sub-sampling of data to downlink when the entire data set is too large for down-link. In this work, acquired imagery is clus tered based on general features such as edge density and intensity histograms. Comparison of machine-derived clusters to scientist-derived clusters shows significant similarity, showing the promise of these automated approaches fo r image summarization.

We hope that the readers will find these articles helpful in learning more about the cutting edge of intelligent systems research for space problems. We thank the many authors who submitted articles as well as the many reviewers whose significant effort enabled the selection and improvement of these articles. We would also like to thank Qiang Yang for his assistance in handling reviews in cases of conflict of interest. Be-cause of the large amount of work in the area of intelligent systems for space, we hope to produce a second special issue shortly.
