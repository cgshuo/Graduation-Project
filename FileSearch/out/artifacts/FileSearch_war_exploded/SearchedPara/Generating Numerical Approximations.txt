We describe a computational model for planning phrases like  X  X ore than a quarter X  and  X 25.9 choices in planning a numerical description, using formal definitions of mathematical form (e.g., the distinction between fractions and percentages) and roundness adapted from earlier 1. Introduction
We describe in this article a computational model for planning phrases that express proportions (e.g.,  X  X ore than a quarter X  and  X 25.9 percent, X  among others, as alternative descriptions of the proportion 0.259). This task is of interest for several reasons. First, such expressions are very common in factual discourse X  X hey will be found on almost any page in a newspaper or scientific journal. Second, any numerical value can be expressed in a variety of ways, differing along such dimensions as precision, formality, and mathematical sophistication; generating the range of suitable phrases is therefore non-trivial. Third, the matter has been largely ignored in the literature on Natural
Language Generation (NLG), even though many NLG systems are designed to produce text from numerical data in domains like weather forecasting (Reiter et al. 2005), stock market trends, 2 and medical records (Hallett, Scott, and Power 2007). Finally, and more subtly, the task provides a convenient microcosm of the general pragmatic problem of determining optimal information content X  X or instance, of balancing preferences for precision and brevity (Krifka 2002).
 N
UM G EN corpus of numerical expressions drawn from families of texts describing the same facts . Because the same quantitative fact is mentioned within and across multiple texts, the corpus provides many examples of linguistic expressions that describe exactly the same quantity. For instance, the following excerpt from an article in the UK news-paper The Daily Telegraph contains several expressions representing proportions, includ-ing the two phrases given as examples in the opening sentence of this article (and shown here in italics), both of which describe the proportion of A-level papers the top grade (A) in 2008:
The N UM G EN corpus contains 14 articles reporting this story, mostly from UK news-papers; in total, it has nearly 100 articles covering ten stories. The numerical facts found in the corpus include cardinalities (e.g.,  X 300,000 students X ) and measures ( X 28 years X ) as well as proportions, but the project focused on proportions as a convenient subset. ferent locations within a document (Williams and Power 2009). The phrases  X  X ore than a quarter X  and  X 25.9 percent X  in the example extract provide a convenient illustration of the nature of these differences. First, there is an obvious disparity in precision . Next, the phrases differ in mathematical form (fraction vs. percentage); we have argued that this distinction is conceptual as well as notational, because fractions are accessible to a wider readership than percentages X  X s testified by the levels at which they are introduced in the UK mathematics curriculum (Qualification and Curriculum Authority 1999).
Finally, one of the phrases contains not only a quantity ( X  X  quarter X ) but a modifier ( X  X ore than X ); such modifiers have been called hedges (Lakoff 1973; Crystal 1988), and they serve (among other things) to indicate the arithmetical relationship between the quantity that follows and the actual value (0 . 259 &gt; 1 / 4). Our corpus study showed that fractions and round numbers tend to occur in the opening of a document, whereas subsequent references to the same fact are more likely to use precise percentages. motivation (why do speakers/writers approximate?), the other concerning technique (how do they approximate?). On the first point, various motives have been proposed.
Speakers might aim at conceptual simplicity (Krifka 2007) X  X or example, because round numbers are easier to remember and calculate with; or they might wish for various rea-sons to avoid commitment (van Deemter 2009). Also, as implied by Grice X  X  (1975) qual-ity and quantity maxims, the benefits of precision need to be balanced against the costs; this trade-off has been discussed within the framework of optimality theory (Dekker 114 and van Rooy 2000; Krifka 2002; Blutner and Zeevat 2011). Little attention has been paid, however, to the second question X  X egarding the technique of approximation X  X espite its intrinsic interest and its practical importance in applications of NLG.
 produce numerical expressions with varying degrees of precision and formality. We propose a two-stage generation process, the first stage producing a language-neutral semantic form such as &gt; 1 / 4, the second stage realizing this semantic form in English or some other natural language (e.g.,  X  X ver a quarter X ,  X  X ore than 1/4 X ). Our model considers the first stage only, and aims to generate the set of alternative semantic forms underlying acceptable numerical expressions. Choosing the most appropriate alternative from this set would depend on the pragmatic context; here, for generality, the model identifies a number of criteria (roundness, accuracy, etc.) but leaves open how they should be weighted (or otherwise combined). 4 ous linguistic and philosophical work on numerical expressions and approximation.
Section 3 adapts some important insights from this literature to propose a new formal model for planning the semantic forms of proportion expressions; we then describe an implementation of this model in Section 4, followed by an empirical evaluation in
Section 5. Section 6 discusses the outcome of the evaluation, and concludes. 2. Previous Work 2.1 Linguistic Background
Mathematically, a proportion is the cardinality of a set divided by the cardinality of a superset. If S is a set, its cardinality C S is defined as the number of elements that S C / C SS is a proportion. From this it follows that a proportion must lie between 0.0 and 1.0, because it will have its minimum value when S is empty, and its maximum value when S is identical to SS . Typically, S and SS can be identified by descriptions, with S distinguished by an extra attribute. Thus in our A-level example, SS is the set of A-level papers marked in 2008, and S is the subset of these papers that received an A grade. To calculate the proportion 25.9%, somebody or something (probably a computer program) must have counted the total number of papers, then counted those distinguished by an A-grade, then divided the latter number by the former.
 phrases, in constructions of the form PofNs where N is a noun. Both mentions of the A-grade proportion in our sample text fit this pattern:
In general, such expressions comprise a numerical value, optionally preceded by a hedge . It is important to note that the numerical value in the expression may differ from the actual value of the proportion, just as a place can be described with reference to a convenient (but different) landmark (e.g.,  X  X eyond the church X ). For this reason we will introduce the term given value for the numerical value found in the quantifying expression. To understand the expression, a reader must infer the relationship between the given value (call it V G ) and the actual value ( V A the hedge; thus in  X  X ore than a quarter X  the hedge  X  X ore than X  indicates that V where V G = 1 / 4. Another clue, it has been argued, is provided by the given value itself, because round numbers are likely to be interpreted as approximations (Krifka 2002).
Thus in  X  X  quarter of papers were marked A X  the given value is a simple fraction, suggesting that V G has been selected by the writer as a round number conveniently near V A , and that the relationship is accordingly V A  X  merical descriptions by Dubois (1987), who studied imprecision in oral scientific presen-tations and listed some common numerical hedges (e.g.,  X  X bout X ,  X  X lmost X ,  X  X early X ,  X  X f the order of X ,  X  X  little over X ); Crystal (1988) added a few more. Because Crystal applied the term to any expression indicating imprecision or uncertainty, he included some terms like  X  X aybe X ,  X  X sually X ,  X  X robably X , which are not relevant here. However, restricting the field to numerical hedges, all Dubois X  X  examples concern the relationship between given value and actual value, and in particular V corpus, the most common hedge was  X  X ore than X  (expressing V  X  X bout X  ( V A  X  V G ),  X  X nder X  ( V A &lt; V G ),  X  X lmost X , and  X  X early X . corpus, the modifier  X  X xactly X  was also counted as a hedge, even though its purpose is to confirm rather than to disclaim a precise commitment, since in common with the other hedges it indicates a relationship between a given and an actual value ( V of the given value itself? From preliminary analysis of the N basic forms for proportion values were identified, and used subsequently for mark-up: fractions, percentages, and ratios. Fractions almost invariably had simple denominators (2, 3 or 4) and were expressed in words rather than digits (e.g.,  X  X wo-thirds X  rather than  X 2/3 X ). Percentages were by contrast expressed almost always in digits X  X 25 percent X  (or  X 25% X ) rather than  X  X wenty-five percent X ; the numerical part was often a decimal, usually with just one digit after the point. Ratios were sometimes used as an alternative to fractions (e.g.,  X  X ne in four students obtained an A grade X ), but with more freedom in choosing denominators, which were sometimes large or non-round numbers ( X  X oughly one in 17 Britons X ); because they were relatively rare, they are not included in the model presented here. 6 form, because the underlying quantities are always expressible as rational numbers (i.e., Num / Den where numerator Num and denominator Den are both integers). We have several reasons for treating mathematical form as a deeper conceptual distinc-tion, however. 7 Firstly, as we will show later, fractions and percentages typically have denominators from different sets X  X ow integers for fractions, powers of ten and related 116 integers for percentages. They also represent distinguishable levels of numerical compe-tence, as evidenced by the UK mathematics curriculum (Qualification and Curriculum
Authority 1999) in which percentages are introduced later than fractions and depend conceptually upon them. Finally, judgments of roundness can only be made relative to a given mathematical form: thus in fractions 1/3 is rounder than 3/10, whereas in percentages 33.33% is less round than 30%. This means that any program planning to describe a proportion V A by relating it to a round number V of mathematical form in selecting V G . 2.2 Roundness
It is a matter of common observation that some numbers are perceived as rounder than others, and hence more likely to be employed in approximations. You might approximate 0.259 by saying  X  X bout a quarter X , but you would never approximate 0.25 by saying  X  X bout 25.9 percent. X  But what exactly is meant by roundness ? Linguists and psychologists have approached this question in various ways.
 distinguished according to the roles they can play in verbal numerals. A few privileged numbers can serve as multiplicands: In English and most European numeral systems these would include 100, 1000, 1000000, and also perhaps 10 if we take account of word morphology (i.e., if we think of  X  X orty X  as meaning 4  X  10). An important (although less exalted) set can be named by forming a product with one of the multiplicands (e.g.,  X  X wenty X ,  X  X wo hundred X ). Finally, at the bottom of the heap, we find the numbers typically named as the sum of a product and another (smaller) number: thus  X  X ixty five X  is the sum of 60 and 5, or  X  X hree hundred sixty five X  is 300 + 65.
 (1996), on the basis of empirical evidence including number frequencies, currency sys-tems, and approximations of the form  X 30 or 35 people. X  At the top level of roundness are  X  X avorite numbers, X  defined thus:
With a numerical system based on 10, this definition yields the set F (10) defined as follows:
Note that this definition allows n to take negative values, or zero; hence 0.05 is also classified as a favorite number because it can be formed by f = 10 as notes for  X 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and so forth. In a survey of currencies from 84 countries (Pollmann and Jansen 1996), only 13 out of about 1,000 coins/notes lay outside F (10) (e.g., a three-dollar banknote in the Cook Islands). Frequency data also support the principle: Using a corpus of Dutch newspaper articles, Jansen and Pollmann (2001) found spikes (local maxima) in the frequency plot for numbers belonging to F (10) (thus 10 was more common than 9 or 11). From experiments on phrases like  X 30 or 35 people, X  they also arrived at a wider group of round numbers (termed  X  X equences X ), formed by multiplying any favorite number F by a low integer M with values in the range M * F of the favorite number 5.
 of different granularity , as suggested for example by Krifka (2007). A scale is defined as a set of evenly spaced points, so that consecutive points are always separated by a unit distance d  X  X t is equivalent, in other words, to Pollmann and Jansen X  X  concept of  X  X equence. X  However, scales can be organized into systems of varying granularity, so that for example in the metric system for measuring length we have meters, decimeters, centimeters, millimeters, and so forth, with granularity increasing tenfold from each scale to the next. Less obviously, we can think of the minutes in an hour as belonging to the following four scales, in which the units are respectively one hour, half an hour, a quarter of an hour, and five minutes (example from Krifka 2007): 0---------------------------------60----------------------...--120 0---------------30----------------60----------------90----...--120 0------15-------30-------45-------60-------75-------90----...--120 0-5-10-15-20-25-30-35-40-45-50-55-60-65-70-75-80-85-90-95-...--120
The roundness of a number, relative to a scale system, can then be equated with the coarsest-grained scale to which it belongs (i.e., the earliest scale, if they are arranged in order of increasing granularity). Thus in this scale system 45 is rounder than 40, although in most systems (e.g., metric distance) 40 would be rounder than 45. 3. Formal Model for Proportions
We have reviewed some insights from the literature on hedging, mathematical form, and roundness; we now aim to draw these together into a formal model that can be implemented and evaluated.
 indeed other quantities) are expressed by relating them to another, typically different quantity that we have called the given value V G , with the hedge (if present) indicating the nature of this relationship. Thus in expressing the proportion 0.259 by  X  X ver a quarter, X  we have an actual value V A (0.259), a given value V V &gt; V G . This leads to the idea that underlying any numerical expression there will be some kind of arithmetical relationship between V A and V the expression can therefore be divided into two stages: (a) choosing an appropriate semantic relationship such as V A &gt; 1 / 4or V A  X  26 / 100; (b) choosing an appropriate linguistic realization of this relationship, such as  X  X ver a quarter X  or  X  X bout 26 percent. X  that given numbers can be conceptualized as points along scales, of varying granularity, organized into systems. This is obvious in Krifka X  X  (2007) example of time measures, and also for distance measures where we are familiar with different systems such as imperial units (inches, feet, yards, etc.) and metric units (centimeters, meters), but it can be applied also to representing proportions. Adopting the simplest and most direct approach, we can measure proportions on scales that divide the interval from 0.0 to 1.0 into N equal segments, where N is an integer greater than 1. A scale system can then be defined as a set of scales ordered by increasing granularity (and hence increasing
N ). Thus if we denote a scale with N segments by S N , an example of a scale system 118
To specify a given value V G we must choose (a) a system, (b) a scale from the system, and (c) a point from the scale X  X he points on a scale S N being represented by integers from0to N .
 degrees of roundness, but also different mathematical forms, which can be equated with scale systems. Thus the system including [ S 10 , S 100 , S cal form percentages , whereas simple fractions use instead a system with very low values that simple fractions are rounder than percentages, and that within any scale system, earlier scales are rounder than later ones. For instance, within the percentage system, 40% would be considered rounder than 45%, because it first appears on the S whereas 45% first appears on S 100 .
 result of four choices, each from a finite domain of options. Thus to obtain the semantic form for  X  X ver a quarter, X  starting from V would choose (1) the relation &gt; , (2) the scale system [ S cent, X  the choices would be (1) the relation  X  , (2) the scale system [ S (percentages), (3) the scale S 100 , and (4) the point 26. 3.1 Scale Systems
We have described the outline of a model for planning proportion expressions; to im-plement this model in an actual generator, we need to make specific assumptions about the scale systems to be employed. We have suggested earlier that there are two major scale systems for proportions, corresponding to fractions and percentages, the former preliminary test of this idea, we have taken all V G values for fractions and percentages in the N UM G EN corpus, and re-expressed them as rational numbers of the form Num / Den , reduced to their minimal terms so that numerator Num and denominator Den have no common factor, and counted the frequencies of all denominators. show a clear difference in the two distributions, with fractions having denominators in the range 2 X 4 (apart from a couple of outliers), and percentages spread more widely, with peaks in powers of 10 or their multiples. for fractions and percentages, the system for fractions being simply [ S percentages, we need to decide (a) how far to extend the granularity (e.g., whether to to include S 20 , which would cover percentages divisible by 5, such as 5% and 15%).
For practical convenience in presenting and testing the model, we have decided to limit granularity to S 1000 , so that we cover, for instance, 25.9% but not 25.95%. Regarding intermediate scales, Table 1 provides support for S 20 but even stronger support for S which would yield percentages like 16% divisible by 4 rather than 5. This result could also be due to bias in our (fairly small) corpus, however; searching for phrases of the form  X  X  percent X  in the Google Labs Ngram Viewer 10 showed a clear preponderance of percentages divisible by 5 compared with neighbors divisible by 4 (Table 2). We therefore begin by limiting the scale system for percentages to [ S that is, powers of ten up to 1,000 with a single intermediate scale for percentages divisible by 5. 3.2 Imposing Constraints
Having specified two scale systems and a set of arithmetical relations ( = , can generate a large (but finite) set of semantic forms, most of which will of course be unsuitable for describing any particular input proportion such as 0.259. To narrow these down, we need to impose constraints which can be separated into three categories: (1) Is the description true? (2) Is the description competent? (3) Is the description appropriate, given the context and the speaker X  X  goals? 120 ship asserted between V A and V G actually holds. Thus for V V
A &gt; 26 / 100 (choosing the 26th point along the S 100 scale from the percentage scale system, with the relation &gt; ) should be rejected as untrue, because the actual value 0.259 is less than the given value 26/100, not greater.
 we have called  X  X ompetence. X  By this we mean that a solution should be excluded if another solution is superior in all contexts . Consider, for example, the solution V (again for the input V A = 0 . 259), in which V G is represented by the fourth point along the S 10 percentage scale. As a method for approximating 0.259 we would argue that this is incompetent, because using the same arithmetical relation &lt; and the same scale S a closer approximation could have been obtained by choosing the third point instead of the fourth. Of course the generator could get even closer by choosing, for instance, V are competent.
 the semantic form that is most appropriate pragmatically. Here many factors come into play, some of which have been mentioned previously (e.g., technical sophistication of the reader/hearer, ease of comprehension, utilities of different levels of precision, eval-uation of the proportion as higher or lower than expected). We have not included such factors in the model described and evaluated in this article, but it is worth commenting briefly on how this could be done, through optimization methods typical of constraint-based applications.
 cost with each solution, so that the set of true and competent solutions can be ranked from most to least appropriate. Plausibly, this function would measure various features of the solution, including mathematical difficulty, emphasis, roundness, and accuracy, and combine them through a weighted sum, with weights reflecting the contextual revelance of the features. Thus, for contexts in which readers lack mathematical so-phistication, solutions using the percentage scale system should incur extra cost; if the writer X  X  aim is to emphasize that the actual value is higher than expected, solutions using the arithmetical relation &lt; should be penalized; where small differences in the actual value have important practical consequences, accuracy should receive a higher weighting than roundness; and so forth. 4. Implementation of the Generator
The input to the generator is a proportion, specified as a real number between 0.0 and 1.0 correct to three places of decimals; the output is a set of alternative semantic forms describing the proportion, where each semantic form is constructed by making four choices from finite domains: (1) a scale system, (2) a scale from this system, (3) a point from this scale, and (4) an arithmetical relation. To implement a generator of this kind, it is convenient to formulate the task as a constraint satisfaction problem, which is characterized by the following components (van Hentenryck 1989):
A solution assigns to each variable V i a specific value from its domain D respecting all constraints. In implementations using Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), programs typically have a three-part structure: first, the domains of the variables are initialized; secondly, constraints over the variables are imposed; finally, values for the variables are chosen X  X  process sometimes called  X  X abeling. X  The labeling stage introduces backtracking points whenever a variable can take one of several values, so that multiple solutions can be generated if desired (and if they exist). However, by using the constraints before labeling in order to reduce the domains of the vari-ables, CLP can achieve substantial efficiency gains over algorithms that rely on generate-and-test, and has been used successfully for a variety of NLP tasks (Koller and Niehren 2000). 4.1 Assigning Domains to Solution Variables
Any solution is defined by four variables which we will call System , Scale , Point ,and Re-lation . For two of these variables, domains can be assigned during initialization: System must belong to { Fraction , Percentage } and Relation to { ables, the domain can be assigned only during the search phase, because it depends on the values of other variables. For instance, the domain of Scale can be set to as soon as System receives the value Fraction , or alternatively to
System receives instead the value Percentage . Similarly, the domain of Point can be set only when a value of Scale has been chosen X  X n general, if Scale has the value S should have the domain 0 ... N . 4.2 Constraints
Having initialized the domains of the variables (where possible), the program next applies five constraints which rule out solutions that are ill-formed (i.e., outside our scale systems), untrue, or incompetent; for convenience these will be given names (see 122 subsequent list). The first two (Scale Domain, Point Domain) perform the conditional domain assignments just described, thus ensuring that solutions lie on the scales that we have prescribed. The third (Correct Description) is concerned with correctness, and the final two (Minimal Distance, Extreme Point) with competence. 1. Scale Domain : The scale must belong to the selected scale system. For 2. Point Domain : The point chosen as given value must belong to the 3. Correct Description : The relation must be adapted to the given value so 4. Minimal Distance : For a given relation and scale, the point selected as 5. Extreme Point : If extreme points (equivalent to 0.0 and 1.0) are used
Whereas the first three constraints are straightforward and obviously necessary, Mini-mal Distance and Extreme Point make more interesting claims that require discussion and empirical testing. 4.2.1 Minimal Distance. The assumption here is that when making an approximation, the generator should make the best possible use of the chosen scale, by considering only points that are adjacent to the actual value. 12 This means, for instance, that if V and Scale = S 10 , the only points that should be considered are 2 and 3. Which of these is choice will depend on correct description. Note that we have not excluded &gt; 2onthe grounds that &lt; 3 is closer, because there might be pragmatic reasons for preferring one relation to the other. 13 tion with given values at the extreme points of the scale (e.g., 0/10 and 10/10 if Scale = 10); such combinations are not found in the N UM G EN corpus and it is hard to imagine contexts when they would be appropriate as approximations. 4.3 Preferences
The constraints just described yield multiple solutions for any given input value; to complete the model, we need to consider contextual reasons why speakers/writers might prefer some solutions to others. Regarding for example the System variable, we have already pointed out some reasons why writers might prefer fractions to per-centages (or vice versa), including location within the document, and the educational level of the reader. Similarly, with regard to Relation , considerations of emphasis might favor &gt; over &lt; (or vice versa), as in the sentence  X  X ore than a quarter of papers were marked A... X  in our initial example, which focuses attention on how easy the
A-level examinations have become. For present purposes, nothing can be said about these choices except that they depend on contextual features outside the scope of our current model. However, regarding the choice of Scale , we can filter out some solutions on the assumption that speakers/writers apply a trade-off between roundness and accuracy. That is, we can show that however these two factors are weighted (provided that they are not judged irrelevant or even undesirable), some solutions will be inferior to others and can therefore be discarded. This is done by the following rule:
A similar rule could be formulated for solutions along the same scale with different accuracies, but in our implementation this case is already covered by the Minimal Distance constraint.
 in which the values for Point / Scale are arithmetically equivalent, such as 5/10 and 10/20 (values for System and Relation being the same). According to Krifka X  X  Round Number
Round Interpretation principle, readers of a phrase like  X  X bout 50% X  will apply an interpretation bias favoring coarse-grained representations (i.e., scales with a relatively low N -value), and writers will take this bias into account. We can therefore prefer 5/10 to 10/20, 50/100, and any other equivalent given value with Scale exceeding 10, and filter out these dispreferred duplicates. 15 labeling, because it relies on comparing each candidate solution with the other can-didates. In general this kind of procedure can lead to computational inefficiency; in planning descriptions of proportions, however, the number of candidates should not be large enough for this to be a problem, given that most combinations will already have been eliminated by the constraints applied before labeling. 124 4.4 Example of Output Table 3 gives a full listing of output for our original A-level example ( V with solutions ordered by accuracy. 17 For convenience, the table includes a possible verbalization of each semantic form. 5. Evaluation
Overall, we would like the generator to satisfy two requirements: First, it should allow all the good solutions; second, it should exclude the bad ones. This assumes (a) that we can measure  X  X oodness, X  and (b) that we can draw a line separating wheat from chaff. Theoretically these are difficult tasks to achieve, because we are dealing with dimensions of judgment that are continuous and partly subjective, but this should not stop us from looking for practical evaluation criteria which can support rough assessments and comparisons of different algorithms.
 judgments of native speakers, and frequency in a corpus. Using the former method, we could ask people to judge whether the 13 plans proposed previously for describing 0.259 are all appropriate (to some context), and whether there are other acceptable solutions that have been omitted. Using the latter method, we could collect from a corpus all phrases describing a given proportion (say 0.259), identify the plans behind them, and find out whether (i) the solutions actually found in the corpus are all generated by our model, and (ii) solutions absent from the corpus are not generated.
 not the most instructive aspect to evaluate. Any reasonably complex system is based on a number of methods and assumptions, some of which might be correct and some incorrect; separate evaluations of these components should provide more useful evi-dence on how the model can be improved. We have therefore designed the empirical study so that as well as assessing overall coverage and quality, it allows us to evaluate the Minimal Distance and Extreme Point Constraints, the Roundness Preference, and the suggested scale systems for fractions and percentages. 5.1 Method
The model was evaluated through two surveys in which participants were asked to fill in gaps in sentences describing proportions, with reference to data from which the actual value V A could be easily computed. The surveys were presented on-line using
SurveyMonkey 18 through a link sent to two computational linguistics mailing lists (SIGGEN and SIGDIAL). Survey 1, completed by 50 participants, tested the predictions of the model concerning given ( V G ) values for percentages . Survey 2, completed by the decision whether to use a fraction or a percentage; it also included four questions testing the Extreme Point constraint. The content of all questions was adapted from newspaper articles in the N UM G EN corpus. In detail, the composition of the surveys wasasfollows:
A. Eight questions where subjects were asked to provide the given number
B. Ten questions where subjects were asked to complete a sentence by
C. Four questions where subjects were asked to choose a hedge for a sentence
Examples of each kind of question are shown in Figure 1. The instructions in both surveys were as follows, with the italicized paragraph occurring only in Survey 2. 126 Schematically, each question presented the raw data of a proportion in the form C (cardinality of set divided by cardinality of superset) X  X or instance, 712 out of 1,000 UK teenagers  X  X o that the actual value V A could be calculated. The values of C so that this calculation would be relatively simple (1,000). of presentation, and the gaps to be filled by the subjects are shown by question marks.
In Survey 1, all participants viewed questions A1 X  X 8 in the same order on separate pages. 21 In Survey 2, similarly, questions B1 X  X 10 were presented on separate pages, followed by questions C1 X  X 4 presented on a single page (see Figure 1). 5.2 Results
Before presenting the results schematically, we will look in detail at the responses actually typed for the question A1 (top of Figure 1). Subjects were asked to complete the sentence About [...] percent of UK teenagers under 16 have used sunbeds during the last year given the data 712/1,000, equivalent to V A = 0 . 712. Reproduced as strings, the following responses were received (some more than once):
As can be seen, the same answer was sometimes given in different forms (70, sev-enty, 70%); in collating the results, these were all normalized to 70. Occasional bizarre 128 responses (20, 15, 2) were not excluded. Collating in this way, and ordering by frequency, the results for the first eight questions were as shown in Table 5.
 fraction or a percentage, and whether fractions would conform to the proposed scale system (favoring denominators in the range 2 X 4). Responses such as  X  X  quarter X ,  X  X wo thirds X ,  X 1/4 X ,  X 2/3 X , were classified as fractions; responses like  X  X ne out of four X ,  X 2 of every 3 X  were instead classified as ratios. For each actual value, a convenient fraction was located within a distance of 0.01 on the proportion scale: for instance, 0.257 is just 0.007 above 1/4, and 0.372 just 0.003 below 3/8. Five of these fractions lay within the proposed scale system (denominators 2 X 4) and five lay outside (denominators 5, 6, 8, 10, 20); questions in the former category are marked by an asterisk in Table 6. less than , more than ,and approximately . 23 The purpose of these questions was to test the
Extreme Point constraint X  X ur hypothesis was that when constrained to use the extreme points 0% or 100% as given values, people would avoid the relations &lt; and &gt; . Two other hedges were employed so that on a random response the frequencies would be equally

Comparing the solutions generated by the program with those produced by human authors (including participants in our survey), we can ask (a) how many solutions produced by humans were generated by the program, and (b) how many solutions generated by the program were produced by humans X  X hus addressing the competing criteria of coverage and quality . A model that generates many solutions will increase coverage at the expense of quality, because it accepts some solutions that competent authors would never produce.

Table 8; comparing these with the actual results in Table 5, we observe that participants chose one of the predicted given values in 357 out of 400 responses, giving an overall 130 coverage rate of about 90%. Turning to quality, the final column of Table 8 shows that all of the predicted solutions occurred at least once in a sample of 50 responses, giving a quality rate of 100%. This confirms that the fairly high coverage rate was not achieved by the artifice of generating an overlarge set of predicted solutions.
 percentages, we obtained 576/588 responses conforming to the predicted given values (98% coverage), and 49 out of 76 predicted given values used at least once (64% quality).
Here the quality rate is lower because our model generates some very rough approxima-would only occur in contexts where roundness overwhelmingly dominates precision. 5.3.2 Fraction and Percentage Scales. Responses to questions B1 X  X 10 supported our as-sumption that fractions are normally drawn from a scale system with denominators in the range 2 X 4. This is shown (a) by the preponderance of fractions using these scales, and (b) by the tendency of subjects to prefer percentages when the closest fraction used another scale (e.g., fifths or tenths).
 range 2 X 6, with frequencies as follows: halves 58 (24.7%), thirds 110 (46.8%), quarters 63 (26.8%), fifths 1 (0.4%), and sixths 3 (1.3%). Thus overall, 98.3% of fraction responses used the proposed scales. Strikingly, none of the subjects chose three-fifths as a given number for 0.605 (question B9), where the 16 fraction responses divided equally be-tween half and two-thirds. Similarly, no subjects chose nine-tenths for V tion B3), for which the overwhelming preference was 90%, and there were no fraction responses at all. The data thus supported a clear division into fraction and percentage scale systems, with most subjects staying within a fraction system with scales limited to the range 2 X 4.
 were chosen so that five were close to convenient fractions in the range 2 X 4, and five were not (see Table 6). For the former group, fractions outnumbered percentages by 185 to 114; for the latter group, percentages outnumbered fractions by 237 to 50 X  X  clear crossover (on a 2  X  2 association test,  X  2 = 120.5, df = 2, p &lt; 0 . 00001). Another way of showing this result is to correlate fraction frequencies with the distance between the actual value and the nearest fraction with a denominator in the range 2 X 4: As this difference increases, fraction frequencies decline, so that we obtain a strong negative correlation (product-moment correlation r =  X  0 . 9, df = 8, p &lt; 0 . 01). 5.3.3 Minimal Distance. The Minimal Distance constraint relates the choice of the given value V G to the choices made for the relation and the scale. It states that V be chosen from the scale so as to minimize the distance from the actual value V while obtaining a true description. Applied for example to question A1, for which the relation is  X  and V A = 0 . 712, the only point along the S will be V G = 7 / 10, yielding a distance from V A of 0.012 (compared with a distance of 0.088 when V G = 8 / 10, the nearest rival). For the other scales, the nearest points are respectively, 14/20, 71/100, and 712/1,000, with the result that there are only two predicted V G values, 7/10 and 71/100 (realized as 70% and 71%): 14/20 is a duplicate of 7/10 removed by the Roundness Preference, and 712/1,000 is inconsistent with the relation  X  because it is exactly equal to V A .
 of 0.712, we can find in Table 5 (questions A1 X  X 8) only seven violations of minimal distance (2%), compared with 357 responses respecting the constraint (98%). The only violation that occurred more than once was  X  X bout 28 percent X  as an approximation of 0.286. For questions B1 X  X 10 we counted only five violations (1%) compared with 583 respecting the constraint (99%). Four of these violations were obvious arithmetical mistakes (e.g., 56% as a realization of 0.056); the other was the response 33% as an approximation for 0.372, suggesting an attempt to realize the underlying form 1/3 as a percentage. 25 be avoided with given values at the extremes of the scale ( V claim, the survey contained four questions (C1 X  X 4) in which subjects had to choose a hedge to accompany an extreme value of V G . For instance in question C1, with V 0 . 983, the sentence presented was A survey has found that [ ...]100percentofpeoplebelieve they are smarter than average , and subjects had to choose from the hedges about, less than, more than, approximately in order to fill the gap. The arithmetically correct answers to this question are &lt; 100 (represented by  X  X ess than X ) and and  X  X pproximately X ); most subjects, however, respected the Extreme Point constraint by opting for the latter, with only 6/62 choosing  X  X ess than. X  Overall, 211/248 responses to questions C1 X  X 4 respected the constraint (85%), with 37 violations (15%). 5.3.5 Roundness Preference. Two questions in Survey 1 were included specifically to test the Roundness Preference; both employed the relation  X  in combination with an actual value exactly midway between two round numbers, one on the scale S on the scale S 20 . The prediction was that subjects would favor the V the coarser-grained scale ( S 10 ). Results were as follows:
The overall count was therefore 36 to 5 in favor of the Roundness Preference (p &lt; 0 . 00001, binomial test), but there was at least a hint of some other factor intruding, with over 10% of responses going the other way. 6. Conclusion
We have proposed and tested a theoretical model for planning expressions that describe proportions, with varying degrees of formality and precision. Our central idea is that such expressions describe an arithmetical relationship between an actual value V a given value V G , where the relation belongs to the set value is a point from a scale belonging to a scale system . We use the concept of scale system in order to distinguish the two commonest mathematical forms for representing proportions X  X ractions and percentages. In everyday usage, fractions are conceptually 132 simpler because they have low-valued scales (usually in the region 2 X 4), whereas per-centages use higher-valued scales based on powers of ten; both scales, however, could be extended to finer granularities, for instance, to meet the requirements of specialized domains. Scales for proportions are characterized by their S represent coarser granularities and are associated intuitively with rounder given values.
The model provides a convenient formalization of the notions of mathematical form and roundness, and a framework for investigating the detailed structure of scale systems and the constraints and preferences that inform the planning process.
 pants in our survey were predicted by the model, with an overall coverage over 90%; quality was also high (i.e., most generated solutions were employed at least once by participants). These results support our assumptions about the composition of the scale systems for fractions ([ S 2 , S 3 , S 4 ]) and percentages ([ S determine the range of generated given values. Regarding the other assumptions of the model, we found overwhelming evidence for a Minimal Distance constraint, which requires speakers/writers to choose (for a specified scale and relation) the nearest point to the actual value that yields a true description, and strong evidence for an Extreme
Point constraint, which disallows approximations in which the relations &gt; or &lt; are used in combination with extreme points of a scale (e.g., with the percentages 0% or 100%).
We also found clear evidence for a Roundness Preference which, all other things being equal, favors solutions using coarser-grained scales within the selected system. set of plans for describing any proportion, although when incorporated into an NLG application it would obviously have to be complemented by a module for selecting the best solution for a given pragmatic context. Despite not covering this problem in the model, we have given examples of how pragmatic considerations might affect each component of a solution (scale system, given value, arithmetical relation), thus providing a framework for investigating such questions systematically.
