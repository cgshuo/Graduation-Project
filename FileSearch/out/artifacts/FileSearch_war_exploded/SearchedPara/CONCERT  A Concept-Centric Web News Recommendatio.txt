 With millions of news generated every day, a high-quality news recommender system is highly desired. However, collaborative filtering technique would fail in this task due to the lack of user feedbacks for real-time news. Although traditional content-based recommender system [1][2][4] can work without feedback, it still has unaccept-able drawbacks: (1) A content-based System like Fab [1] represents a Web page as the top 100 most informative words. However, millions of news is published every month, making it both time and space consuming to extract 100 words for every Web page. (2) Other content-based recommender systems such as [2] use TF-IDF [3] as the measurement of  X  X mportance X  of keywords. These systems often do not consider se-mantics, thus the recommendation may encounter the topic-drifting problem. 
To overcome the above drawbacks, we propose a concept-centric recommender system called CONCERT. A concept here is defined as a key phrase which represents an entity, event, or idea that people are interested in. CONCERT achieves both high diversity and high quality, as its concept-centric methodology can capture users X  in-terest in a natural way. It can also partially alleviate the cold-start problem faced with the traditional recommender systems, since it can even recommend new Web news to a user as long as it is conceptually relevant to the Web news the user is browsing. In [4], Aditya Parameswaran et al. gave a definition of  X  X oncept X  and developed the so-called K-gram algorithm to extract concepts in English articles, which can be potentially used by CONCERT. However, since the rules used to mine the concepts in K-gram are language-specific, we have to define some rules for each language, which can be very complicated and tedious. As a result, we decide to use a supervised algorithm to extract the main concepts, which is language independent and achieves much better performance. The main component of CONCERT is concept extractor and the real-time recom-mender system. 
Concept extractor can extract concepts from the input ar ticles. We build a concept extractor in a supervised way based on the KEA method [5]. It learns five features, that is, TF-IDF, Length, FirstOccur, POST (Part Of Speech Tagging), and FIQL (Fre-quency In Query Log) from a training set. We use a Na X ve Bayesian classifier to train a model which computes the weights of the features. When a new article comes, we can calculate the probability of a phrase being a concept. After building the concept ex tractor, we use it to construct the concept database. When users read new Web news, we recommend news to them. Figure 1(a) shows the CONCERT system architecture. Real-time recommender works in 3 steps: 1. Webpage Pre-processing. We extract title and content from our database using boilerpipe 1 . After segmentation using Stanford Chinese NLP 2 , we turn urls in our database to news texts expressed as sequences of words. 2. Concept Indexing. We put all news texts into the concept extractor, and get concepts in every news page in the database. Then we build an inverted index, that for each concept, it contains an inverted list cons isting of information about this concept. 3. Real-time Recommender. When a user reads a new Web page, we extract the title and content, segment them, put the news texts into the concept extractor, and then get the main concepts (i.e., the top ranked concepts measured by probability). We then search for each concept in the inverted list and calculate the cosine distance. We put each cosine distance in a minheap of size k to get the top-k results. After calcula-tion we show the main concepts and t op-k recommendation results to users. Our training set contains 13,703 NetEase 3 news Web pages used in [6]. Our database contains 3.5 million news Web pages from sohu.com 4 . The interface of the CONCERT system is shown in Figure 1(b). We plan to demonstrate the CONCERT system with the following scenario: Step 1. A user searches for news, and the latest news from Internet are displayed. 
Step 2. The user clicks a search result and the news is shown in the middle, mean-while, the concepts and recommendations are shown in the right of the system. Acknowledgement. This work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61272088.
