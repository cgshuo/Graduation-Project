 1. Introduction
Information seeking theories, models and evaluations have generally been developed on the basis of: (a) relatively small and, sometimes, unrepresentative samples; (b) what people say they did/thought rather than what they actually did; and, (c) a print and/or oral based world. As Turnbull (2005) points out a significant number of models and theories are based on assumptions or smaller-scale studies of user information needs and searching (see studies by Ellis, 1989 or Kuhlthau, 1991 ). As information users decamp rapidly to the dig-ital world, their numbers (and nature) increase considerably and as it becomes possible to digitally map what millions of people actually do in this world, it is important that the knowledge we have about information seeking is updated, corrected and, possibly, rewritten. For the past five years CIBER has been doing just this by utilising log analysis to obtain a deep, rich and robust understanding of the  X  X ew X  digital consumer and how they seek information in cyberspace. This has been undertaken in regard to several million consumers in a wide number of settings, including health ( Nicholas, Huntington, &amp; Williams, 2004 ), news ( Nicholas, Hun-
This paper concentrates on what has been, arguably, our most important finding  X  the discovery of what is probably best described as a widespread, pronounced and endemic form of digital behaviour which is best described as  X  X ouncing X  and first noted in an article published by Journal of Documentation in 2004 ( Nicholas,
Huntington, Williams, &amp; Dobrowolski, 2004 ). Bouncing describes a form of behaviour in which users view only a few web pages from the vast numbers available and generally do not return to the same website very often, if at all. What is most interesting is that a thorough review of the information seeking literature uncov-ered no significant mentions of such a form of behaviour. What follows then is a discussion of this behaviour, mainly in the virtual scholar field 4 in which we shall describe the methods by which we have identified it, pres-ent the evidence for its existence, show variations between user groups, examine the possible reasons for this form of behaviour, and consider the significance of this form of behaviour for information providers and pol-icy makers. 2. Literature review
Surprisingly, given the vastness of the information seeking literature and the dominance of bouncing as a form of information seeking behaviour it has not been the subject of serious or sustained research by research-ers, although clearly this form of behaviour has widespread significance for a number of fields  X  marketing (e.g. Zauberman, 2003 ), web design (e.g. Lindgaard, Fernandes, Dudek, &amp; Brown, 2006 ) and retrieval ( Chang &amp; Rice, 1993 ).

One of the two main characteristics of bouncers is that they rarely come back to the same website. In the hardcopy environment there have been some studies about repeat users. The concept of  X  X illingness to return X  was developed in 1980s and 1990s in the area of reference services. This concept later was incorporated into of the development of electronic journals, the issue of return visitors was considered by researchers in Super-
Journal project. They categorised users into two groups  X  repeat and non-repeat users. They identified four different patterns of behaviour among non-repeat users (about 60% of the analysed sample) including the lost users, the exploratory users, the tourists, and the searchers. The tourists accounted for 42% of the sample ( Eason, Richardson, &amp; Yu, 2000 ). In the TULIP project, repeat users were defined as users who used TULIP in at least two of the six-months studied ( Borghuis et al., 1996 ).

Return visits were also a concern of researchers in marketing. They have naturally paid more attention to this aspect of bouncing behaviour because of the not inconsiderable financial consequences connected with the form of behaviour. Lindgaard et al. (2006) conducted research to determine how quickly people took to make a decision about whether they though a web page was relevant. It turned out that a reliable decision could be made in 50 ms and web designers have just a fraction of second to make a good first impression. Zauberman (2003) in an experimental study demonstrated that users quickly develop a tendency to become loyal to a sin-gle Web site to accomplish an assigned task. This occurred even when a better Web site was quite literally just a click away. The term  X  X  X ock-in X  X , which was introduced by Zauberman, indicates the behaviour of users who he found unwilling to switch to other sites. Log analysis of the website of an Internet automotive company by
Bucklin and Sismeiro (2003) showed that visitors X  propensity to continue browsing changes dynamically as a function of the depth of a given site visit and the number of repeat visits to the site. The dynamics were con-particular, repeat visits led to reduced page-view propensities but not to reduced page-view durations. The results also revealed browsing patterns that may reflect visitors X  timesaving strategies.

Johnson, Bellman, and Lohse (2003) studied Web site sessions X  duration across multiple visits. They found out that visitors spent less time per session the more they visited the site, which was an indication of their becoming more efficient as they returned to the site. Bucklin and Sismeiro (2003) criticised this result for focus-sing just on the cognitive and learning factors and did not take into account other factors that might influence session duration across visits; factors such as content of pages requested, server response time, and tasks per-formed during each site visit. The author did not address how visitors become more efficient.
 The other main characteristic of bouncers is the extent to which they use a website (site penetration).
Researchers in the TULIP project developed measures of penetration for different institutions using electronic journals. The degree of penetration was calculated as the number of repeat users divided by the number of information seeking behaviour, personality traits and study approach through two surveys of students. She found out that psychological features had a stronger influence on the students X  information behaviour than their discipline background, or the stage of the thesis process did. Based on the results, she grouped the stu-dents X  information behaviour into three patterns with regard to the extent they exploited or penetrated infor-mation resources. The three patterns included fast surfing, broad scanning and deep diving, which were linked to different personality traits and study approaches. Fast surfers were students who wanted information avail-able quickly and easily, with the least possible effort. For them, the depth and quality of information was a minor concern and, as a consequence, they judge documents by document description criteria (looks, type, easy availability, etc.) rather than content. Broad scanning was characterised by exhaustive and flexible infor-mation seeking in a wide range of sources. Broad scanning searches developed gradually rather than being planned. Deep diving students dived far beneath the surface of the information flow. They were quality-con-scious and worked hard in order to obtain high quality information. They desired quality rather than quantity. Bouncing behaviour clearly is linked to browsing behaviour. Cove and Walsh, 1987 ; cited in Chang and
Rice, 1993, p. 235 , suggested three degrees of goal orientation in browsing (see also Apted, 1971, &amp; Levine, 1969 for similar categories): (1) search browsing, a closely directed and structured activity in which the desired goal is known; (2) general-purpose browsing, an activity of consulting specific sources regularly because they probably contain items of interest; (3) serendipity browsing, purely random, unstructured and undirected activity. It is evident that those who have the second type of orientation in their browsing (such as using jour-nals for keeping up-to-date) are less likely to be bouncers. Marchionini, Dwiggins, Katz, and Lin (1993) sug-gested four factors that influence different types of browsing techniques. The first factor concerns the object sought, which may be well or ill defined. The second factor relates to individual searcher characteristics. These include experience and knowledge about object sought, motivation, purpose, learning pattern and cognitive style. The third factor is the purpose of the search, which may include pleasure, fact retrieval, concept forma-tion, interpretation, evaluation of ideas and keeping abreast of development of a field. The final factor is the context for conducting the search. Some contextual factors that can influence the extent and type of browsing include collection size, subject divisions, subject discipline, display and work activity. 3. Methodology
The statistical data presented in this paper are generated by deep log analysis (DLA) techniques developed by the authors. DLA is a form of log analysis which takes raw log files and analyses them by SPSS (Software
Package for Social Sciences). The resultant data is then related to user data normally obtained through online surveys or extracted from subscribers X  databases. DLA extracts data associated with search and navigational behaviour and thus provides a very wide range of metrics which enable information seeking to be evaluated; hence the name  X  X eep X . For full details of the methods see the article by Nicholas et al. (2000) . The working definitions for the metrics employed by the studies are as follows:
User . In all of the studies mentioned here, user identification was based on the Internet Protocol addresses (IP), as well as browsers details, cookies, and password identification if available. A user was effectively a computer; sometimes that computer represents an individual, or in other cases a number of people (i.e., students in the library).
 Items viewed . A  X  X  X omplete X  X  item returned by the server to the client in response to a user action.
Typically, this might include an abstract, an article, or a table of contents. A complete item might be all the pages, charts, etc. from an article, and this is recorded as a single item; hence, the digital library logs are quite different from traditional server log files that record pictures and text documents sepa-rately.

Session . Identified in the logs by a session identification number. Digital library logs include a session begin-ning tag and a session ending tag, which enables us to make time calculations as well. If this is not available, researchers choose a maximum time-frame in which a user is can be inactive and consider that as the end of that session. 3.1. Methodological problems
Logs provide access to millions of user transactions but there are problems inherent in using the data to accurately portray information seeking behaviour in a digital environment and this is true also in the case of determining bouncing behaviour. The two bouncing metrics are subject to distortion, a distortion which tends to make the bouncing behaviour more pronounced, but not in all cases. The main distorting factors are caching, proxy servers, and user identification by means of IP address ( Jamali, Nicholas, &amp; Huntington, 2005 ). In addition there are considerations as to how a session and use is interpreted and the problems of dou-ble counting. 3.1.1. Caching
Caching is the storing of previously viewed pages on to the client X  X  computer; repeat in-session accesses to these pages are made from the cache and are not requested from the web site X  X  server and hence not recorded in the logs. If the cache is not cleared, subsequent sessions may make use of cached pages. Caching impacts especially on the penetration metric, as some viewed pages are not recorded or attributed to a user X  X  search session, leading to more sessions being classified as bouncer sessions. Clearly, the more pages that are viewed in a session, the more caching will impact. Further, some types of pages are more likely to be cached than other pages. For example, menu pages are more likely to be cached compared to, say, a search page. Caching can be defeated by utilising a non-cacheable image. 3.1.2. Proxy servers A proxy connection is where a number of computers are connected to the Internet via a single IP number.
In such cases, session details of the connected computers are muddled together and it will appear that all use comes from the same  X  X roxy X  user since users are identified by IP numbers. Again, this has an impact on esti-mated usage metrics and estimates of site penetration. Their use can lead to an underestimation of bouncing behaviour. They can also lead to an overestimation. Proxy servers introduce caching problems as their func-tion is to reduce the load on servers by caching information on a Web server and acting as an intermediary between a Web client and the Web server. For example an organisation configures all its browsers to send requests to the proxy. The first time a user accesses a given web page, the proxy must obtain a copy from the server that manages the page. The proxy places the copy in its cache, and returns the pages as the response to the request. The next time a user accesses the same page, the proxy extracts the data from its cache without sending a request across the Internet. Consequently, traffic from the site to the Internet is significantly reduced.
Proxy server usage cannot be excluded from the data set. In previous studies, such as OhioLINK, the team has successfully identified proxy servers via an analysis of sub network node computer name analysis and their behaviour analysed.

Another characteristic of proxy servers is that they will record a higher than expected repeat use. This occurs as there are many computers linking to the internet via a single IP address hence as any of these com-puters are used they will appear as repeat use of the same IP address. 3.1.3. User identification
Web logs provide a user  X  X race X , but not real user or individual identification. Typically all you have to work with is the Internet Protocol (IP) number, which provides the name of the institution to which the user belonged. However, the IP number cannot be traced back to an individual, only to a computer  X  sometimes to a multiple user computer, such as those found in libraries. Furthermore the IP number might have been allocated temporarily to a computer (floating IP numbers). Similarly, the use of proxy servers mean that the IP address cannot be assumed to relate to use on a specific machine. The problem with the metric that calculates repeat visits is that it is largely based on IP number and we have great difficulties in recognising that it is the same person coming back.

Some of these difficulties (e.g. group machines) lead to an overestimation of revisits but most lead to an underestimation. To overcome these difficulties we have resorted to: (1) excluding obvious proxy use; (2) com-bining browser details with IP number to get a better identification of  X  X ndividual X  users; (3) combining cookie information with IP numbers. We have successfully combined cookie information with IP numbers and hence have uniquely identified a computer and for a full discussion of these issues see Nicholas, Huntington, and
Jamali (2006) . 3.1.4. Sessions
Calculations of site penetration are dependent on the definition of session and item viewed adopted. There is an issue of how a session is defined and that can lead to variations in counting, which largely impacts on site penetration calculations, but also influences return visit counts.

Sessions are identified in the logs by an identification number. Logs include a session-beginning tag and a session-ending tag, which enables us to make time calculations as well. Unfortunately as far as the logs are concerned, nobody logs off on the Web: they just depart anonymously. Typically, then, to estimate a log off  X  or a session end, and so define a session (a key use metric)  X  a time lapse of inactivity has to be assumed and the industry standard tends to be 30 min ( Zawitz, 1998 ). We believe this is too generous as users invariable take 10 s to review a page. Hence we have tended to define a session as having been completed if the lapse of time between requests assigned to the same IP number exceeded ten minutes. We are currently investigating online reading time, time lapse and session send.

Clearly, the above impacts on the levels of bouncing behaviour discovered. Take the example of a proxy server serving say a department or library network. There will be many users viewing from these machines all sharing the same IP address. We do not know when one users session ends the other begins. Setting the session end trigger too long and you risk the chaining of a number of separate sessions into one session. Set-ting it too short and you risk cutting the user session into a number of smaller chunks. The bouncer metric is essentially tied to the session end. Clearly there is a problem with interrupted sessions  X  the coffee example is a typical trivial one that X  X  always cited. 3.1.5. Use
The basic unit of consumption on the web  X  and essential component of the site penetration metric, is var-iously referred to as hits, views, requests, pages and screens. We have tended to use item, as in number of items viewed. This is because both hits and views are vague terms and pages/screens in some circumstances can be misleading. Some items are content-rich, like PDFs and others lead you to content  X  we call these menu pages.
Thus it is possible for someone to land on a full text/content rich item from a link from another site or steer themselves to such content via a number of menus. Others might only look at a menu page, like the home page and leave  X  having viewed no content as such but having taken away the knowledge that this site has nothing of interest to them. 3.1.6. Double counting
If someone views a full-text document in HTML format and then goes on to view this item in PDF pro-prietary software tends to count this as two views or downloads. This particularly arises as the result of ses-sions where the user comes in from a gateway or third-party site and that site only indexes the HTML version. Hence, when the user clicks through to the article the user is served up with the HTML version. To view the PDF version the user has to come out of the HTML Full text version and load up the PDF format version. This process results in the downloading of two items rather than one. Inevitably, this inflates site penetration.
While there are undeniably problems with the methodology, this is true of any methodology. Even so the real value of deep log analysis is in raising the questions that need to be asked via questionnaire, interview and observation. It is not a complete methodology in itself. 4. The evidence
Irrespective of the field or industry investigated: (1) a high proportion of people appear to penetrate a web not come back to the site or they do so infrequently. Typically those who penetrate a site least tend also to return the least frequently. The combined form of behaviour we have labelled  X  X ouncing X  and the consumers evidencing it  X  X ouncers X . They bounce into the site and then bounce out again, presumably, to another site, as a high proportion of them do not appear to come back again. The terms vividly describe a pattern of behav-iour but they are in no way meant to be judgemental and this theme will be returned to later.

To estimate how much of a website a visitor uses or engages with a metric called  X  X ite penetration X  has been employed, which is the number of items (or pages) viewed in a search session. We have generally identified bouncing behaviour as being exhibited when users view three or less items in a session  X  three being a figure, which research in the health field had shown to represent limited or menu (e.g. homepage, content page) use ( Nicholas et al., 2004 ). Thus an evaluation of the NHS Direct site has shown that 60% of single session page users viewed the opening menu/home directory screen and left without accessing any further pages. These users did not access an information page and left without further investigating the site ( Nicholas et al., 2004 ).
Return visits is outwardly anyway a more straightforward and popular metric and people who do not come back to a site after a suitably long interval are denoted as bouncers. The two bouncing metrics operate on two quite different scales: one is a time based metric and the other is not. Putting them together to create  X  X ndivid-ual X  user profiles is really not feasible with log analysis. Thus, say we took a user who had visited a site twice, firstly just looking at one page and then returning to view 10 pages, maybe as a result of the initial foray.
Clearly we can average site penetration across visits but this obviously misses information and the average here will probably be biased.

Time online is also a metric that suggests itself when defining users by their engagement and would appear to provide the same kind of information as site penetration. However, this metric has been eschewed because: (a) it is a damaged metric as from the logs it is not possible to estimate the time for those viewing a single item, and no estimate of the last page viewed can be made (no one logs off on the Web; (b) it does not add much to the site metric as CIBER studies have provided evidence that users viewing more items spend more time online ( Nicholas et al., 2004 ); (c) the time spent while the user is  X  X nline X  but not actually engaged with the service distorts the figures; d) because sites are not navigationally closed a user visiting for 10 s might access the desired information while another viewing for a 30 s might not. 4.1. Site penetration
The actual figures are quite high with around half to two-thirds of people visiting a site leaving after they had viewed three items or less. Table 1 provides the figures for the virtual scholar in connection with five dig-ital journal libraries ( Nicholas, Huntington, &amp; Watkinson, 2005 ; Nicholas et al., 2006 ; Nicholas, Huntington,
Jamali, &amp; Tenopir, 2006 ). For digital health consumers the figures showed slightly higher levels of bouncing behaviour; thus in the case of users of SurgeryDoor consumer website the corresponding figures were 74% (1 X  3 items), 20% (4 X 10), 4% (11 X 20) and 2% (more than 20) ( Nicholas, Huntington, &amp; Williams, 2003 ).
There are significant differences between the sites and these can be explained by various factors, which we shall briefly touch upon here, but will discuss in much more detail later on. Thus in the case of OhioLINK, the lower penetration rate was probably due to the fact that: (a) users could not access menus, abstracts or articles via an external link or agent such as Google; (b) it is a closed facility where academic users only can view aca-demic material from many publishers ( Nicholas et al., 2006 ).
And in the case of ScienceDirect, its even lower figure is explained by a number of factors: (a) very restricted sample of 750 + scholars, many of whom were authors. Just 3% of respondents were students, while Professors and Heads of Departments made up approximately 42% of the sample; (b) the fact that the data set was restricted to those who were identified as being users with a unique IP (Internet protocol) address. Those with a proxy or floating IP addresses, identified by the association of more than one IP number to a cookie, were excluded from the sample; (c) the minimal access to the site by search engines which as shall be seen tends to increase bouncing behaviour ( Nicholas et al., 2006 ); (d) many people approached the site via PubMed and were taken directly to what they were looking for, this of course would increase the bouncer rate. 4.1.1. Characteristics of users penetration
The evaluation of the Blackwell Synergy digital journal library showed that there were differences in the information seeking behaviour of those users who penetrated deeply and those who did not, especially in regard to what items/pages they view. Thus, those viewing 1 X 3 items in a session, proportionally viewed more abstracts, approximately 36% of this group viewed abstracts compared to 17% of those viewing 4 X 10 items in a session and 12% viewing 21 or more items. Furthermore, and perhaps, more unexpectedly, those viewing 1 X 3 items made less use of table of contents. Only 7% did so compared to 20% of those viewing 4 X 10 items, 26% of those viewing 11 X 20 items and 41% of those viewing 21 and over items in a session ( Nicholas et al., 2005 ).
The ScienceDirect study also showed that those penetrating a site least tended to look at material published in the last year. ScienceDirect study was characterised by linking attitudinal data with log data. An online questionnaire survey was conducted and the respondent X  X  IP number was collected as well as their written responses. This database of anonymous IP numbers was then compared to IP numbers collected by the server used to access the ScienceDirect web site over the previous 18 months. Those IP numbers that could be safely associated with a single computer (those with a unique machine cookie) were selected. The study showed that about two thirds of the items viewed by those just viewing three or less items were current; however, this was true of just 24% of those people viewing over 20 items. The same study examined the difference in the attitudes of users according to the number of items viewed in a session. Thus, for illustration, in regard to the statements:  X  X  X  prefer to do my e-journal browsing at home rather than at work X  X  it was found that those viewing fewer items were more likely to agree with the statement than those viewing more items;  X  X  X  always search authors X  own websites for the full article X  X  it was found that those respondents viewing fewer items in a session were less likely to strongly agree. 4.2. Return visits
Estimates of the proportion of visitors coming back to a site depend, of course, on the time window adopted, and we shall discuss this in more detail later. Table 2 provides a sizeable window of 12 months for users of a digital journal library (EmeraldInsight) and a consumer health website (SurgeryDoor). The figures are similar for the bouncer component (a single visit), respectively, 69% and 67%. The digital journal library, probably because of it updates content more frequently, attracts a higher proportion of frequent vis-itors (those who visited more than six times a year).

Even with a reduced time window the figures are not that dissimilar. Thus in the case of Blackwell Synergy the figures were respectively 63%, 28%, 6%, and 3% over a two month time period. The figures for Science-
Direct over a five month period were however different, respectively, 40%, 24%,15%, and 21% and this could be due to the seniority of the users (mostly senior academics, who were also authors) or the fact that for a number of technical reasons we believe that data were more accurate (see Section 3 , Methodology). 4.2.1. Characteristics of users by number of visits made
As mentioned earlier those making the fewest number of visits also made the fewest number of views in a session. Thus well over half (56%) of the Synergy subscribers who made more than fifteen visits a year viewed more than four items in a session, whereas the same figure for people who visited once was 26% ( Fig. 1 ). How-ever, if we consider only Big Deal, those people with extensive full text rights, the differences were not so pro-nounced ( Fig. 2 ). For people visiting over 15 times the figure was 56% for those viewing four or more items and 53% for those visiting only once.

Both the figures refer to subscribers, people who were entitled to certain full text rights and this might have influenced the findings.

The ScienceDirect study ( Nicholas et al., 2006 ) found that those people visiting just once tended to publish fewest papers. About half of those visiting six or more times had published five or more papers in the past year compared to about 32% who had done so who had just visited once. 4.3. User diversity
The figures cited above are the results of generalising about thousands of users and clearly this can prove to be misleading, with, say, Nobel prize winners being clumped together with first year undergraduate students. For example the number of users in the case of Emerald study exceeded two million over a one-year period.
Fortunately, deep log analysis techniques enable the profiling of those types of user who bounce, and those that do not. Thus bouncing behaviour in connection with the age, gender, subject background, geographical location, academic status, organisational affiliation, and paper productivity has been examined. However, for the purposes of illustration bouncing behaviour in connection with the ScienceDirect site in regard to four user characteristics  X  subject, age, academic status, and geographical location will be illustrated. By way of context the ScienceDirect study concerned nearly 800 users, with a bias towards more senior academics. Logs were collected for an 18 month period and in all these authors conducted 16,865 sessions, which saw 110,029 pages viewed. The returnee analysis was conducted over a five month period. 4.3.1. Subject background of user
Life sciences (21%), mathematics (20%) and medicine (20%) recorded a high proportion of sessions consist-ing of just one item view ( Fig. 3 ). If we extend the analysis to three or fewer views, medicine (60%) and life sciences (58%) were clearly the subjects with the fewest items viewed in a session. The medicine result con-firmed by the results of the Synergy study, which also showed that medicine viewed the fewest items in a session ( Nicholas et al., 2005 ). Material science, earth science, and environmental science users tended to con-duct more extensive sessions (i.e. four or more views). In the case of Material Sciences just 33% of sessions saw three items or fewer being viewed.

In terms of return visits, physics (81% visiting more than once) and computer sciences (80%) recorded high percentage of users repeating their visit. Earth sciences, with 38% of people visiting more often than 15 times, are worth singling out. Engineering (54% visiting just once) and medicine (50%) users were relatively infre-quent visitors ( Fig. 4 ).

If we take the site penetration and return visit data together, it is medical users who clearly exhibit the strongest bouncing behaviour. This is interesting, as one might expect the bouncing behaviour of a user to be related to the proportion of market coverage by the given site in the given topic. Thus for example, we might find a higher rate of bouncing in a field less well covered, but in the case of medicine this is a well cov-ered field.
 4.3.2. Age of the user
The number of sessions which just saw single items viewed generally increased with age, from 12% for those users under 36 to about 49% for those aged over 65 ( Fig. 5 ). However, those aged between 36 and 65 were more likely to record sessions with four or more items viewed, 56% did so.

Interestingly, the likelihood that a user will repeat visit also increases with age. Thus, while about 80% of those aged over 56 visited two or more times during the five month period this was only true of about 55% of users aged 45 or younger ( Fig. 6 ). We have found elsewhere that the information seeking behaviour of younger users was noticeably for its bouncing ( Nicholas et al., 2005 ). 4.3.3. Academic status of the user
Heads of Department/Professors were more likely to undertake sessions in which only one item was viewed, 19% of sessions were of this type compared to 13% for research staff ( Fig. 7 ). However, the real differences emerge when we examine percentage of people who viewed three items or less, which in the case of postgrad-uates was 66% and only 46% in respect to Heads of Department/Professors.

Senior researchers were most likely to return to a site, 67% did so as compared to 53% of research staff and 61% of Heads of Department/Professors ( Fig. 8 ). However, postgraduate students were the most likely to visit very frequently (six or more times). It is possible that the number of downloads is a function of the amount of time the given user types have available to find information.

If we take together the two metrics we have a reasonably strong case for arguing that students exhibit a more marked bouncing behaviour. 4.3.4. Geographical location of the user
Asian and South American users conducted sessions which saw the greatest number of items viewed  X  respectively 56% and 60% of their sessions viewed four or more pages ( Fig. 9 ). African (33%) and Eastern
European (31%) users were most likely to view only one item in a session. Taking the figure to three or less items makes a considerable difference with Australasian users now viewing the fewest number of items in a session (71% of sessions saw three or fewer items viewed).

North Americans (an Elsevier term for Canadians and Alaskans) were more likely to be repeat users, 92% visited more than once while those based in South America (75%) and E. Europe (67%) were most likely to visit once ( Fig. 10 ).

On the evidence of both metrics, Eastern Europeans are clearly our archetypical bouncers. 5. Possible explanations for bouncing
There are a number of possible explanations for bouncing and here we shall concentrate on those for which we have strong evidence. 5.1. Considerable digital choice
Bouncing is a natural function of being presented with massive digital choice and having search engines to help make that choice. Indeed, in almost all fields there is now a bewildering information choice. The web is really all about choice and the excitement of making choices and information seeking behaviour will inevitably reflect this reality. If people are presented with easy access to lots of information then they will take advantage of that choice by cross-checking, comparing and by adopting a kind of  X  X ick and mix X  approach which comes over as bouncing. Bouncing helps determine what is wanted. 5.2. Search engines
Search engines provide massive choice in response to any query and they offer a relatively sophisticated search facility for people with limited knowledge about searching and content. In this respect they might have become the digital equivalent of the  X  X eturned book shelves X  the place where the most interesting items are to be found and the framework in which choices are made. They also offer the prospect of providing targeted and direct access to meet an information need. Using a search engine is costless, except for the time spent  X  and it only takes a typical internet user 10 s to check out a page ( Nielsen, 2000 ). The choice is so rich and sometimes the quality of the matched material so poor that this encourages users to cycle swiftly through matched hits or sites in an effort to locate the content that is most useful or trustworthy. Users appear quite happy to accept bouncing in return for the immediacy and close proximity of content offered. Search engines amplify bouncing at individual website level because they provide an effective browsing mechanism (with relevance ranking, combined with keyword in context content) which limits the amount of browsing conducted on the individual site.

Our work has confirmed the popularity of search engine searching, amongst all user groups, but especially younger users. In fact the evidence (see the ScienceDirect study: Nicholas et al., 2006 ) points to users shunning complicated interfaces and myriad search options. There is an emerging picture that users are using search engines instead of on-site menus, that is they prefer to re-interrogate a site via a search engine search of the whole Net (even though they might know they will return to the site from which they have recently departed) rather than using on-site menus. One reason a user might prefer to use a web search engine (like
Google) rather than a local search engine on a site might be that they consider Google to be superior to the local search engines.

The study of Synergy demonstrated quite dramatically the popularity of the search engine and the behav-they came to the site via a search engine, a library connection or from some other connection (e.g. the user connected directly by typing in the web address). For this study a search engine referral was defined as coming from either Google or Yahoo, while the library classification included log ins from any address that included the word library (i.e. libraries, lib or biblioteque). It was estimated that few, just 8%, of sessions came in to
Synergy from a library connection, just over a third (35%) accessed the site via a search engine and a further 57% accessed the site from some other means ( Fig. 11 ). Sessions related to users coming in via a search engine where most likely, compared to library and other access sessions, to view the least number of items in a session: only 18% of search engine access sessions saw four or more items being viewed. Most sessions, 82%, related to users coming in and just viewing 1 X 3 pages. However, users coming in from a library were far more likely to heavily use the service: 57% of users accessing the site via a library connection viewed four or more items. 5.3. Web navigation
The Internet offers the user the prospect of accessing a site via a search engine, via a link (hot link, email link, reference link etc.) as well as via a menu. Internet sites do not have a closed navigation structure, the system is open, so users can jump, via a search engine or link, to a desired information page, and just view that information and then leave and only one page is viewed. This means that site penetration, although seem-ingly  X  X ow X  is not directly linked to information use and a greater number of views do not correspond to a greater access of information. 5.4. Digital visibility The web is an incredibly busy and crowded space and the consumer has only a tiny window to that space. Increasingly the search engine, typically Google, defines what is seen in the window and the view this window furnishes is regularly refreshed, we might even be unhappy if it did not do so in what is a real-time environ-ment. This leads to an important information seeking outcome, which has an impact largely on the return visit component of bouncing. What is viewed is what is most visible or immediate. When the visibility of something in the digital window is decreased, use will inevitably fall, largely because, while original users will know of its existence through its original prominence, new users will not and will be less likely to come across it ( Hunting-ton, Nicholas, Williams, &amp; Gunter, 2003 ). 5.5. Reach
The huge reach of the web and that fact that most sites allow search engine access means more people will end up searching a site they would never have been in a position to before; this means two things: (a) far more casual use  X  people on the periphery of a subject or simply informed, but not professionally educated, users (the informed patient is a good example which has its equivalent in other fields); (b) high levels of people arriv-ing mistakenly or accidentally at sites they would not otherwise visit (see also the following section). 5.6. Poor/limited searching
From an investigation of the BBC website ( Nicholas &amp; Huntington, 2005 ) it was found that a considerable number of users made input errors when entering their search queries, and often did not notice what they had done until the search results were displayed. When participants noticed spelling suggestions (i.e.  X  X ere you looking for ...  X ) they were welcomed by participants, although several users scrolled directly down to the results list. Two further findings from this study showed how even people searching for something as impor-all search queries just used the most obvious, single word to describe a query; (2) nearly half of all searchers just made one search.

The ScienceDirect study ( Nicholas et al., 2004 ) investigated the number of hits people obtained in response to a search request and while not strictly a metric on search success as it also says much about site penetration, it is worth reviewing the data in the context of poor searching. About 40% of the sample either abandoned their search after viewing the search screen perhaps to go on to another search type. A quarter (23%) recorded zero hits in response to a query. Of the remaining searches, 11% obtained 1 X 2 hits, 16% obtained 3 X 10 returned hits, 14% obtained 10 X 50 and 19% obtained 51 or more. The apparent failure rates could be a result of the multiple and confusing menus users could be confronted with when they attempt to search and some of the abandonment could be a result of shuffling around the various menus. Nevertheless, importantly, it was clear that it was the more elderly users who were abandoning most. 5.7. Other factors
Trust. Establishing trust in a digital environment is difficult because there are so many new content provid-ers and because with so many stakeholders involved it is very difficult to gauge who is responsible for content.
In these circumstances people cross-check and make their own minds up over which to trust, and this is done on the basis of a very quick comparison of content. The results of such a process lead to the kind of bouncing distributions we have been describing ( Nicholas et al., 2006 ).

Media attributes of web content. The visual, media information world that is the Web also leads inevitably to bouncing. There is more than just content diversity on the web, websites also differentiate themselves in regard to look and feel  X  colour, graphics, and design, also provides users with far more choice than simply arises from content. There are simply more things to consider and compare. 6. Discussion
So far we have refrained from making judgements about this form of behaviour, but it is time to consider what can be read into the fact that large numbers of people view a small number of items in a session and do not coming back to a site very often, if at all.

Both components of bouncing behaviour can be considered to be measures of interest and the latter shows satisfaction as well to a certain extent; otherwise why come back? Even after distorting factors have been allowed for care still needs to be taken as to how the two metrics are interpreted. Thus take site penetration, which could be taken for a busyness or activity metric, which it is much of the time, but this does not neces-sarily mean that a session which just views a page or two is not a productive or satisfying one. On the one hand it could represent superficial and shallow searching, resulting from a failure to find what is wanted or, on the other hand, it could represent targeted, skilled and effective searching, possibly, a testament to power of the search engine or prowess of the user. After all users would not bounce if it did not yield information returns; for particular groups of users it is a method that works albeit one associated with a level of casualness and inattention. It could also just be par for the digital information seeking course -neither a negative or positive factor, just a reflection of a digital reality.

The return visits metric is less problematical in conceptual terms but more problematical technically. How-ever, this is the gold standard metric, which the industry calls  X  X ite stickiness X  and regular visits to a site must surely have positive overtones. Clearly, the more times people return the more likely they are to be satisfied with the site or dependent on it, however even here care has to be taken because it is all relative. News sites, for instance, are more likely to attract frequent use because of the sheer turnover in content. Where there is much turnover/great change then it might be expected that there would be frequent visits and, indeed, this is what our work in the newspaper field has demonstrated ( Nicholas et al., 2000 ).
 On the negative side, bouncing behaviour:
Provides strong evidence that people are finding it difficult to find what they want on the web  X  too much content, too much low quality content and too difficult to find content; that is there is failure at the terminal on a large scale.

Provides strong evidence of a dumbed form of information seeking behaviour, which is characterised by an over-reliance on and too much faith in search engine searching, which provides painless but relatively basic searching.

Shows the inefficiencies and failures that arise as a result of disintermediation  X  people searching them-selves, often without any information training and having a low level of information literacy.
 Shows that people are just bewildered by the choice on offer and search engines add to that bewilderment. On the positive side:
It could be the result of targeted and very effective retrieval as a result of search engine effectiveness and an increasingly information savvy user who has been exposed to digital information resources for some years now.

It is the natural consequence of having so much choice and the checking and comparing that is the inev-itable result of such a process. This leads to people ranging widely for information.

It can be explained by a preponderance of fact finding or  X  X nformed X  searching (i.e. as in the case of a stu-dent who has been given a reference) as opposed to browsing.

It would appear most likely that a mix of positive and negative factors are at work. If indeed the negative explanations weigh more heavily, then this has very serious implications for the digital world we increasingly inhabit. Firstly, there is the worry of what will happen as a result of providing to all what might be termed life-critical or strategic public services, like health and education on the web, In the digital drive to provide all kinds of (enhanced) information and advisory services on the Internet  X  and the Government is a prime driver in this, what is often being lost or forgotten is that  X  X ife-dependent X  services, once only ever provided orally and by professionals, are being moved into an information space that is the Internet without detailed consideration having been given to issues of user satisfaction, performance and service usability. It is not life threatening if online users are searching for airline tickets or trying to find a book  X  though still irritating for the user, but could be catastrophic if a user is unable to find the health service they need. There are significant and incal-culable risks that accrue from citizens being overwhelmed by digital information.
Secondly, there are the concerns that arise from the digital inequalities that will arise in a digital universe and which our earlier user analysis has hinted at. We have seen that bouncing behaviour varies amongst the digital population at large and if what is being witnessed is, indeed, a negative form of behaviour then it might be hypothesised that there will be differences between users from different socioeconomic backgrounds (and different levels of digital information literacy). However, at present this is all supposition and we do not know for sure, but clearly there is a pressing need to know. However, in the context of innovation adoption, we do know that there are demographic differences in access to new communications technologies Access is impor-tant, because unless digital consumers can physically avail themselves of online communications systems, they cannot use them. But ensuring a successful outcome to the use of online public services once access is facili-tated the ease of information searching is equally important. 7. Conclusions
We have examined the evidence, outcomes and consequences of large-scale information seeking in a num-ber of digital environments and hundreds of thousands of users and millions of online transactions have been evaluated in this regard. Even allowing for the inaccuracies in measurement outlined, bouncing behaviour is a marked feature of all these environments. This finding could provide ammunition for all those people who have expressed concern about the consequences of widespread and unfettered access to information in an information environment increasingly regulated by search engines.

Although the time online metric has not been employed in the analysis of information seeking behaviour for the reasons given earlier it is nevertheless worth mentioning the results of a time analysis conducted on the
ScienceDirect study ( Nicholas et al., 2006 ). The data lends support to the bouncing model and, possibly, pro-vides further concerns about this form of behaviour. Three findings are especially pertinent: (1) with an aver-age of 20 X 30 s being spent online on each full-text item it is clear that people check, but do not read, online; (2) the longer the article, the greater the likelihood of viewing the article as an abstract or as a summary plus and the less likelihood of it being viewed in a PDF or Full text format; (3) the greatest amount of average (median) online time (42 s) was spent on papers 4 X 10 pages long and the least amount of time (32 s) on those papers 21 pages or more in length. This data raise such questions as are readers avoiding long articles, are abstracts being used as substitutes for articles and if they are being downloaded are they really being read at a later time?
It might be argued that this form of behaviour represents a significant inefficiency in the system and con-stitutes a loss both to the consumer and producer of web site information. The consumer in terms of time wasted in visiting sites that are not used and producer in that their content is unused by many visitors. Does bouncing, at worst, represent failure at the terminal on a large scale? The uncovering of bouncing behaviour on this scale should be a wake up call for governments rapidly migrating public services to the web on the basis that this has to be a public good.

Certainly we can ascribe much (but not all) of this behaviour to a universally popular retrieval model in which the default is to search so much of the world X  X  information resource. This is inevitably going to lead to a very different form of information seeking that prevailed in the largely closed and hard-copy environment of the late Twentieth Century. Searching is certainly no longer a serious activity in terms of though, prepara-tion and execution.

But it is much more complicated than that and what we might be seeing is, at worse, a neutral form of behaviour adapted to instant access, huge digital choice and the ease with which users can move across the information landscape. Or, at best, a sophisticated form of behaviour in which users know precisely what they want.

There cannot be any question that it is a major feature of information seeking on the web. However, there are question marks over the exact scale of bouncing behaviour and there are clearly very important dif-ferences between user groups  X  and the latter is where surely the greatest interest lies as any methodological inaccuracies apply to all groups. The inaccuracies in measurement, something we hope to address in the future, has to be set against the fact that the alternative (asking people about their web behaviour) might be worse.
