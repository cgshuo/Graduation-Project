 In this paper we describe the Knowledge Management approach for the biomedical scientific community developed by SyynX Solutions GmbH [1]. I.2.4 [ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE]: Knowledge Representation Formalisms and Methods -Relation systems, Representations (procedural and rule-based), Semantic Networks. Knowledge management, Mining of unstructured data, trend mining Knowledge management, thesaurus, documentation, publication, natural language texts, classification of research, biomedicine, research management, research trends, expert profiles, semantic analysis. SyynX Solutions GmbH develops web-based applications based on the Collexis Fingerprint technology [2]. In contrast to Boolean search, Fingerprinting analyzes documents semantically instead of just retrieving single words. Key features are the search option with full texts, language-independent search, the analysis of semantic similarities between texts, trend mining and expert profiles extracted from document compositions. The analysis of data is processed in a way so that non-experts can understand them as well. Therefore, new approaches to knowledge retrieval, support for clinical processes and strategic coordination of research institutions have become possible. Both internal documents and publicly accessible data (e.g. Medline, biomedical patents, websites) can be integrated. All applications can be added to the previously existing IT infrastructure. SyynX Solutions develops applications based on the Collexis Fingerprint Technology [3]. The system can create a fingerprint for each piece of text that contains relevant information, such as competence sheets, project descriptions or web pages. The fingerprinting process uses a structure of professional terminology in a particular field (essentially a thesaurus). By doing so it embodies the way humans understand those terms and concepts. The routine that fingerprint information items is also used to create fingerprints from search texts. It handles complete documents as easily as simple text strings. In fact, using a document as a search command (asking for  X  X ore like this X ) defines the search topics much more accurately than one or two keywords and thus yields better retrieval results. The applications developed by SyynX Solutions are targeted to biomedical research institutions, hospitals of any size, pharmaceutical and biotech companies. The applications are designed to serve both the individual scientist and physician as well as the controlling and managing directors of the above mentioned target clients. The acceptance of the solutions within the customer X  X  organisation is increased by adding value to the information systems along all hierarchical levels. For the executives transparancy and strategic coordination of research activity is emphasized, whereas for departments and individual researchers automatic and assisted knowledge retrieval is more important. For research institutions transparency and monitoring of research activities has become an important issue in order to manage human and financial resources effectively. At the moment it is hardly possible for deans of medical faculties and other research executives to oversee all activities of an institution in a satisfying way. With departments operating rather independently strategic orientation and coordination of research output is difficult to handle. But due to falling budgets, rising competition among research institutions benchmarking and efficient allocation of finances and manpower are crucial for future directions. For this purpose existing evaluation procedures are time-consuming and laborious. Relevant parameters like publication output, third party funds etc. need to be obtained  X  X anually X , i.e. by requesting every piece of information separately. Beyond gathering, the information has to be analysed for evaluation purposes. Due to excessively rising amounts of publications a human scan of content becomes increasingly impossible. Furthermore, the monitoring and coordination of big institutions require the aggregation of information at different institutional levels (individual researchers, groups, departments, institution as a whole). Especially for strategic decisions the right answer cannot be found in one single information item, e.g. one single publication. Therefore, clustering of data is necessary in order to reveal the performance of research activities. But the semantic aggregation of documents is a complex and arduous task on the one hand, and influenced by the subjective bias of the reader on the other hand. Adequate solutions for clustering knowledge items in an automated way have not been implemented in the biomedical research domain yet. Apart from internal evaluation benchmarking in the national and international context becomes more and more important. For benchmarking an institution in comparison with others publicly available data need to be processed and clustered so that conclusions can be drawn. The amount of data to analyze exceeds the feasibility within a single institution. For this reason, benchmarking analyses are mainly performed by evaluation departments (CWTS, CEST, BMBF etc.) in nationwide or international rankings in a clearly defined time frame. They are essential for decisions at the political level, but of limited use for the micro-management of research institutions that need a different scale basis and dynamic mapping of their main competitors. Furthermore, decision makers of hospitals are very often non-experts that need to rely on the opinion of experts. Expert-independent information systems that pre-process specialized knowledge for intuitive interpretation for decision makers in the biomedical domain have not been developed so far. For the single researcher keeping up with new literature is essential for his/her own projects. But due to the excessive amount of new publication the conventional  X  X ull X  literature scan is very time-consuming. Embedding  X  X ush X  information automatically into the researcher X  X  workflow according to his/her needs would gain time for other tasks and prevent from losing sight of relevant knowledge discoveries. In the clinical domain the consideration of new scientific knowledge is important in order to adapt therapeutical strategies to research findings. However, the workload of physicians does not allow for extensive literature searches. By  X  X ushing X  the information directly into the physician X  X  working environment the active search could be simplified. But so far matching of scientific knowledge items with the patients diagnoses has not been rendered possible. Pharmaceutical companies are knowledge intensive environments and have to cope with exponentially rising information as well. But the challenges differ from the ones in conventional research settings, e.g., university hospitals, governmental institutions etc. Competitive intelligence from an economic and strategic point of view is much more stressed. The development of new pharmaceutical substances has to catch up with current  X  X pen source X  research findings. The activities of competitors have to be monitored, and qualified scientists for new projects have to be identified. Besides competitive intelligence risk management, especially of side effects, has to be observed carefully and they must be detected as early as possible. Alert systems that routinely scan databases for critical pieces of information and previously undetected adverse r eactions co-occurring together with newly launched drugs can enhance the reliability of risk detection. Furthermore, in Biotech and pharmaceutical domains specific databases with heterogeneous and complex content, e.g. genes, proteins, molecules and drug compositions, are needed. In order to perform searches which integrate the information stored in diverse databases a unifying semantic language is necessary. Combined searches would enable researchers to detect previously unknown relationships between heterogeneous knowledge items. SyynX Research Solutions provide basic knowledge retrieval applications that make use of document fingerprints, the Collexis core technology. The SyynX mediator builds the platform on top of which more custom-built applications are designed. The mediator offers innovative search tools in Medline for physicians and researchers in the field of life sciences. 1 For this application we fingerprinted the complete Medline database. Besides the conventional search procedure with one or more terms the mediator is able to process more extended information such as full texts or ICD codes. During the search process the search text is fingerprinted. The results can be displayed in different ways: the usual result list or a preview of results together with proposed concepts that are helpful to cut down the amount of results to an acceptable size. Furthermore, the results can be aggregated to the respective experts that have published the retrieved articles. By clustering the semantic concepts of each single publication, expert profiles can be created and illustrated. Trend mining is another feature embedded in the mediator. All results can be displayed as timelines that indicate the amount of publications over time. The mediator can be extended for institutional use by integrating internal documents. Thereby, searches can be performed in internal and external databases simultaneously. SyynX Research Management Solutions are specifically designed for research institutions in the biomedical field. They support the strategic coordination and planning of research institutions. By fingerprinting all relevant documents of an institution, e.g. a university hospital, SyynX Knowledge Guides can be built in order to map the research activities at different institutional levels. SyynX established an up-to-date knowledge map for the LBK Hamburg, a multi-site hospital organization, displaying the publication activity from an overall perspective down to small entities such as specific departments and individual experts. By unambiguously assigning the affiliations of each document and aggregating the data for individuals, departments and hospitals the publication activity has been rendered transparent from a top-down perspective. Since the Knowledge Guide is a dynamic www.mediator.syynx.de/en application, because documents are fingerprinted once they are added to the database, changes in the map of activity can be observed as soon as they arise. The effects of strategic decisions on the research activity can constantly be monitored and cooperation potentials within an institution can easily be identified. Equivalent knowledge maps can be created for competitor institutions by accessing publicly available data, especially Medline, as well. The Science Management Application complements the Knowledge Guide. It allows the management a more detailed evaluation of the research performance. It is a suitable tool for evaluating the research activity from different perspectives. Because of heterogeneous evaluation procedures the Science Management Application can be individually tailored to the customer X  X  needs. Publications in Medline and ISI, articles not listed in Medline, the acquisition of third party funds and transfer activities (conferences, education and training, patents) can be considered. If the documents are accessible in c onnected databases they are indexed automatically. Thereby, the retrieval of documents is quicker and more accurate. In order to assess and evaluate the quality of the publication output the Science Management Application (SMA) can be adapted to different evaluation methods. Besides simple ranking with Impact Factors provided by Thomson Scientific Inc. the SMA offers several benchmarking options. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften (AWMF) has introduced the weighted Impact Factor in order to only compare publications in the same biomedical field. Together with the AWMF SyynX is working on implementing the weighted Impact Factor within the Science Management Application. Furthermore SyynX has introduced the  X  X eer document impact level X . It is a new approach that has become possible by automatically identifying  X  X eer documents X  with the help of the Collexis Fingerprint technology. It benchmarks the Impact Factor of a single publication with all publications that have similar content fingerprints. The relevant publications that are clustered to a  X  X eer publication group X  are retrieved automatically with a Collexis search engine. Beyond the single publication, the publication activity of research departments can be benchmarked internationally by analyzing corresponding publications of peer researchers and rectifying the yielded impact factors down to a peer-related unit. In analogy to the evaluation procdure of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) the development of a budget tool as an add-on to the Science Management Application is in process. It is designed to correlate the publication output with the acquisition of third party funds. Furthermore, the assignment of resources (budget, personnel) will be integrated in relation to the quality of publication output as well. SyynX Solutions provides automated search tools for hospitals and biomedical research institutions. The applications are embedded into the customers X  workflow and automatically retrieve relevant internal and external information such as scientific articles, guidelines, or expert profiles that match the user needs. By creating fingerprints for each ICD Code (International Statistical Classification of Diseases) matching relevant documents with patients X  diseases can be performed automatically. The ICD mediator retrieves relevant articles from the connected databases. At the moment we have set up the application with Medline, Cochrane (database with scientific articles and guidelines) and Abdamed (database for pharmaceutical drugs). The results can be displayed according to the user X  X  needs. The user has the option to differentiate between research articles, case reports and guidelines. In university hospitals the databases of clinical trials containing study protocols and other relevant information can be connected. Thereby, suitable patients for clinical trials can be directly identified and recruited. The Case Study Mediator uses the ICD Fingerprints as well. It stores all didactically and clinically interesting patient cases in a specific database. The ICD codes of the stored case reports are matched with relevant research articles or similar case reports. Thereby, clinically produced knowledge is linked to research findings. The knowledge of old case reports is updated with new scientific results. SyynX Clinical Solutions can be completely embedded into the customer X  X  intranet. For further adaptation to the physicians X  working environment we are aiming at implementing the ICD and Case Study Mediator within the user interface of the clinical information system. For this purpose we are working with Clinical IT companies. Competitive intelligence is of major interest for pharmaceutical companies. The Collexis Fingerprint technology the scientific activity of competitors can be mapped faster, and more differentiated analyses of the research output are possible. By assigning the metadata of publicly available documents accurately (author names, name of the company, setting in place and time etc.) competence profiles can be generated for different purposes. By aggregating subsets of publications profiles for experts, departments or certain substances and drugs can be created. The profiles are updated every time a new relevant pi ece of information appears. The literature scan is processed automatically in the background thus enabling the profiling application to offer dynamic functions like  X  X otify me as soon as company X releases a new publication about drug Y X  or  X  X otify me when substance X appears together with new side effects. Such automatic search agents reduce the workload for literature retrieval and make it more reliable to prevent omissions. Thereby, for standard procedures like the Periodical Safety Update Reports a fingerprint for a substance can be prepared in advance to monitor constantly for new relevant publications. The expert profiling can be used for identifying experts in specific research fields either for cooperation or vacant placements. SyynX Solutions provides automated search tools for hospitals and biomedical research institutions. Embedded into the customers X  workflow the applications automatically retrieve relevant internal and external information such as scientific articles, guidelines, or expert profiles that match the user needs. By indexing patient data and the associated metadata of physicians a competence map of physicians for a hospital can be created. The newly developed Case Study Mediator saves and organizes the knowledge gathered by case reports and refreshes them with suitable scientific publications. The SyynX Solutions are web-based applications that can be integrated into any intranet. Embedded into the customers X  existing applications the user gets easily acquainted with the new functions provided by SyynX. They are  X  X ilent add-ons X  that automatically display relevant data where needed or through easy to use search interfaces for knowledge on demand. All applications use the Collexis core engine version 5.0. They are built as an ASP solution accessing the mediator platform. In-house installations are possible as well. The exchange with hospital managers, physicians and researchers has led to the assumption that clinical processes and research evaluation in Germany lack suitable tools that support knowledge management and the strategic use of existing data. In an environment where the scientific community is challenged by restricted funding and competition, the strategic planning of activities has become crucial for the goal-oriented use of budget and human resources. SyynX sheds light on previously indiscernible areas by simply analyzing publicly accessible data. Decision makers often need experts to judge the research activities within an institution. SyynX has learnt on the one hand that complex data can be processed in a way that even non-experts can interpret them, e.g. trends, knowledge maps and the peer document impact level, and on the other hand, that information often does either not reach the right addressee or human resources are wasted by too much inadequate information. Thus, process-oriented knowledge management and knowledge transparency are not only the right things to do, they are the strategic things to do.
