 This overview introduces the aim of the SMUC 2010 work-shop, as well as the list of papers presented in the workshop. H.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Storage and Re-trieval; H.4 [ Information Systems ]: Information Systems Applications; I.2 [ Computing Methodologies ]: Artificial Intelligence; I.7 [ Computing Methodologies ]: Document and Text Processing Documentation, Experimentation, Algorithms search, data mining, text mining, opinion mining, informa-tion retrieval, user-generated contents, social media The 2nd International Workshop on Search and Mining User-generated Contents (SMUC) was be held in Toronto, Canada, as a workshop of the 19th ACM International Con-ference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2010), on October 30, 2010.

SMUC 2010 aims to become a forum for researchers from several Information and Knowledge Management areas like data/text mining, information retrieval, semantics, etc. that apply their work into the fields of Social Media and Opin-ion/Sentiment Analysis where the main goal is to process user generated contents.

User generated content provides an excellent scenario to apply the metaphor of mining any kind of information. In a social media context, users create a huge amount of data where we can look for valuable nuggets of knowledge by applying several search techniques (information retrieval)  X  X  Formal Study of Classification Techniques on Entity Discovery and their Application to Opinion Mining X  focuses on examining the effectiveness of various classification tech-niques on entity discovery and their application to the opin-ion mining task.  X  X lassifying Latent User Attributes in Twitter X  includes a novel investigation of stacked-SVM-based classification algo-rithms over a rich set of original features, applied to classify-ing four latent user attributes (gender, age, regional origin, and political orientation).  X  X pam Detection with a Content-based Random-walk Al-gorithm X  presents a novel approach to web spam detection based on a random-walk algorithm that obtains a ranking of pages according to their relevance and their spam likelihood.  X  X xploiting Web Reviews for Generating Customer Ser-vice Surveys X  proposes a method of automatically generat-ing service surveys through mining Web reviews to address the issue of the subjectivity present on traditional surveys.  X  X haracterization of the Twitter @replies Network: are User Ties Social or Topical? X  presents an exhaustive charac-terization of a dataset from a popular micro-blogging service, Twitter. A quantitative analysis of the users X  interactions in the implicit network derived from tweet replies, is also presented.  X  X ining Social Tags to Predict Mashup Patterns X  pro-poses a tag-based approach for predicting mashup patterns, thus deriving inspiration for potential new mashups from the community X  X  consensus.  X  X  Weighted Tag Similarity Measure Based on a Collab-orative Weight Model X  proposes a weight model for tagging systems that considers the user dimension unlike existing measures based on tag frequency. This work also proposes weighted similarity model that is conceptually different from the contemporary frequency based similarity measures.  X  X ow to Interpret the Helpfulness of Online Product Re-views: Bridging the Needs Between Customers and Design-ers X  focuses on how to automatically build the connection between online customer X  X  voting and designer X  X  rating and predict the customer reviews X  helpfulness based on the re-view content.  X  X eb-based Statistical Fact Checking of Textual Docu-ments X  aims to make use of the web-content to calculate a statistical support score for textual documents.  X  X n the Difficulty of Clustering Company Tweets X  presents and compare a number of different approaches based on clus-tering that determine whether a given tweet refers to a par-ticular company or not.  X  X ross-media Impact on Twitter in Japan X  reports the characteristics of Twitter users in Japan, and the impact of media such as publications, and TV programs on Twitter community.
