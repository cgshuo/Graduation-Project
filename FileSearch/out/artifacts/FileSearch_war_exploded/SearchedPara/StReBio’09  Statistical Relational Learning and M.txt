 Bioinformatics is an application domain where information is naturally represented in terms of relations between het-erogenous objects. Modern experimentation and data acqui-sition techniques allow the study of complex interactions in biological systems. This raises interesting challenges for ma-chine learning and data mining researchers, as the amount of data is huge, some information can not be observed, and measurements may be noisy.
 This report presents a review on the ACM SIGKDD 2009 Workshop on Statistical Relational Learning and Mining in Bioinformatics (StReBio X 09) which was held in Paris on June 28th, 2009. The aim of this workshop was to provide a forum to share challenges, results and ideas at the frontier between the field of statistical relational learning and the field of bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is an application domain where information is naturally represented in terms of relations between het-erogenous objects such as DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides, chemicals, genes and organisms. Modern experimentation and data acquisition techniques allow the study of complex interactions in biological systems. This raises interesting challenges for machine learning and data mining researchers. First, the amount of data is huge and the structure of it is complex. At the same time, there is often a large fraction of missing data (as experiments are expensive, and not ev-erything can be measured), while the available data is noisy due to a wide range of different effects that can interfere with the experiments.
 This report presents a review on the Second Workshop on Statistical Relational Learning and Mining in Bioinformat-ics (StReBio X 09) which was held with ACM-SIGKDD 2009 in Paris, France on June 28th, 2009. The first StReBio workshop was held at ECML/PKDD in Antwerpen, Bel-gium in September 2008. The aim of this workshop was to bring together researchers at the frontier between the field of statistical relational learning [4; 3] and the field of bioinfor-matics [1; 5]. To stimulate interaction between the different fields, next to the regular contributions we invited problem statements and invited a speaker from the field of statistical genetics, David Balding, who attracted quite some atten-tion.
 We will first present a review of the contributions to the workshop. After that, we will conclude with some discussion and perspectives. The invited speaker of this workshop was David Balding, professor of statistical genetics [2] at Imperial College, Lon-don, UK. He presented joint work with Clive Hoggart, John Whittaker and Maria De Iorio on  X  X imultaneous Analysis of all SNPs in Genome-wide and Resequencing Association Studies X . In the invited talk the theme of how to identify multiple causal variants in genome-wide association stud-ies of complex diseases was introduced. Since testing one marker at a time does not exploit the full information avail-able, more complex models are needed taking many SNPs into account simultaneously. In this research the authors employ a recent search method to fit a model where every SNP can be considered for additive, dominant and recessive contributions to disease risk.
 The paper by Lodhi, Muggleton and Sternberg  X  X ulti-Class Protein Fold Recognition using Large Margin Logic based Divide and Conquer Learning X  deals with the task of pro-tein fold multiclassification. The multiclassification is trans-formed into a recursive binary classification problem using dynamic decision lists. The authors propose to use an ILP technique to extract features which are then ranked and selected using an information theoretic measure. Support Vector Machines based on Radial Basis Function kernels are then used as model for the predictive task.
 The paper by Arevalillo and Navarro  X  X sing Random Forests to uncover bivariate interactions in high dimensional small data sets X  tackles the task of detecting pairwise feature in-teractions when data live in high dimensional spaces but are available in small quantities. The authors propose to use the out-of-bag error of an ensemble of decision trees trained in a supervised fashion on a binary classification problem to assess pairwise feature interactions. In order to reduce the computational burden they consider sets of variables and choose the set with the smallest generalization error. That set is then believed to contain the interacting features. The paper by Kecselj, Liu, Zeh, Blouin and Whidden  X  X ind-ing Optimal Parameters for Edit-Distance Based Sequence Classification is NP-Hard X  deals with the complexity analy-ses of finding optimal parameters for edit-distance measures. Optimality is defined in respect of the accuracy achievable by a 1-nearest-neighbour classifier in the induced metric space. The authors motivate the relevance of the study with a bioinformatic application for the assessment of similarity between strings representing sentences in natural text that talk about interactions of proteins.
 The paper by H  X am  X al  X ainen  X  X ift-based search for significant dependencies in dense data sets X  tackles the task of detect-ing dependencies between binary attributes that can be ex-pressed as association rules. The author proposes to use the notion of  X  X ift X  to build an anti-monotonic goodness mea-sure called  X  X otentially significant X , which is then used to prune the search space for interesting association rules. The main concern of the author is to find a small set of less  X  X e-dundant X  rules (redundancy is defined once again using the lift notion). The experimental verification is done over a set of 5 biological/medical datasets and results are compared against the Apriori approach.
 The paper by Cheng, Lu and Li  X  X dentification of struc-turally important amino acids in proteins by graph-theoretic measures X  deals with the task of identifying single residues in a protein that are responsible for the ovearll stability of the protein. The authors propose to use the graph theoreti-cal notion of minimum vertex cover to rank single residues. As the proposed measure is NP-complete, the authors sug-gest a greedy approximation which boils down to iteratively remove vertices according to their degree. The authors find that this measure has a good linear correlation with the sta-bility of the residue as numerically computed via software simulation. The rank is shown to be a better indicator as compared to betweenness and spectral methods, although from the experimental section is not clear if the comparison happens on an equal basis.
 The paper  X  X omparing Graph-based Representations of Pro-tein for Mining Purposes X  by Saidi, Maddouri and Nguifo deals with the preprocessing of protein data so that a rep-resentation (often graph-based) suitable for mining is ob-tained. They criticize existing methods from the perspective of a graph-theoretic analysis of important properties of pro-teins, and propose and evaluate a way to enhance existing methods.
 The paper by Obradovic, Midic and Dunker,  X  X rotein Se-quence Alignment and Intrinsic Disorder: A Substitution Matrix for an Extended Alphabet X  proposes a way to extend substitution matrices, commonly used in protein alignment algorithms, to deal with intrinsically disordered proteins. This is achieved by extending the alphabet and using an it-erative algorithm to estimate the associated matrix. This method performs well on realistic datasets.
 Next to these regular contribution, the workshop featured also a problem statement. In  X  X an we improve on the iden-tification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites using string kernels? X , Hugh Shanahan presents the problem of finding small sequences (TFBS X  X ) with very specific properties in large non-coding regions of DNA. Relational information (i.e., across individuals/species) about the position and na-ture of TFBS X  X  is becoming available, but mining this re-quires the deployment of new methods. Finding non-local correlations between TFBS X  X  is another challenge, and string kernels seem a good candidate for dealing with this aspect. An SVM with mismatch string kernel is reported to outper-form existing methods. In this paper we presented a brief review of the StReBio X 09 workshop. The workshop brought together researchers from the field of data mining and bioinformatics to exchange chal-lenges, ideas and findings.
 We hope this workshop contributed to the communication between experts and a better understanding of the numer-ous aspects of the biological problems and the computational and statistical methods. It is clear that the interaction be-tween the involved fields will remain essential for progress in the future.
