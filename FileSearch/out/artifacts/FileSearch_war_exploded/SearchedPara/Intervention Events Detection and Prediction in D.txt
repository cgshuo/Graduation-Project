 With the rapid development of modern sensor device technology, huge data are gen-erated every day in forms of stream, Data streams have raised challenges to data min-with intervention is specially difficult but meaningful. Motivating example. Consider the traffic prediction on the freeway: There is a loop-sensor located on the Glendale on-ramp to the 101-North freeway in Los Angeles. stadium. By investigating the variation in stream, people detect the game event occurred in the stadium as illustrated in Fig.1. distribution in time window is following some interesting rules. The shapes of traffic happened. The event monitors will check associated media news and conclude that there is a game play during date 3.
The above principle about intervention can be applied in many fields, such as: birth defect analysis, nuclear leak detection, malfunction detection, and so on. Mining this new knowledge brings special challenges: How to detect intervention events adap-pacts? How to apply the mining results of intervention events? Researchers proposed many (traditional) mining methods to deal with the problems in data streams [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The literatures [10, 11] gave frameworks based on regression analysis to deal with incidents detective and trends analysis. Due to the limitation of regression, it only analyzes changes in a local scope. Thus regression is to mine the data stream, but it needs prior distribution judging. This limits the applica-tion objects and causes high computation cost. Literature [13] proposed a high-order model  X  X oncept Drift X  to reveal the rule behind the varying of data. However, current its concepts, and then to monitor the varyin g of data stream. For those researches on  X  X oncept drift X  ignore the backward direction. This would bring new problems, such evaluate the change rate of these patterns, and how to predict their impact to the data paper. According to the motivating example, we have the following assumption: Stability Assumption. During the process of a data stream, if no outside intervention intervention events happened. 3.1 Basic Definitions and Terminologies are listed as Tab. 1. 
Complexion Entropy (C E ) is borrowed from thermodynamics. It describes mole-status of stream in t-th Window (W t ). We call the newly distribution-describe variance as Complexity Entropy (C E ). It can be calculated as: Observation 1. Consider an intervention observation system. Denote observation distribution at time t as Distr (t): Then th ere exists threshold h such that, SquareSum (S CE (t1), S CE (t 2 )) &lt;= h implies Distr(t1)  X  Distr (t2). temporal sequence, S CE (t) be sequence of C E value in date t , and N(t) be the value of P (t) (or abbr. P (t) when S is understood) is defined as follows: cant difference value of observation sequence O(t) (t=0,1,2,...).Suppose that interven-the input data stream); (b) intervention events sequence. Assume the variation of stream is caused by the varying of intervention events sequence. (2) The Intervention Intensity at time t of intervention event E , denoted as I (t), is defined as: Definition 3. The Interven tion Events Scheduler (IES) is defined as a 4-tuple, ( O (t), Q, P, C, S(t)), where: (2) Q={q 1 ,q 2 ,...q n } is a finite set of intervention events; (3) M t is the transition matrix between intervention events; (4) M C is the confusion transition matrix between intervention events and observa-Observation 2. In IES model, state sequences S(t) is a Markov chain. This section proposes three algorithms to implement the Intervention Events Sched-uler (IES) model, and all the algorithms are designed in one data scan style. The main structure of IES is listed in Fig.2 (a). Fig. 2 (b), the key idea of Interv-detect is as follows: Computes the sum of square of happening of intervention events by contrasting the P s (t) with threshold. needed by IES model, including: states transition matrix, confusion matrix between states and observations. Algorithm Intervention-Prediction gives the methods to predict intervention events and the details are listed in the Fig. 3(b). The experiments are conducted on a Linux machine with a 1.7GHZ CPU and 512 Mb downloaded from UCI Machine Repository. It is generated by a loop sensor around 50,400 traffic records, and 67 events. 5.1 Experiment ness and completeness of our algorithms are analyzed. The final result of IES analysis is listed in the Fig. 4. The entire observed traffic data set (from April to October) was process efficiency is inverse correlated to the window size d. 
In experiment 2, half of the detected events in last experiment were used as train-ing, and the rest were used to verify the results of prediction.
