 Wordnets are intricate and substantive reposito-ries of lexical knowledge and have become im-portant resources for computational processing of natural languages and for information retrieval. Good quality Wordnets are available only for a few "resource-rich" languages such as English and Japanese. Published approaches to automatically build new Wordnets are manual or semi-automatic and can be used only for languages that already possess some lexical resources.

The Princeton Wordnet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) was painstakingly constructed manually over many decades. Wordnets, except the PWN, have been usually constructed by one of two ap-proaches. The first approach translates the PWN to T (Bilgin et al., 2004), (Barbu and Mititelu, 2005), (Kaji and Watanabe, 2006), (Sagot and Fi X er, 2008), (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) and (Oliver and Climent, 2012); while the second ap-proach builds a Wordnet in T , and then aligns it with the PWN by generating translations (Gu-nawan and Saputra, 2010). In terms of popular-ity, the first approach dominates over the second approach. Wordnets generated using the second approach have different structures from the PWN; however, the complex agglutinative morphology, culture specific meanings and usages of words and phrases of target languages can be maintained. In contrast, Wordnets created using the first approach have the same structure as the PWN.

One of our goals is to automatically gener-ate high quality synsets, each of which is a set of cognitive synonyms, for Wordnets having the same structure as the PWN in several languages. Therefore, we use the first approach to construct Wordnets. This paper discusses the first step of a project to automatically build core Wordnets for languages with low amounts of resources (viz., Arabic and Vietnamese), resource-poor languages (viz., Assamese) or endangered languages (viz., of freely existing resources, if any, for these lan-guages vary, but are not usually high. Hence, our second goal is to use a limited number of freely available resources in the target languages as in-put to our algorithms to ensure that our methods can be felicitously used with languages that lack much resource. In addition, our approaches need to have a capability to reduce noise coming from the existing resources that we use. For transla-tion, we use a free machine translator (MT) and restrict ourselves to using it as the only "dictio-nary" we can have. For research purposes, we have obtained free access to the Microsoft Translator, which supports translations among 44 languages. In particular, given public Wordnets aligned to the PWN ( such as the FinnWordNet (FWN) (Lind X n, 2010) and the JapaneseWordNet (JWN) (Isahara et al., 2008) ) and the Microsoft Translator, we build Wordnet synsets for arb, asm, dis, ajz and vie . In this section, we propose approaches to create Wordnet synsets for a target languages T using ex-isting Wordnets and the MT and/or a single bilin-gual dictionary. We take advantage of the fact that every synset in PWN has a unique offset-POS , referring to the offset for a synset with a partic-ular part-of-speech (POS) from the beginning of its data file. Each synset may have one or more words, each of which may be in one or more synsets. Words in a synset have the same sense. The basic idea is to extract corresponding synsets for each offset-POS from existing Wordnets linked to PWN, in several languages. Next, we translate extracted synsets in each language to T to produce so-called synset candidates using MT. Then, we apply a ranking method on these candidates to find the correct words for a specific offset-POS in T . 2.1 Generating synset candidates We propose three approaches to generate synset candidates for each offset-POS in T . 2.1.1 The direct translation (DR) approach The first approach directly translates synsets in PWN to T as in Figure 1.
 Figure 1: The DR approach to construct Wordnet synsets in a target language T .

For each offset-POS , we extract words in that synset from the PWN and translate them to the tar-get language to generate translation candidates. 2.1.2 Approach using intermediate Wordnets To handle ambiguities in synset translation, we propose the IW approach as in Figure 2. Publicly available Wordnets in various languages, which we call intermediate Wordnets, are used as re-sources to create synsets for Wordnets. For each offset-POS , we extract its corresponding synsets from intermediate Wordnets. Then, the extracted synsets, which are in different languages, are translated to T using MT to generate synset candi-dates. Depending on which Wordnets are used and the number of intermediate Wordnets, the num-ber of candidates in each synset and the number of synsets in the new Wordnets change.
 Figure 2: The IW approach to construct Wordnet synsets in a target language T 2.1.3 Approach using intermediate Wordnets The IW approach for creating Wordnet synsets de-creases ambiguities in translations. However, we need more than one bilingual dictionary from each intermediate languages to T . Such dictionaries are not always available for many languages, espe-cially the ones that are resource poor. The IWND approach is like the IW approach, but instead of translating immediately from the intermediate lan-guages to the target language, we translate synsets extracted from intermediate Wordnets to English ( eng ), then translate them to the target language. The IWND approach is presented in Figure 3. Figure 3: The IWND approach to construct Word-net synsets 2.2 Ranking method For each of offset-POS , we have many translation candidates. A translation candidate with a higher rank is more likely to become a word belonging to the corresponding offset-POS of the new Wordnet in the target language. Candidates having the same ranks are treated similarly. The rank value in the range 0.00 to 1.00. The rank of a word w , the so-called rank w , is computed as below. where:
Our motivation for this rank formula is the fol-lowing. If a candidate has a higher occurrence count, it has a greater chance to become a cor-rect translation. Therefore, the occurrence count of each candidate needs to be taken into account. We normalize the occurrence count of a word by dividing it by numCandidates . In addition, if a candidate is translated from different words hav-ing the same sense in different languages, this can-didate is more likely to be a correct translation. Hence, we multiply the first fraction by numDst-Wordnets . To normalize, we divide results by the number of intermediate Wordnet used.

For instance, in our experiments we use 4 in-termediate Wordnets, viz., PWN, FWN, JWN and WOLF Wordnet (WWN) (Sagot and Fi X er, 2008). The words in the offset-POS "00006802-v" ob-tained from all 4 Wordnets, their translations to arb , the occurrence count and the rank of each translation are presented in the second, the fourth and the fifth columns, respectively, of Figure 4. 2.3 Selecting candidates based on ranks We separate candidates based on three cases as be-low.

Case 1: A candidate w has the highest chance to become a correct word belonging to a specific synset in the target language if its rank is 1.0. This means that all intermediate Wordnets contain the synset having a specific offset-POS and all words belonging to these synsets are translated to the Figure 4: Example of calculating the ranks of candidates translated from words belonging to the offset-POS "00006802-v" in 4 Wordnets: PWN, FWN, JWN and WWN. The word A , word B and respectively. The JWN does not contain this offset-POS . TL presents transliterations of the words in arb . The numWordnets is 4 and the numCandi-dates is 7. The rank of each candidate is shown in the last column of Figure 4. same word w . The more the number of intermedi-ate Wordnets used, the higher the chance the can-didate with the rank of 1.0 has to become the cor-rect translation. Therefore, we accept all transla-tions that satisfy this criterion. An example of this scenario is presented in Figure 5.
 Figure 5: Example of Case 1: Using the IW ap-proach with four intermediate Wordnets, PWN, FWN, JWN and WWN. All words belonging to the offSet-POS "00952615-n" in all 4 Wordnets are translated to the same word "  X i X  X  " in vie . The word "  X i X  X  " is accepted as the correct word be-longing to the offSet-POS "00952615-n" in the Vietnamese Wordnet we create.

Case 2: If an offSet-POS does not have candi-dates having the rank of 1.0, we accept the candi-dates having the greatest rank. Figure 6 shows the example of the second scenario.

Case 3: If all candidates of an offSet-POS has the same rank which is also the greatest rank, we Figure 6: Example of Case 2: Using the IW ap-proach with three intermediate Wordnets, PWN, FWN and WWN. For the offSet-POS "01437254-v", there is no candidate with the rank of 1.0. The highest rank of the candidates in "vie" is 0.67 which is the word g X  X  . We accept " g X  X  " as the cor-rect word in the offSet-POS "01437254-v" in the Vietnamese Wordnet we create. skip these candidates. Table 1 gives an example of the last scenario.
 Table 1: Example of Case 3: Using the DR ap-proach. For the offSet-POS "00010435-v", there is no candidate with the rank of 1.0. The highest rank of the candidates in vie is 0.33. All of 3 can-didates have the rank as same as the highest rank. Therefore, we do not accept any candidate as the correct word in the offSet-POS "00010435-v" in the Vietnamese Wordnet we create. 3.1 Publicly available Wordnets The PWN is the oldest and the biggest available Wordnet. It is also free. Wordnets in many However, only a few of these Wordnets are of high quality and free for downloading. The EuroWord-net (Vossen, 1998) is a multilingual database with Wordnets in European languages (e.g., Dutch, Ital-a platform for building and sharing Wordnets for Asian languages (e.g., Mongolian, Thai and Viet-namese). Unfortunately, the progress in building most of these Wordnets is slow and they are far from being finished.
In our current experiments as mentioned ear-lier, we use the PWN and other Wordnets linked to the PWN 3.0 provided by the Open Multilingual FWN and JWN. Table 2 provides some details of the Wordnets used.
 Table 2: The number of synsets in the Wordnets linked to the PWN 3.0 are obtained from the Open Multilingual Wordnet, along with the percentage of synsets covered from the semi-automatically compiled list of 5,000 "core" word senses in PWN. Note that synsets which are not linked to the PWN are not taken into account.

For languages not supported by MT, we use three additional bilingual dictionaries: two dictio-naries Dict(eng,ajz ) and Dict(eng,dis) provided by Xobdo 5 ; one Dict(eng,asm) created by integrat-ing two dictionaries Dict(eng,asm) provided by ing qualities and sizes. The total number of entries in Dict(eng,ajz) , Dict(eng,asm) and Dict(eng,dis) are 4682, 76634 and 6628, respectively. 3.2 Experimental results and discussion As previously mentioned, our primary goal is to build high quality synsets for Wordnets in lan-guages with low amount of resources: ajz, asm, arb, dis and vie . The number of Wordnet synsets we create for arb and vie using the DR approach and the coverage percentage compared to the PWN synsets are 4813 (4.10%) and 2983 (2.54%), respectively. The number of synsets for each Wordnet we create using the IW approach with different numbers of intermediate Wordnets and the coverage percentage compared to the PWN synsets are presented in Table 3.

For the IWND approach, we use all 4 Wordnets as intermediate resources. The number of Wordnet synsets we create using the IWND approach are presented in Table 4. We only construct Wordnet synsets for ajz , asm and dis using the IWND ap-App. Lang.

 Table 4: The number of Wordnets synsets we cre-ate using the IWND approach.

Finally, we combine all of the Wordnet synsets we create using different approaches to generate the final Wordnet synsets. Table 5 presents the fi-nal number of Wordnet synsets we create and their coverage percentage.
 Table 5: The number and the average score of Wordnets synsets we create.

Evaluations were performed by volunteers who use the language of the Wordnet as mother tongue. To achieve reliable judgment, we use the same set of 500 offSet-POS s, randomly chosen from the synsets we create. Each volunteer was requested to evaluate using a 5-point scale  X  5: excellent, 4: good, 3: average, 2: fair and 1: bad. The aver-age score of Wordnet synsets for arb, asm and vie are 3.82, 3.78 and 3.75, respectively. We notice that the Wordnet synsets generated using the IW approach with all 4 intermediate Wordnets have the highest average score: 4.16/5.00 for arb and 4.26/5.00 for vie . We are in the process of finding volunteers to evaluate the Wordnet synsets for ajz and dis .

It is difficult to compare Wordnets because the languages involved in different papers are differ-ent, the number and quality of input resources vary and the evaluation methods are not standard. How-ever, for the sake of completeness, we make an at-tempt at comparing our results with published pa-pers. Although our score is not in terms of percent-age, we obtain the average score of 3.78/5.00 (or informally and possibly incorrectly, 75.60% preci-sion) which we believe it is better than 55.30% ob-tained by (Bond et al., 2008) and 43.20% obtained by (Charoenporn et al., 2008). In addition, the av-erage coverage percentage of all Wordnet synsets we create is 44.85% which is better than 12% in (Charoenporn et al., 2008) and 33276 synsets ( ' 28.28%) in (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) .

The previous studies need more than one dic-tionary to translate between a target language and intermediate-helper languages. For exam-ple, to create the JWN, (Bond et al., 2008) needs the Japanese-Multilingual dictionary, Japanese-English lexicon and Japanese-English life sci-ence dictionary. For asm , there are a number of Dict(eng,asm); to the best of our knowledge only two online dictionaries, both between eng and asm , are available. The IWND approach re-quires only one input dictionary between a pair of languages. This is a strength of our method. We present approaches to create Wordnet synsets for languages using available Wordnets, a public MT and a single bilingual dictionary. We create Wordnet synsets with good accuracy and high cov-erage for languages with low resources ( arb and vie ), resource-poor ( asm ) and endangered ( ajz and dis ). We believe that our work has the potential to construct full Wordnets for languages which do not have many existing resources. We are in the process of creating a Website where all Wordnet synsets we create will be available, along with a user friendly interface to give feedback on individ-ual entries. We will solicit feedback from commu-nities that use these languages as mother-tongue. Our goal is to use this feedback to improve the quality of the Wordnet synsets. Some of Word-net synsets we created can be downloaded from http://cs.uccs.edu/  X  linclab/projects.html.
