 paper-centered flow, asynchronous communication, with more expressive interaction made only in small groups. knowledge is a resource which needs to be managed is relatively recent. Even though competences, and resource waste by the repetition of mistakes and the reinvention of already-known and consolidated solutions. 
Some attempts to improve knowledge dissemination have been made in the information technology must lead to more a fundamental change than automating and technology may fundamentally change the way in which scientists work, collaborate, and, consequently, create, organize, and disseminate their knowledge. 
Based on these issues, we have developed a web environment the purpose of which organizations. Our approach envisions personal knowledge management, process management  X  allowing the reuse of models and rationale capture, collaboration tools what knowledge may be present, as the way of when, how, and to whom it could be techniques were intensive and they are used to filter the amount of information to be provided. Selective dissemination of information was created to deploy automatically important information to communities. Our approach is based on a national ontology of Science, and provides mechanisms to enrich this one. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses a number explained in section 4. The following section (section 5) describes some related work and the difference with our approach. Future works and the conclusion are shown in section 6. The nature of knowledge has been a matter of intense discussion since the beginning of philosophy [12]. Much research has sought to refine the concept of knowledge and knowledge was Socrates [6], and, for him, knowing a subject or concept consisted of defined as true. In other words, scientific knowledge is the knowledge resulting from solution to a problem, relative to a certain issue [19]. The most common approach to knowledge and scientific knowledge? 
The first difference is related to the analysis of the data used and of the knowledge constant alterations. knowledge who do not share a common background can interact by exchanging (Producer-Consumer). flow in scientific environments are usually more restricted, and occur among a small scientific collaboration proposed by [17] can be applied easily. Knowledge organization has always been recognized as an area of research and study by professionals of different domains. Computing Science professionals are currently that is, of semantic. 
In knowledge organization, especially in the Science and Technology scenario, we have been improving the knowledge organization area in the information technology context [5; 3]. concept categorization. The main issue is whether a unique classification can be a complex approach of the knowledge aggregation becomes impossible. LANGRIDGE [14] emphasizes that the disciplines. organization and classification. The first issue classification pointed by LANGRIDGE [14] mentions that the same objects can be classified in different ways, depending on different names. Then, identifying new areas of Science, capturing temporal changes for any effort to Brazilian scientific production. and the reinvention of already-known and consolidated solutions. weaknesses (scientific areas with insufficient production and few researchers). institutions. Based on this scenario, we developed the GCC. Our approach allows for Knowledge Area classification, from e-meeting logs, projects definition, mental maps, improvement of a unique ontology, incorporating new scientific knowledge areas and management in personal and organization aspects, facilitates the knowledge capture in described in next section. COPPE 2  X  (Knowledge Management in COPPE). The GCC architecture, as shown in Figure 1, is detailed in the following sections. 
The GCC services and main functionalities are:  X  the researchers X   X  X urriculum vitae X , weblogs and mental maps.  X 
Project Management Services  X  manage scientific project execution, enabling the knowledge in the activities of a process.  X 
Community Services  X  allow for easy and quick communication, providing tools for synchronous and asynchronous collaboration and dissemination of information and knowledge to communities.  X 
Knowledge Visualization and Navigation Services  X  displays knowledge and its relationships in a more intuitive and visual way  X  differently from common reports, allowing the user to interact with the information, navigate and access it.

Analysis Services -Our proposal uses tree kinds of analysis services: i) reports of in a community and the evolution of concepts (new knowledge created, merger of arousing the possibility for collaboration. 
The GCC is a proactive environment, that is, capable of taking initiative according providing distributed scientific knowledge in a single and accessible system. with knowledge which flows in the GCC, such as personal knowledge, competences, new knowledge concepts and definition. 
The Services are discussed in more detail below. 4.1 Personal KM Services This module is responsible for providing functions for a researcher to manage his/her services such as: 4.1.1 Curriculum Vitae enables the importation of curricula from CV-Lattes System, a kind of CNPq system. which Knowledge Areas he/she acts and what his/her competences and his/her degree represented in the CNPq classification, in which the user works and has some fluency. he/she is not an expert yet. 4.1.2 Personal Blog Weblogs may be viewed as personal Web pages or "home pages". The term refers to a on the World Wide Web. Many say that weblogs comprise an electronic-diary, but in the GCC this acts as a tool to provide personal knowledge management. Weblogs, in general, have a number of features which are as follows:  X  some topics about his/her individual's profile.  X 
There is also no prescribed length for a post -some posts simply consist of a single and/or personal commentary on the issue under discussion. In the GCC this may be information about successful or unsuccessful experiments, lesson notes, and other kinds of scientific information.  X  published daily in the Web. As it is impossible to read it, people need the means of weblog operates in much the same manner. By reading a weblog that is edited by obtain a tailor-made publication and contact with researchers with the same interest as yours.  X 
Frequent updates  X  which are displayed in reverse chronological order can show chronological record of your thoughts, knowledge, references and other notes that could otherwise be lost or disorganized. researcher who uses them, such as: identify: a researcher X  X  personal interests, his/her competences, and knowledge areas cited, and infer which areas are connected and how they are connected. 4.1.3 Mental Maps creatively constructs our own maps, then these will be different from everyone else's styles, and even perceived shared experiences differently. GCC. react to the world around us and give meaning to our experiences and behaviors. No compassionate maps are those which make available the wisest and richest number of discover new definitions, learn and enrich the domain. 4.2 Project Management Services permit knowledge reuse. 4.2.1 Define and Execute a Project consequently, can perform this activity better. 4.2.2 Knowledge Storage During the Project model itself is a kind of knowledge which should be stored for further access. 4.2.3 Knowledge Reuse Previous process-models and the knowledge described in their activity can be reuses totally or partially by other users. 4.3 Community Services One of the main focus in the GCC is virtual-community creation, created by groups of together. This module displays some tools to improve the interaction between people in a community, such as:  X  members. The presentation of the survey is random and the questioner can change inquires and their response percentage.  X  for asynchronous communication.  X 
News  X  Any member of a community can send news about related topics, such as links and external materials which underlie it.  X 
Scheduled E-meetings  X  A member can ask for a private and synchronous e-meeting with another member, as in the case of an inexperienced researcher asking for an explanation of a doubt from an expert researcher. Then, the member invites confirmed and appointed in the community schedule.  X 
Public library  X  A space to display electronic material and links.  X 
Log Categorization and Storage  X  All conversation of an e-meeting is stored and categorized in one or more Knowledge Areas. This is important because a conversation or interview is a kind of explicit knowledge which could be consulted in the future, avoiding future interviews and accelerating the knowledge capture.  X 
Community Evaluation  X  Several metrics are used to control the community evaluation and the member interactio n. All evaluations are public.  X  posted here. 4.4 Knowledge Visualization and Navigation Services effectively with the online systems. Based on these complains, more than the reports, lists and graphics visualization provided by the GCC, the environment has two more the Conceptual Project Map. 4.4.1 Hyperbolic Tree Classification. The user can navigate by the CNPQ classification, as shown in Figure competences, people (in blue), communities, and etc. 4.4.2 Conceptual Project Map which matches. their interests and expertise enhances the chances of collaboration. The GCC provides for competences and iii)Web Miner, a way of tracking pages the user accesses when navigating the Internet and identifying topics of his/her interest. 4.5.1 S-Miner words are precisely originated, we can say that a document is represented by a vector for example: CONNECT, CONNECTED, CONNECTING, CONNECTION, CONNECTIONS. Then, after having the words, stemming to count the relevance of a term is applied. Terms are related to a person X  X  competence, and these competences database. 
Besides, these filtered words, named Relevant Words, are submitted to the report provided by the application. 4.5.2 Competence Search This is a service which provides a list of people with specific competence to perform searched following this order of priority:  X  Declared competences  X  the competences which the researcher declares to have in 
GCC or Curriculum Lattes.  X  competence needed.  X  by S-Miner.  X  researcher participates or contributes. 
In addition, the Competence Searcher includes distinctive weights for each type of competence found: Declared competences-weig ht 3, Project competences-weight 2, not to misrepresent the analysis. 
While the competences above are gathered, the Competence Searcher identifies the accumulation of weights, since this action is only used in the absence of competence linked straight. 4.5.3 Web Miner users with similar interests. 4.6 Collaborative Filter user based on the stated preferences of other, similar users and communities. We use related documents and disposed to communities. 4.7 Inference Engine process, cases or solutions, and reusable content. 4.8 Analyses Services communities and comparative analysis by researchers, departments and organizations. These kinds of analysis are especially useful to:  X  research team;  X 
Make the identification of knowledge areas with a shortage of professional researcher recruiting;  X 
Make the regular appraisal of each researcher's knowledge level possible;  X 
Analyze chances of external collaboration;  X 
Analyze the quality of an institution; and  X  Identify the appearance, death and merging of knowledge areas Business Intelligence to the other issues. Some work the purpose of which is to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration among researchers has been created, although focus was different as in:  X 
Research Environment) [17].  X  The CLARE [21] is a CSCL environment (Computer-Supported Cooperative 
Learning) which aims at scientific knowledge creation by cooperative learning. For this, CLARE uses a semiformal representation language called RESRA and a process model called SECAI.  X 
The Science Desk Project[18] is developed by NASA and its purpose is the development of a computational infrastructure and a suite of collaborative tools to support the day-to-day activities of science teams. of Knowledge Management Systems, the ISKM ( X  X ntegrated Systems for Knowledge natural resource management domain. 
Our approach differs significantly from the above mentioned because major management, because experts and their knowledge are the most important assets in a recognition of groups with common interests, diminishing the amount of time spent in the coordination of team work and expediting the project problem solution processes. knowledge areas and correlate them. thereby enriching Science Ontology used in Brazil. identify knowledge areas in order to: i)improve communication among people, emerging knowledge areas. 
Currently, the GCC is a centralized-base environment. As future work, we envision extending it to a distributed scenario. Moreover, we will measure how much the GCC disseminate it, their learning and collaborating. universities and research centers in Brazil.
