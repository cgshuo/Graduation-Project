 1. Introduction
Dictionaries have weakly structured contents entries, describing the information relative to each lexical unit. At the same time, it has been demonstrated that the structure of the articles in the dictionaries signifi-cantly changes from one dictionary to another.

This study proposes a formal XML scheme model for Spanish language dictionaries that allows represen-tation of the structure and contents that are most relevant for natural language processing in XML format.
The main objectives are the following: (a) consider only the information inherent to the entity being defined, (b) appropriately structure the information in such a way that it allows efficient searches, and (c) allow inte-gration with other linguistic tools and technologies. Information that is more related to the lexical unit than to the semantics represented X  X uch as morphology X  X s not included in the XML design, as in the Spanish lan-guage this is highly irregular and can be obtained by means of linguistic tools that solve the problem ( Santana, Pe  X  rez, Carreras, Herna  X  ndez, &amp; Rodr X   X  guez, 2003 ).

We have opted to use the XML standard as a container of the information inherent in the electronic dic-tionaries as the starting information X  X rinted dictionaries X  X s given in a semi-structured way. In a relational database, this information would produce few tables with a large number of fields with void values or a large number of tables. XML complies with the requirements for storing the lexical resources, explained in detail in
Bird and Gary (2002) . Bird proposed storing this type of information in accessible and non-proprietary for-mats, so it can be easily shared between applications.

As a method for representing the information in the XML document, we have chosen the recommendations of W3C XML Scheme instead of DTD (Document Type Definition). The XML Scheme is currently consid-ered a replacement of DTD, and both are used to define restrictions in the XML documents. In contrast to
DTD, the XML Scheme provides strongly typed data and support for the name spaces and, as it is based on XML, it is also extendable ( Dongwon &amp; Chu, 2000 ).

Once the dictionaries have been built in this format, they can be stored in relational databases with XML support, or in XML native databases, thereby becoming very valuable tools in the field of computational lin-guistics. For example, by means of a Java interface and XSL transformations we could present the results of queries in different media, such as HTML pages, mobile devices by means of WAP, or implement web services for dialogues between applications.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss related work. Section 3 describes the formal scheme proposed. The representation in XMLSchema of the model proposed is shown in Section 4 . In Section 5 we compare our scheme with the TEI proposal. We provide justification of the pro-posed model in Section 6 . In Section 7 we describe the validation of our approach. We touch on future work in
Section 8 and conclude in Section 9 . 2. Similar studies
The encoding of the information present in printed dictionaries has been a matter that has been extensively dealt with, although a good number of the studies have been aimed at English dictionaries. For example, Ide, Ve  X  ronis, Warwick-Armstrong, and Calzolari (1992) drafted, in accordance with the first works from the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), several guides for encoding dictionaries.

Then, in Ide and Ve  X  ronis (1995) , the main problems encountered when designing a codification format for dictionaries were described. They highlighted, firstly, the conflict between the generality of a description, for-mulated in such a way that it is applicable to other dictionaries, and the capacity to precisely describe the spe-cific structure of any dictionary. Secondly, they mentioned the need to accommodate various views and applications of the encoded dictionary, for example as a printed object and as an information database.
Without any doubt whatsoever, the approaches most widely recognised and accepted by the international community are those put into effect by the Text Encoding Initiative. In Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard (1994) , a series of basic tags were defined for the encoding of mono-and multilingual dictionaries with human beings in mind, taking printed dictionaries as a reference. This recommendation was later transposed to the
XML standard ( Sperberg-McQueen &amp; Burnard, 2004, chap. 12 ). Other studies have also appeared, dealing with the identification of the essential information fields that appear in dictionaries; Amsler and Tompa (1998) made an extensive proposal on the tags and attributes that should be used to characterise the informa-tion contained in dictionaries.

Nevertheless, all of these studies have been mainly determined by the format of printed dictionaries, whose restrictions limit the development of the models, including a more effective subjacent structure of the lexical information ( Ide, Kilgarriff, &amp; Romary, 2000 ). Therefore, as already indicated by Nancy Ide, the recommen-dation for the codification of electronic dictionaries provided by the TEI does not provide a sufficiently concise description to be efficiently used in the codification of the information scheme of the electronic dictionaries. the proposed DTD and described some of the problems in its use.

Other researchers are also using the XML recommendation as a framework for the information included in dictionaries ( Berger, Reitter, &amp; Stede, 2002 ) although, as already indicated by some of them, the use of these technologies and their potentials are only starting to be explored.

This work is the first to design an XML scheme specifically for Spanish treatment. Our proposal also lacks the ambiguity the TEI encoding specification has. We have designed a formal XML scheme able to support, in addition to English, the main Spanish dictionaries, and it may be easily extended to support other languages. The main aim of our proposal is to develop a means of better representing the information in the dictionaries.
This opens a window towards future electronic dictionaries as sources of lexical and morphological wealth. A solid, robust and versatile design allows the development of different interfaces according to necessity and the destination of the information. 3. Formal model of the mono-lingual electronic dictionary: MOFDEM Dictionaries store and organise data structures that we call entries. As indicated in Sperberg-McQueen and
Burnard (2004, chap. 12) , a simple dictionary entry should include the following information: the form of the word, the grammar class, the definition, synonyms, translation to other languages, etymology, references to other entries, usages and examples.

Therefore, every entry of the dictionary provides a description of a certain word by means of a series of attributes. For the construction of this scheme we have identified the types of information shown in dictionar-ies: etymology, definition, grammar category, etc. The hierarchy of the elements has been determined and they have been labelled with explicit names, avoiding the use of abbreviations.

The structure of a dictionary can be represented as a finite group of elements, E of the entries in the dictionary.

Each entry E i is made up of the headword and its possible graphic variations, W languages and Latinisms, adopted due to their usage in the Spanish language, can become entries too, for example hot dog , ad hoc , etc. A phrase is also considered an entry when any of the complete words that make it up does not exist as a separate entry, for example en volandas . These phrases are dealt with as headwords,
W . The productive suffix and prefix elements are also treated in the same way. The criteria for the creation of the different articles have been set in the possible etymologies of the same voice.
 In a hierarchical representation we have the following structure ( Fig. 1 ).

As shown in Fig. 1 , each article A ij is represented by: a head, HD group of accepted meanings, AM ij ; and a finite series of expressions or compound lexical units, EX of various words. The expression is shown in the entry corresponding to the first noun, adjective or verb included. Thus, the expression de buenas a primeras will be shown in the bueno entry and the expression a ton-tas y a ciegas will be shown in the tonto entry.

The head, HD ij , and the etymology, ET ij , are simple tags (not made up by other labels) that include, respec-tively, the masculine and feminine forms of the headword (not only their endings) and the information relative to the origin of the specific word.

The various accepted meanings are derived from the various definitions of the word. Each, AM up of a series of elements or tags that characterise the same meaning and that can be represented in the fol-lowing way ( Fig. 2 ).

This structure can be hierarchised to include more levels to represent the linguistic characteristics that inter-relate the various elements. The basic representation has been chosen with the maximum level of detail that allows the most convenient reorganisation later.

The only simple elements within the accepted meaning, are the definition, DF scientific name, SN ijk , which is an optional element.

The element including the examples, EX ijk , provides quotes or sentences showing the usage of the word. In the case of quotes, information on their origin is provided (author, source, date, page) as well as the example text ( Fig. 3 ).

The grammar category, GC ijk , shows the various syntactical functions that the word can carry out within a specific accepted meaning. Generally, a specific word has one sole grammar category associated with it; nev-ertheless, there are words that have various associated grammar categories, for example contrario , disminuido , pa  X  nfilo , ...

Not all words have the same degree of generality in terms of the geographical area of their usage. The local-isation, LC ijkh , describes one or several geographical areas, GA element is made up of: the geographical zone or country and, optionally, the region or territorial division, the area (clearly defining a space within a region), and a clarification note ( Fig. 4 ).

The matter, MT ijk , indicates the fields of knowledge or professional activities where this word is more fre-quently used.

The usage, US ijk , relates the conditions of use or the origin of the word to a specific accepted meaning. This element is made up of: the intention to use the term (e.g., scornful, humoristic, etc.), the sociocultural scope where it is used (e.g., children, slang, etc.) and the linguistic environment it is used in (e.g., colloquial, edu-cated, euphemistic, literary, etc.) ( Fig. 5 ).

The rest of the elements that make up the accepted meaning are: the prepositional regime, PR cates the prepositions that are used with the word; the outline, OT mar limits of the use of the word in a specific accepted meaning; and, finally, the synonyms, SI antonyms, AN ijk .

The last elements making up the article are the compound lexical units, made up of various words labelled as expressions. Each expression element, EP ijk , includes the phrase or expression entry, comprising the com-pound lexical unit and its possible variations (i.e., other ways of writing the same expression or phrase, for example, bien mirado , mira  X  ndolo bien , si bien se mira) and a finite series of accepted meanings of the expres-sion, AME ijk . The structure of the accepted meaning of the expression coincides with the prior definition of the tag Accepted Meaning.
 The structure of the expression gives rise to the following hierarchical representation ( Fig. 6 ). 4. Representation of MOFDEM in XMLSchema
The XML scheme specifies the syntax, that is to say, the formal grammar that defines the restrictions on how the elements should be shown in the XML document. The model described in the previous point is defined by means of a XML scheme, in the following way: 5. MOFDEM versus TEI
The following is a brief comparison of the proposed model MOFDEM and the TEI guide for the encoding of the printed dictionaries.

TEI defines two different elements for the dictionary entries: &lt;entry&gt;, which coincides with the conven-tional entries in most dictionaries, and &lt;entryFree&gt;, which uses the same elements but allows them to be com-bined in a freer way. The guide does not clearly establish when to use one or the other option, but recommends the use of &lt;entry&gt;. Another label is also defined, &lt;superEntry&gt;, which allows for grouping of a series of homographs. The model proposed defines one sole label for the entries (&lt;Entry&gt;). As the Spanish language does not have the same casuistry with homographs that the English language has, we do not have a need for two different types of entries.

Within each entry, TEI proposes using the labels &lt;hom&gt;, grouping together the information relative to a homograph, and &lt;sense&gt;, grouping together of all the information relative to each sense, to carry out the groupings together that can give rise to various combinations. As a reference point the model proposes a of Accepted Meanings &lt;Meaning&gt; that will be determined by the different definitions of the word and by a series of expressions including the word &lt;Expressions&gt;. Discrimination by etymology indirectly groups together a series of accepted meanings that have a strong semantic relationship with each other. For example, the Spanish word aver X   X  a has two well differentiated semantic blocks, coinciding with the different etymologies of aver X   X  a . Each semantic block can include more than one definition. aver X   X  a1. aver X   X  a2.

TEI recommends that the following information on each article dealt with should be provided: (c) Definitions of translations to other languages &lt;trans&gt;. The scope of this work is mono-lingual dictio-(d) Etymological information: reference language &lt;lang&gt;, date &lt;date&gt;, reference words or phrases &lt;men-(e) Examples: real use examples &lt;q&gt;, phrases or quotes attributed by the narrator or author to some exter-(f) Usage information, indicated in the type of the element attribute &lt;usg&gt;, whose typical labels are:  X  X  X ime X  X  6. Justification of the proposed model
Our model is characterised by containing those items from a dictionary of meanings that are less related to the lexical units and by using linguistic tools to include this information-headwording, flexion and verbal tense, syllables and hyphenisation, and pronunciation. In this way the information provided by these tools is generalised to all the entries and not exclusively to the irregular information an entry may have. Therefore, the following information has been deliberately eliminated from the model: gender and number, verbal tense and flexions in general, syllables, hyphenisation and pronunciation.

The advantage of including these linguistic tools is based on the fact that the solution they provide is extendable to all the words of a language and not only to the entries. For example, in a dictionary that is
XML encoded according to the TEI, the pronunciation would exclusively refer to the entry. However, by means of the inclusion of linguistic tools, we could additionally have access to the pronunciation of all the flexional forms of that word, greatly enriching the dictionary. What result do we obtain from a search in sev-eral of the main Spanish language electronic dictionaries for the word perrillo , pececito or precomie  X  ndoselas ?
Simply, the electronic dictionary does not provide the appropriate entry, a statement that can be easily checked by using many of the electronic dictionaries available. This is due to the fact that the electronic dic-tionaries are applications limited to search for information represented in accordance with some of the cod-ification models proposed; this information is directly taken from the printed dictionaries, subject to paper limitations. 7. Validation
In order to verify the validity of the proposed scheme we have used it to generate an XML document with more than 67000 entries from one of the main Spanish dictionaries. The validity was checked by means of random selections. In order to achieve this we have identified the dictionary syntax, and we have developed an application identifying its different elements and positioning them in their corresponding XML tags. A total of 125292 accepted meanings and 18406 expressions have been identified in the entries. At the same time, within the expressions, a total of 19887 accepted meanings have been processed. The processing of this dic-tionary has determined, on the one hand, that there are no unidentified elements left and, on the other hand, that all the elements defined have been used.

Once the XML document of the dictionary was obtained, various verifications were carried out. Initially, by using XSL, we obtained counters of the various elements corresponding to both the entry and the accepted meanings of the expression. In this way, we demonstrated that the accepted meanings of the word and those of the expression share their elements. Also, by means of XSL, files with the various elements have been gener-ated separately, verifying, in this much easier way, the correct processing of the inputs. Lastly, various entries have been selected at random and their correct processing has been verified manually ( Table 1 ). 8. Future work
The proposed scheme is only a first step towards building a final information system that supports an elec-tronic dictionary. Nevertheless, there are important steps to be carried out in other essential parts that will constitute this information system. These parts will allow having an electronic dictionary able to provide a correct result for any type of voice, with respect to flexion ( Santana et al., 2003 ), or morpholexic relationship solved. Insofar as electronic dictionaries are concerned, the system would involve important qualitative and quantitative improvements, as it would not involve a simple transfer of the information existing in the printed dictionaries. To achieve this, the information system model will have to be developed further in such a way as to allow the integration of the various existing linguistic tools with the information in the dictionary. On the other hand, there is an attempt to develop interfaces that allow presenting the information in various resources, mainly using XML (XPATH, XQuery and XSL), Web, Java and Wap technologies. 9. Conclusions
The development of a common codification for different dictionaries is an extremely difficult task ( Ide et al., 1992 ). This study attempts to provide a useful model for the processing of natural language that is easy to use in the codification of information from various dictionaries of the Spanish language, excluding those items that are directly related to the lexical units.
 In this study, we have described a model different from that proposed by the TEI ( Sperberg-McQueen &amp;
Burnard, 2004, chap. 12 ) to define and structure the information included in the electronic dictionaries, with specific rather than general purposes, and its viability has been tested with a leading Spanish dictionary. The
TEI proposal regarding the dictionaries consists of an important series of labels that can be used in different combinations depending on the codifier needs. Our proposal presents a well defined series of labels whose only objective is to accommodate those items that are less related to the lexical units for natural language process-ing of the electronic dictionaries.

The combination of linguistic tools with electronic dictionaries labelled in XML provides a new perspective in this area with a series of advantages in the final product: access to the dictionary articles by means of any word in the written language (without the need of using the canonical form) and the ability to obtain the pro-nunciation, syllables and hyphenisation of any word (not only those of the entries expressed by the headword).
The model is especially important as it is extendable to other languages and combines two parallel paradigms: document extendable labelling and computational linguistics. This model will be, at the same time, a very use-ful part in the construction of electronic dictionaries.
