 In recent years, Web services are desig ned as computational components to build service-oriented distributed system s [1]. The rising development of service-oriented architecture makes more and m ore alternative Web services offered by different providers with equivalent or similar functions. So how to select Web services from a large number of functionally-equivalent candidates become an important issue.
 In an intuitive way, Web service can be selected from all candidates by their QoS values. However, it is hard to obtain all their QoS observed by a target user, as some Web service invocations may be charged. Hence QoS prediction [2-5] become a challenging research topic. For example, Jieming Zhu et al [2] proposes a Web service positioning framework for response time prediction. Zibin Zheng and Michael R. Lyu [3] propose a collaborative reliability prediction approach. Yilei Zhang et al [4] propose a neighborhood-based approach for collaborative and personalized quality predi ction of cloud components.

However, there remains challenges to design accurate personalized QoS pre-diction approaches for Web service selection.  X  How to predict Multi-QoS simultaneously? In Web service selection, the  X  How to improve the accuration of Multi-QoS prediction? Existing algorithms In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-QoS Effective Prediction problem, which aims to make effective Multi-QoS prediction based on Multi-QoS attributes and their relationships. To address this problem, we design a novel prediction frame-work Multi-QoS Effective Prediction Approach. It first take use of Gaussian method to normalize the QoS attribute values, then exploits Non-negative Ma-trix Factorization to extract the latent f eature of users and services from Multi-QoS attributes, and last predicts the Multi-QoS value of unused services via Multi-output Support Vector Regression algorithm. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.
 The contribution is as follows.

First, we propose a novel Multi-QoS Effective Prediction problem, which aims to make effective Multi-QoS predict based on Multi-QoS attributes and their relationships.

Second, we propose a novel prediction framework Multi-QoS Effective Pre-diction Approach to address this MQEP problem. Unlike existing algorithms that all focused on predicting QoS independently one by one, and taking no ac-count of the relationship between them, MQEPA taking use of these Multi-QoS attributes and their relationships to predict QoS.

Last, we conduct several experiments on real-world Web service dataset, com-prehensive empirical studies demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. In this section, we formally describe th e Multi-QoS effective prediction problem as follow. Given a set of users and a set of Web services, based on the existing Multi-QoS values from different users, predict the missing Multi-QoS values of Web service when invoked by a target user at same time. For example, a bipartite graph G =( U  X  S, E ) represents the user-Web services invocation (shown as Fig.1), where U denotes the users set, and S denotes the Web services set, E denotes the invocations set between U and S .Ifuser u i has invoked Web service s e ij corresponds to the Multi-QoS values (e.g., throughput, response-time in this example) of that invocation. Our task is to effectively predict the Multi-QoS values of potential invocations (the broken lines) for a targeted user.
In fact, the Multi-QoS effective predict ion problem can be considered as how to effective predict the missing entries in the user-Web service matrix based on the existing entries, where the existin g entries are Multi-QoS values between U and S , and can be observed in Fig.1. The personalized QoS experience, obtain ed from a user after the invocation, is co-determined by the feature of corresponding invoked Web service and the user. Therefore, for a target user, he always obtains different QoS experience after invoking the different Web services, as the feature of these Web services is different. As a result, we predict the Multi-QoS based on the extracted feature of Web services and historical QoS experience of a target user.
 In this paper, we propose a novel three-step prediction framework Multi-QoS Effective Prediction Approach (shown as Figure.2).  X  First, preprocess step, which aims to normalize the QoS attribute values by  X  Second, extraction step, which aims to extract the feature of Web services  X  Third, prediction step, which aims to predict the missing Multi-QoS val-3.1 The QoS Normalization Since different QoS attributes have different range of values, we employ Gaussian method[6] to normalize the QoS attribute values for feature extraction. It can not only map the QoS values to the interval [0,1], but also can better avoid the influence of abnormal values (such as high value or low value) compared with other normalization methods (such as Extremum Regularization Method). The detail can be described as follow.  X  First, exploit formulation (1) to normalize the Multi-QoS attribute values in  X  Second, assign the Q k ij with 0 or 1 based on the distance with 0 or 1, if it is 3.2 Feature Extraction Base d on Multi-QoS Attributes To better reflect the feature of Web ser vice, we extract it based on Multi-QoS attributes. Due to the existing QoS matrix is always sparse, we employ ma-trix factorization to extract the fea tures of Web services. The main idea of this method is to derive a high-quality low-dimensional matrix to approximate the historical QoS data, which represent the feature of Web service and user respectively. of l users, n Web services and m QoS attributes. Our method is to factorize Q into two matrices C  X  R l  X  m  X  r and W  X  R r  X  n , which satisfy the following equation: Where Q ij is the Multi-QoS performance of Web service s j observed by user u c m  X  l  X  n .

In this paper, we put Multi-QoS attribute values together and use NMF al-gorithm[7] to learn the feature of Web s ervices. The detail can be described as follow:  X  First, we put normalized Multi-QoS attribute values together to form a super  X  Second, we decompose the Q  X  to extract the matrix C and W with following 3.3 Predict QoS with Multi-output Support Vector Regression Based on the extracted feature of Web ser vices and user X  X  historical QoS expe-rience, we predict the missing Multi-QoS values for a targeted user. Consider the relationship between QoS attributes, we employ the Multi-output Support Vector Regression (MSVR for short) algorithm[8] to predict the missing Multi-QoS values at same time by following steps:  X  First, we select the training data according to the invoked experience of  X  Second, we employ MSVR to build a function f , which represents the relation  X  Last,wepredictthemissMulti-QoSva lues for a targeted user, based on the In this section, we conduct several experiments to show the prediction quality of our proposed approach on real-world Web service dataset[9]. In the experiments, we randomly remove 90% entries from the original QoS matrix, only use the remaining 10% entries to predict the rem oved entries of a targeted user (which is chosen by random). The parameter settings are r =4 , X  =0 . 02 ,C = 678 , X  =0 . 6.
Figure.3 and Figure.4 show the predictions of response-time and throughput for different users. The experimental results show that our approach have good performance on predicting the QoS value of different Web services. 4.1 Performance Comparison In order to evaluate the performance of our approach, we compare our prediction precision with following methods on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  X  UserMean : predict the missing QoS values based on the mean QoS value of  X  UPCC: predict the missing QoS values based on similar users[10].  X  IPCC: predict the missing QoS values based on similar items (item refers to Table.1 shows the experimental results of different approaches, and the result of MQEPA is specially highlighted. From Table.1, we can observe that our approach can obtain smaller MAE and RMSE, shows that MQEPA has better performance on prediction accuracy on both response-time and throughput for different users. This indicates that our approach suits better for Web service selection. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-QoS Effective Prediction problem, which aims to make effective Multi-QoS prediction based on Multi-QoS attributes and their relationships. To address this problem, we propose a novel prediction frame-work Multi-QoS Effective Prediction Approach. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.
