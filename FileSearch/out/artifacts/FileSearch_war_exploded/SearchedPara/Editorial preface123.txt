 EDITORIAL Josep Llad X s  X  Apostolos Antonacopoulos  X  Mohamed Cheriet  X  Umapada Pal This special issue represents a selected group of papers drawn from those presented in the program of the Tenth Inter-national Conference on Document Analysis and Recogni-tion (ICDAR2009). ICDAR2009 was held at the Universitat Aut X noma de Barcelona (UAB), Catalonia, Spain in July 26 X 29, 2009. ICDAR is the main event of the technical com-mittees TC-10 (Graphics Recognition) and TC-11 (reading Systems) within the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR).

The volume and quality of technical material submit-ted to the conference confirm that Document Analysis and Recognition is an active community, both from the scien-tific and industrial sides, and reinforce ICDAR X  X  status as one of the flagship Pattern Recognition conferences. IC-DAR2009 had a varied and high-quality technical program. More than 430 manuscripts were submitted. Of these, 87 were accepted as oral and 190 as poster presentations. About a 16% of accepted papers had at least one author from a com-pany, which shows that Document Analysis is rich in indus-try-academia pathways. The most represented topics were handwriting recognition, character recognition, and DIA sys-tems and applications. ICDAR finally had 378 registered par-ticipants coming from 31 countries. Of these, 255 were full registrants and 123 were students.

After the conference, 20 papers were drawn according to the feedback received by the program committee. The authors of the pre-selected papers were invited to submit extended and improved versions of their manuscripts. The papers have been subjected to a rigorous peer review process that resulted in the five papers collected in this special issue. Clearly, the papers of this issue cover the major research areas of document image analysis and recognition: optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, multilingual recognition, oriental fonts recognition, graphics recognition, machine learning applied to document analysis, document retrieval, and document classification.

We hereby want to thank Karl Tombre, David Doermann, and Simone Marinai, the Editors in Chief of IJDAR, for giving us the opportunity of publishing this special issue. We also wish to thank Ms Gayathri Balasubramanian of the Springer Journals Editorial Office for her always quick and helpful assistance in preparing this special issue. Last but not least, we thank all the authors and reviewers; without their help, this special issue would have been impossible to produce.
