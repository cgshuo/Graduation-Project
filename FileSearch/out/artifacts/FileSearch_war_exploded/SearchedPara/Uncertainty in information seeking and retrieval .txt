 1. Introduction
In today X  X  digital information era users are very much dependent on digital technologies in order to create, manipulate or interact with digital content on different platforms, and in different media, languages, and digital formats. The information required by an individual at a particular moment may be available in source(s) that can be accessed through a variety of information channels. People look for information from a very wide range of sources and use it constantly as part of their of the various channels could provide the required information in the most useful and efficient manner ( Chowdhury &amp; Landoni, 2006 ).

Human information behaviour (HIB) is an area of research that deals with different aspects of information seeking and retrieval. Nahl (2001) comments that  X  X  X n the information fields, the behavioral approach has been dominant in relation to identifying what users do when . In other words, how they search, what errors they make, what they consider relevant, what  X  they know or comprehend, what choices they make, which feelings they express or how much value they attach to some outcome. X  Marchionini (1995) emphasizes that  X  X  X nformation seeking is a generic cognitive activity, different communities studies have been conducted in relation to the information seeking behaviour of different types of users in different domains and circumstances (see for example, Berryman, 2006; Bystr X m &amp; Hansen, 2005; Fidel &amp; Pejtersen, 2004; Foster, 2005; Wilson, 1994; Wilson, Ellis, Ford, &amp; Foster, 2000 ).

The increase in information availability on the web has significantly influenced information seeking behaviour. Several researchers have focused on the web information seeking activities of users (see for example, Agosto, 2002; Bilal, 2000; Choo seeking in a digital environment still remain unexplored. In a recent paper Wilson (2006) stressed that electronic informa-tion resources in different formats and structures have become increasingly important in regular information seeking, and therefore user interactions on the web and in a digital library environment will become a key theme for future research.
Uncertainty is an important concept within HIB research. Researchers in general suggest that the information seeking process begins with uncertainty but as the user proceeds through the information seeking and retrieval (IS&amp;R) process uncertainty gradually decreases. Belkin (2005) describes the concept of anomalous state of knowledge (ASK) as the recog-nition of an anomaly in the state of knowledge of the recipient that can only be resolved by information communication.
Kuhlthau (1993a) points out that uncertainty decreases when the searcher proceeds towards the completion of the search uncertainty may arise and successive searches within the same stage or any other stage may be required to resolve the problem.

Uncertainty in these research papers has been considered to be a problem that is closely related to information need, and tually disappears. However, in the present study it is argued that some form of uncertainty is always associated with the information seeking and retrieval process and that, with the proliferation of new and different search tools, sources and channels in the digital era, uncertainty continues to be a significant factor in the search process. Users may feel uncertain at any stage of the information seeking and retrieval process and uncertainty may remain even after completion of the addition to the uncertainty regarding the subject knowledge that triggers the information search process (as proposed by of the proliferation of information sources and channels and the complexities of the underlying processes. tion, lack of confidence, technophobia, etc. However, recent research shows that uncertainty does also have some positive impact. For example, Anderson (2006) shows that uncertainty caused by various stages of the information seeking process can lead to creativity and innovation. Therefore it is extremely important to study whether uncertainty exists at various stages of IS&amp;R and how this influences the information seeking behaviour of users.
 library environments. 2. Related research
Uncertainty is  X  X  X  cognitive state that commonly causes affective symptoms of anxiety and lack of confidence X  ( Kuhlthau, 2004a , p. 103). Anderson (2006) comments that  X  X  X ncertainty is not only portrayed as a necessary feature of the human con-dition within information behaviour research but within the wider realm of human behaviour research. X 
Uncertainty has been studied widely in the context of information behaviour research, The relationship between infor-mation and uncertainty was identified over five decades ago by Shannon and Weaver (1949) who demonstrated that all closed systems (i.e. those into which no additional energy is invested) have a tendency to disorder through the cumulative effects of noise. The more disordered the system becomes, the less information it is capable of delivering and the higher its information and entropy: the more disordered a system the greater the uncertainty and the lesser the information. Informa-tion is therefore a measure of the degree to which uncertainty is reduced.

Uncertainty has been discussed by several researchers in the context of information seeking in different fields and among different groups of users (see for example, Belkin, 1980; D X  X mbra and Wilson, 2004; Henkind, 1988; Ingwersen, 1996;
Rijsbergen, 1998; Wilson et al., 1999, 2002 ). Case (2007) points out that research from 1950s to 1970s focused on the Shan-non model of uncertainty where the basic notion is that the objective of an information system is to reduce uncertainty. In other words, uncertainty is considered here with negative connotation and the aim should be to reduce it. However, Case (2007) and other researchers like Anderson (2006) argue that many scholars identified positive effects of uncertainty. There-fore, increased uncertainty in the context of information seeking may motivate the user in spending more time in informa-tion seeking or exploring other/alternative avenues, etc.

A number of feelings and thoughts are involved in information seeking in the digital environment. According to Nahl as affective behaviour while confused thoughts are identified as cognitive behaviour. A holistic view of users X  information seeking incorporates the interplay of cognitive and affective factors ( Martzoukou, 2004 ). Kuhlthau (2004a) explains that  X  X  X nterpreting, choosing, and creating the inconsistent, often incompatible information encountered is likely to cause pro-found feelings of uncertainty, confusions, anxiety, and even threat. X  2000 ; Wang et al., 2000 ) shows that information seeking behaviour on the web varies from one user to another because of changing technology may experience information overload, anxiety, technophobia, uncertainty, computer aversion, and information rage and, as Nahl (2001) points out, affective problems may also be present in people who are highly motivated and are conversant with new technologies. Therefore, it may be suggested that affective behaviour is not necessarily the re-sult of a lack of motivation to learn new technologies. The need for further research into the relationship between uncer-tainty and information seeking behaviour has been emphasised by leading researchers such as Ingwersen (1992), Kuhlthau and Ledet (1996), Wilson (2000), Wilson et al. (1999) and Case (2007) .

In the present paper, it is argued that, due to the proliferation of new and different information channels and sources, and ing and retrieval) in an academic environment with particular reference to academic staff, research staff, and research students. 3. Research objectives and methods
The general objective of the ongoing research, part of which has been reported here, is to study whether uncertainty oc-proved design of information services. It will also shed light on the general theory of HIB in that it might show how uncer-tainty triggers new actions of users in an information seeking process and will help to propose a new model suitable for the electronic information environment.

Researchers in HIB (for example, Ellis, 1989; Kuhlthau, 1993b ) have identified several information seeking activities in-these problems are related to various information seeking activities, it was thought that it would be interesting to study whether uncertainty is associated with any of these information seeking problems. Furthermore, any such uncertainty whether in the context of an information seeking activity or information seeking problem may be associated with a partic-ular information channel or source. Therefore, this research also intended to study uncertainty in the context of specific types of information channels/sources.

The research reported in this paper specifically aims to find out: whether uncertainty occurs in the course of different information seeking activities among users of different categories (research students, research staff and academic staff in higher education) from different disciplines, of different gender and age groups, and with different degrees of ICT skills; whether uncertainty is caused by specific information seeking problems among users of different categories (research students, research staff and academic staff in higher education) from different disciplines, of different gender and age groups, and with different degrees of ICT skills; and whether uncertainty occurs in relation to access to, and use of, a specific type of information channel/source among dif-ferent categories of academic users.

The results reported in this paper are based on the quantitative analysis of data derived from a survey of an academic environment consisting of a sample group of academic staff, research staff, and research students in the UK. The target user group was chosen for two main reasons: (1) it was assumed that users in an academic environment use electronic information resources extensively for their academic and research activities and therefore, findings from this group could be very useful for further research in the design of information systems in digital library environments; and (2) this research wished to study differences, if any, in terms of uncertainty in IS&amp;R process among people working in different academic disciplines.

A self-selected stratified sampling method was used to select the target population. The national academic mailing list plines, comprised a total of 3607 members who were invited to take part in the survey: BIOME (Medical, Biological and Health Sciences mailing list, 506 subscribers ).

BUSINESS-HEACADEMY-NEWS (Business, Management, Accountancy and Finance Subject Centre e-news, 1138 subscribers ).
 CP-UK (Cognitive Psychology UK mailing list, 5 4 subscribers ).
 ENGINEERING (The Engineering Subject Centre X  X  information list, 717 subscribers ).
 MERSENNE (which promotes discussion in the science studies community, 556 subscribers ).
 SCIENCE-EDUCATION (a forum for academics engaged in the study of science-education, 159 subscribers ). HUMBUL (The Humbul Humanities Hub, 289 subscribers ).
 WICR (Women in Computing Research, 188 subscribers ).

An online questionnaire ( Appendix A ) was used to collect data from the target population. There were three parts to the questionnaire which focused on: information seeking activities, information seeking problems, and access to specific infor-mation channels or sources. For each part, users were asked to indicate whether uncertainty exists in relation to the param-eters listed there. The questionnaire aimed to get information on each part independently of others.
 ing, chaining, browsing, differentiating, monitoring and extracting). Based on Kuhlthau X  X  and Ellis X  X  information seeking stages, 14 information seeking activities were established ( Table 1 ).

The other parts of the questionnaire were designed after reviewing the related literature (as discussed in the earlier sec-tion), followed by informal individual discussions within a small set of academics and researchers from various departments (i.e., Computer and Information Sciences, Civil Engineering, and Economics) at the University of Strathclyde with regard to their information seeking experiences. Before conducting the full scale survey, a pilot test was conducted using respondents from the above mentioned departments at the University of Strathclyde. A total of 11 responses were returned. Some minor corrections were made to the questionnaire based on the comments of the respondents. Altogether 21 problems ( Table 2 ) were returned. 4. Findings
Out of the total 668 responses, 67% were academic staff, 21% were research staff and 12% were research students. The results of this survey are presented in the following three sub-sections: Section 4.1 shows how uncertainty is related to information seeking problems ( Table 2 ); and Section 4.3 shows how uncertainty is related to the 17 identified information channels or sources ( Table 3 ). 4.1. Uncertainty and information seeking activities
Fig. 1 shows that information seeking activities, such as, choosing appropriate information channels and sources (36%), formulating a search expression (32%), deciding when to stop a search and begin to use the retrieved items(32%), and making sure to remain up-to-date in a given field (30%) were identified by the significant number of the users as causes of uncertainty. 4.1.1. Information seeking activities and age group
In order to establish whether there were any differences in uncertainty caused by information seeking activities among users from different age groups the respondents were grouped as: 61+ (8%). Fig. 2 shows the activities which caused uncertainty among a considerable number of users of various age groups. There was a difference between age groups, for example, the major activities ( Table 1 ) that caused uncertainty were: Age group 30 and below: A1 (43%), A3 (38%), A5 (38%), A13 (38%), A14 (35%), A7 (31%), and A11 (30%).
 Age group 31 X 40: A12 (38%), A9 (33%), A2 (32%), A7 (32%), A3 (30%), A1 (29%), and A10 (29%).
 Age group 41 X 50: A7 (46%), A1(43%), A9 (38%), A6 (33%), A12 (32%), A10 (31%), and A3 (28%).
 Age group 51 X 60: A1 (36%), A5 (36%), A13 (35%), A6 (32%), A7 (31%), A9 (30%), and A12 (29%).

Age group 61+: A5 (54%), A1(37%), A11 (33%), A2 (31%), A7 (27%), A4 (25%), and A14 (25%). 4.1.2. Information seeking activities and gender
Out of the 668 respondents, 51% were female and 49% were male respondents. Fig. 3 shows how uncertainty in relation to different information seeking activities varied between male and female respondents.
 However, the degrees of uncertainty caused by a number of activities ( Table 1 ) differed between male and female users: A1: female (46%) and male (6%).
 A14: female (36%) and male (23%).
 A13:female (35%) and male (20%).
 A9: female (34%) and male (23%).
 A3: female (33%) and male (24%).
 A12:female (31%) and male (22%).

A6: female (30%) and male (22%). 4.1.3. Information seeking activities and ICT skills
People with different ICT skills may have differing levels of uncertainty in relation to certain information seeking activ-ities. In this study, 52% of the respondents considered themselves to be extremely confident, 33% very confident, 7% confi-seeking activities among respondents with respect to their ICT skills. The following activities ( Table 1 ) caused uncertainty among a considerable number of users with different ICT skills:
Extremely confident in ICT skills (25% ad over): A1 (29%), A3 (29%), A5 (29%), A9 (27%), A12 (26%), A7 (25%), and A13 (25%).

Very confident (30% and over): A7 (45%), A1 (39%), A11(38%), A5 (36%), A6 (36%), A9 (35%), A13 (35%), A10 (31%), A12 (31%), and A3 (30%).
 Confident (30% and over): A1 (53%), A14 (53%), A5 (43%), A13 (33%).

Fairly confident (30% and over): A5 (54%), A7 (50%), A9 (50%), A1 (38%), A6 (33%), A8 (33%), A10 (33%), A12 (33%), A13 (33%), and A14 (33%).

Not at all confident (30% and over): A1 (75%), A6 (46%), A12 (43%), A14 (43%), A3 (32%), and A9 (32%). 4.1.4. Information seeking activities and user category Fig. 5 shows that user of all categories experienced uncertainty at different stages of information seeking. The following activities ( Table 1 ) caused uncertainty among considerable number of users (25% and over). Among academic staff: A1 (31%), A7 (31%), A5 (30%), A13 (29%), A9 (28%), A12 (28%), A3 (25%), and A6 (25%).
Among research staff: A1 (51%), A2 (39%), A3 (35%), A9 (35%), A11 (35%), A6 (34%), A12 (33%), A13 (30%), A5 (29%), A14 (29%), A10 (28%) and A7 (26%).
 Among research students: A7 (49%), A5 (43%), A3 (36%), A1 (33%), A14 (33%), A13 (32%), A9 (28%), A2 (26%), A6 (26%), and
A11 (26%). 4.1.5. Information seeking activities and different disciplines
The respondents were from a wide range of subject areas but the number of responses from some specific subjects was small compared to others. Therefore, keeping in view the objectives of the research, the respondents were grouped into five broad subject categories: business and management; computer science and informatics; arts and humanities; science, engi-neering, medical science and technology; and social sciences. The reason for grouping users under these broad categories was to find out whether uncertainty in relation to information seeking varied from one major discipline to another. Com-puter science and informatics was not included in the science group, but placed under a separate subject grouping, because users in these disciplines were considered to be quite conversant with the technology and hence, it was assumed that this group of users might produce results that would be significantly different from the other user groups.
Out of the total 668 respondents, 30% were from business and management, 27% were from social science disciplines, 19% from arts and humanities; 17% from science, engineering, medical science and technology; and 7% from computer science and informatics. Fig. 6 shows how the various information seeking activities caused uncertainty among users from different disciplines.

In general, the activities (as listed in Table 1 ) which caused uncertainty among a considerable number of users (25% and over) from different disciplines were:
For business and management: A5 (44%), A9 (43%), A7 (42%), A1(41%), A6 (38%), A12 (34%), A13 (34%), A11 (33%), A3 (30%), A2 (28%), A10(28%), A8 (26%), and A14 (26%).
 For arts and humanities: A5 (41%), A7 (40%), A13 (36%), A11 (32%), A1 (32%), A3 (30%), A12 (30%), A4 (29%), and A14 (29%). For science/engineering/medical science/technology: A1 (31%), A3 (30%), and A4 (28%).
 For social sciences: A1 (45%), A13 (36%), A2 (33%), A6 (33%), A12 (33%), A14 (32%), A5 (31%), A3 (29%), A7 (29%), A9 (28%), A11 (27%), and A10 (26%).
 For computer science and informatics: A10 (52%), A13 (45%), A3 (44%), A9 (42%), A12 (35%), A7 (35%), A11 (33%), A1 (27%),
A14 (27%) and A6 (25%). 4.2. Uncertainty and information seeking problems
It was noted that a number of problems in relation to IS&amp;R process caused uncertainty regardless of the respondents X  gen-and unfamiliar with the source (22%) were the information seeking problems which caused uncertainty among a considerable number of users. 4.2.1. Information seeking problems and age group
Fig. 8 shows that too much information or information overload caused uncertainty for the following groups: 31 X 40 (30%), 51 X 60 (30%), 41 X 50 (23%), 30 and below (20%), and 61 and over (17%). Too scattered information was a major problem for: 51 X 60 (24%), 31 X 40 (23%), and 41 X 50 (23%), but a minor problem for two groups: age group 30 and below (13%) and 61 and over (10%). Search output is not exhaustive was a serious problem for age group 30 and below (47%) followed by 41 X 50 (33%), 51 X 60 (26%), and 31 X 40 (20%) and 61 and over (6%).

A number of problems ( Table 2 ) commonly caused uncertainty for a considerable numbers of users (20% and over) in dif-ferent age groups, except for the age group 61 and over: Age group 30 and below: P5 (47%), P6 (27%), P3 (24%), P17 (24%), and P1 (20%).
 Age group 31 X 40: P1 (30%), P6 (30%), P7 (29%), P2 (23%), and P5 (20%).
 Age group 41 X 50: P5 (33%), P6 (28%), P17 (26%), P7 (25%), P1 (23%), P2 (23%), P3 (23%), P10 (23%), and P11 (22%). Age group 51 X 60: P1 (30%), P5 (26%), P2 (24%), P6 (23%), P17 (22%), and P10 (21%).

Age group 61+: P1 (17%), P4 (15%), P6 (15%), and P9 (15%). 4.2.2. Information seeking problems and gender Fig. 9 shows how the degrees of uncertainty caused by various information seeking problems varied between the genders.
Problems ( Table 2 ) that caused uncertainty among male and female users varied in terms of the degrees of uncertainty (15% and over): P5: female (28%) and male (24%).
 P6: female (28%) and male (21%).
 P1: female (26%) and male (23%).
 P17: female (24%) and male (19%).
 P2: female (22%) and male (16%).
 P3: female (22%) and male (9%).

P11: female (16%) and male (11%). P7: female (15%) and male (22%).

P10: female (15%) and male (17%). 4.2.3. Information seeking problems and ICT skills
Fig. 10 shows that the information seeking problems considered to be the main causes for uncertainty varied among users with different levels of ICT skills.

The following were the significant problems ( Table 2 ) that caused uncertainty among people (15% and over) with differ-ent levels of ICT skills.
 Extremely confident in ICT skills: P1 (22%), P6 (22%), P17 (20%), P3 (18%), P5 (18%), and P7 (16%).
 Very confident: P5 (38%), P1 (30%), P2 (27%), P6 (27%), P7 (25%), P17 (25%), P10 (24%), P11(18%), and P16 (15%). Confident : P17 (43%), P1 (33%), P5 (30%), P10 (23%), P2 (20%), and P6 (18%).
 Fairly confident: P4 (54%), P2 (38%), P16 (38%), P5 (33%), P7 (33%), P6 (29%), P3 (21%), P17 (21%), and P9(17%).
Not at all confident: P3 (46%), P6 (46%), P5 (43%), P11 (43%), P1 (32%), P10 (29%), P2 (18%), and P9 (18%). 4.2.4. Information seeking problems and user category
Fig. 11 shows that various information seeking problems caused different degrees of uncertainty among academic staff, research staff, and research students.
 For academic staff: P1 (26%), P5 (26%), P2 (21%), P6 (20%), P17 (19%), P7 (16%), P10 (16%), and P3 (15%). For research staff: P17 (32%), P6 (26%), P10 (22%), P1 (21%), P5 (18%), P11 (18%), and P16 (18%).
 For research student: P7 (43%), P6 (42%), P5 (38%), P17 (29%), P3 (28%), P1 (22%), P2 (21%), and P13 (21%). 4.2.5. Information seeking problems and disciplines
Fig. 12 shows the varying degrees of uncertainty caused by the information seeking problems among users of different disciplines.

Information seeking problems ( Table 2 ) that caused uncertainty among a considerable number of users from different disciplines (20% and over) were:
For business and management: P1 (39%), P6 (37%), P5 (35%), P10 (29%), P2 (28%), P17 (26%), P7 (25%), P4 (23%), P11 (22%), and P3 (19%).
 For arts and humanities: P17 (30%), P5 (20%), P3 (19%), and P7 (19%).

For science, engineering, medical science and technology: P1 (18%), P5 (25%), P6 (21%), and P7 (24%). 4.3. Uncertainty and different electronic information channels or sources
Users were asked to indicate whether they had any uncertainty while seeking information from the specified information channels or sources irrespective of the causes. Fig. 13 shows the results. 4.3.1. Information channels or sources and age group
Fig. 14 shows some degrees of uncertainty among various age groups with regard to specific information channels or sources.
 Various channels or sources causing uncertainty among users of different age groups were as follows: For age group 30 and below: C5 (28%), C4 (24%), C13 (23%), C16 (23%), C12 (20%), C15 (16%) and C7 (15%). For age group 31 X 40: C3 (23%), C6 (19%), C15 (19%), C4 (17%), C11 (16%), and C9 (15%).
 For age group 41 X 50: C7 (18%), and C4 (16%).

For age group 61 and over: C7 (23%), C3 (17%), and C2 (15%). 4.3.2. Information channels or sources and gender
Fig. 15 shows that websites of online bookstores and business websites caused uncertainty among 17% and 15% male tainty among 21%, 16%, and 15% female respondents respectively. Other channels/sources ( Table 3 ) that caused uncertainty among15% or more users were: For female: C4 (21%), C5 (16%), and C13 (15%); and
For male: C9 (17%), and C7 (15%). 4.3.3. Information channels or sources and ICT skills Fig. 16 shows how specific information channels or sources ( Table 3 ) cause uncertainty among users of different ICT skills.
More specifically, Fig. 16 shows some varying degrees of uncertainty with regard to specific information sources/chan-nels, such as:
For respondents those are very confident in ICT skills: C4 (26%), C3 (20%), C7 (20%), C5 (18%), C13 (18%), C12 (17%), C2 (16%), C9 (16%), C16 (16%), and C11 (15%). For respondents those are confident in ICT skills: C4 (40%), C3 (33%), C11 (23%), C2 (20%), C15 (20%), and C16 (20%). For respondents those are fairly confident in ICT skills: C9 (38%), C3 (17%), C8 (21%), C14 (17%), and C15 (17%). For respondents those are not at all confident in ICT skills: C13 (32%), C4 (29%), C14 (29%), C12 (18%), and C15 (18%).
However, it is important to note that information channels or sources caused very little uncertainty among users who were extremely confident in their ICT skills ( 6 11%). 4.3.4. Information channels or sources and user category
Fig. 17 shows the uncertainty caused by specific channels or sources among research students, research staff, and aca-demic staff.

For research students: C3 (20%), C4 (28%), C5 (33%), C6 (28%), C7 (32%), C9 (26%), C13 (22%), C1 (16%), C15 (28%), C16 (21%), and C17 (17%).
 For research staff: C13 (15%).

It is important to note that specific information channels or sources caused very little uncertainty among academic staff (&lt;15%).
 4.3.5. Information channels or sources and disciplines Fig. 18 shows the uncertainty caused by specific information channels or sources for users of different disciplines. More specifically Fig. 18 shows the disciplinary differences as follows: For arts and humanities: C5 (27%), C3 (17%), and C4 (16%).
 For social sciences: C12 (16%) For business and management: C4 (20%), C7 (18%), C9 (16%), and C12 (15%).
 For computer science and informatics: C3 (19%), C7 (19%), C12 (19%), C4 (17%), and C9 (17%).

For science/engineering/medical science/technology: C3 (15%). 5. Summary
It is evident that information seeking is a challenging task in the context of the exponential growth of the web and elec-tronic information channels and sources. As the quantity of information channels and sources continues to rise, users often seeking on the web is an emotional experience; i.e., that uncertainty dominates over feelings of optimism and enthusiasm. It of appropriate information sources is a very challenging task X .

This study shows that there were some differences among users in various age groups in terms of the activities that caused uncertainty during their information seeking process. However, choosing appropriate information channels and sources caused uncertainty for a considerable number of users of all age groups while browsing or searching the chosen information among the least number of users of all age groups.

While looking for the differences, if any, among male and female users, it was noted that formulating a search expression and deciding when to stop a search and begin to use the retrieved items were the common causes of uncertainty among max-imum number of users of both genders. However, choosing appropriate information channels and sources was the activity that caused uncertainty among many female respondents (46%), but among very few male respondents (6%).

With a view to finding out whether users X  ICT skills had any bearing on the uncertainty caused by information seeking main up-to-date in a given field , were identified as causes of uncertainty by 30% or more of respondents irrespective of the many of the retrieved items should be viewed when many items are retrieved, and ensuring that all the information required for a given task has been obtained were selected as a cause of uncertainty by over 25% of respondents who were extremely confident in their ICT skills.

This study also showed that information seeking activities such as choosing appropriate information channels and sources, formulating a search expression, deciding when to stop a search and begin to use the retrieved items, and making sure to remain up-to-date in a given field caused uncertainty among at least 30% of the academic users. Most activities caused a degree of uncertainty among 30% or more research staff and students with choosing appropriate information chan-nels and sources being on top for research staff (identified by 51%), and deciding when to stop a search and begin to use the retrieved items being the top for research students (identified by 49%).

There appeared to be some differences in terms of users X  disciplines. For example, most of the users from business and management and arts and humanities indicated that formulating a search expression was the cause of uncertainty in relation items should be viewed for their content within the available time was the prime cause of uncertainty among computer science business and management, computer science and informatics, and arts and humanities users; and choosing appropriate infor-mation channels and sources caused uncertainty among users from social sciences, business and management, arts and humanities, and science, engineering, medical sciences and technology.

However, in general, it can be said that the choosing appropriate information channels and sources, formulating a search expression, deciding when to stop a search and begin to use the retrieved items, making sure to remain up-to-date in a given field, quality of the sources, deciding how many of the retrieved items should be viewed when many items are retrieved, and ensuring that all the information required for a given task has been obtained were the information seeking activities which most commonly caused uncertainty among users regardless of their age, gender, ICT skills, user categories and disciplines.
With regard to information seeking problems, it was found that too much information or information overload , unaware of those who were 61 and over; too scattered information caused uncertainty for majority of the users (within the range of 31 X  60 years age), while users of age 30 and below and age 61 and over considered it to be a minor problem. Technology related problems were identified by the majority of users in the age group 61 and over.

The four most common problems that caused uncertainty in both male and female users were search output is not exhaustive, too much information or information overload, unaware of source or channel and unfamiliar with the source.
However, information seeking problems of too scattered information, search results are not up-to-date and materials can be unreliable caused uncertainty for male respondents (between 18% and 22%), while too much information or information overload, which channels and sources to look for, search output is not exhaustive, and unaware of source or channel were the problems that caused uncertainty for female respondents (between 22% and 28%).

Too much information or information overload, search output is not exhaustive, unfamiliar with the source, unaware of source or channel, and too scattered information were the most identifiable problems among users (about 20% and over) had some problems in common with people who were relatively less confident in their ICT skills.

Information seeking problems such as too much information or information overload, search output is not exhaustive, unaware of source or channel and unfamiliar with the source commonly caused uncertainty among academic staff, research staff, and research students, but to varying degrees. However, there were problems ( Table 2 ) which were specific to a par-ticular user category, such as too much information or information overload, unfamiliar with the source, and search results are not up-to-date caused uncertainty among most of the academic staff, research staff and research students respectively. Some problems caused uncertainty for a significant number of research students (between 38% and 43%).
Different information seeking problems caused different degrees of uncertainty in different disciplines. For example, 35% of users from computer science and informatics highlighted that the problems of too much information or informa-tion overload and unaware of source or channel caused uncertainty while 33% of users from social sciences stressed that the problem of search output is not exhaustive was the main cause of uncertainty; 30% of users from business and management, and arts and humanities indicated that they faced uncertainty due to too much information or information overload , and u nfamiliar with the source respectively. S earch output is not exhaustive was a cause of uncertainty among a considerable number of users (25%) from science, engineering, medical science and technology. However, s earch output is not exhaustive, unaware of source or channel and unfamiliar with the source were the problems which most commonly caused uncertainty among users across all disciplines. The problem of too much information or information overload caused uncertainty among all users except those from the arts and humanities whereas the problem search results are not up-to-date was a major cause of uncertainty for everyone except users from computer science and informatics.

In general, it was seen that the major information seeking problems were: search output is not exhaustive, unaware of source or channel, too much information or information overload, and unfamiliar with the source irrespective of age, gender, ICT skills, user category or discipline.
 and listservs and mailing lists caused uncertainty for age group 30 and below (20% and over), while e-books and business web-services cause uncertainty for age group 41 X 50 (15 X 20%) whereas in general specific information channel/source caused little uncertainty for age group 51 X 60.

Indexing and abstracting databases caused uncertainty for 21% female respondents while w ebsites of online bookstores (17%) caused uncertainty among 17% male respondents.

In general, different information channels or sources ( Table 3 ) caused uncertainty among users of different ICT skills. e-books were the information sources which caused uncertainty for 33% users who were confident, 20% users who were very confident, and 17% users who were fairly confident in their ICT skills while indexing and abstracting databases caused uncer-tainty among 26% users who were very confident, 40% users who were confident, and 29% users who were not at all confi-dent. Websites of online bookstores and meta-search engines caused uncertainty among the majority of the users who were cific information channels or sources caused very little uncertainty among users who were extremely confident in their ICT skills ( 6 11%).

A considerable number of research students appeared to experience some sort of uncertainty when accessing and using personal collections, business websites, indexing and abstracting databases, government websites, OPAC of other institu-tions, websites of online bookstores, e-books, meta-search engines, and listservs and mailing lists. However, very few users or sources.

Research students indicated that specific information channels or sources ( Table 3 ) caused some considerable amounts of specific information channels or sources.

Less that 20% users from different disciplines indicated that specific information channels or sources ( Table 3 ) were caus-ing uncertainty. Only personal collections caused some uncertainty for 27% users from arts and humanities.
However, in general, accessing and using e-books, Indexing and Abstracting Databases, Personal collections, Government websites, Business websites, Websites of online bookstores, Search engines, Meta-search engines, OPAC of own institution X  X  library, and OPAC of other institutions caused uncertainty among the users ( categories and subject disciplines. 6. Conclusions
According to Kuhlthau (2004b) ,  X  X  X sers are concerned with much more than merely finding sources relevant to their topic. X  This research shows that there were some common information seeking activities and information seeking problems user category. It was also found that while some may have been major causes of uncertainty for one group, they may only have been minor causes for others. This is also the case with regard to the use of a specific information channel or source.
Nevertheless, such uncertainty may not always be negative or undesirable. Uncertainty may prompt users to find infor-mation from a vast collection and at the same time may be exciting in terms of discovering new information channels and should be made to reduce such negative or undesirable uncertainty by improved information systems design once specific causes for negative uncertainty are identified. The research shows that uncertainty does not have a linear and non-complex contributes to the uncertainty found by users during their search processes are clearly articulated.

This research shows that varying degrees of uncertainty exist among user groups of different age, gender, ICT skills, cat-to specific information channels or sources. This research specifies the information seeking activities, information seeking problems, and information channels or sources that cause uncertainty among users. However, it does not provide any rea-sons or any justifications for the causes of uncertainty. Anderson (2006) comments that  X  X  X egative and positive [uncertainty] are closely bound to one another in a situation. X  The next phase of this ongoing research using qualitative analysis is ex-pected to find answers to some such questions, and may also identify some uncertainty that are positive/desirable as op-posed to negative/undesirable, and their impact on the IS&amp;R process.

The findings of this study should be useful in the design of new information systems and services in digital library envi-ronments or making improvements to existing services. For example, an understanding of information seeking activities and information seeking problems that cause uncertainty may help in the design of personalized and task-based information ser-vices ( Chowdhury, 2004; Meyyappan, Chowdhury, &amp; Foo, 2001; Meyyappan, Foo, &amp; Chowdhury, 2004 ). Uncertainty in rela-tion to the problem of selecting the appropriate information channels or sources, and those related to formulation of search expression, etc., may also be resolved by adopting the approaches of some aggregator services, such as Dialog Newsroom.
Uncertainty surrounding the selection of appropriate information sources/channels may be resolved by creating a master is required to decide on the specific design requirements for reducing negative/undesirable uncertainty and for utilizing the positive/desirable uncertainty in IS&amp;R.
