 Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content, and also for connecting to other users. User-generated content includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. Items can be annotated and rated by different users, and users can connect to others that are usually friends and/or share common interests.
We demonstrate a social recommendation system that takes advantages of users connections and tagging behavior to compute recommendations of items in such communities. The advantages can be verified via comparison to a standard IR technique.

 With the advent of Web 2.0, new online services offer the possibility to store personal content, to share it with other people, and to explore other users X  contents. Well-known examples of such social-community platforms are del.icio.us, YouTube, Flickr and LibraryThing. While differing in the type of content (e.g., videos, photos, bookmarks), most plat-forms follow a common pattern: Users join the community, then produce information vy publishing their own items and by adding tags , ratings or comments to other content already available. Users additionally maintain a list of friends ,which is often initially populated with people they already know from the offline world or other online communities, but over time they identify previously unknown users they share com-mon interests with and add those users to their friends lists.
Social tagging offers an opportunity to exploit the  X  X is-dom of the crowds X  by identifying valuable content that is recommended by friends  X  either directly or indirectly (i.e., via friends of friends) and explicitly (e.g., ratings) or im-plicitly (e.g., by intensive tagging). To this end, the re-lationships among users should be taken into account for ranking, the intuition being that you trust the recommen-dations of your close friends more than those of your casual acquaintances. This situation resembles the paradigm of collaborative recommendation [1], which applies data min-
