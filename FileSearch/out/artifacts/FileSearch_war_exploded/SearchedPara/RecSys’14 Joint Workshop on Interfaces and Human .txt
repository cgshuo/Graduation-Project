 As an interactive intelligent system, recommender systems are developed to give predictions that match users preferences. Since the emergence of recommender systems, a large majority of research focuses on objective accuracy criteria and less attention has been paid to how users intera ct with the system and the efficacy of interface designs from the end -user perspective . The field has reached a point where it is ready to look beyond algorithms, in to users interactions, decision -making processes and overall experience. Accordingly, the goals of t his workshop (IntRS@RecSys) are to explore the human aspect s of recommender systems, with a particular focus on the impact of interfaces and interaction design on decision -making and user experiences with recommender systems , and to explore metho dologies to evaluate these human aspects of the recommendation process that go beyond traditional automated approaches.

This workshop integrates different theories of human decision making into the construction of recommender systems , as illustrated in Fig 1 . In recent RecSys conferences, we h ave seen an emerging research theme on the impact of interfaces on decision support, satisfaction and overall user experience with the recommender system (RS). For this, and related workshops from previous years, t he aim has been to bring together research ers and pr actitioners around the topics of designing and evaluating novel intelligent interfaces for recommender systems. Another has been to foster an interdisciplinary community with a focus on decision -making and on the related interface design issues for recomm ender systems and promoting collaboration opportunities between researchers and practitioners. The workshop covers three interrelated themes: a) user interfaces (e.g. visual interfaces, explanations), b) interaction, user modeling and decision -ma king (e.g. decision theories, argumentation, detection and avoidance of biases), and c) evaluation (e.g. case studies and empirical evaluations) . This workshop is a follow up on the successful workshops at RecS ys in previous years: The following list outlines core topics of interest . User Interfaces Interaction, user modeling and decision -making http://recex.ist.tugraz.at/RecSysWork shop/ http://recex.ist.tugraz.at/RecSysWorkshop2012 http://recex.ist.tugraz.at:8080/RecSysWorkshop2011 https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/n.tintarev/pages/InterfaceRS/ Evaluation The workshop started with a short general introduction to the workshop themes by the organizers. This was followed by oral presentation of accepted papers listed at the link b elow. Presentations were grouped into sessions based on the subthemes of the workshop. Julita Vassileva gave a keynote presentation titled Visualization and User Control of Recommender Systems . After each presentation and session, time was allocated for general discussion and feedback. The workshop material including list of accepted papers, invited talk and workshop schedule are ava ilable at the IntRS@RecSys 2014 webpage: http://recex.ist.tugraz.at/intrs2014/ and via the workshops s ection on the main conference website: http://recsys.acm.org/recsys14/workshops/
