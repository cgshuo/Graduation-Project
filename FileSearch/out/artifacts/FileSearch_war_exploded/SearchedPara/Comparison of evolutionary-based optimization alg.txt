 1. Introduction challenging topic in the field of engineering design for obtaining more efficient and lighter structures. The aim of the design optimization is to determine the optimal shape of a structure to maximize or minimize a given criterion, such as minimize the weight, maximize the stiffness, subjected to the stress or dis-placement constraint conditions.
 finding optimum solutions of complex optimization problems. In the past few decades, a number of evo lutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm, cuckoo search algorithm, particle swarm optimi-zation algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, harmony search algorithm and artificial immune algorithm have been used exten-sively to obtain optimal designs and overcome the computational drawbacks of traditional mathematical optimization methods ( Yildiz (2003) ; Woon et al., 2001 ).
 optimization approach for continuum structures using the genetic algorithms. The developed approach is applied to multi-compo-nent topology optimization of a vehicle floor frame.
The differential evolution (DE) algorithm introduced by Storn and Price (1995) is an efficient population-based optimization method. The DE has received considerable attention and has been successfully used in various areas. The use of the DE in the optimum solution of problems resulted in better solutions com-Khoei et al., 2002 ).

Although the DE algorithm is very effective at finding rela-tively good neighborhoods of solutions in a complex search space, they may have a premature convergence to a local minimum ( Wang et al., 2011 ; Isaacs et al., 2007 ).

Some researchers have used the robustness issues to solve optimization problems ( Chen et al., 2002 ; Lee et al., 2003 ).
Robinson et al. (2004) presents a review paper which focuses largely on the work done since 1992 and a historical perspective of parameter design is also given. Kunjur and Krishnamurty (1997) presented a robust optimization approach that integrates optimization concepts with statistical robust design techniques.
Hybrid optimization algorithms have received significant interest for fast convergence speed and robustness in finding the global minimum at the same time ( Yildiz, 2009a , 2009b , 2009c ; Yildiz and Solanki, 2011 ). Tsai et al. (2004) proposed a hybrid algorithm in which the Taguchi X  X  method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a genetic algo-rithm. The Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently, enhance the performance of genetic algorithm. Yildiz (2012b) developed a novel hybrid robust optimization method (HRABC) based on the Taguchi X  X  method and the artificial bee colony algorithm. The HRABC was applied to structural design optimization problem of an automobile component from industry and a milling optimization problem. Yildiz (2009b) hybridized immune algorithm with hill climbing local search algorithm and applied to multi-objective disc brake and manufacturing optimi-zation problems from literature. Yildiz (2009c) developed a new hybrid particle swarm optimization approach to solve optimiza-tion problems in design and manufacturing area.

In this paper, a comparative study of six evolutionary-based optimization algorithms for the structural design optimization is presented. Furthermore, a hybrid technique (HTDEA) based on differential evolution algorithm is introduced. The HTDEA is applied to a welded beam design problem and the optimal design of a vehicle component to illustrate how the present approach can be applied for solving structural design optimization problems. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 2. Hybrid differential evolution optimization algorithm for structural optimization In this paper, the differential evolution algorithm and the Taguchi X  X  method are integrated to solve structural design opti-mization problems. First, some brief explanations about the differential evolution optimization algorithm and the Taguchi X  X  method are given and, finally, the proposed hybrid approach is explained. 2.1. Differential evolution algorithm
The differential evolution (DE) algorithm introduced by Storn and Price (1995) is a population-based optimization method. The DE algorithm X  X  main strategy is to generate new individuals by calculating vector differences between other individuals of the population. The DE algorithm includes three important operators: mutation, crossover and selection. In the DE, a population of NP population is successfully improved by applying mutation, cross-over and selection operators, respectively. Mutation and cross-over are used to generate new vectors (trial vectors), and selection then are used to determine whether or not the new generated vectors can survive the next iteration. The mentioned operators are described below. 2.1.1. Mutation
The DE generates new parameter vectors by adding the weighted difference between two population vectors to a third vector. This operation is called mutation. The mutated vector X  X  parameters are then mixed with the parameters of another predetermined vector, the target vector, to yield the so-called trial vector.

For each target vector x i,G  X  1,2,3, y ,NP, a mutant vector is produced by v controls the magnitude of the differential variation of ( x x r 3, G ). NP is size of the population. 2.1.2. Crossover
The parent vector is mixed with the mutated vector to produce a trial vector u ji,G  X  1 u represents the number of dimensions of a vector. 2.1.3. Selection
In this step, the trial vector obtained after the mutation and crossover operators is evaluated. Then, the performance of the trial and target is compared and the better one is selected. If the generation otherwise target vector is passed into next generation: x
In this paper the following set of parameter values has been assumed; specifically mutation ratio F  X  0.8 and crossover ratio
CR  X  0.95. 2.2. Taguchi method
The Taguchi method provides the most suitable levels of the design variables ( Phadke, 1989 ). The Taguchi classifies robust parameter design problems depending on the goal of the problem as follows:
Smaller the better : In this situation, S / N ratio is defined as follows: S = N Ratio  X  10 log  X 
Larger the better : In this situation, S / N ratio is defined as follows: S = N Ratio  X  10 log S = N Ratio  X  10 log  X 
The Taguchi X  X  method uses the orthogonal arrays. To compare performances of parameters, the statistical test known as the
ANOVA is used. Further details and technical merits about robust parameter design can be found in ( Phadke, 1989 ).

The Taguchi X  X  method is used to define robust initial population
The problem with larger population may stick around certain solutions which may not be the best ones. This is handled with the help of robust parameter levels which are embedded into
In other words, the design space is restricted and refined based on the effect of the various design variables on objective function.
The purpose of the ANOVA table is to help differentiate the robust designs from the non-robust ones. The main issue of experimental analysis is the ANOVA analysis which is formed using S / N ratios, respectively, for the objective. According to results of the ANOVA, appropriate levels of design parameters are found and then, initial population of the DE algorithm is defined according to the levels.

Finally, optimum results of the optimization problem are obtained by applying the DE in two steps as follows: define initial population set, use the DE operators to create the next generation, 3. Evaluation of the proposed approach using test problem illustrate the implementation procedure of the HTDEA. Fig. 1 shows design variables and structure of the welded beam. welded beam subject to constraints on shear stress ( t ), bending length of 14 in. and P  X  6000 lb force is applied at the end of the beam ( Siddall, 1972 ; Ragsdell and Phillips (1976) ; Coello and
Montes, 2002 ). The design variables are thickness of the weld h  X  x 1  X  , length of the weld l  X  x 2  X  , depth of the beam t  X  x of the beam b  X  x 4  X  : The mathematical model of the welded beam optimization problem taken from ( Coello and Montes, 2002 )is defined as
Objective function: f  X  x  X  X  1 : 10471 x 2 1 x 2  X  0 : 04811 x 3 x 4  X  14 : 0  X  x
Constraints: g  X  x  X  X  t max t  X  x  X  Z 0  X  8  X  g  X  x  X  X  s max s  X  x  X  Z 0  X  9  X  g  X  x  X  X  x 4 x 1 Z 0  X  10  X  g  X  x  X  X  P c  X  x  X  P Z 0  X  11  X  g  X  x  X  X  d max  X  d  X  x  X  Z 0  X  12  X  g  X  x  X  X  x 1 0 : 125 Z 0  X  13  X  g  X  x  X  X  5 1 : 10471 x 2 1 x 2  X  0 : 04811 x 3 x 4  X  14 : 0  X  x
The weld stress t  X  x  X  has two components which are t 0 and t t 00 is the primary stress, whereas t 00 is the secondary torsional stress ( ). t  X  x  X  is computed using the following equation:  X  x  X  X 
The bar bending stress s ( x ) is calculated from the following equation:  X  x  X  X  The bar buckling load is found from the following equation:
Pc  X  x  X  X 
The bar displacement is computed using the following equa-tion: d  X  x  X  X  4 PL
Step 1: Four design variables are used to define the objective and seven constraint functions. The design variables are h  X  x l  X  x under the given loading conditions subject to constraints. The bending stress, buckling load, and weld stress are defined with
Step 2: In this step, experiments are designed to evaluate the effects of the design. The selection of an orthogonal array for a given problem depends on the number of factors and their levels.
The Taguchi has tabulated 18 basic orthogonal arrays, which are called standard orthogonal arrays. The suitable orthogonal array with regard to four design variables at four levels each is chosen as L 16 . In this problem, smaller the better characteristic is considered to compute the S / N ratios based on the objective as smaller the better for cost.

The levels and the S / N ratios are tabulated for 16 experiments given as 0.125 o x 1 o 5, 0.1 o x 2 o 10, 0.1 o x 3 o 10, 0.125 o x
The ANOVA for the objective is formed using the S / N ratios as shown in Table 2 .

Step 3: In this step, the intervals of the design parameters are obtained using the ANOVA regarding the effects of factors on the objective function. The effective parameters are x 2 and x 39.2% and 35.5% contributions as shown in Table 2 , respectively. Therefore, the levels of 1 and 2 are considered as 0.125 (level 1) since the smaller the better category is applied for the objective function. The intervals for x 1 and x 2 are level 1 o x 1 level 1 o x 2 o level 2. The contributions for x 3 and x 4 the objective as 8.9% and 9.9%, respectively. Therefore, the predefined intervals are selected without any change as 0.125 and 10 (level 1 o x 3 o level 4) for x 3 , 0.125 and 5 (level 1 o x level 4) for x 4 . In summary, the parameter settings are found as 0.125 o x 1 o 1.75, 0.1 o x 2 o 3.4, 0.1 o x 3 o 10, 0.125 o x (level 1 o x 1 o level 2, level 1 o x 2 o level 2, level 1 o x level 1 o x 4 o level 4) for the objective function.
Step 4: The initial population of the DE algorithm is randomly generated for individuals within the range of the solution space bounded by 0.125 o x 1 o 1.75, 0.1 o x 2 o 3.4, 0.1 o x 4 for x 3 , level 1 o x 4 o level 4).

Steps 5  X  7: From steps 5 to 7, the HTDEA searches for the optimal step. The DE operators are then applied to compute the optimal values.

The parameters used by the proposed hybrid approach for optimization process are the following: (a) number of individuals: 50; (b) maximum number of generations: 400; (c) number of function evaluations: 20.000.

The best solutions obtained by the above mentioned approaches are listed in Table 2 , and their statistical simulation results are given in Table 3 for welded beam design problem.
When considering the number of function evaluations, the best solution computed and the statistical analysis results are taken into account together, it is concluded that the HTDEA provided better solutions for this problem compared to the published results ( Siddall, 1972 ; Ragsdell and Phillips (1976) ; Coello and Montes, 2002 ; He and Wang 2007 ; Huang et al., 2007 ; Akay and Karaboga 2010 ).

The worst solution found by the HTDEA is better than the best use of the proposed hybrid approach improves the convergence rate by computing the best value 1.7248 with the smallest function evaluation 20.000 and standard deviation 0.00510 values. As can be in the literature for welded beam design problem. 4. Structural design optimization using improved hybrid differential evolution algorithm
The hybrid approach is applied to optimal structural design of an automobile component taken from the automotive industry.
The objective function is minimization of the volume. The boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 2 . There is only one force acting along x -direction. The all degree of freedom on upper and lower connection regions are resticted.

In this research, then structural design optimization is performed using the present approach. In the first stage, the experiments are designed to evaluate the effects of four design variables. The four feasible range of design variables is considered as 100 o X 200 o X 2 o 335, 16 o X 3 o 115, and 140 o X 4 o 170.
Matrix experiments are designed using L 16 orthogonal arrays and the S / N ratios are conducted for the volume as given in Table 5 .
The relative effect of the different factors can be obtained by the ANOVA. The ANOVA is formed using S / N ratios for the objective function as shown in Table 6 .
 for the objective function with 34% contribution as shown in characteristic for the objective. Thus X 2 is chosen as X  X  335 mm.
The intervals of design variables are computed as 112 o X
X 2  X  335. 16 o X 3 o 115. and 140 o X 4 o 170. The new ranges of the design variables are used for initial population. Finally, the problem is solved using differential evolution optimization algo-rithm. The parameters used for optimization process are the following: (a) number of individuals: 30; (b) maximum number of generations: 80; (c) number of objective function evaluations: 2400.

The results of the HTDEA for the optimal structural design of the vehicle part are given in Table 7 . The use of the HTDEA improves the convergence rate by computing the best volume value 340524 cm 3 with the smallest function evaluation 2400.
