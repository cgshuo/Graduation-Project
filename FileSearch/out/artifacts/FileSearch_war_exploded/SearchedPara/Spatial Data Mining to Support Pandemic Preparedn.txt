 Effective detection of and response to pandemic disease out-breaks require significant advances in data mining. Contri-butions to the recently held SIAM DM 2006 Workshop on Spatial Data Mining highlighted key challenges, directions, and progress in this context. We summarize here the main themes presented at the workshop as well as promising re-search directions for the data mining community. Pandemic diseases such as avian influenza cause extremely infectious disease outbreaks. Pandemic influenza viruses have demonstrated their ability to spread worldwide within months or even weeks, and to cause infections in all age groups. While the ultimate number of infections, illnesses, and deaths is unpredictable, and could vary tremendously depending on multiple factors, it is nonetheless certain that without adequate planning and preparation [13], an influenza pandemic has the potential to overwhelm current public health and medical care capacities at all levels. Control-ling the spread of a pandemic requires early detection via appropriate surveillance [1], along with implementation of appropriate responses [6] (e.g., isolation of cases, quaran-tine of contacts, antiviral drug treatment and prophylaxis). These needs directly motivate research in spatial data min-ing for a time-varying network capturing collocation and effective contact patterns [5].
 The SIAM DM 2006 Workshop on Spatial Data Mining ( http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/  X  cbk/sdm06/ ) provided a forum for explorations into these challenges. To focus the discussion, a synthetic dataset of disease evolution in the city of Portland, Oregon was provided by the Virginia Tech Net-work Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory [9]. The five regular papers accepted for presentation at the work-shop [3; 7; 11; 12; 14] showcased a variety of data mining studies performed on this dataset, e.g., model-based data aggregation, mining spatial interaction patterns, predicting infection risks, designing containment policies, and process-driven spatial and network aggregation. Two additional short papers [8; 15] addressed spatial data mining challenges more generally. The goals of this report are two-fold: to summarize the main themes resulting from the workshop and to bring to the attention of the larger data mining com-munity the challenging problems arising in the context of pandemic preparedness.
 the traditional approach of estimating gross reproductive numbers by uniform mixing models over the entire popula-tion. In particular, it provides a bottom-up approach mir-roring the contact structure of individuals and is naturally suited for formulating and studying the effect of intervention policies. For more details, please see the EpiSims project ( http://ndssl.vbi.vt.edu/episims.html ; [4]), part of the TRANSIMS simulation infrastructure ( http://ndssl.vbi. vt.edu/transims.html ; [2]). Several levels of analysis must come together to successfully address the data mining challenges in pandemic prepared-ness. First, from the synthetic dataset, we must develop and model a time-varying spatial-social network capturing collocation and effective contact patterns. Second, we must conduct model-based data aggregation to identify the onset of disease and other qualitative indicators of disease spread. Third, we must identify critical individuals and critical loca-tions, in order to support targeted vaccination and targeted detection goals (respectively). We discuss some of the work discussed at the workshop for these various challenges. One of the key themes brought out by the workshop is a multi-faceted definition of what it means to be  X  X patial X , and how to appropriately model the data under that notion of spatiality. Modeling disease outbreaks necessitates captur-ing not only the geographic context but also the induced neighborhoods caused by people X  X  movement patterns and visitation patterns as a function of time. There is a complex interplay between  X  X patial X  in the geographic sense and  X  X pa-tial X  according to distances in a social network X  X ropagation in one context appears as discontinuous  X  X umps X  in the other. A wealth of literature exists on how diseases propagate through spatial and social channels, both at the epidemiological level and at the network modeling level. At the same time, data mining techniques can integrate multiple views of locality and spatiality. For instance, Gaussian process (GP) meth-ods that work with a prior on covariance structures [10] can be fruitfully interleaved with techniques that define covari-ances using an underlying graph model. Savell and Chung [11] propose an approach using the related Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) to model stochastic diffusion of disease state on the underlying network. This supports disease state pre-diction for unlabeled nodes, and thereby could account for real-world limitations in available information.
 Several other generalizations of  X  X patial X  were utilized in the presented work. The original study by Marathe and co-workers [5] included graph models such as people-people in-teractions (by way of collocation) and location-location in-teractions (by way of shared visitors). Guo [7] studies the relationship between such social localization and the under-lying spatial localization. Tatikonda et al. [12] use these graph models as the basis for developing containment poli-cies, discussed further below. Chen et al. [3] adopt a similar approach in analyzing Portland X  X  electrical network, which contains a mixture of short and long distance interconnec-tions, as well as notions of proximity to sources (the gen-eration system) and sinks (the consumers). Zarnani and Rahgozar [15] start with a similar neighborhood graph rep-resentation, while Jin et al. [8] integrate metric spatial and temporal information. Vucetic and Sun [14] further account gating other global indicators of disease outbreaks. Savell and Chung [11] likewise propose using global information, via their GRF model, in an active sampling strategy. As-sessment of risk guides the active sampling, either towards nodes useful for observation (where classification risk is high-est) or control (where infection risk is highest). Vucetic and Sun [14] also take a risk-based approach, using location aggregation (type of activity) to provide input for classi-fiers that predict infection risk. The first few generations of disease spread provide the training data for predicting the future course of the pandemic (and thereby appropriate responses). Data mining in support for pandemic preparedness is an important and rich application area, with many significant research challenges. Summarizing and adding to the issues identified above, we identify six key areas where data mining research must make progress: Algorithms for fast computations of multi-level net-work properties induced by spatial-social data; in par-ticular, provable approximations for estimating expansion, between-ness, and community structure, and tracking such properties across time-indexed snapshots.
 Integrating model-driven methods with spatial min-ing , e.g., combining a model for disease spread with a method for detecting critical individuals and locations; or using data mining to derive a social distancing policy or to formulate quarantine procedures.
 Disaggregation on demand , i.e., determining a small set of multi-level aggregates (among the multitude of possibili-ties) to be stored as sufficient statistics, thus allowing other microscopic parameters to be re-generated on demand. Co-evolving epidemic policy, simulation, and min-ing ; unlike passive observation of data to derive targeted sampling policies that model a static dataset, implementing an intervention policy can fundamentally change the course of future simulation runs, thus making data mining an inte-gral part of the simulation-based model.
 New objective functions for active data mining , that mimic targeted detection and targeted vaccination goals in epidemiological modeling, and, in this manner, close the monitor-simulate-mine loop.
 Support the view of simulation models as procedural representations of large datasets ; thus allowing the rich modeling literature to be harnessed for data mining goals. We hope these proceedings of the SIAM DM 2006 Workshop on Spatial Data Mining serve as an impetus toward estab-lishing a new thrust in the practical problem of pandemic modeling and result in a consolidation of ideas as well as a renewed bearing in spatial data mining research.
