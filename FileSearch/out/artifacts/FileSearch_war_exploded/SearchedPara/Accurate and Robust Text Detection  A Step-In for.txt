 We propose and implement a robust text detection system, which is a prominent step-in for text retrieval in natural scene images or videos. Our system includes several key components: (1) A fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing reg-ularized variations. (2) Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and threshold of clustering are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learn-ing algorithm. (3) The posterior probabilities of text candi-dates corresponding to non-text are estimated with an char-acter classifier; text candidates with high probabilities are then eliminated and finally texts are identified with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition dataset and a publicly available multilingual dataset; the f measures are over 76% and 74% which are significantly better than the state-of-the-art performances of 71% and 65%, respectively.

Text in images contains valuable information and is ex-ploited in many content-based image and video applications, such as content-based web image search, video information retrieval, mobile based text analysis and recognition, espe-cially for text retrieval in natural scene images. Due to com-plex background, variations of font, size, color and orienta-tion, text in natural scene images has to be robustly detected before being recognized or retrieved.

Recently, Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) based text detection methods, which actually fall into the family of connected component based methods but use MSERs [1] as character candidates, have become the focus of several recent projects [5, 3, 2, 6].

Although the MSER based method is the winning method of the benchmark data, i.e., ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition [5] and has reported promising performance, there remains several problems to be addressed. First, as the MSER algorithm detects a large number of non-characters, on one hand, it may still have room for further improve-ment in terms of the accuracies; on the other hand, it tends to be slow because of the computation of complex features. Second, current approaches [3, 4] for text candidates con-struction is time consuming and error pruning.

We propose a robust and accurate MSER based scene text detection method. First, we designed a fast and accurate MSERs pruning algorithm; the number of character candi-dates to be processed is significantly reduced with a high accuracy. Second, we propose a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm that can learn distance weights and clustering threshold simultaneously and automatically; character candidates are clustered into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm using the learned pa-rameters. Third, we propose to use a character classifier to estimate the posterior probabilities of text candidates corre-sponding to non-text and remove text candidates with high probabilities. By integrating the above ideas, we built an accurate and robust scene text detection system.
The structure of our novel MSER based text detection system, as well as the sample result of each stage is presented in Figure 1, which includes the following stages: 1) Character candidates extraction . character candidates are extracted with MSERs; most of the non-characters are reduced by the proposed MSERs pruning algorithm using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations. 2) Text candidates construction . distance weights and threshold are learned simultaneously using a novel metric learning algorithm; character candidates are clustered into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm using the learned parameters. 3) Text candidates elimination . the posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are measured using the character classifier and text candidates with high probabilities for non-text are removed. 4) Text candidates classification . text candidates corre-sponding to true text are identified by the text classifier. An AdaBoost classifier is trained to decide whether an text candidate corresponding to true text or not.

For more details we refer the reader to [7, 8].
First, we perform experiments on ICDAR 2011 Compe-tition dataset. The performance of our system, together with Neumann and Matas X  method [3], a very recent MSER based method by Shi et al. [6] and the top 3 scoring methods (Kim X  X , Yi X  X  and TH-TextLoc) from ICDAR 2011 Competi-tion are presented in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, our method produces much better recall, precision and f measure over other methods on this dataset. The average processing speed of the proposed system on a general Linux laptop is 0.43s per image.

Second, experiments on a multilingual dataset [4] are also conducted. The training dataset contains 248 images and the testing dateset contains 239 images.

 Pan et al. X  X  [4] 65.9 64.5 65.2 3.11 The performance of our system (include Scheme-I and Scheme-II ) and Pan et al. X  X  method [4] is presented in Ta-ble 2. The main difference between Scheme-I and Scheme-II is that the character classifier in the first scheme is trained on the ICDAR 2011 training set while the character clas-sifier in the second scheme is trained on the multilingual training set. The result comparison between Scheme-I and Scheme-II in Table 2 shows that the performance of the proposed system is significantly improved because of the in-corporating of the Chinese-friendly character classifier.
Finally, we have setup an online demo of our proposed sys-tem at  X  http://kems.ustb.edu.cn/learning/yin/dtext  X . We also develop an application software of camera-based re-altime scene text detection in Android Phones and Tablets.
