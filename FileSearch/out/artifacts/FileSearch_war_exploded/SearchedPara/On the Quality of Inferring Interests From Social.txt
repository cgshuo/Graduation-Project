 This paper intends to provide some insights of a scientific problem: how likely one X  X  interests can be inferred from his/her social connections  X  friends, friends X  friends, 3-degree friends, etc? Is X  X irds of a Feather Flocks Together X  X  norm? We do not consider the friending activity on online social networking sites. Instead, we conduct this study by imple-menting a privacy-preserving large distribute social sensor system in a large global IT company to capture the mul-tifaceted activities of 30,000+ people, including communi-cations (e.g., emails, instant messaging, etc) and Web 2.0 activities (e.g., social bookmarking, file sharing, blogging, etc). These activities occupy the majority of employees X  time in work, and thus, provide a high quality approxi-mation to the real social connections of employees in the workplace context. In addition to such  X  X nformal networks X , we investigated the  X  X ormal networks X , such as their hier-archical structure, as well as the demographic profile data such as geography, job role, self-specified interests, etc. Be-cause user ID matching across multiple sources on the Inter-net is very difficult, and most user activity logs have to be anonymized before they are processed, no prior studies could collect comparable multifaceted activity data of individuals. That makes this study unique. In this paper, we present a technique to predict the inference quality by utilizing (1) network analysis and network autocorrelation modeling of informal and formal networks, and (2) regression models to predict user interest inference quality from network charac-teristics. We verify our findings with experiments on both implicit user interests indicated by the content of commu-nications or Web 2.0 activities, and explicit user interests specified in user profiles. We demonstrate that the inference quality prediction increases the inference quality of implicit interests by 42 . 8%, and inference quality of explicit interests by up to 101%.
 i.e., users that do not contribute social content. On one hand, accurate user interest modeling can provide personal-ized search and recommendation results, and thus may help to increase the usage of social software. On the other hand, the available observations of users are sparse and exist in multiple types of media.

There resides more information about social relationships via traditional communication media, such as emails, in-stant messaging, meeting calendars, etc. Comparing to so-cial software, they provide better accuracy in inferring so-cial networks, since most people still spend significant time of these media. However, these data are more private, and thus, seldom could prior researches in the literature utilize such information without potential infringing privacy or col-laboration from the communication service provider, which is actually illegal in some countries. Fortunately, we solved the privacy issue by designing a rigorous distributed social sensing system [16] and went through lawyer, privacy offi-cer, and union reviews in each country to make sure the system follows the privacy and data protection laws. Up to Jan 2010, this system has been approved worldwide except 5 European countries.

We have been capturing the multifaceted activities of 30K+ people, including communications such as emails, instant messaging, meetings, etc, and web 2.0 activities, such as blogs, wiki, file sharing, and social bookmarking for up to 3 years in more than 70 countries. After anonymizing the identity and the content of these data, we are able to quanti-tatively infer the social networks of 400K employees within the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the three top social media 1 with the largest contributor populations, and the re-lationships among their contributor populations. Overall, the three top social media cover 31K employees out of the 400K employees of the enterprise. With the abundant infor-Figure 1: A Venn diagram showing the overlapping contributor populations of three top social media. mation of people available, we thus can study the scientific questions of  X  X hether one X  X  interests are related to the peo-ple surrounding him?

To address such challenges, we present a network autocor-relation model based approach that combines multiple types of social media to infer user interests from social neighbors, especially for inactive users . In order not to diminish the quality of personalized search and recommendation results by inaccurately inferred user interests, we propose a compu-tational method to measure inference quality (e.g., accuracy
Note that electronic communication can also be considered as a social media, though it is not a Web 2.0 social media. cess that people tend to form new links to others who are already like them. While social influence is an important factor that induces correlation among people, it is not the only one. Thus, Anagnostopoulos et al. [2] present a model to distinguish social influence from other factors of social correlation. Moreover, Tang et al. [24] model the dynamics and topic dependency of social influence. While these works provide us with a theoretical foundation to draw upon, our study focuses on the quality of modeling user interests from social neighbors, an important issue for social applications due to practical constraints, such as limited observations with large variations and multiple types.

In other work, several approaches have developed tools for various applications based on social influence and correla-tion. For example, Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg [15] exploit social correlation to predict future links among users. Ma et al. [17] leverage the similarity among ratings from friends to improve items recommendation (e.g., movies, books, etc). Our work similarly makes use of social correlation to infer user interests from social neighbors. However, in contrast to previous work, we focus on understanding the large variance of the inference quality and how the quality can be predicted by social network characteristics.
We analyze the information content in the electronic com-munication social networks inside a global information tech-nology firm with more than 400,000 employees. The data contain people X  X  electronic communication data, Web 2.0 so-cial content and employee job-related information.
The people X  X  electronic communication data include email and instant messaging activities. We collected detailed elec-tronic communication records of 8952 volunteer employees in more than 70 countries. To preserve privacy, the original textual content of an email or text message is not saved. Instead, the content is represented as a vector containing the terms appeared in the text as well as their counts af-ter stop-words removal and stemming. In addition, to con-struct a view of the network that reflects the real com-munications, we eliminate spam and mass email announce-ments and are left with 20 million emails and text messaging chats. Because a volunteer X  X  communication may include non-contributors, our system can thus infer the connections and the amount of communications to the non-contributors. From the 8952 volunteers X  communication data, we derive the social networks of more than 400K people within the firm, where the strength of a link is computed based the amount of communication between two people (see Equa-tion 5 for the detailed link strength definition).
We also collected social content in various Web 2.0 social software within the enterprise. Among the 400K employees, nearly 16K people created 400K social bookmarks of web pages [18]. Each bookmark includes the web page url and a set of tags. A different but overlapping set of 14K people shared 140K files, of which 20K files are public files that we can analyze. Two other social media that have smaller number of users are blogs with 5K contributors and 112K entries, and audio/video media library with 4.2K users and 61K media files. In this study, we focus on social bookmark-ing and file sharing, the two Web 2.0 social media that have the widest coverage in the enterprise.

Combining the users who contributed to one or more of the three sources, we have 31K employees in total (see Figure 1). objective function for top-N interests T N : where t j is the j -th topic, cos( t j , t k ) is the cosine similarity, the weights  X  1 =  X  2 = 0 . 5 but can be adjusted in different application scenarios. We use a greedy method to select the top-N interests. Then, for each interest we output its top N w keywords (e.g., N w = 20 ).
User interests can also be explicitly specified in their pro-files. In this organization, employees are encouraged to spec-ify information preferences indicating their interests in their online profiles. The interests are specified using terms from a manually designed work-related taxonomy. Overall, 1120 distinct terms are used in explicit interests. We observe that only 29% of employees (116K out of 400K employees) spec-ified their interests, and on average each person specified 10 terms. In addition, many people do not update the interests in years. We use a vector of terms as a user X  X  interest model. The default weight of a term is 1, since the terms specified in profiles are neither weighted nor sorted.

We further examine the relationship between the implicit and explicit user interests. Out of the 25315 users that con-tributed social content, 8005 of them also explicitly specified interests in their profiles. For these 8005 users that have both interest models, we compare the terms in their explicit interests and the top-20 implicit interests extracted from the contributed content. On average, 60 . 4% of the terms in a user X  X  explicit interests are covered by the terms in his top-20 implicit interests. In contrast, only 2 . 2% of the terms in a user X  X  top-20 implicit interests are covered by his explicit interests. This is understandable because the implicit in-terests are extracted from a large amount of content, while explicit interests are from a limited taxonomy and many users may just specify a small set of of their interests. An in-depth investigation of the relationship between the two types of interests is beyond the scope of this study. Instead, we focus on validating our findings on these two different types of user interest models.
Users X  behavior and interests are influenced by their neigh-bors in social networks. In this section, we present our ap-proach to inferring user interests using a social influence model based on network autocorrelation. Our approach may especially be useful for inferring interests of inactive users whose behavior is difficult to observe.
In social network sciences, network autocorrelation mod-els have been widely used to describe the social actors X  in-terdependency as a result of social influence [14]. In these models, people are assumed to establish their own behavior as a result of a diffusion process, in which they appropriately take into account the opinions and behaviors of their signif-icant social neighbors. We adopt this model in our study because only partial observations are available in our net-work, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficient samples for a large number of inactive users to train a probabilistic graph model such as the one in [24].

To infer a user X  X  interests using Equation 2, we only con-sider the neighbors in his three-degree ego network, i.e., the network of people within three degrees of separation to him. The reason is that previous empirical studies have been able to effectively use the information from neighbors within three degrees of separation for social influence study [7] and social search [16]. Therefore, we focus on the three-degree ego network of a user for inferring his interests.
To measure the quality of the inferred implicit interests, we define the quality as: C = 1 N where t j is the j -th topic in the inferred top-N interests, T
N is the ground-truth top-N interests, and cos ( t j , t 0 ) is the cosine similarity. Intuitively, the equation calculates how many inferred top-N interests are similar to the top-N ground truth. In our study, we set N = 10 and use the interests extracted from a user X  X  contributed content as his ground-truth implicit interests.

Then, we randomly partition the ground-truth data of the 25315 employees into ten parts and perform 10-fold cross val-idation to compute the inference quality. In each round, we leave out the data of one-tenth of the users (testing set), and infer their interests using only the extracted interests for the other nine-tenths of the users (training set). To investigate the effectiveness of combining different types of social con-tent, we conduct the experiment in four conditions: (1) us-ing social bookmarking data only, (2) using file sharing data only, (3) using electronic communication data only, and (4) using all three types of data. Table 1 shows the inference quality in the four conditions.
 Table 1: The quality of user interest inference.

The comparison results demonstrate the significant ad-vantage of combining multiple sources of social information. The mean quality of combining sources outperform the best mean quality of using one source (electronic communica-tion) by 52%. We attribute the significant improvement to the much wider coverage of the combined social content as illustrated by Figure 1. Specifically, each social media is used for different purpose. For example, social bookmark-ing is mostly for organizing and sharing web content while electronic communication is used more often for an infor-mation worker X  X  daily business. Therefore, the content in the different sources may relate to different aspects of a user X  X  interest. Among the three social media, electronic communication data gives the best performance because of its ubiquity and quantity. Social bookmarking outperforms file sharing, since social bookmarks are more direct and con-cise indication of user interests [23].

However, Table 1 also shows that the variance of inference quality is huge. We hypothesize that the variance is due to the large variation in people X  X  contributed content and their positions in the information diffusion of the social networks. In Section 6, we test this hypothesis and present a method to predict inference quality. By using the predictor to decide
We measure the activeness of user i in the network using the amount of content he contributed. Let a ( i ) be a (3  X  1) amount of the user X  X  contribution in social bookmarking, file sharing, and electronic communication, respectively. Their values are normalized to [0 , 1] by dividing by the maximum contribution in each type of media.

The social influence user i receives on a subject could be mostly from a highly active friend in the user X  X  ego network, or the collective influence from all neighbors is more impor-tant. To distinguish the two situations and compare their relative importance, we calculate both the sum and the max-imum value of the activeness in the ego network of user i . Moreover, each neighbor X  X  activeness should be weighted by his social influence on user i : A j ( i ) = where w vi is defined in Equation 3 to indicate the social influence user v has on user i , j = 0 , 1 , 2 denotes the type of the social media, and V k is the node set of the sub ego network containing neighbors of degree k .
Network in-degree and out-degree measure the number of electronic communication (e.g., email) between a user and other users in a network. For user i , in-degree is measured as the number of email sent to i , while out-degree is measured as the number of emails sent out from i . For a sub ego network V k of user i , we also calculate both the sum and the maximum value of the in-degree as: I ( i ) = where V k is the sub ego network containing neighbors of degree k , inDeg ( v ) is the number of emails coming into user v . Similarly, we calculate the sum and the maximum value of the out-degree as: O ( i ) = where outDeg ( v ) is the number of emails coming out from user v . In addition, we include the ego attributes inDeg ( i ) and outDeg ( i ) as features for user i .
For an individual node i in social networks, the between-ness centrality b ( i ) measures the relative importance of the node in the information flow within the network [9]. Hence, a user with high betweenness value might have high influence on his neighbors. Specifically, b ( i ) is defined as the proba-bility that node i will fall on the shortest path between any two other individuals in a network: where  X  lm ( i ) is the number of shortest geodesic paths from l to m that pass through a node i , and  X  lm is the total number of shortest geodesic paths from l to m . For the sub ego network V k of user i , we again compute the sum and the SVR model. We use the support vector regression imple-mentation in SVM-Light [12]. In our support vector regres-sion experiments, we use sigmoid kernel function tanh( s  X  x T i  X  x + c ) with parameter s = 0 . 2. Other parameters such as  X  are set to default. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of the regression in Section 6.3 and 6.4. Figure 2: (a) The precision-recall curves for implicit interest inference quality classification. (b) The quality improvements after using inference quality classification.
To evaluate the quality of the inferred top-N implicit in-terests, we use the prediction to classify  X  X igh quality X  in-ferred interests (e.g., quality C &gt; 50%). In practice, the criteria for high quality can vary according to application scenarios. To classify  X  X ccurate X  interest inference, we test whether the quality prediction is larger than a threshold TH . The precision and recall for a particular TH can be defined as: precision TH = | E H where E H is the ground truth set of  X  X ccurate X  inferences that satisfy our preselected quality criteria, and E TH is the set of predictions larger than TH . A precision-recall curve can be derived by varying the threshold TH .

We randomly partition the ground-truth user interest data into ten parts and use 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the classification performance based on support vector re-gressions. Five criteria are used to classify the inference quality. The resulting precision-recall curves are shown in Figure 2(a). We observe that satisfactory performance can be achieved by our quality prediction method. For example, to classify inferred interests that have quality larger than 50%, our method gives a precision of 62%, at a recall of result of balancing the two factors: the amount of informa-tion provided and the degree of separation.

Next, the impact of the three types of social information sources is compared. In our study, we have focused on three types of media: social bookmarking, file sharing and elec-tronic communication (e.g., email and instant messaging). Figure 3(c) illustrates the three precision-recall curves. The results show that ignoring electronic communication has the largest impact on prediction. This is understandable since the amount of electronic communication data is much larger: 20 million compared to less than 1 million in other two types of media. Besides electronic communication, social book-marking has a bigger impact than file sharing. This can be explained by the fact that social bookmarks are usually meaningful tags used to improve information search and or-ganization [18, 11, 3]. Therefore, it is easier to extract user interests from social bookmarks than shared files.
Moreover, we compare the impact of the maximum and sum values of the factors, which are both used as the features to predict quality (see Equation 12). For a user, the maxi-mum values of the factors correspond to the most prominent neighbor (e.g., the most active neighbor). In contrast, the sum values indicate the collective influence of all the neigh-bors. Figure 3(d) shows the precision-recall curves. We observe that leaving out the sum values has a bigger over-all influence on the classification performance. Therefore, the collective influence from all neighbors is still noticeably more important than the influence from a single most promi-nent friend. On the other hand, the features on the most prominent friend can already achieve a reasonable perfor-mance (e.g., &lt; 5% difference in performance), especially in high-recall, low-precision situations. Figure 4: Compare the impact of five factors includ-ing user activeness, network in-degree, out-degree, betweenness and user management role. (a) An overall view, (b) a detailed view with 0  X  recall  X  0 . 2 .
In addition, we assess the relative impact of the five fac-tors: user activeness, network in-degree, network out-degree , betweenness centrality , and user management role . The five corresponding precision-recall curves are illustrated in Fig-ure 4. In Figure 4(a), we observe that overall user active-ness has more significant impact than the other four fac-tors. In contrast, a more detailed comparison in Figure 4(b) shows that network in-degree, out-degree, betweenness and user management role have bigger impact in the scenario with high precision (precision &gt; 85%) and low recall (recall &lt; 20%). Among the social network features, network in-degree has the biggest impact. This indicates that it may be accurate to infer an inactive user X  X  interests if he receives information from many active friends. The implication is use the predictor to decide when to infer user interests from friends and achieve reasonable quality (e.g., mean accuracy 64 . 4%). In addition, the applications need combine all avail-able social content sources to increase the inference quality. For example, sources that provide larger amount of infor-mation (e.g., email) or are easier to extract interests (e.g., social bookmarking) can be given more weights. Further-more, neighbors with one or two degrees of separation have the most impact on inferring one X  X  interests. Two-degree neighbors may even have a bigger impact since there are much more of them and yet not too far away. Finally, users X  roles in formal networks also impact the inference. For in-stance, higher level managers can be more influential.
Our findings are based on social networks inferred from people X  X  electronic communication including email and in-stant messaging. In practice, the findings may also be ap-plied to social networks constructed from other types of in-teraction among people, depending on their availability. For example, the strength of the tie between two people can be inferred from their activities on online social sites (e.g., blogs, forum), co-authorship of papers [24], or face-to-face interaction captured by physical sensors [28].
In this paper, we present a study on the quality of infer-ring user interests from friends in one of the largest global organizations. We demonstrate that there exist large vari-ance of the inference quality when user contributed content considerably vary and the content types are diverse. To al-low search and recommendation applications make informed decisions on when to utilize inferred user interests, we fur-ther investigated relevant factors and present a method to predict inference quality based on network features including user activeness, network in-degree, out-degree, betweenness centrality and user management role. Our experiments vali-date the effectiveness of the prediction method and compare the relevant importance of the factors. Our findings can be useful for social applications with widely varied participa-tion rate so that the interests of many people can only be inferred from their friends. In particular, our results can be leveraged to provide new users with personalized recommen-dations, especially in our system where a user X  X  social net-works can be automatically constructed based on archived years of communications. This can motivate the new users to actively participate in social applications [6].
We are planning to incorporate the inferred user interests to provide better personalized results in enterprise expert finding and content recommendation systems [16]. In the future, we plan to examine additional network properties that may affect social influence, such as the network back-bone structure recently observed in email communication networks [13]. Another future direction is to study how well the dynamic evolution of users X  interests can be inferred from friends. Such study can increase our understanding on the temporal aspect of user interest models in order to provide up-to-date personalized search and recommendations.
