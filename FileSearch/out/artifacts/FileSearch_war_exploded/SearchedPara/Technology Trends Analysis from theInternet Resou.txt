 Shin-ichi Kobayashi 1 , Yasuyuki Shirai 2 , Kazuo Hiyane 2 , Fumihiro Kumeno 2 , Many attempts have been made to organize and present the relationships be-tween technical concepts for advanced use of the Internet content and academic papers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Based on these researches, we need further enhance-ment of the methods to grasp not only the current relationships between concepts but also the near future trends of the specified technology field. In this paper, we propose some metrics as leading indicators of changes over time, by which we can analyze the current situation and the future trends. The architecture of our system is shown in Figure 1.
 2.1 Keyword Extraction This module extracts keywords from resources using pattern matching, includ-ing regular expressions, and stores the keywords together with their phases in a keyword database. The patterns depend on the resource type and are defined by the user. This module extracts keywords for nine different phases: organization, technical term, system, protocol, business service, person, hardware, social phe-nomenon/trend, and business term. By considering indicators that are discussed later, in terms of individual phases, it is possible to recognize the target field from a global perspective (for example, organizationally driven, technologically driven, standards-centered, etc.). 2.2 Resource Analysis This module determines whether or not the keywords in the dictionary appear in each resource and generates a term-document matrix. If we consider n documents with m keywords, the size of the matrix is m  X  n . Each element f ij is 1 if keyword is the term vector relating to keyword i ,and d j =( f 1 j ,  X  X  X  ,f ij ,  X  X  X  ,f mj )isthe document vector relating to document j . 2.3 Keyword Relativity and Superiority The relativity and superiority are defined between two keywords in a group of specified resources.
 Relativity. The relativity R ( i, j ) of keywords i and j is defined by the similarity of the group of documents in which they appear. R ( i, j ) is defined by the well-known metrics, that is, the cosine of the term vectors t i and t j , as shown below. Superiority. The objective of superiority is to extract a hierarchical relation-ship between two keywords in the group of defined resources. In order to define superiority, the complementary concept i c for keyword i is defined. The com-plementary concept i c is a hypothetical concept that bears no similarity (no words i and j , assume i is a superior concept to j , then in accordance with the relativity between i and the complementary concept of j would be higher than the relativity between j and the complementary concept of i . Accordingly, we define the superiority P ( i, j )of i with respect to j as follows: where  X   X  2  X  P ( i, j )  X   X  2 .If P ( i, j ) &lt; 0, i is called to be superior to j . 2.4 Keyword Importance and Influence The importance and influence indicators show the status or positioning of key-words within a specified resource.
 Importance. Importance is an indicator of relative importance within a spec-ified resource and uses the well-known indicators tf and idf . The importance indicator W R ( i )ofkeyword i in a resource group R (with n documents) is de-fined as follows: where tf R ( i ) is a total number of appearances of i in R and df R ( i )isanumber of documents in R that include i .
 Influence. Suppose a keyword group A has been defined for a resource group R . The influence I A ( i )ofkeyword i  X  A with respect to A indicates the degree of influence of i for other keywords in A . The evaluation considers the degree to which the appearance of i in the documents reduces the entropy with respect to the other keywords in A , namely ( A \{ i } ).
 group S is indicated by H ( S ) as follows: where p ( S )( p (  X  S )) is a probability of any of the keywords in S being (not being) included in the document.
 the condition that the appearance of keyword i is known. H ( S | i ) is defined as follows: where p ( x, y ) is a joint probability of x and y ,and p ( x | y ) is a conditional probability of x based on y .
 A is defined as follows: result of knowing i . The greater I A ( i ) is, the greater the influence of i on the appearance of the other keywords of A . We consider that a highly influential keyword could induce structural changes in the target field after a certain time. In other words, influence is one of the leading indicators of time change. The nature of the change cannot be determined uniformly, but typically, there is an increase or decrease in the importance of the highly influential keyword itself or in a different keyword that has a high degree of relativity or superiority with the highly influential keyword.
 2.5 Trend Analysis as Time Series By continuously calculating the indicators discussed in section 2.3 and 2.4 for the specified set of keywords that characterize the field in a time series, it is possible to obtain data on past trends and future developments in that field. We consider the changes on the average values for importance, influence, relativity and superiority of keywords in the target field or phase as indicators for time series analysis, as well as the changes of importance and influence for the specified keyword. This section describes experiments using actual Internet resources, ITmedia 1 news articles (2001 -2003), targeting the categories of broadband and mobile communications. To identify time series trends in fields and phases, significant or representative keywords in that field are extracted according to their importance values. We consider that the trends of that field can be revealed by analyzing the trends of that group of keywords.
 Analysis of Overall Trends in the Broadband Field. We have selected 19 keywords according to their importance values. Figure 2 shows the overall trends of indicators in time-series from period 1 (2001/07 -2001/12) to period 13 (2003/07 -2003/12).
 with a high degree of influence appeared during these periods. As if in response, the average importance increased through period 6 and subsequently stabilized. Based on the meanings for the indicators shown in section 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5, this can be interpreted as the high influence of this trend, which first appeared in periods 3 and 4 and became a leading indicator of the broadband  X  X oom X  that followed. In actuality, the media began reporting widely on the potential for new platforms and services at that time, such as WiFi hot spots, IPv6, MPEG-4 video transmission, etc. Moreover, the fact that the average superiority gradually increased indicates that some kind of hierarchic structure had developed between the important keywords.
 Detailed Analysis of the Broadband Field. Figure 3 shows the trends in importance and influence for each keyword. Noteworthy in the broadband field is the conspicuous growth in the importance of wireless LAN. Wireless LAN was followed in importance by DSL, mobile phones, IP telephoning, all of which showed steady increases in importance, which matched the situation at the time. The rapid growth of wireless LAN can be predicted from the influence value. Both the absolute value and the influence of IEEE 802.11i and WiFi hot spots increased rapidly up through period 4, following which the importance of wireless LAN increased.
 ified period, we found that wireless LAN has the highest relativity value and a high superiority value with respect to IEEE and WiFi hot spots. In this sense as well, the hypothesis noted in the definition of influence is supported. Comparison with Human Experts X  Estimation. In order to reinforce the performance of this method, we surveyed the estimations of 10 researchers who are particularly interested in and have minimum 10 years X  working experience in these fields so that we can compare the results of this method with human experts X  opinions.
 relatively characterized in terms of the importance and the influence. For ex-ample, if a keyword has high importance and influence, then it can be classified as an important and noteworthy concept. We evaluated this method by com-paring the system X  X  and human experts X  answers about the classification of each keyword. Table 1 shows the results for this comparison. Although the value of concordance rate are not extremely high in themselves, taking into consideration that the answers by human experts hardly agreed with each other, we conclude that our system makes good performance and has ability to judge the status of each technology concept properly. Second evaluation is for the superiority. We surveyed human experts X  opinions about the structural configuration of the organizations, at the time of 2001 and 2003. While the results of the system say that higher hierarchization with respect to organizations achieved at the end of 2003 rather than at 2001 in the broadband field, eight of ten experts agreed with this trend.
 In this paper, we proposed the methods to characterize technology concepts and technology trends based on the Internet news resources, introducing some new metrics to grasp time series trends for technology fields or phases.
 the validity of this method and the use of indicators for technology trend analysis.
