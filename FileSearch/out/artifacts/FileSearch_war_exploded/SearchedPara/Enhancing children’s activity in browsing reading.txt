 1. Introduction
Reading picture books together with peers or adults motivates children to become active participants in a reading com-munity ( Jalongo, 2004 ). By reading-to-children 1 and also reading picture books together mainly with families younger children experience a range of emotions  X  e.g. joy, happiness, and sad  X  by being affected in their cerebral limbic systems ( Taira, 2009 ).  X 
These experiences and the experience in reading picture books together with families and/or friends, which accompanies read-ing-aloud, in succeeding years largely help older children to acquire literacy skills, broaden communication ability, and advance intellectual thinking by developing the frontal association areas within their cerebrums ( Arnold &amp; Colburn, 2009; Foorman &amp; Torgesen, 2001; McGee &amp; Morrow, 2005; Taira, 2009 ).

The children X  X  room of a public library or a kindergarten is one of the best places for children to find and read picture books of interest together with their families and/or friends ( Stooke &amp; McKenzie, 2009 ). When finding picture books children usually step over toward the bookshelves, pull out some picture books by browsing in bookshelves, and glance through them. After repeating these steps, they eventually find a picture book, which is then brought either to a table to be read or to a counter to be taken home. It can be noted that if the collection in a children X  X  room is not biased in content and not limited in number, it becomes more attractive and enhances the reading together activity. Unfortunately, mainly due to finance, many small public libraries are unable to collect a large number and/or wide variety of picture books. It also can be noted that children should be able to find picture books of interest by browsing in through the entire collection.
In the children X  X  room of a large public library, however, children face the challenge of finding these books; i.e. they either have to physically browse through multiple bookshelves or search a bibliographic database for keywords.

The problem in the children X  X  room of a small library described above could be solved by bringing digitized picture books into the existing printed picture book collection (in this case digitized picture books refer to the picture books that have re-ceived permission for digitizing and copying from the copyright owners), in addition to web picture books that are the pic-ture books in Digital Ehon, 2 Digital Okayama Encyclopedia can be potentially solved by building an environment in which children together can easily browse through a bookshelf that conveniently keeps the entire collection. Note that the adoption of off-the-shelf digital picture books provided by the web stores, e.g. Kindle store 5 and Barnes &amp; Noble, 6 exerts a significant influence on the execution of a library budget.
There have been various attempts to solve those problems. One approach seen in the website, Old Picture Book, the web based digitized versions of the great Old Picture Books written by authors such as Kate Greenaway, a popular 19th cen-tury writer for children, through the web. Although reading these picture books together can provide an excellent opportunity to teach children many things, supporting children X  X  browsing to find books of interest is crucial in increasing the amount of reading they do ( Reuter, 2007 ). The study ( Druin, Weeks, Massey, &amp; Bederson, 2007 ) for building ICDL provides kindergartners and grade-schoolers with worldwide digital picture books to read together, and allows them to find these books on a category browser. Eriksson and Lykke-Olesen X  X  study (2007) also supports children browsing together in a library by providing a large-scale device, where children step on the category buttons in order to select books. Despite the children X  X  immense enjoyment in playing with those systems, the category buttons may be hard to use for many younger children and those studies do not sup-port children who intend to browse through the bookshelves ( Eriksson, Krogh, &amp; Lykke-Olesen, 2007 ) in a library.
We here propose a method of steadily enhancing the activity of children in browsing/reading together with their families and/or friends by installing the BrowsReader in the children X  X  room of a library or a kindergarten. Most of these children are kindergartners and the rest are mainly lower graders. The original BrowsReader shima, &amp; Ito, 2008 ) was a system designed so that children can gather around it and engage in picture bookshelf browsing and picture book reading. However, it can work for a rather small picture book collection. The BrowsReader presented here has been improved step by step, keeping the design rationale intact, so that it can work in the children X  X  room, with a large picture book collection, of every public library or kindergarten. The children in such a room can easily browse a large number of picture books as if they are browsing in the physical bookshelves, and can read a wide variety of picture books as if they are reading ordinary printed picture books. The hardware setting is just a computer with a display. A touch-display relatively large in screen size is preferable so that the children together can operate the BrowsReader. The basic notions for the improvement are: (i) an abstracted bookshelf , which presents the front-cover images of many picture books in the form where all are linearly arranged, with some of the images bundled in places, and (ii) a unified view , which presents every page of any picture book in a form that seems like a printed picture book X  X  page. The goal of the improvement of the BrowsReader thus is to satisfy the following requirements: (1) A large number and wide variety of printed, digitized, and web picture books are reproduced as a set of surrogate pic-(2) Children, together with their families and/or friends, can easily browse in an abstracted bookshelf storing a large num-(3) Children, together with their families and/or friends, can read a wide variety of surrogate picture books in a unified (4) The browsing/reading activity for the surrogate picture books would not infringe upon copyright protection.
We consider that children together with their families and/or friends have read picture books using the BrowsReader in a children X  X  room when they together spend 2 X 5 min for flipping the pages of each of these picture books, by supposing that during this time period many kindergartners have enjoyed looking around the pictures and/or hearing the stories and many lower graders, in addition, have become intellectually activated through reading-aloud of the texts. The estimation of the time period is based on the observation of the kindergartners X  reading activity in a children X  X  room of a kindergarten.
By gathering around the BrowsReader children can easily browse in an abstracted bookshelf and then find surrogate pic-ture books which are of interest. Any found surrogate picture book, which can be moved around, rotated, and enlarged, is read by flipping the pages with the same convenience as with a familiar printed picture book. The children are also free to browse while reading. The BrowsReader is different from an ordinary bibliographic search engine in which the informa-tion about the desired picture books is searched for by inputting the keywords or category symbols and is presented on a display. In the BrowsReader all the front-cover images are linearly arranged and then presented in such a way that some of them, which will be of particular interest, are enlarged and the rest are reduced. Further the presence of all the front-cover images is shown all of the time. The BrowsReader is easily customized so that it can be installed in any children X  X  room, where the main task of the customization is to generate the surrogate picture books for the collection there. Fig. 1 , shows an environment built in the children X  X  room of Oita University library, which is open to the public.

The effect upon the installation of the BrowsReader has been evaluated along with its step by step improvement through five case studies; three of the case studies were conducted in the temporary children X  X  rooms built in Oita University campus and two in the actual children X  X  rooms of Oita Prefectural library evaluation study, where children freely used the BrowsReader, was employed so as not to have any long lasting influence on the children X  X  browsing/reading activity in the future. In the initial three studies, where hundreds of digitized and non-flash-based web picture books and also printed picture books became available, the children X  X  behavior was observed, and then the children were questioned and interviewed to evaluate the effect of the installation. Through the observation and the answers we con-firmed the BrowsReader could be used in an actual situation. In the latter two studies, a relatively large number of digitized, non-flash-based/flash-based web picture books and a fairly large number of printed picture books collected in a children X  X  room became available on the BrowsReader. The printed, digitized, and web picture books, which were arranged so that they reflected the scheme used to classify the printed picture books, were able to be browsed all together, and any digitized/web picture book be read as if it was an ordinary printed picture book. By analyzing the data of the employed logging system, and questioning and interviewing the librarians and kindergarten teachers who observed the children X  X  behavior, we collected the evidence showing that the children in the actual children X  X  rooms were steadily enhanced in browsing/reading together.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Previous studies which have focused on enhancing children X  X  browsing/ reading activity are overviewed in Section 2 . Our aim is to steadily enhance the children X  X  activity in browsing/reading to-gether by installing the BrowsReader in the children X  X  room of a library or a kindergarten. The original design of the Brows-
Reader should be improved to work well in any actual situation, and therefore in Section 3 we introduce two basic notions to achieve the desired improvement; an abstracted bookshelf and a unified view. Following that, and then based on these no-tions, we state the ways in which the improvement is obtained. These are detailed in Section 4 . In Section 5 a description is provided to show how the BrowsReader is customized so that it can be installed in each of the children X  X  rooms. In Section 6 we detail the case studies that were conducted to improve and evaluate the BrowsReader in enhancing browsing/reading together. Finally, Section 7 describes a future research direction to further investigate the effect of the BrowsReader in the children X  X  activity in reading together. 2. Related work
Recent studies have suggested that the environments for enhancing the children X  X  activity in browsing/reading together are built along three main streams. The first stream involves ideas which encourage children to read the printed children X  X  books 11 in the children X  X  room of a public library. The second stream provides a large collection of digital children X  X  books in a server system and encourages children to read and discuss via client computers. The third involves devising new large-scale digital devices that intensify the children X  X  physical activity.

The reading-to-children programs of public libraries in the promotion of children X  X  reading activity in Japan ( Editing Com-mittee of Nippon Association for Librarianship, 2006 ) and Storytime programs in USA ( McKenzie &amp; Stooke, 2007 ) have been very effective in attracting children (mainly aged 0 X 3) for reading together with their families. In another effort, Statewide
Summer Reading Program 12 ( Houck &amp; Simon, 2008 ) in New York State in USA, 1100 local public libraries across the states orga-nize children aged 0 X 5 as well as older children during summer to read various children X  X  books together with their families in a series of events. The main benefit there is to provide fun to the children through reading together, which is an important part of ited period of time. Further the collection in each library is limited in number and biased in content, and in addition, out-of-print books could not be read there either.

Providing digitized picture books through the web is one way of alleviating those problems. The free website, Old Pic-ture Book, carries the digitized out-of-print books for younger children (aged 3 X 9) to choose from. The children and their parents can find and read these books at any time. The number of books in the collection, however, is limited and little atten-tion is paid to browsing together. Oxford Owl, 13 the website built by Oxford University Press, has claimed that encouraging younger children, mostly preschoolers, to read picture books together with their parents can effectively help them to develop early reading skills. When the parents draw attention to letters and sounds, their children begin to notice them as well. Thus children X  X  early reading can be seen to greatly benefit from reading picture books with families and developing initial awareness of pictures, sound, and letters relationship.

The adoption of off-the-shelf digital picture books available from web stores, e.g. Kindle store and Barnes &amp; Noble, can be another way of providing a number of picture books for children. The available collection from which picture books are cho-sen as a part of the collection of a public library, however, is still not so large. Though more than 1100 public and school libraries in USA have introduced the digital book distribution system of OverDrive Inc., the digital picture books, the introduction of such a system also becomes a burden financially. off-the-shelf digital picture books are usually read on dedicated devices each of which is not well suited for children to use by gathering around.
 In order to provide a large collection to children researchers ( Druin et al., 2001; Hutchinson, Bederson, &amp; Druin, 2006;
Hutchinson, Druin, &amp; Bederson, 2007 ) have tried to address the problems by building a children X  X  digital library, named ICDL, on the web. There are many other experimental, public, and commercial digital libraries. Two studies related to ICDL have investigated how to help children from grade schools or junior high schools to find the digital information about children X  X  books and read them through verbal communication ( Druin et al., 2003 ) or through internet communication ( Kaplan &amp; Chis-ik, 2005 ). The former study has designed and developed an interface in which children (the major targets are children aged around 8) can use multiple mice collaboratively on a single computer to access multimedia information. As the children get into the search section, they are required to click category symbols and forced to engage in conversation to agree upon how to use two mice. The latter study has been carried out at Baltimore University, where children in the higher grades or from junior high schools have used the Internet to exchanged and shared ideas about the children X  X  books in ICDL with their read-ing group by making digital notes and/or marks. Although the effectiveness of ICDL in reading children X  X  books has been cer-tificated in a four-country study ( Druin et al., 2007 ), the focus is on the reading together activity to some extent and does not support the combining of the physical spaces and artifacts in a library. In ( Eriksson &amp; Lykke-Olesen, 2007; McIntyre, 2002 )it is said that children desire for physical spaces in a library for social communication.

The stream for building new large-scale digital devices includes a number of projects. The researchers in the projects have tried to realize new children X  X  libraries to meet various children X  X  needs ( Enemark, 2008 ) including a new design of physical spaces for old as well as new media. The project conducted by Aarhus University and Aarhus School of Architecture in Den-mark ( Eriksson &amp; Lykke-Olesen, 2007 ) has studied an interactive children X  X  library that can engage the children X  X  physical activity in finding printed children X  X  books through the digital system. The prototype system, StorySurfer, has an interactive browsing device set up in a public library. The system has category buttons on the floor of the library that display the front covers of categorized books, and the children (the major targets are children aged around 8) together select a category by stepping on the appropriate category buttons. The children are able to walk among the front-covers to choose books of inter-est, and the information then is sent to an interface module displaying the book locations. This system motivates the children for mutual interactions and then they can have an enjoyable time when reading as usual, but to do this they are required to know the categories beforehand. The device seems to be too large to be suitable for ordinary libraries. The study has also revealed that the children do not prefer to search for books through the available systems; however they do like to browse in physical bookshelves to find books of interest, and prefer the front-covers instead of the backs of the books. Shelf-Slider, which is shown in the study ( Eriksson et al., 2007 ), is a proposal to assist children aged around 8 in browsing the front-cov-ers. By touching the digital slider attached to the sidewall of a physical bookshelf, the children together are able to browse the front-covers in this bookshelf. When the children stop the slider on a particular front-cover, the location of its corre-sponding book is displayed. The slider interface meets the children X  X  preference, but when the size of the book collection becomes too large, they can easily lose their way to browse, making browsing difficult.

Another project, Search Wall ( Detken, Martinez, &amp; Schrader, 2009 ), aims to realize a tangible interface which searches for interesting information in a public library. It provides a large vertical wall display, a small table in front of it, and 10 cate-gories/keyword-cubes surrounding them. Children aged 5 X 11 have access to digital data, such as titles and front-covers, about printed children X  X  books from the wall display by narrowing down the search area in the collection. The children can enjoy searching, but they are required to use the categories/keyword-cubes. Although they together can browse in the large wall display, the number of books presented is limited, and they have to change the presentation frequently to find the desired books.

When supporting the children X  X  activity in a library by reflecting the results of those studies or implementing those kinds of systems, there is an unavoidable issue related to copyright protection ( Covey, 2005 ). To increase the number of digital books in the collection the library has to negotiate with the copyrights holders. This negotiation becomes a heavy burden financially as the number of newly collected digital books increases. And if we collect only books which are allowed to be copied and/or whose copyrights have expired, we will lose a great way to give the children a further opportunity to read. Note that we can find a variety of places, i.e. websites, where the children can freely read digital picture books.
The approach taken here is different from the studies described above. The installation of the BrowsReader in the chil-dren X  X  room of a library offers an easy way to establish a new environment for enhancing the children X  X  activity in brows-ing/reading together. In this environment, children, gathering around the BrowsReader, become able to easily browse a large number and wide variety of picture books in harmony with the ordinary browsing in physical bookshelves, and to read any found picture book with the same interface as that provided in an ordinary printed one. The hardware setting is just a com-puter with a display. Also on the BrowsReader many and various digitized/web picture books become available at little ex-pense and without infringing copyright protection. 3. Abstracted bookshelf and unified view
The desirably improved BrowsReader outlined here reproduces printed, digitized, and web picture books as surrogate pic-ture books, and then presents the surrogate picture books in the form of an abstracted bookshelf front-cover images so that children can easily browse in this bookshelf just as when browsing in physical bookshelves. The
BrowsReader also presents the found surrogate picture books in the form of the ones providing a unified view be read in a similar way to the ordinary printed picture books. Here a surrogate picture book consists of the front-cover image followed by the page images of a printed, digitized, or web picture book. Fig. 2 depicts the sources of organizing an abstracted bookshelf and of producing the surrogate picture books.

An abstracted bookshelf is organized as the presentation of the linearly arranged front-cover images of surrogate picture books both for the printed picture books in a collection and for the digitized/web picture books being collected. Some front-cover images in places will be bundled to make an abstracted bookshelf compact in form. Any front-cover image accompa-nies its surrogate title, which is a schematization of the title of this front-cover image for presentation. Some surrogate titles will be superimposed when they are similar in string and then one or more front-cover images can accompany the same surrogate title.

The arrangement of the front-cover images is conducted in the same manner employed to linearly arrange the printed picture books in physical bookshelves. As the arranging schemes in many libraries are based on the colored spine labels for major classification followed by the titles for minor classification (author names sometimes are employed instead), we put, at the heads of the surrogate titles, the color symbols whose arranged order is the same as that of the spine label X  X  colors. We then arrange all the front-cover images according to the color symbols in their corresponding titles. When the front-cover images have the same color symbol, we further arrange them based on the lexicographical order of titles. Note that the color symbols are not for categorizing the picture books but for arranging the front-cover images. Any front-cover image thus has its own relative location in an abstracted bookshelf, which is quite similar to any printed picture book given the fact that it has its own relative location in physical bookshelves. The surrogate titles themselves are also arranged sim-ilarly. One of the specific features of an abstracted bookshelf is that it always presents the presence of all the front-cover images. When the images are small in size, many of them can be enlarged by reducing the rest while keeping the relative locations unchanged.

The surrogate picture book for a printed picture book is in fact composed of the image of its front-cover photo followed by the page image showing the physical bookshelf photo in which this book is placed. For a digitized picture book the surrogate picture book is composed of its scanned front-cover image followed by the scanned images of the rest of the pages, and for a web picture book the web page with its front-cover image followed by the web pages along with the rest of the pages. Unfor-tunately, by using these basic compositions the surrogate picture books themselves could have different views. We prepare a sophisticated mechanism of trimming the front-cover/page images and of transferring the page flipping operations into some specific mouse events by employing the CollaboTray technology in ( Abe et al., 2010 ) so that any surrogate picture book can provide a unified view. In the following we present an overview of some abstracted bookshelves and some such surro-gate picture books.

Fig. 3 a shows an initial abstracted bookshelf, where the left side presents the front-cover images of in total 1265 surrogate picture books for 1111 printed, 79 digitized and 75 web picture books, and the right side their surrogate titles. For dealing with a large number of surrogate picture books and easy browsing in an abstracted bookshelf some adjacent front-cover images are grouped to form a surrogate bookcase in fix size n (the adoption of a surrogate bookcase makes it possible that about n times as many front-cover images as the case when not employed can be presented on a display). Accordingly the surrogate bookcases in an abstracted bookshelf are arranged by reflecting the order of color symbols from the top row to the bottom row and from the left side to the right side in each row. The surrogate titles are also arranged from the left column to the right column and from the top end to the bottom end in each column. Fig. 3 b, changed over from Fig. 3 a by inputting
Japanese hiragana characters and , shows an abstracted bookshelf in which the front-cover images and the surro-gate titles with these characters in the corresponding titles are enlarged and the rest reduced. Note that the Japanese hira-gana consists of 46 basic characters and 30 additional ones, where the basic characters can be grouped into 10 classes. A hiragana character in Japanese seems like an alphabetic character in English. (The detail of dealing with the Japanese hira-gana in the BrowsReader is given in Section 4.1.3 .)
The front-cover images of the surrogate picture books for three printed, digitized, and web picture books in the enlarged bookcases are presented, after further enlargement, in the top left, bottom center, and top right in Fig. 4 a, respectively, where these books are to be read using the sophisticated off-the-shelf book viewers. They are, however, different in presentation and in page flipping operation. Fig. 4 b presents three front-cover images providing a unified view protection infringement occurs. Children together can read any of them through ordinary page flipping, and if necessary can move around, rotate, and enlarge it.

Children can freely go into reading from browsing, and vice versa. Also the children are able to browse in an abstracted bookshelf while others glance through it. Since an abstracted bookshelf matches physical bookshelves and any surrogate pic-ture book can be read in a similar way to read a printed picture book, the children together can browse/read with the same feeling as when they are in an ordinary children X  X  room even on the BrowsReader. The installation of the BrowsReader thus will make a children X  X  room more attractive in enhancing browsing/reading. 4. The BrowsReader to be installed in a children X  X  room The improvement for steadily enhancing the children X  X  browsing/reading activity in the children X  X  room is to have the
BrowsReader satisfy four requirements denoted above. In this section we describe in more detail the ways in which the improvement is obtained. Hereafter a surrogate bookcase and a surrogate title, respectively, are written as a bookcase and a title for simplicity unless otherwise noted. 4.1. For browsing a large number of surrogate picture books together as if they are in the physical bookshelves of a children X  X  room (requirements (1) and (2))
After observing the collection sizes of various public libraries it becomes clear that the BrowsReader should be able to deal with at least 10,000 printed picture books in addition to many digitized/web ones. It also can be noted that the relative locations of the printed picture books in the physical bookshelves of a children X  X  room would be basically unchanged even when the collection sizes are increased or decreased. 4.1.1. Organizing the left side of an abstracted bookshelf
On the left side of an abstracted bookshelf the bookcases (each of which includes several front-cover images) are linearly arranged and then presented. To make the arrangement understandable we put a color bar on the top of each bookcase. This color bar matches the color symbols at the heads of the titles whose corresponding front-cover images are in this bookcase.
All the bookcases are color-segmented and arranged according to the color bars. Each printed picture book thus is considered to have its relative location in an abstracted bookshelf that matches its relative location in physical bookshelves.
Children together can change over from one abstracted bookshelf to another one with more enlarged bookcases, if they want to examine in more detail some bookcases or some front-cover images that are small in size. The character icons are prepared to enlarge multiple bookcases containing at least one front-cover image whose corresponding title includes the character(s) that has been dragged-in (the detail of dragging-in the character(s) is given in Section 4.1.3 ). No enlarged book-cases are reduced, and if the reduced ones are adjacent and given the same color bar, they are bundled to make room for better enlargement. Each bookcase also can be enlarged by touching it, and each front-cover image there, when it corre-sponding surrogate picture book is to be read, can also be further enlarged by touching it. The presence of all the bookcases is shown all of the time with their arranged order unchanged so that each of the children can notice the present state of an abstracted bookshelf in order to easily browse in it together with others. An abstracted bookshelf then works as a simulta-neous menu ( Hutchinson et al., 2005 ).

Children could become confused about the arrangement of bookcases when there is a sudden changeover on an ab-stracted bookshelf, so an animation procedure for the changeover when dragging-in a character is employed. A zooming technique is utilized to formalize an animation procedure. The procedure when dragging-out can be similarly formalized.
As all the linearly arranged bookcases in an abstracted bookshelf are two-dimensionally allocated on a display for presen-tation and the bookcases to be enlarged/reduced would be scattered around there, some need to be moved upward while others downward in order to make room as large as possible. This complication makes it difficult to employ the previous zooming techniques ( Appert &amp; Fekete, 2006; Bederson, 2001; Toyoda &amp; Shibayama, 2000 ). We solve this difficulty by devis-ing a new zooming technique that consists of spiraling-up and -down steps. The spiraling-up steps begin, for each bookcase from the headmost to the dead-end in an abstracted bookshelf, with repeatedly moving this bookcase while it can be moved toward the leftmost position in its own row; and further, if possible, toward the rightmost position in the raw above, by con-sidering the final bookcase allocation. When moving, reduce the size of the moving bookcase if it includes no front-cover image of the surrogate picture book containing the dragged-in character in its title. After the spiraling-up, each of the book-cases is spiraled-down by reversing the steps and enlarging the size of each bookcase.
With this procedure all the bookcases are spiraled-up or -down uniformly, and then the linear arrangement of the book-cases is clearly presented all of the time. Fig. 5 depicts an example of zooming when a character is dragged-in. The left, mid-dle, and right figures, respectively, show the abstracted bookshelves before, during, and after the changeover. The spiraling-up and -down steps, respectively, are depicted in the upper-and lower-middle figures. The spiraling-up can be sped up by grouping the bookcases that are adjacent in a row and will be moved upward, and by moving them toward the final locations after moving them concurrently toward the leftmost in this row. Each bookcase that will be moved upward but is not grouped is processed similarly. The spiraling-down also can be sped up in the same way. 4.1.2. Organizing the right side of an abstracted bookshelf
The titles on the right side of an abstracted bookshelf become useful, especially when the front-cover images to be browsed are too small in size. By noting that even kindergartners together with their families and/or friends can deal with a character ( Liu et al., 2007 ), the function for children to drag-in a character to have the more enlarged front-cover images is prepared. The dragged-in character is centered in the titles, the titles with this character are selected and rearranged like in the KWIC index ( Steensgaard-Madsen et al., 1981 ), and the adjacent titles with common substring are superimposed as much as possible for better presentation. Accordingly the front-cover images whose titles are included in the presented titles are enlarged.
Fig. 6 a presenting the titles (including two superimposed titles) is changed over to Fig. 6 b presenting the rearranged titles with the dragging-in character in their centers. The width of each title is adjusted to make room for the dragged-in character and its predecessor/successors, and each title is presented as large as possible so that children can see if the inputted character constitutes a part of the title. When the number of dragged-in characters increases, the number of presented titles drastically decreases and the size of each title increases. This also helps the children to correctly spell the words, as seen in the utilization of an incremental search ( Stallman, 1993 ). It is indicated in ( National Institute for Japanese Language, 1972 ) children could not correctly spell words until 11, though they start to become interested in characters from around 3 years old. No zooming technique is employed since the titles with the dragged-in characters are the only objects that would be enlarged and presented. The color symbols attached at the heads of the titles match the color bars on the bookcases. Any color symbol can be dragged to browse the color-segmented bookcases in sequence.

A touch on a title corresponds to the input of the characters in this title. Since the enlargements/reductions of the left and right sides of an abstracted bookshelf are fully synchronized, as a character is dragged-in, the matched bookcases and the associated titles are enlarged simultaneously. Such synchronization guarantees the left and right sides, as they should be seen in one mechanism. 4.1.3. Dragging-in or -out a character
Children are able to easily browse in an abstracted bookshelf with many small front-cover images by dragging-in or -out a character. The dragging-in or -out of a Japanese character which is done by using the character input panel located in the lower-right of a display (see Figs. 3 or 4 ), is especially effective in such a case. The Japanese hiragana consists of 46 basic characters and 30 additional ones expressing dull sound, nasal sound, etc., and the basic characters are grouped into 10 clas-ses most of which consist of five characters. In the second-left division of the input panel almost all the hiragana characters are shown in 10 dark soccer-ball shaped icons; the rest of the hiragana characters are shown in the middle division when needed. In the left-most division 10 colored soccer-ball shaped icons reflecting the spine label X  X  colors are presented in a cir-cle, where 2 colored soccer-ball shaped icons are for digitized/web picture books (the number of the colored soccer-ball shaped icons will vary depending on the major classification taken in each children X  X  room). When one of the colored soc-cer-ball shaped icons is dragged, its corresponding color symbol is inputted and all the bookcases with the corresponding color bar are presented after being enlarged. When one of the dark soccer-balls is touched, it is enlarged and presented in the middle division, and then children are able to drag-in a character. By dragging a character icon, the presented bookshelf is promptly refashioned. Children one after the other can drag the character icons in succession. In Figs. 3 and 4 the other 10 soccer-ball shaped icons located at the second-right division are prepared to drag-in alphabetic characters. The soccer-ball shaped icons could be replaced so that characters for some other languages can be inputted.

The characters that have been dragged-in are displayed on the white-ribbon just above the soccer-ball shaped icons. The children one after the other can drag-out or exchange any characters on it to have an imaginable arrangement of characters.
These convenient features help the children without knowledge about keywords to easily operate on the BrowsReader. The characters on the white-ribbon can be cleared out to set an abstracted bookshelf to the initial presentation. When a non-superimposed title is touched, its corresponding title is displayed on the white-ribbon. The children together then can up-date it by adding or removing characters as they please. The bookcase icon at the bottom-right division is for bringing back the surrogate picture books under reading into an abstracted bookshelf. 4.2. For reading a surrogate picture book together in the feeling that it is an ordinary printed picture book and without the infringement of copyright protection (requirements (3) and (4))
In the BrowsReader printed, digitized, and web picture books are reproduced as the surrogate picture books that can pro-vide a unified view. The surrogate picture books also should be dealt with in a manner that does not infringe upon copyright protection when presented to the public. In the following we first discuss about copyright protection and then a unified view. 4.2.1. Keeping copyright protection intact
Any surrogate picture book consists of a front-cover image followed by the page images or the page image with a physical bookshelf photo. No copyright protection issue occurs on the images but for the front-cover images of printed and web pic-ture books, and for the page images of web picture books. This issue on those front-cover images can be solved by taking the obscured front-cover photos or by referring to the web pages with the URL addresses displaying them. It should be noted that the web pages are referred to every time when the front-cover images there are required to be presented. For the page images of web picture books we could take a similar approach to the front-cover images. Since, however, for some sort of web picture books, e.g. flash-based web picture books, no URL addresses for the page images can be known, we take another approach to using off-the-shelf book viewers (or internet explorers) stating at the URL addresses for the front-cover images.
To speed up the presentation, the obscured front-cover images in the web pages are registered and then presented when they are in small bookcases. Eventually the BrowsReader stores (i) for a printed picture book the obscured front-cover image (and the URL address in which the non-obscured front-cover image will be displayed, if available) followed by the page im-age displaying a physical bookshelf photo, (ii) for a digitized picture book the front-cover image and the rest of the page images, and (iii) for a web picture book the obscured front-cover image and the URL address in which the non-obscured front-cover image will be displayed. 4.2.2. Providing a unified view
The surrogate picture books on off-the-shelf book viewers would be variously presented as seen in Fig. 4 a. To alleviate this defect the BrowsReader has been developed in such a way that the surrogate picture books can provide a unified view.
The mechanism to do so is depicted in Fig. 7 , where the CollaboTray technology devised in Abe et al. (2010) is employed. The mechanism takes a three-layer structure. The bottom layer is for a web page with a front-cover/page image of some picture book on an off-the-shelf book viewer, and the top layer for just the front-cover/page image. Though on the bottom layer the specific buttons in places should be pressed for page flipping, on the top layer dragging (or touching) of the page images is sufficient for this purpose. The middle layer shows a CollaboTray technology based filter for trimming the bottom layer im-age so as to be seen on the top layer, for moving around, rotating, and enlarging the trimmed image by the affine transfor-mation ( Jain, 1988 ), and for transferring the dragging (or touching) performance to the corresponding button operation. The moving around, rotating, enlarging, and dragging performances encourage children to read surrogate picture books together.
No infringement of copyright protection occurs since the BrowsReader stores no original images on the web pages (and of the printed picture books). 4.2.3. Reading a surrogate picture book
Children together can read a surrogate picture book with a unified view having the feeling that it is an ordinary printed picture book. When a front-cover image in some bookcase is touched its corresponding surrogate picture book is presented in readable size. This design mimics the book reading activity in a children X  X  room. When the presented surrogate picture book is for a digitized or a web picture book, children can read it by flipping one after the other the front-cover image and then the page images on the BrowsReader as if they are reading a printed picture book on a table. When the presented surrogate picture book is for a printed one, the children can read it by flipping the front-cover image, finding its location in an abstracted bookshelf and also in physical bookshelves, taking it out from there, and then flipping the pages on a table. More than one surrogate picture book can be read simultaneously. 4.3. A scenario of using the BrowsReader
Let us see a scenario in which we assume that two children are gathered around the lower-right corner of the display for the BrowsReader and use it to find some picture book of interest. The initial abstracted bookshelf is the one shown in Fig. 3 a.
They together can change over from Fig. 3 ato Fig. 3 b by dragging-in characters and one after the other, and examine the further enlarged front-cover images of three surrogate picture books about (rabbit) X  as seen in Fig. 4 b. They then become able to select the surrogate picture book entitled (a rabbit in lonesome heart) X  whose page image is shown in Fig. 8 . They together can read it by orienting, enlarging, and flipping the page images of this digitized pic-ture book. 5. Customizing the BrowsReader
An abstracted bookshelf is designed to be easily customized so that the BrowsReader can be installed in each of the children X  X  rooms. In the customization process librarians are requested to collect the picture books that have the permission to be digitized and/or to qualify the picture books on the web. The former could be the product of the library X  X  course in cre-ative writing open to citizens, and the latter could be found by some citizens, e.g. parents when navigating websites.
The generation of surrogate picture books for digitized picture books is rather easy, i.e. it can be by scanning their font-covers and pages. When they are originally digitized the task becomes much easier. The generation of surrogate picture books for web picture books is the registration of the URL addresses of their websites and the preparation of the data to pro-vide a unified view. For digitized/web picture books their titles and dedicated color symbols should be registered. The gen-eration of surrogate picture books for printed picture books includes: collecting the titles and the codes for the arranging scheme, finding the front-cover images on the web, and taking the photos of physical bookshelves. The titles and codes can be found in a library X  X  bibliographic database. Many of the front-cover images can be found on the web by employing a search engine with ISBN numbers, though some inadequate ones still need to be filtered out manually. When the front-cover images are not available on the web, they are manually obtained by taking their obscured photos. The location of each printed picture book is registered in the form of the page image with the photo of the physical bookshelf in which this book is placed.

The most laborious work in the customization process is the preparation of the data used for providing a unified view for the web picture books (i.e. the preparation of the location coordinates of the page images and the buttons on the web pages) and of the obscured front-cover photos of the printed picture books. The organization of a database, storing the data and photos (as well as the images of digitized picture books if they are open to the public), makes the customization much easier when newly installing the BrowsReader in another children X  X  room. 6. Case studies
We evaluated the BrowsReader by employing a free-style study of allowing children to use the BrowsReader without con-trol or direction from the researchers as this kind of study would minimize any unexpected influence on the children X  X  browsing/reading activity in the future. This allowed us to certify the effect of installing the BrowsReader by noticing that the children X  X  activity in browsing/reading together was steadily enhanced.

The BrowsReader was improved and evaluated in a step by step process through two phases: (i) in temporary children X  X  rooms realized in three children X  X  events, where we not only directly observed the children X  X  behavior, and questioned and interviewed the children but also employed a logging system to record the children X  X  operations on the BrowsReader, and (ii) in the actual children X  X  rooms of a prefectural library and a kindergarten, where, since we were not allowed to directly ob-serve, question, and interview, we analyzed in some detail the data of the reformed logging system to figure out the chil-dren X  X  activity in reading together, and questioned and interviewed the librarians/kindergarten teachers who observed the children X  X  behavior.

The digitized and non-flash-based web picture book collection in the former phase was gradually increased in number, although the total number was up to around 700. We further set up the makeshift physical bookshelves arranging 500 printed picture books to see whether the BrowsReader could really work in an actual situation. In the latter phase the further improvement was achieved so as to manage, in a unified view, the complete collection of printed picture books in an actual children X  X  room in addition to the digitized and non-flash-based/flash-based web picture books. Some color symbols were also prepared for suitably presenting special bookcases which collected the front-cover images of seasonable picture books, with the reflection of the arranging scheme taken in each children X  X  room. The design of several icons was somewhat chan-ged by hearing the opinions of the children. We also checked that the children steadily enjoyed the use of the BrowsReader and became more active when browsing/reading on it.

The hardware setting for the BrowsReader was basically the same in all case studies, though each was customized to manage the collection available in each setting. A 30-in. touch-display was utilized to encourage the children together to operate the BrowsReader by gathering around it as shown in the figures in Table 3 . 6.1. In the temporary children X  X  rooms 6.1.1. Environments
Each study in the three events in 2007, 2008 and 2009 hosted at Oita University was performed from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. by building a temporary children X  X  room in the university campus, where a total of 111, 146 and 126 children aged 3 X 12 with their families and/or friends participated in using the BrowsReader, respectively. Children got together when browsing/reading as they pleased.

In the 2007 event we focused on browsing/reading the surrogate picture books for the digitized versions of 162 printed picture books (the digitization here was performed solely for the case study use because of copyright protection) and on con-firming that the children could use the BrowsReader ( Liu et al., 2007 ). The children were briefly introduced to the Brows-
Reader and encouraged to freely use it. In the 2008 event we added the surrogate picture books for another 70 digitized and 228 non-flash-based web picture books to see whether the children could browse/read the web picture books ( Liu et al., 2008 ). In this event a display was set horizontally on a table and we checked the effect of such setting. In the 2009 event the collection was enriched by adding other 259 non-flash-based web picture books ing the surrogate picture books for relatively new 500 printed picture books. We temporarily put, at the heads of the titles, the color symbols that reflect grouping of the Japanese hiragana characters. These printed picture books also were provided in the makeshift physical bookshelves placed in a temporary children X  X  room. The front-cover images of about 94% of the printed pic-ture books were found in the websites such as Books.or.jp the children together read the printed picture books in the physical bookshelves after finding their surrogate picture books on the BrowsReader. A display in the 2009 event also was set horizontally. 6.1.2. Results and discussions
The same logging system to record the children X  X  dragging and touching operations was utilized in all three studies for the statistical survey. We further observed the children X  X  behavior, and requested that the children (along with their families and/or friends) filled in the questionnaire shown in Table 1 . The questions were prepared to see whether the use of the
BrowsReader was enjoyable and whether the browsing/reading together activity there could be enhanced from the view-point of the children. We also collected information on the ages and grades by interviewing the children. 6.1.2.1. Results about browsing. Figs. 9 a and 9b show the percentage of the children who dragged-in at least one character and the average number of dragged-in characters, respectively. We noticed that even kindergartners could drag a character icon ( Liu et al., 2007 ). In the 2009 event 98.4% of the children dragged the character icons. This rate was larger than 71.9% and much larger than 23.5% in the 2008 and 2007 events, respectively. We believed that this was a result of the front-cover images being small. The children would like to see the front-cover images; and this fact was the main cause of dragging-in more characters when the front-cover images presented were small. We concluded that the BrowsReader was able to work in enhancing the browsing together activity even for a large collection. Most children could freely change over the ab-stracted bookshelves and then find the surrogate picture book(s) for reading. Even kindergartners and lower graders dragged-in characters, and some children dragged-in multiple characters as seen in Fig. 9 b. From the answer to Q5, many children read the printed picture books after using the BrowsReader.

In the 2009 event, where a display was horizontally set and the makeshift physical bookshelves were set up, we observed that about 80% of the children gathered around the BrowsReader for browsing. The percentage was larger compared to that in each of the previous events. After browsing, many children were able to easily locate although not knowing the structure of an abstracted bookshelf and to read the found printed picture books without getting lost in the physical bookshelves, by seeing their locations in the abstracted bookshelf and the page images with their photos. By this fact we can say that the children could browse in surrogate picture books like usually. 6.1.2.2. Results about reading. Fig. 10 shows the average numbers of surrogate picture books for the digitized/web or the printed picture books read by the children getting together. After touching a front-cover image the children began to flip its page images on the BrowsReader or the pages in front of the physical bookshelves. When many page images for a digi-tized/web picture book or many pages for a printed picture book were observed being flipped one after the other at an easy pace, we decided that this book had been read together. Two to four children getting together read 1 X 2 picture books on average; however with more time they would have been able to read more. In the 2009 event the children read in total 44 printed picture books after finding their surrogate picture books. In the event about a half of the children liked to read printed picture books better than digitized/web ones. Similar results have been found in other research ( Druin et al., 2007 ). The children were not bewildered when reading the digitized/web picture books. We thus can conclude that the
BrowsReader worked well in allowing the children together to read the digitized/web picture books as if they were reading ordinary printed ones.

Many children shared the surrogate picture books they found with their families and/or friends when they found some-thing interesting there. Several children, who learned how to orient the front-cover and page images toward them by mim-icking the other children X  X  behavior, read the surrogate picture books as if they were the ordinary printed ones. Some of the children still tried to find the printed picture books in the physical bookshelves nearby after reading their digitized versions.
The graffiti tool prepared to virtually paint on digitized/web picture books contributed a great deal to motivate the children in reading, although this tool was excluded in the following studies since the graffiti on printed picture books would be pro-hibited in a library. 6.1.2.3. Discussions based on the questionnaire and interview. The statistics about the answers to the questions in Table 1 are shown in Table 2 . When comparing the data for the common questions, the results for the years were almost the same except for Q2 and Q4. The average percentage of positive answers to Q2 drastically increased from 38.8 in 2007 to 63.0 in 2008, and then to 83.7 in 2009. This certifies that the activity in browsing/reading together could be enhanced by laying down a display and furthermore by building a environment in which many printed picture books as well as digitized/web ones were col-lected. Positive answers to Q4 in the 2009 event indicates the built environment was suitable for kindergartners and lower graders. Some higher graders had a clearer purpose of their own; if the book(s) they were looking for could not be found, they would no longer use the BrowsReader. From the answers to Q1, Q7, and Q8 it can be seen that the children who rarely go to libraries enjoyed the use of the BrowsReader.

From the answers to Q3 and Q5, we can see that most children could easily find the surrogate picture books and not a few children read the printed picture books after finding their locations in the makeshift physical bookshelves. The average per-centage (61.1%) of positive answers to Q6 correlates well with our observation that a large portion of the children joined in browsing/reading together.

Some comments from the interviews with the children were:  X  X  X e like to read the picture books together with others. X  X   X  X  X f the same one is in our school library, I will use it every day. X  X  Many parents told us that they hoped the BrowsReader would be set in a public space not just in the event.

Based on the studies in the temporary children X  X  rooms we believed that the BrowsReader could be used in the actual children X  X  rooms providing it could manage many more and various picture books. We also noticed that the BrowsReader should be able to flexibly color-segment the bookcases according to the arranging scheme taken in each actual children X  X  room. 6.2. In the actual children X  X  rooms 6.2.1. Environments
We improved the BrowsReader in such a way that it could manage all the printed picture books in the children X  X  room of a public library or a kindergarten in addition to the digitized and non-flash-based/flash-based web picture books. The other main improvement was to have a surrogate picture book providing a unified view even for a web picture book with no
URL addresses for the page images without infringing copyright protection. Also the bookcases in an abstracted bookshelf were made to be flexibly color-segmented. We then carried out the studies to certify the viability of the improved Brows-
Reader in any actual situation by installing both in the children X  X  room of Oita Prefectual library, a fairly large public library playing the central role on public library services in Oita prefecture, and in that of Beppu University X  X  attached kindergarten, a medium kindergarten. The BrowsReader was named KNT-Oita when customized for the prefectural library, and KND-Bep-pu for the kindergarten. The study in the prefectural library was carried out during 5 months from October 27th, 2010 to March 26th, 2011 and that in the kindergarten during almost 2 months from February 9th, 2011 to March 26th, 2011.
We know that many children prefer reading printed picture books to digitized/web ones ( Druin et al., 2007 ). Using this knowledge, and the results in Section 6.1.2 , we made suppositions before the following case studies (i) that the BrowsReader in each of the children X  X  rooms would work well to enhance the activity of children in reading the printed picture books to-gether as one positive effect of enhanced browsing together, but (ii) that its work to enhance the activity of children in read-ing the digitized/web picture books together would be limited.

The customization for KNT-Oita was performed as follows: The digitized picture books were the product of the librarian course opened in Beppu University. The web picture books were found in a varied selection of 20 X 60 websites, e.g. Digital
Ehon, Digital Okayama Encyclopedia for Japanese picture books, and ICDL for English picture books, and qualified by the librarians of Beppu University and Oita University libraries. The URL addresses of their websites and the data for providing a unified view were stored in a server of Oita University library, where the front-cover/page images of the digitized picture books also were stored. This server could be accessed by not only KNT-Oita but also KND-Beppu via the web. The surrogate picture books for the printed picture books were generated in the manner described in Section 5 , where about 67% of the front-cover images were found on the web by employing a search engine with ISBN numbers. Only their obscured images were stored in KNT-Oita. The rest of the front-cover images in this study were automatically produced and stored as the ones with the titles for simplicity. The bibliographic data and the codes for the arranging scheme were obtained by the manner stated in Section 5 . Since the number of surrogate picture books in KNT-Oita was very large, we set each bookcase size to 9.
The customization for KND-Beppu was as follows: The digitized/web picture books were collected in a similar manner to KNT-Oita. This work was rather easy since we fully utilized the data stored in the server of Oita University library.
English picture books were excluded because of the language problem for the kindergartners. The surrogate picture books for the printed picture books (published relatively earlier) were generated similarly. About 51% of the front-cover images there were found on the web. Their obscured images were stored in KND-Beppu. The rest of the front-cover images were produced and stored by taking their obscured photos. The bibliographic data and the codes for the arranging scheme were set in a similar way to the above. Since the number of surrogate picture books on KND-Beppu was not so large, we set each bookcase size to 4.

Table 3 summarizes the environmental settings of KNT-Oita and KND-Beppu. The display for each was vertically set and bound on a table to prevent possible accidents, although the horizontal setting was shown in the above case studies to be effective as a way of allowing children to get together.
 The numbers of surrogate picture books in KNT-Oita and KND-Beppu, respectively, were gradually increased as shown in
Tables 4 and 5 . The additions on KNT-Oita were (i) caused by the updating of the bibliographic data for the printed picture books and (ii) planned to see the effect of the increase in the number of web picture books. The additions on KND-Beppu were caused because we started the free time use following to the school time use. 6.2.2. Results and discussions
The reformed logging system, which enables us to check whether the children visited the children X  X  rooms were more active in reading together, was utilized in both case studies, since we could not observe the children X  X  behavior there and also could not record the personal data. This logging system recorded the operations on abstracted bookshelves and surro-gate picture books with the time stamps. We questioned the librarians and kindergarten teachers as shown in Table 6 . The questions were prepared to see whether the built environments could enhance the browsing/reading together activity from the viewpoint of the librarians and teachers. To see the effect from the viewpoint of the children we checked whether KNT-Oita or KND-Beppu was actively used by analyzing the logged data.
 6.2.2.1. Results about browsing/reading on KNT-Oita. Fig. 11 a shows the average numbers of touched front-cover images in
KNT-Oita per open day in each month. In total 4595 front-cover images (2959 different ones) were touched. Figs. 11 b and 11c show the ones per weekday and holiday (including Saturdays and Sundays), respectively. The latter was much larger than the former; this meant that on holidays the children visited the children X  X  room and operated KNT-Oita with their fam-ilies in addition to their friends (with whom they might visited on weekdays). On weekdays the grade-schoolers had insuf-ficient time and the kindergartners had no means of transportation to come to the prefectural library. By seeing Fig. 11 cwe can say that KNT-Oita worked fairly well in steadily enhancing the children X  X  activity in browsing together, where the aver-age numbers of touched front-cover images on holidays went up to around 80 and were highly stable during 5 months.
When comparing the relative number ratios of printed, digitized, and web picture books in the collection, the number ratio of touched front-cover images of digitized/web picture books appeared to be increasing, though that of printed picture books was consistently high. We reconsidered that the children from the beginning had an interest in reading the digitized/ web picture books together.

Fig. 12 shows the relative average number ratios for touched/dragged bookcases, character icons, and titles on holidays in each month, where the ratio for bookcase was very high. By seeing this figure we can say that the children tended to browse the front-cover images even when their sizes were very small. A similar observation was made in research ( Eriksson et al., 2007 ) which indicated that children liked to browse in the bookshelves with front-covers. From the analyses the presenta-tion of front-covers would be necessary to enhance the children X  X  browsing/reading together activity. It also could be noticed that the children rather frequently dragged-in the characters to enlarge the front-cover images, and sometimes dragged the titles. As to the dragged-in characters about 29% of them were for the strings with not less than four characters in length.
The logged data was analyzed to estimate how many surrogate picture books for the digitized/web picture books had been read together on KNT-Oita. Since in the children X  X  room the direct observation of the children X  X  activity was not feasible, we considered that the children together with their families and/or friends had read a surrogate picture book when they to-gether spent, for page flipping, 2 X 5 min from the opening to the closing of this picture book. This time period was estimated by observing the reading activity of the kindergartners of Beppu University X  X  attached kindergarten (the details are given in
Section 6.2.2.2 ). We could not estimate such time period for a printed picture book. In total 58 surrogate picture books (54 different ones) were considered to have been read together within a period of 41 holidays, and this number, i.e. 1.4 surrogate picture books per holiday, seemed rather small.

The fact that on KNT-Oita the number of touched front-cover images was large and the number of surrogate picture books read was small seems to coincide with our suppositions denoted above. By hearing comments from the librarians, however, we came to the conclusion that, if the number of digitized/web picture books in a collection is comparable to that of the printed picture books, the children together are sure to read many more digitized/web ones. This tendency can be seen in Fig. 11 c.

Although no user X  X  manual for browsing was prepared for KNT-Oita, the children liked to touch the bookcases even in a large abstracted bookshelf, as seen in Fig. 12 . Thus we can note that the children browsed in a large number of surrogate picture books in the same manner as if they were browsing printed picture books in the physical bookshelves. There was also no manual for reading the surrogate picture books. The answers for Q3 shown in Table 7 show that when the picture books found by using KNT-Oita were non-digitized/web ones, many children often went to the physical bookshelves to read them. This leads us to note that the children would not clearly differentiate the digitized/web picture books with the printed ones for reading. 6.2.2.2. Results about browsing/reading on KND-Beppu. We had two sub-phases for the case study in a kindergarten when using KND-Beppu: the school time use followed by the free time one. The school time use was set on February 8th, 2011 between 9:30 a.m. and 12:00 noon to introduce KND-Beppu to the children who were in one of three classes Y (15 children aged 3 X 4), M (21 aged 4 X 5), and E (22 aged 5 X 6). The children in every class were put into 24 subclasses, where every class was 2 X 4 members. We installed two KND-Beppu X  X , each of which stored the collection shown in the middle column of
Table 5 , in the children X  X  room. In each abstracted bookshelf the front-cover images of all the printed picture books were reduced in size, since the purpose of this sub-phase was for the children to have the first experience to use KND-Beppu in both browsing together and reading together. The children X  X  subclasses were to read the digitized or web picture books.
There was no difficulty in reading them using KND-Beppu even for class Y children, since all the children had much expe-rience in reading the printed picture book together.

When many page images of a surrogate picture book were observed being flipped one after the other at an easy pace, we decided it had been read together. Almost all subclasses read the surrogate picture books, and each subclass spent around 10 min or more to browse in an abstracted bookshelf and to read 2 X 3 found surrogate picture books. In total 64 surrogate picture books (26 and 38 for digitized and web picture books, respectively) had been read on two KND-Beppu X  X  in almost 2 h.
Each subclass spent about 3.5 min on average for reading a surrogate picture book. After observing the children X  X  behavior, we asked the children to comment on the enjoyment of using KND-Beppu, the activity in reading digitized/web picture books, and the experience of utilizing computers. About 85.5% and 76.5% of the answers, respectively, were positive for the former two (there was no noticeable statistical difference among the children X  X  classes), though the percentages of the children in classes Y, M, and E giving positive answer to the last one were 38.0%, 50.0% and 63.6%, respectively. We also asked the kindergarten teachers and children X  X  parents to use KND-Beppu and questioned whether KND-Beppu was useful to enhance the children X  X  activity in reading together when installed in the children X  X  room. The answers received were positive.

On February 9th, 2011 we installed one KND-Beppu in the same room as in the above with the collection shown in the right column of Table 5 . In the free time use KND-Beppu was set so that the front-cover images of not only the digitized/web picture books but also the printed picture books were presented. When the surrogate picture book for a printed picture book was found the printed picture book could be read in this room after being taken from the physical bookshelves. The same logging system as described above was set in KND-Beppu.
 Fig. 13 a shows the average number of touched front-cover images in KND-Beppu per room-open day in each of 2 months. In total 2036 front-cover images (827 different ones) were touched. The children browsed in an abstracted bookshelf of KND-Beppu around 75 times per day. This results shows that the children in the kindergarten were active in browsing together.
The distributions of the average numbers of touched front-cover images for printed, digitized, and web picture books in the kindergarten and prefectural library were different. This could come from the different number ratios for those picture books in KND-Beppu and KNT-Oita. As a consequence we can say that KND-Beppu well matched this room and that the children enjoyed the use of it.

Fig. 13 b shows the relative average number ratios for touched/dragged bookcases, character icons, and titles on a room-open day in each month. The children tended to browse the front-cover images similar to the above. From this figure we can again say that the presentation of the front-cover images of the printed picture books that were collected in the kindergarten would be beneficial to enhance the children X  X  browsing together activity. As to the dragged-in characters about 19% of them were for the strings with not less than four characters in length.
 We estimated how many surrogate picture books for the digitized/web picture books had been read together on KND-Beppu on the same base for KNT-Oita. In total 89 surrogate picture books (53 different ones) were considered to have been read together within a period of 27 room-open days. The number, i.e. 3.2 surrogate picture books per room-open day, was relatively large compared to the one in the study in the prefectural library, though the activity time period per day was short.
Some of the same surrogate picture books had been read by the same child at different times or by different children. We propose that KND-Beppu could work well to enhance reading together in addition to browsing together.

The fact that the number of touched front-cover images on KND-Beppu was large during a period of almost 2 months coincides with the suppositions denoted above; however the number of surrogate picture books read on KND-Beppu was relatively high, which seems to contradict some of these suppositions. The reasons are that the number of digitized/web pic-ture books and that of printed ones were almost equal, and that the published date of the printed picture books were rel-atively old. Another reason is that the children would like to read the digitized/web picture books as well as the printed ones; which can be confirmed by the comments of the kindergarten teachers described in the following. The children in the children X  X  room with KND-Beppu were highly active in browsing/reading together.

The similar notices about browsing in an abstracted bookshelf and reading the surrogate picture books shown in the above for KNT-Oita can hold for KND-Beppu. Since the children could use KND-Beppu without the assistance of the kinder-garten teachers, the browsing/reading activity on KND-Beppu is said to be seamlessly combined with the accustomed activ-ity in the children X  X  room of the kindergarten. 6.2.2.3. Discussions. From the results of the two case studies we can say that the BrowsReader will work well in steadily enhancing the activity of children, especially kindergartners, in browsing/reading together in every children X  X  room. This benefit is also achieved by the basic design of the BrowsReader that the children who gather around and use it can browse/read surrogate picture books together with their families and/or friend with the same feeling provided when brows-ing/reading the ordinary printed picture books in a children X  X  room. One key to yielding this feeling is the adoption of the color symbols/bars for linearly arranging the front-cover images. Ideally, however, the color symbols/bars should have a well known linear structure such as the one for the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... . This kind of structure for the color symbols is seen in the
Munsell color system ( Munsell, 2004 ) and also in the color gradation in a rainbow. If the colored spine labels attached to the backs of printed picture books had reflected this ideal linear arrangement, the colored soccer-ball shaped icons in the char-acter input panel (see Figs. 3, 4 or 8 ) of KNT-Oita or KND-Beppu would have been presented in the similar way to the hue-circle of the Munsell color system. Fortunately for the study we found a partly ideal linear arrangement in the spine label X  X  colors in Beppu University X  X  attached kindergarten. Also if the display of KNT-Oita or KND-Beppu had been set horizontally, the browsing/reading activity would have been much more enhanced.

Table 7 shows the answers to the questionnaire featured in Table 6 . From the answers to Q1 and Q3, we can say the chil-dren X  X  room of a public library or a kindergarten will be one of the best places for lower graders and/or kindergartners to use the BrowsReader. From the positive answers to Q2, Q3 and Q4 we can say that KNT-Oita and KND-Beppu worked fairly well to enhance the children X  X  activity when seen from the perspective of the librarians and kindergarten teachers. Since both
KNT-Oita and KND-Beppu, respectively, were actively used together with others over 5 months and almost 2 months, we can say that they worked well even when seen from the children X  X  perspective.

We outline some interesting comments on KNT-Oita and KND-Beppu from three librarians and three kindergarten teach-ers, respectively. Some of the comments from the librarians are as follows:  X  X  X he children used KNT-Oita with no help from a librarian. X  X   X  X  X e saw that the children were sometimes waiting in line in front of KNT-Oita. X  X   X  X  X he grade-schoolers were po-sitive about dragging-in the characters and some of them were the repeaters. X  X   X  X  X he children would have read more digi-tized/web picture books if many more digitized/web picture books that could be clearly identified were collected. X  X 
Further we noticed that some adults used KNT-Oita to find picture books for reading-to-children. Comments from the kin-dergarten teachers are:  X  X  X he kindergartners in classes Y and M enjoyed browsing and the ones in class E reading too. X  X   X  X  X he children really liked the digitized/web picture books to read together. X  X  We also were informed that KND-Beppu has contin-ued to be used by some children X  X  parents for reading-to-children once a week.

In the actual children X  X  rooms we took rather long term studies to certify that the children thoroughly and constantly en-joyed the use of the BrowsReader, and also to confirm the credit that a set of the BrowsReader X  X  can be installed in the chil-dren X  X  room of multiple public libraries. To conclude we can say that the kindergartners in a new environment in a kindergarten become more active in reading digitized/web picture books together and can confirm that the children, includ-ing the lower graders, in a new environment in a public library will become more active in reading together when many more and various digitized/web picture being clearly identified are collected. 7. Conclusions
A method of building a new environment for steadily enhancing the children X  X  activity in browsing/reading together is proposed by installing the BrowsReader in the children X  X  room of a public library or a kindergarten. In this environment a large number and wide variety of printed, digitized, and web picture books are reproduced as a set of surrogate picture books that can provide a unified view, and then the front cover images of these surrogate picture books are presented in the form of an abstracted bookshelf. The children who visited there together with their families and/or friends can browse in an ab-stracted bookshelf with the same feeling that is provided when browsing in the physical bookshelves and read a digitized and web picture book as if it is an ordinary printed picture book. We can note by the case studies that the BrowsReader is steadily used in each actual children X  X  room.

Future research will be needed to investigate in more detail that the children in a new environment become as active in reading digitized/web picture books together as in reading the printed picture books. Beyond the specific remit of this study it is important to remember that the activity of children in reading together has a positive effect on the development of the children X  X  frontal association areas as well as cerebral limbic systems. By examining how often the children, especially the lower graders, read digitized/web picture books together, in the case where the digitized/web picture books in the Brows-
Reader have significantly increased in number, it is possible to clarify the differences between reading of digitized/web and that of printed picture books with particular concern toward comprehensibility and affectivity. We are now collecting many more qualified digitized/web picture books and grouping them by age bracket to be registered in the BrowsReader. The log-ging system is also being reformulated in order to specify a range of important data, e.g. children X  X  voices, of reading-aloud together as well as to monitor the page flipping action even for a web picture book with no URL addresses for the page images, and to count how often the same digitized/web picture books have been read. The logged data will be compared with the statistics and findings about reading printed picture books in a children X  X  room.

One way of increasing non-printed picture books in number will be to improve the BrowsReader so that it can manage off-the-shelf digital picture books in a manner similar to digitized/web ones, if many more off-the-shelf digital picture books become available and their adoption would not hamper the finances of a public library. We are taking another approach; i.e. many and various digitized/web picture books are being collected by installing a set of the BrowsReader X  X  in the children X  X  rooms of multiple public libraries, where these collected picture books are the ones originally produced or selected by the citizens residing near one of the libraries, and by linking the BrowsReader X  X  to a server of Oita University library via the web.
We already have additionally installed the BrowsReader X  X  in four medium-size public libraries in local cities in Oita prefec-ture, and asked the libraries to set up cultural lesson courses for producing digitized picture books open to citizens. These
BrowsReader X  X  can also be utilized to organize a regional repository as a locally-organized but globally-usable digital library when the products are the digitized (or digital) picture books telling folktales, myths, patrimonies, etc., in a regional community.
