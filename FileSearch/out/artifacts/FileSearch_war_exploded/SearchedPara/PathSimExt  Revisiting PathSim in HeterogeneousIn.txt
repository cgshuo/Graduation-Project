 A heterogeneous network is a logical network that usually consists of a large amount of multi-typed and interconnected component s. The inter-connections in the hetero-geneous networks often indicate different ki nd of relations, such as bibliographic net-works, epidemic network, and social media network [1]. As an example in bibliographic networks, users may be interested in querying similar authors to the author of a paper that they just read. There are variant ways to measure the similarity of two authors in a bibliographic network. For instance, two authors is similar if their papers co-appear in the same venue frequently or they are the co-authors in many publications.

Similarity queries in homogenous networks have been extensively studied over the past few decades, where random walk based approaches (e.g., P-PageRank [2] and Sim-Rank [3]) are the representative methods in this category. However, the random walk solutions cannot be used in heterogenous networ ks since the walks over different rela-tionships have different meanings behind. To address the similarity queries in heteroge-nous networks, Yizhou Sun et al. [4] proposed PathSim that computes the similarity of two objects based on the affiliation of a semantic path. For instance, the affiliations in bibliographic networks may include authors -venues ( AV ), authors -papers (AP), and papers -terms ( PT ) relationships. A possible semantic path is authors -venues -authors ( AVA ) which indicates the similarity of the aut hors based on their co-appearance in the same venue. Given a semantic path (e.g., AVA ) and a query object (e.g., an author), PathSim returns the most similar objects based on the affiliations in the semantic path.
In this work we enrich PathSim by introducing external support into the similar-ity computation. We observe that some factor can be used as an external support for improving the similarity search. More specifically, the similarity of venues is not only reflected by the semantic path venues -authors -venues ( VAV ) but also the reputation similarity of the venues (e.g., average citations per paper). Table 1 compares this idea with other similarity methods using a DBLP example that lists the most similar venues to  X  X KDD X  based on a semantic path venues -authors -venues ( VAV ).  X  X KDD X  is a Euro-pean conference on machine learning and kno wledge discovery in databases. As shown in the table, P-PageRank [2] and PathSim [4] return  X  X DD X  and  X  X CDM X , respectively; however, these results may be not the best answer for the query since the reputation of  X  X DD X  and  X  X CDM X  is quite different from  X  X KDD X . SimRank returns a less related conference  X  X ocal Pattern Detection X  as the top-1 result which manifests the problem of random walk based solutions in heterogenous networks. Thus, we revise the definition of PathSim, named as PathSimExt, that additionally introduces external support into the similarity measures. A heterogenous information network is a special type of information networks that ei-ther contains multiple types of objects or multiple types of relationships. More specif-ically, a heterogenous information network is a directed graph G , where each vertex belongs to one particular object type T and each edge belongs to one particular seman-tic relationship R .
 Semantic paths,  X  . Based on the semantic relationships, we can construct a semantic paths  X  that typically represents some semantic meaning behind. For instance, a seman-tic path authors -papers -authors ( APA ) (shown in Figure 1(b)), that uses two semantic relationships AP and PA , indicates the co-authorship. Note that the semantic path is not necessary symmetric, where a asymmetric semantic path VPTV can be found in Figure 1(c). To facilitate reasonable search queries, we assume that the begin and the end object type in a semantic path ar e always identical in this work.
 PathSim. As studied in [4], PathSim is shown to capture better semantics of peer similarity in heterogenous network than other methods proposed for homogenous in-formation networks, such as P-PageRank and SimRank. Formally, PathSim is defined as follows.
 where w ( x, y ) represents the number of path instances between x and y under the se-mantic path  X  . The denominators, w ( x, x ) and w ( y,y ) , can be viewed as the normal-ization factor in the definition.

Table 2 shows an example of PathSim that finds the most similar authors of  X  X ike X  under the semantic path APA . According to the definition of PathSim (Equation 1),  X  X ike X  is similar to  X  X im X  than  X  X om X  since the number of path instances (i.e., the num-ber of collaborations) between  X  X ike X  and  X  X im X  is higher than  X  X ike X  and  X  X om X . How-ever, if we take the fame of the authors (i.e., number of citations) into consideration,  X  X om X  should be a more similar result to  X  X ike X  since both of them have similar num-ber of citations and publish certain amount of papers together. This example shows that external support (i.e., number of citations) can enrich the result of PathSim but is not considered in [4].
 External Supports. An external support can be any factor that reflects the importance of the objects from global views . Typically, for each type of object  X   X  T , we can facilitate some support (e.g., well accepted knowledge and common sense) to rank the objects o i  X  O in a reasonable way, which is defined as ext (  X , o i ) in this work. For instance, in the bibliographic network, we can use the citation numbers as the external support for every author a i in the author type A , which is denoted as ext ( A ,a i ) .Given the external support, we revise PathSim to PathSimExt as follows.
 jects in the object type T . The denominators in Equation 2, ext ( T,x ) and ext ( T,y ) , can be viewed as the normalization factor. In this paper, we used a DBLP citation network dataset downloaded from arnetminer.org that contains 7.7K venues, 1M authors, 1.6M papers, 34K terms, and 2.3M citations.
We show the result of different semantic paths in Table 3, including author-to-author relationships ( AVA and APA ) and venue-to-venue relationships ( VAVTV and VAV ). The result of AVA shows that  X  X hilip S. Yu X  and  X  X hristos Faloutsos X  are the two most similar authors to  X  X iawei Han X . The result is meaningful as both  X  X hilip S. Yu X  and  X  X hris-tos Faloutsos X  publish lot of papers in the common venues of  X  X iawei Han X  and their cita-tion records (i.e., external support) are strong. In another set of experiments, we evaluate the path VAVTV and VAV for a journal  X  X CM Transaction on Graphics X . The results using the semantic path VAVTV are more relevant to the area of computer graphics and computer vision research since the return ed venues should have similar topics according to VTV (i.e., the terms). In addition,  X  X CCV X  and  X  X VPR X  are ranked in the top-5 result since these venues have similar reputation (i.e., by external support) to  X  X CM Transac-tion on Graphics X . For clarity, the results using the semantic path VAV are more diverse since the path only take author-venue relationship into consideration. In this work, we revise the definition of PathSim that enriches the result of PathSim by introducing the external support into the similarity measure. Our result demonstrates that the external support is effective in bibliography data. In the future, we attempt to further improve the query performance in te rms of both efficiency and effectiveness.
