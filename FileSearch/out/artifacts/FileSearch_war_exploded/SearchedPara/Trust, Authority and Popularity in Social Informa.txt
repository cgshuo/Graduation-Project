 W e present a social information retrieval (SIR) model comprising the social network of actors (e.g., authors, publishers, consumers) , the graph representing relations in data (e.g., publications ), and the links between the social and data network that reflect activities in the network such as search, authoring, annotation, etc . Bu ild ing on this hybrid network, we describe relevance in terms of the trust propagated through the network and rendered onto a given item. In particular, r elevance is a function of the approval votes and the reputation of the associated sub -graph nodes . We explore a model that dif ferentiat es between approval votes from a ctors who are perceived authorities by the user and the approval by a wider community , representing the popular opinion .
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ] Algorithms, Theory Existing i nformation retrieval (IR) services lack formal mecha -nism s to measure the truthfulness of the information sources they retrieve . I n contrast with the physic al world , where there are established authorities and developed practices to build and maintain trust, Web services infer the quality of web pages from  X  X uthoritative ness  X  implied by the hypertext structure [1] . This approach disregard s the cognitive and social processes that led to the information source s and their link structure in the first place [5] . However, with the growing popularity of online communities and review systems , such as Amazon  X  X  book recommendations , explicit trust relations between content providers and consumers are increasingly availabl e . These new resources are used in s ocial n etwork a nalysis (SNA) to measure , for example, the authority of a node in the social network [11] . Recently , the fields of IR and SNA h ave been bridged by s ocial i nformation r etrieval (SIR) models [2] , which extend conventional IR models to incorporate the social context , e.g., the authorship and usage of information sources . For example, [7] [8] [4] include social network models into search and recommendation. We present work that expands SIR models to refine reputation models and trust propagation mechanism s in order to differentiate between the authoritative and popular approval of an item. This is motivated by the observed difference between the roles of i nsti -tutions (e.g., lib raries, publishers) in providing authoritative input or popularizing information resources versus the approval from masses of users with less differentiated and measurable qualities. Inspired by the work s of [4] [9] , we investigate SIR models in the context of online collections of objects e.g., publ ications , that inherit properties from the social context s , including popularity and perceived authoritativeness. W e model the relevance of an item on the basis of the type and level of approval received from the social context. More precisely, our SIR model comprises a hybrid network of actors  X  = {  X  1 ,  X  2 , ... ,  X   X  } , i.e., participants in the social network , and objects  X  = {  X  1 ,  X  2 , ... ,  X  lection , and mechanisms to propagate approval and trust between the nodes in t he network along link s that reflect associations and activities . Approval votes, expressing the trust placed in a given item, may be cast in relation to any action or node in the network. The aggregate of the trust expressed over time by nodes in the associated sub -graph of ac tors and data defines the reputation of a node . R elevance is then a function of the approval votes and the reputation of the voters. Hybrid network. We build on a hybrid network of actors (content producers and consumers) and data objects (content). Data nodes are associated with a topic domain (or context). Actor nodes may refer to individuals , organizations , a nd services, such as search engines (SE) . A ctors have different facets , ref lecting associated topic domains and roles , i.e. , personas in the case of individuals, or functions in the case of organizations and services. Organi -zation nodes are connected to the nodes of their members, forming sub -graphs in the network. Through the connecting links, properties of the members propa gate to the organization node, while properties of the organization are inherited by the members. For example, the reputation of an organization may be accumula -ted from the reputation of its associated staff, which in turn may be a function of the reputat ion of the organization as a whole. Properties. Each data node and each facet of an actor is associated with a set of properties . For the purpose of this discussion, we focus on two propert ies: visibility and reputation. Visibility is re -flected in the con nectivity with other data and actor nodes through incoming and outgoing links. We also include visibility through SE services, represented by the connectivity with the SE actor node. Reputation is a quality of a node that is derived b ased on the trust relationships that other nodes in the associated sub -graph form towards the node . For example, actors may express the level of trust they place in a given data item by casting a vote that is then visible in their associated sub -graph . Trust score s may then be aggregated to define the reputation of the data item or may be propagated in the network to define the reputation of the actor , who authored the data item . Linkage . Fundamental to the assessment of data objects is the linkage between actor s and d ata nodes. Links v a ry in types and are created and deleted dynamically , thus also have vary ing persistence . For example, association s between individuals and an organization are expected to be more stable than links that corres -pond to a search query or a marketing campaign . A particular instance of the SIR model is governed by a specific set of mechanisms that define the network activities. Here we descri be a search scenario. In response to a query, an SE actor node connect s with all the data items whose representation it include s in the result list . At the same time the items on the list are embedded in the SIR network within which they receive vote s from actors of varying reputation (note that some of this informa -tion may be already inc orporated into the SE recommendation) . The searcher considers the recommendations from the SE taking into account his trust in the observed votes and the perceived reputation of the SE and other nodes linked to the recommended items to make the final decis ion, e.g., to access or purchase an item. The se trust weighted votes represent a  X  X ocial approval score X  that is integrated with the search engine results [3] [10] . Thus, fundamental to the SIR model is the trust relationship . We consider trust to be a perceived likelihood that a particular entity, actor, or data object, will deliver on its promise and meet user expectation [6] . Trust relationships are di rectional links and may be expressed as observable votes , reflecting for example the level of approval or disapproval an actor a i associates with an object o v : A  X  O  X  [  X  1 , 1 ] . Note that here the vote inherits the context attribute of the object o j . T he as sociated t rust t places in the vote v ij depends on the reputation R of a of a k and is measured as a probability that a k will agree with the vote: t k v ij = P ( v ij = v kj | R k , c ( a i ) ) . In general , r eputation is a sociological aggregate of individuals X  opinions about one another [11] . It may be considered a global or a personalized quant ity [9] . In social networks, it is often quantified by centrality measures [6] .
 The reputation of an actor can be modeled as a function of the trust placed in its votes by others: R ( a i ) = t n ( v V is the set of votes cast by a i , A n is the set of actors who formulated a trust opinion on a vote by a i , and  X  is a n aggregation operator (e.g., sum) . For a given context  X  , the V i set is limited to votes to objects in  X  . In the eye of an observer a of an actor is limited to the observed part of the network and votes . Actors may also inherit reputation from links with associa -ted organizations and other actors within the organizations X  sub -graphs . In this case the set of vote s V i is expanded to the votes cast by actors in the organization X  X  sub -graph. Actors in the network differ in their reputation and ability to propagate approval votes directly to the items in the network or indirectly through other acto rs, e.g., SE nodes. Authoritative votes are cast by actors with a high level of reputation in a given context from the perspective of the obs erver. Popular ity , on the other hand, is associated with visibility and the volume of votes an item receives . Popul arity is independent of the reputation of the source of a vote, or the trust associated with the votes . In reality, data items and actors are associated with various levels of observed popularity and authorit ativeness. Our t rust propagation model is devised to support flexible query -based retrieval . In addition to the user specific assessment of the social approval, it also facilitate s a generic assessment of publica -tion quality based on globally exposed approval and reputation of the assessors. Thus, a user independent quality of publication can be defined, e.g., a s a function of trust -weighted scores from the authoritative bodies , reviewers , and the citation network . The aggregate of the trust scores for a given data object may be given as:  X   X   X   X  = t k ( v ij ) V observed by a k . Both the user dependent and independent rele -vance scores , derived from network properties , can be combin ed with content based scores in various ways. A simple method is to apply a linear weighting function , employ ing machine learning techniques to optimize the weights. In this paper we describe d a framework for SIR that models relevance as a comb ination of approval votes from a hybrid network of actors and data. The framework enables us to differ -entiate between the authoritative and popular approval as well as between the u ser centred and community based assessment of the quality and reputation. We intend to use this framework to investi -gate a wide range of features and algorithms for the effective retrieval of online digital media. [1] Brin, S. and Page, L. 1998.
