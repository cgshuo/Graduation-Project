 1. Introduction
In fl ammatory cells, also known as leukocytes or white blood cells (WBCs), are cells of the immune system which defend the body against both infectious disease and foreign materials ( Kumar et al., 2010 ). These cells are available in blood and in tissues at the time of injury. These cells are analyzed manually by expert pathologists for disease identi fi cation and drug develop-ment which is a time consuming and biased method. Therefore, automation of leukocytes analysis can assist the pathologists in the quanti fi cation of leukocytes. Some useful algorithms have been developed for separation of leukocytes in blood smears images ( Pan et al., 2011 ; Ko et al., 2011 ; Theera-Umpon and Dhompongsa, 2007 ; Angulo and Flandrin, 2003 ; Tycko et al., 1976 ), but rare efforts have been made to automate leukocytes segmentation in tissue section images. Leukocytes can be found in different organs but skin tissue has the most complex structure. Further, skin is the fi rst line of defence for any infection or injury. Most of the animal models for in fl ammation consider skin as a major organ. There-fore, in this paper skin tissue images are considered for leukocytes segmentation.

Leukocyte can be identi fi ed with the structural and textual information of its nucleus and cytoplasm. Leukocytes identi tion system goes through the process of leukocytes segmentation, their feature extraction and classi fi cation. But, automatic segmen-tation of leukocytes from the complex morphological background of tissue section images also extracts the vast number of artifacts/ noise. These artifacts are created due to improper handling prior to fi xation, processing of tissue, its sectioning, and staining. Some of the artifacts appear like tiny points or Gaussian noise within skin tissue. The artifacts are identi fi ed using their morphological characteristics mainly the nuclear characteristics. In general, these structures do not contain any nucleus but, a halo dark zone misrepresent to a nucleus. Rare studies have been reported regarding the reduction of artifacts from the extracted objects of tissue section images. The research scientists used different methods for reduction of the tiny points prior to segmentation process. Most general method is median fi ltering ( Gonzalez and Woods, 2008 ) in which pixel intensity is used to reduce the noise.
Mohapatra et al. (2011) performed median fi ltering followed by unsharp masking to all the images before cell segmentation.
Mathematical morphology ( Gonzalez and Woods, 2008 ) is another method which was employed by researchers to remove small noisy areas from the images. Morphological operators work on the basis of shape characteristics of the objects. Erosion, dilation, opening and closing operations are the basic operations of mathematical morphology. Phukpattaranont and Boonyaphiphat (2006) used morphological erosion and opening operations to eliminate spike noise and to simplify shape of cells. But these methods may change the shape and size of actual leukocytes.
Further, the artifacts whose shape and size may be similar to leukocytes cannot be removed using these morphological operations.

Recently, we have introduced a novel unsupervised method ( Saraswat et al., 2013 ) based on differential evolution (DE) ( Storn and Price, 1997 ) to segment the leukocytes from the images of mice skin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and acquired at 40 magni fi cations. The method per-forms an unsupervised multilevel clustering in two phases. First phase uses pixel intensity to extract the leukocyte type objects from the complex background of skin tissue image. A vast number of artifacts are also segmented along with the leukocytes in this phase due to similarity of their intensity with leukocytes. These artifacts can only be differentiated from leukocytes on the basis of their morphological structure. Therefore, second phase is intro-duced which performs unsupervised multilevel clustering using the feature vector of each extracted object to reduce the artifacts.
But, this process can be improved by introducing the supervised segmentation. Supervised artifacts reduction method may provide better results as they are based on learning and classi fi objects.

Thus, keeping in view the need of drug research scientists and availability of limited number of algorithms for reducing the artifacts in leukocytes segmentation from tissue section images, this study was planned to design a supervised and ef fi cient system for reduction of artifacts/noise in leukocytes segmentation. The pro-posed system modi fi es the second phase of our earlier unsupervised method ( Saraswat et al., 2013 ) through threshold based supervised binary classi fi er to classify the extracted objects into noise and leukocytes. The classi fi er compares the feature vector of an object with the optimal threshold values for its classi fi cation. To optimal threshold values for each feature, non-dominated sorting the most ef fi cient multi-objective evolutionary algorithms derived from its predecessor NSGA ( Srinivas and Deb, 1994 ). NSGA-II is used extensively in many applications due to its fast non-dominated sorting procedure, an elitist strategy, and parameter less approach.
Coello Coello (2006) presented state-of-the-art of NSGA-II and other multi-objective algorithms along with its applicability to a larger set of applications. Salazar et al. (2006) have applied and compared the ef fi ciency of NSGA-II with existing methods for reliability optimiza-tion problems. NSGA-II has also been successfully applied to the applications of pattern recognition ( Tekguc et al., 2009 ).
Therefore, in this paper NSGA-II ( Deb et al., 2002 ) has been used to calculate the optimum thresholds. Since, NSGA-II is a multi-objective technique, two objective functions are generated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve ( Fawcett, 2003 ; Qin, 2005 ). ROC curves are utilized to evaluate the classi fi in case of skewed class distribution and uneven classi fi The performance of the proposed method is compared with
Saraswat et al. (2013) and other supervised classi fi cation methods (support vector machine (SVM) Vapnik, 1998 , k-nearest neighbor (kNN) Duda and Hart, 1973 ,arti fi cial neural network (ANN) Hagan et al., 1996 , linear discriminant analysis (LDA) McLachlan, 2004 ).
Rest of the paper is organized as follows. The problem for-mulations and its description are described in Section 2 . Section 3 presents the proposed segmentation method. The considered performance measures for this study are explained in Section 4 .
In Section 5 , experiments are performed and the results are compared. Finally, paper is concluded in Section 6 . 2. Problem description
The supervised segmentation is a process of labeling the objects to their respective class based on their properties like color, area, shape, etc. This paper deals with the problem of reducing the artifacts/noise in an automated leukocytes segmentation process using a threshold based supervised binary classi fi er. The proposed method calculates the optimal thresholds, to be used by binary II and ROC curve.

The problem of fi nding the optimal thresholds can be treated as an optimization problem de fi ned by an appropriate objective function. Let there be N number of objects which are to be classi fi ed into their respective class. Each object is represented by a features vector f , having M number of features  X  x 1 The classi fi er separates the noisy elements from required leuko-cytes using the feature vector f . For each feature value, two optimum thresholds are calculated which represent the boundary wall between the two classes. The binary classi fi er compares a feature value with the optimum threshold values to take the decision. Therefore, total 2 M number of optimum thresholds is to be calculated for comparison in classi fi er. Various combinations of the threshold values can generate a set of optimal solutions, known as pareto-optimal solutions instead of a single optimal solution. For obtaining pareto-optimal solutions, a number of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been proposed ( Coello Coello, 2006 ). In this paper, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) has been used for obtaining the pareto-optimal solutions where 2 M will be the number of decision variables in a chromosome. The objective function values for each of the chromosome are found using ROC curve which is described in the following section. 2.1. Objective function
To fi nd the objective functions for NSGA-II, the concept of ROC curve is implemented. An ROC curve is a plot of sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR) versus false positive rate (FPR). The value of TPR and FPR can be calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) respectively ( Qin, 2005 ).
 TPR  X  TP TP  X  FN  X  1  X  FPR  X  FP FP  X  TN  X  2  X  where TP, FN, FP, and TN are true positive, false negative, false positive, and true negative value of a classi fi er respectively. TP represents the number of correctly classi fi ed leukocytes, FN is the number of objects which are classi fi ed as noise but actually are leukocytes, FP represents the number of objects classi leukocytes but actually are noise and TN is the number of correctly classi fi ed noisy elements. FPR can be represented in terms of speci fi city as shown in Eqs. (3) and (4) ( Qin, 2005 ). FPR  X  1 specificity  X  3  X  specificity  X  TN FP  X  TN  X  4  X 
A numeric value on each of the parameters, TPR and FPR, represents the degree to which a region belongs to noise or cell. An ROC curve gives a comparative view of classi fi er for all possible decision thresholds. Optimum classi fi er shows higher value of TPR and lower value FPR. On this basis, two objective functions, TPR and FPR, are proposed for selecting the thresholds for these features. One will calculate the TPR which is to be maximized and other will calculate the FPR which is to be minimized. To calculate the TPR and FPR for the selected decision variables, training data set (gold standard) is used which is the set of labeled objects along with their feature values. The process of calculating objective function values are depicted in Algorithm 1 . Algorithm 1. Objective function for NSGA-II.

The following section presents a brief overview of the NSGA-II used in this paper. 2.2. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II)
Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) ( Deb et al., 2002 ) searches the non-dominant set o f solutions using a population of potential solutions, known as chromosomes. Chromosomes are represented by a D-dimensional vector  X  t i 1 ; t i 2 i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; NP and NP is the population size (number of chromo-somes). Each decision variable t ij for j  X  1 ; 2 ; 3 ; ... ; some represents j th threshold value. The population is initialized randomly and their objective funct ion values are calculated using
Algorithm 1 . Before applying the selection, crossover and mutation operator to generate the new offspring, the population is sorted using a fast non-dominated sorting technique and crowding distance.
The fast non-dominated sorting approach assigns the rank to each individual with O  X  FNP 2  X  computational complexity, where F is thenumberofobjectives.Thecrowdingdistanceisameasureof
Crowding distance for an individual is calculated using the average of the distances from its immediate neighbors along the same front in every dimension. Selection of parents from the population is done using binary tournament selecti on method based on the rank and crowding distance. From these parents offsprings are generated using crossover and mutation operators. This process is repeated until the termination condition is satis fi ed which is the number of generations. In this paper, binary tournament selection ( Miller and
Goldberg, 1996 ), simulated binary crossover (SBX) ( Agrawal et al., 1994 ), and polynomial mutation operators ( Deb, 2001 )areusedfor
NSGA-II implementation which are explained brie fl yinthefollowing sections. 2.2.1. Selection
After sorting the chromosomes by non-dominated sorting tech-nique and crowding distance, the selection is carried out using binary tournament selection with crowding comparison operator ( Deb et al., 2002 ). If the two chromosomes have different non-domination rank then lower rank chromosome is selected otherwise the chromosome with larger crowding distance is preferred. 2.2.2. Simulated binary crossover (SBX)
Let P 1 j and P 2 j are the j th genes of two selected parents P respectively. SBX generates two children solutions C 1 and C these parents as follows.

Calculate  X  j  X  Z 0  X  for each decision variable as given below.  X  where  X  c is distribution index for crossover and u j A  X  0 a random number.

The j th elements C 1 j and C 2 j of both children are generated as follows.

C j  X  0 : 5 n  X  X  X  1  X 
C j  X  0 : 5 n  X  X  X  1
If the generated values of children goes out of decision space then they are set to their appropriate extrema. 2.2.3. Polynomial mutation
Let  X  m is the mutation distribution index and P is the randomly selected parent. Mutation is performed on each element of the selected parent as given below.

Select a random number r j and calculate  X  j as follows.  X  Generate the corresponding child element, C, as follows.
C  X  P j  X   X  j :  X  9  X 
If the generated values of child goes out of decision space then they are set to their appropriate extrema.

The pseudo-code for NSGA-II is given in Algorithm 2 . The algorithm returns a set of best individuals known as pareto-front.

Replace the un fi t individuals with the fi t individuals to maintain a constant population size. 8. Repeat the steps 2  X  7 until termination condition is satis fi ed.
 3. The proposed methodology
The leukocytes segmentation method consists of two phases; (i) fi rst phase is similar to Saraswat et al. (2013) which extracts the different objects (leukocytes and artifacts/noise) using intensity information of the pixels and (ii) second phase proposed a binary classi fi er based on NSGA-II and ROC curve. A detailed description of each phase is presented in the following sections. 3.1. Intensity based segmentation ( Saraswat et al., 2013 )
Pixel intensity is the primary source of information of an image which is utilized to cluster the different objects into their respec-tive class. Therefore, in this phase, DE based multi-level clustering is performed using pixel intensity for segmenting the objects of interest (leukocytes and artifacts/noise) from photomicrographs of in fl amed mice skin. Let a given RGB image consists of L intensity levels for each RGB plane. DE calculates the n 1 thresholds  X  t ; t 2 ; ... ; t n 1 for each RGB plane by maximizing the following objective function.  X  max
Here s 2  X  t  X  is the inter-class variance de fi ned as  X   X  n where  X  j ,  X  , and w j are the mean of class D j , mean intensity of a plane, and probability of occurrence of class D j respectively. After these n classes, leukocyte type objects are extracted. For detailed description of this method, Saraswat et al. (2013) may be referred.
Since, artifacts/noise have almost similar intensity as that of leukocytes, they are also extracted along with leukocytes which can only be separated out using their structural features. There-fore, the extracted features are given input to subsequent phase of proposed supervised NSGA-II based segmentation which is described in the following section. 3.2. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II based segmentation In the proposed second phase, each extracted object from
Phase-I are represented as a feature vector X  X  X  x 1 ; x 2 where M is the number of features. This feature vector is given input to a threshold based binary classi fi er which classi object into either noise or leukocyte. The classi fi er compares each feature value, x i ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; M , with corresponding two optimum thresholds,  X  T 2 i 1 ; T 2 i  X  ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; object. These optimum thresholds bound the feature values of the leukocytes, outside which all are noise. Here T 2 i 1 respectively are upper and lower bound of the i th feature value of leukocyte. These optimum thresholds are calculated using NSGA-
II, as described in Section 2.2 , which generates non-dominated set
Two objective functions are used for the NSGA-II namely true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) calculated using
ROC curve as mentioned in Section 2.1 . From these non-dominated solutions, one value is selected as an optimal set corresponding to the lowest FPR (less than 0.2) and highest TPR (greater than 0.75).
The decision variables (thresholds) of the selected non-dominated solution are the optimal thresholds to be used by the classi noise reduction. To separate the noise and leukocytes, the classi compares each value of feature vector x i ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; optimal threshold values  X  T 2 i 1 ; T 2 i  X  ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; ROI j  X  The process of proposed leukocytes segmentation method is described in Algorithm 3 . The algorithm made no priori assumptions about the size, shape, texture or spatial distribution of the leukocytes. Algorithm 3.

NSGA-II algorithm performs several layers of chromosomes classi fi cation before their selection using the non-domination based ranking i.e. all non-dominated chromosomes are classi into one category. This provides an equal reproductive potential for these chromosomes. Further, it uses crowding distance in its selection operator to keep the population diverse and helps the algorithm to explore the fi tness landscape. Moreover, elitism property and non-domination sorting helps to generate the better generation and achieve better convergence ( Coello et al., 2002 ). 4. Algorithm validation
Image segmentation extracts the meaningful regions from an image. It is an important task to evaluate the segmentation process for making it acceptable in preclinical practice. In this paper, two methodologies are used to calculate the performance of proposed segmentation method, dice coef fi cient (DC) and classi-fi cation accuracy. Dice coef fi cient ( Zou et al., 2004 ) gives the spatial overlapping measure between two binary images (manu-ally segmented image (gold standard) and automated segmented image). It has a value between 0 (no overlapping) and 1 (exactly similar) and is calculated as D  X  A ; B  X  X  2 j A \ B j j A j X j B j  X  13  X  where A and B respectively represent the ground truth set of pixels and automated segmented region of pixels. In this paper, ground truth set of pixels are marked manually in each image. For any experiment, the higher value of DC represents the better segmen-tation accuracy.

Since the proposed method uses a binary classi fi er to distinguish the noise from leukocytes, its performance can also be analyzed by validating it with the set of objects including leukocytes and artifacts/noise. Generally, the performance of the classi de fi ned by error matrix or confusion matrix. If there are n number of classes then the value C ij of the confusion matrix of size n n represents the number of patterns of class i predicted in class j .The diagonal values represent the correctly classi fi ed patterns. Generally the classi fi er accuracy can be represented as
Accuracy  X 
But, this classi fi cation accuracy shows inaccurate results for the classes having imbalance patterns, viz. the considered problem consists of high volume of noise/artifacts as compared to leukocytes. pair of values  X  S ; C  X  where S is the minimum of sensitivities in both classes and C is the overall accuracy ( Fernandez Caballero et al., patterns correctly predicted to be in class i with respect to the total number of patterns in class i as depicted in Eq. (15) ( Fernandez Caballero et al., 2010 ).

Therefore, the sensitivity  X  S  X  of the classi fi er will be the minimum value of the sensitivities as shown in Eq. (16) ( Fernandez Caballero et al., 2010 ).

C  X  1 n 5. Experimental results
The objects including leukocytes and artifacts/noise are extracted using the Phase-I of the segmentation method described in Saraswat et al. (2013) . Total 5035 objects are cropped from 30 images of size 1300 1030 pixels of in fl amed mice skin sections stained with routinely used H&amp;E staining method and acquired at 40 magni fi cation. Out of these 836 are the leukocytes and rest 4199 are the artifacts/noise. These objects are grouped into training set and testing set each having 30% and 70% of objects from individual class respectively. The images were obtained from the Histopathology Section of Defence Research &amp; Development Establishment, Gwalior,
India. All the photomicrographs were acquired using DC500 camera (Leica, Germany) attached with DMLB microscope (Leica, Germany) at 40 magni fi cation. All the skin sections were obtained from archived animal studies that have a prior approval from Institutional Animal Ethical Committee of Defence Research &amp; Development
Establishment, Gwalior, India. All the cropped objects were subjected to analysis by two expert pathologists where different cells were marked either leukocytes or artifacts/noise. The representative sets of detected leukocytes and noisy elements as per the analysis of expert pathologists are depicted in Fig. 1 .

Each of the cropped objects is represented as a set of four features of cytoplasm to nucleus area which are brie fl ydiscussedbelow. 5.1. Area
The area of the object is represented by the total number of none zero pixels within the object boundary. This property is useful to remove extracted tiny and very large noisy elements. 5.2. Eccentricity
The ratio of the major and minor axis length of an object is known as eccentricity as given in Eq. (18) . As the shape of a leukocyte is almost circular, therefore, eccentricity value will be useful to remove the non-circular shaped artifacts.
 Eccentricity  X  Length of Major Axis Length of Minor Axis  X  18  X  5.3. Solidity of nucleus
Solidity is the ratio of actual nucleus to its convex hull area and is shown in Eq. (19) . Convex hull area of a nucleus will be very close to its actual area.
 Solidity  X  Area of Cell Area of Convex Hull  X  19  X  5.4. Ratio of cytoplasm to nucleus area
It represents the ratio of number of pixels in the cytoplasm part and nucleus part of the leukocyte. Since the artifacts have no nucleus and cytoplasm but halo dark zone appears like nucleus. This property will remove the rest of the artifacts.

Mean, standard deviation and median of each feature value for the classes of leukocytes and artifacts/noise are shown in Table 1 .
The mean values of eccentricity and solidity for leukocyte class are approximately one which show that leukocytes generally have near circular shape while artifacts/noise are of different shape and size. The value of standard deviations also shows that artifacts/ noise class is much scattered as compared to leukocyte class.
These multivariate artifacts make the classi fi cation process more complex.

The classi fi er used in this study is threshold based and hence, multi-objective optimization technique, NSGA-II, is being used for selecting the optimum values of the thresholds. NSGA-II generates 20 non-dominated solutions for the binary classi fi er using gold standard of training dataset. The following parameter speci in the NSGA-II are used: Population Size :20, Mutation Probability :1/ n {where n is the number of decision variables}, Stopping Condition : 1000 generations, Crossover Probability :0.9.

These solutions for the classi fi er are plotted in Fig. 2 . For the classi fi er, (0.19, 0.84) value is selected from these 20 non-dominated solutions and their corresponding values of decision variables serve as optimal threshold values for the classi are [568.9364, 36.6456, 4.0064, 1.6591, 8.8276, 0.4128, 14.9775, 0.6566].
 A pictorial comparison among the results of Phase-I and Phase-
II of the method described in Saraswat et al. (2013) and proposed method for leukocyte segmentation have been presented in Fig. 3 .
There are six sub-images in Fig. 3 . One of the original skin tissue section images used for leukocyte segmentation is depicted in
Fig. 3 a. The results of Phases I and II of DE based segmentation method ( Saraswat et al., 2013 ) are shown in Fig. 3 b and 3 c respectively. The resultant image of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 3 d. To visualize the effectiveness of the proposed method, some noisy objects  X  N 1 N 8  X  are marked by circles in Fig. 3 a  X  c which are extracted by both phases of DE based segmen-tation ( Saraswat et al., 2013 ). These noisy elements are removed by the proposed method. The expanded version of these artifacts (N1 N8) is shown in Fig. 3 e. Similarly, one leukocyte ( L ), shown by arrow in Fig. 3 a, b and d and its expanded version in Fig. 3 f, is removed by Phase-II method while selected by our proposed method. Therefore, the pictorial results show that proposed method outperforms the DE based segmentation method ( Saraswat et al., 2013 ).
As discussed in Section 4 , the performance of proposed segmentation method is evaluated using dice coef fi cient (DC) and classi fi cation accuracy. To calculate the DC, ground truth set of pixels are collected by manually marking the leukocytes in the images. One of the manually marked image is shown in Fig. 4 , where dark black regions represent the leukocytes as a ground truth set of pixels. Results of dice coef fi cient of both the phases of Saraswat et al. (2013) and proposed method for all the 30 considered images are shown in Table 2 .In Table 2 , DC1, DC2, and DC3 represent dice coef fi cient for Phase-I, Phase-II, and proposed method respectively. It is clear from Table 2 that the DC of proposed method is much higher than the Phases I and II as the number of noisy elements have been minimized signi fi cantly while true positive have been increased.

Further, the proposed method is compared with the well known supervised classi fi cation methods namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), arti fi cial neural net-work (ANN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The compar-ison of dice coef fi cients for all the considered methods are shown in Table 3 and its graphical representation in Fig. 5 . By analyzing the results, it is evident that for the considered image database, the proposed approach gives lesser number of noisy elements with better accuracy as compare to the other methods. To test the signi fi cant difference between the proposed strategy and consid-ered algorithms, statistical comparison is carried out for dice coef fi cient using student's t -test ( Croarkin and Tobias, 2012 ). In this experiment, student's t -test is applied for a con level of 0.95 for the null hypothesis that there is no difference in images signi fi cant differences are obtained between proposed strategy and considered existing methods, i.e. the null hypothesis is rejected for all cases. Therefore, the proposed method outper-forms the other existing methods in terms of dice coef fi
The performance of classi fi ers is also quanti fi ed using the accuracy given in Eq. (17) . The performance of proposed threshold based classi fi er and four other classi fi ers (SVM, kNN, ANN, and
LDA) in terms of sensitivity of each class and overall accuracy are shown in Table 4 and corresponding graphical representation in class 2 for the proposed method are around 80% which is much higher than other traditional classi fi ers for which sensitivities are around 60%. The overall accuracy of the proposed method is 81% which is the best among all the classi fi ers considered here. The reason behind the poor performance of conventional classi is the presence of irregular structured artifacts/noise causing large amount of multivariate data generation. Since, there is no general morphological characteristics of artifacts, the standard deviation of all the features is much higher as exhibited by Table 1 , conse-quently leading to degraded performance of the classi fi ers used to discriminate between leukocytes and artifacts/noise. Therefore, for such multivariate data, multi-objective optimization techni-ques proved to be very successful as validated by the results shown in Tables 2  X  4 . Hence, the proposed method outperforms the existing leukocytes segmentation methods. 6. Conclusion
In this work, we have developed a supervised method for segmenting the leukocytes from the images of in fl amed mice skin sections stained with H&amp;E staining and acquired at 40 magni fi cation. The proposed method uses a binary classi on the threshold values of the features. The optimum thresholds are calculated by multi-objective optimization technique, NSGA-II, and ROC curve. The results show the superiority of the proposed system over the existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fi rst in-line report validated for leukocytes segmenta-tion and noise reduction in in fl amed skin sections using multi-objective optimization technique.

In summary, the proposed system effectively provides the solu-tion for leukocytes segmentation in in fl amed skin section images acquired at 40 magni fi cation. Thus, this work presents an ef system that can further be utilized for screening the ef fi in fl ammatory compounds on mouse skin model. This work may be further extended for the classi fi cation of various structures in other organs.
