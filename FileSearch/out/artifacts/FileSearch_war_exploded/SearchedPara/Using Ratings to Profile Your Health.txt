 The widespread adoption of mobile technology allows per-sonalised applications to be deployed in an increasing host of contexts; user modelling, profiling, and personalised recom-mendations are becoming an integral component of mobile information systems. Furthermore, mobile technology en-ables the recording and collection of facets of daily life, which has given rise to the notion of the quantified self ; researchers operating at the intersection of computer and social science are now seeking to understand how these mobiles X  data can aide the design of health interventions and inform future psychological and social science research. In this work, we describe the design of a personalised mobile application that seeks user feedback and builds a user profile about people X  X  gastrointestinal health using ratings and tags. We describe the application X  X  design and the personalised health insights it provides (and, particularly, why recommendations were not designed as a means for self-diagnosis).

Mobile phones have become items that we keep within arms length throughout over 75% of the day [1]. Moreover, by ubiquitously connecting us to the web at all times, they are allowing for personalised information systems to be de-signed and deployed in contexts where they were previously unavailable, such as health, where recommendations can be used to intervene on and change people X  X  behaviour. There is a rising interest in using mobile phones to deliver per-sonalised health-related interventions by, for example, mon-itoring people X  X  mood throughout the day [2]. Historically, the Quantity , Solidity ,andthe Satisfaction of passing their current stool (Figure 1(a)). (2) Categorical Choice .The second step asks users to tag their review with a category from the 7-level Bristol Stool Chart (Figure 1(b)), which was defined in [6] as a means to monitor stools X  intestinal transit time and assess the effectiveness of treatments for bowel diseases. (3) Current Location : the user then has the option to add their current location from a pre-defined set of options (e.g.,  X  X estaurant X ). (4) Textual Feedback . Finally, users have the option of adding a short comment to their review.

Submitting a review results in instant feedback (Figure 2(a)), which comes in two forms. (1) Personalised Feed-back . The user is given a fact that has been computed from the set of ratings given to date. A range of candidate facts are possible, relating to both time (e.g., the user X  X  7-day frequency average, the number of reviews in the last 24 hours, the time of the last review), and category (e.g., the last time they input a review with the same category): a personalised fact is chosen randomly from the available can-didates. (2) Generic Fact . The bottom half of Figure 2(a) is a generic fact under a  X  X id you know? X  heading. These facts have been collected manually from Wikipedia, and in-clude snippets about defecation, the digestive system, minor bowel problems, and healthy eating. The server also returns the Wikipedia link to the source of each fact, which is used to set the target of a  X  X ead More X  button that accompa-nies the snippet. The set of reviews that users input are also used to create a user profile, which is also split into two halves. The first section reports the user X  X  7-day statistics (number of reviews, average reviews per day). The second section contains the aggregate data. This includes both the total number of reviews as well as distributions of aspects of the reviews: for example, Figure 2(b) shows the aggregate distribution of categories selected by the user.
This paper has introduced the design of the The (Poo) Re-view Android application: a tool to rate and tag bowel move-ments in order to generate and deliver personalised health information. Future iterations of the application could ex-tend this in order to visualise correlations between activities, moods, and health (e.g., comparisons with what you eat or other aspects of users X  lifestyle).

The current version of the application allows users to re-view their bowel movements without linking their data to any means for automated diagnosis or comparing them to any notion of  X  X ormal X  behaviour. Furthermore, person-alised facts about reviews are presented as-is, without any qualitative information appended. This was a specific de-sign decision: not only do we assume that the definition of normal may be culturally-dependent, but Internet-based in-terventions for those with bowel problems actively encour-agepeopleto not over-monitor their bowel movements as this may lead to stress (from questioning whether they are  X  X ormal X ) which may exacerbate any pre-existing problem. Conversely, it would be rather straightforward to encode a means to detect and alarm the user if reviews clearly reflect, for example, early symptoms of bowel cancer [7]: the rela-tion between recommendations and the delivery of health interventions is thus an important issue that future recom-mender systems in the health domain must tackle.

This application is an initial step into uncovering the po-
