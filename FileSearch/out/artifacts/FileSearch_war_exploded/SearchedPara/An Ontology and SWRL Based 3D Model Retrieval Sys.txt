The method of text-based retrieval looks on the model as an object in the database. It describes the models with keywords and text. Although the text-based approach may be convenient for user, it relies on artificial annotation and has many shortcom-match strictly in query keyword, so its performance is not always satisfying. 
Therefore, the content-based retrieval way becomes the research focus in 3D model problem of shape-based retrieval is extracting model X  X  shape feature with good prop-erties, such as rotation invariant. Researches of this kind concentrate on improving the Semantic Gap [3], the shape-based method doesn X  X  perform quite well. 
The root of the problem is keyword and feature have not any meaning for com-the user X  X  intention, then we consider introducing ontology technology to the field of 3D model retrieval. On the one hand, it can instruct retrieval inte lligently according to the semantic relation among the models; on the other hand ontology can also be used to link the model X  X  low-level features and its high-level semantic information. The paper explores an ontology and SWRL-based 3D model retrieval system target models by ontology. The experiments on Princeton Shape Benchmark [4] show retrieval. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the way to con-gives the experimental result; finally, Section 5 concludes the paper. 2.1 Ontology Structure The Knowledge Base of Onto3D contains a general ontology. Since our purpose is to English, so we must prune it and extract only those branches containing these objects. In our experiment, the basis of pruning is the manual classifications of 1,814 models in the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB) [4]. By classification names, we can search their synonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy and meronymy in WordNet , and then supply their correlated concept as we ll as the attribute relations to our ontology. After prun-ing, final 3D model ontology partial structure is shown in Fig. 1. 
In Fig. 1, ontology is represented by a directed acyclic graph and every node in the graph represents a concept. Concepts are interconnected by means of interrelation-ships. If there is an interrelationship R between concepts C i and C j , then there is also component membership ( Part-of ). 
Is-a interrelationship is used to represent specialization (concept inclusion). A con-C sented by a real line with an arrowhead. 
The Instance-Of relationship denotes concept instantiation. If a concept C j is an ex-stance of a concept human; Ins_hand and Ins_face are instances of the concepts hand Ins_hand ) is the hypothesized instance, it only used to annotate the model X  X  portion. 
A concept is represented by C j is Part-Of a concept represented by C i if C i has a C j human. The Part-of relationship is obtained by meronymy relation in WordNet , and in express the model whole/partial relationship, see Fig.1 model m118 hasPart Ins_hand and Ins_face . 
In ontology, the relationship is expressed by concept property. hasPart is a kind of datatype property, and used to express the concept synonym relationship, see Fig.1. 2.2 OWL Each of the 3D models is an instance of a certain concept in the ontology. In the ex-periment, we use Prot X g X  3.3 as the ontology modeling tool and OWL [6] as ontology human. Fig. 2 lists a portion of the ontology expressed in OWL about the concept human. It is the description about the 3D model m118 of PSB. It also contains some annota-scribed by some synonyms, such as homo, man, human_being etc.. The model has two parts: face and hand. 2.3 SWRL SWRL [7] (Semantic Web Rule Language) is based on a combination of the OWL DL and OWL Lite sublanguages of the OWL Web Ontology Language the Unary/Binary Datalog sublanguages of the Rule Markup Language. SWRL allows OWL individuals. The rules can be used to infer new knowledge from existing OWL knowledge bases. hasPart properties: 
Furthermore, for every type of model we also need a SWRL rule to express its whole/partial relationship, for example: We can create, edit, and read/write SWRL rules in the Prot X g X  SWRL Editor. The Prot X g X  SWRL Editor is an extension to Pr ot X g X -OWL that permits interactive editing of SWRL rules. Figure 3 shows the part of the SWRL Editor tab in Prot X g X -OWL. 
In the Prot X g X  SWRL Editor, the inter action between OWL and the Jess rule en-gine is user-driven. After defining the SWRL rules, we can make OWL knowledge and rules, and then make the resulting Jess facts be transferred back to Prot X g X -OWL as OWL knowledge. Prot X g X  SWRL Editor. 3.1 Working Principle We can use the two methods of text-based and content-based retrieval to retrieval the 3D models in Onto3D. 
The user who used the method of text-based retrieval can make retrieval of 3D ob-jects by textual query or browse the ontology and select the appropriate concept. The concrete working is as follows: 1. System needs to establish an ontology knowledge-base which is connected with 2. User can input keyword or browse the ontology tree and select the model name to 3. The Knowledge Base can infer and obtain the retrieval results by query request of 
About the method of content-based retrieval, the model is based on the hypothesis high-level semantic of the models. The concrete working is as follows: 1. System also needs an ontology Knowledge-base which is connected with PSB. We 2. User uploads a sample 3D model. 3. Extracting the sample model X  X  features. 4. Cluster the features of all the models in KB and the sample model. After that, we 5. System returns all of the models of the cluster which the sample model belong to The system architecture is depicted in Fig.5. 3.2 Shape Feature Extraction and Clustering with the 3D model that user provided. features of 3D models. 
We use X-means [10] algorithm to cluster the 3D models in the PSB and utilize the cluster results to simply classify the models. X-means is an important improvement of the well known method K-means. To overcome the highly dependency of K-means on clustering, where L(x  X  c) is the log-likelihood of dataset x according to the model c, ters can be automatically decided. 
In our experiment, we assigned X-means parameter range is [130, 150] which is according to the count of the basic manual classification in PSB. Finally, we can ob-belongs to. Meanwhile, the system can calcu late the nearest N neighbors according to the distances between their centers, and saved the result to the temp document for user feedback later. 3.3 Retrieval Realization and Relevance Feedback They can make retrieval of 3D objects by textual query. A query can be typed by the models can input the concept in a text box. Alternatively he can browse the ontology and select the appropriate concept. The system will answer the user query by return-ing all the models annotated with the input concept or with a sub-concept of the input concept. Specially, the system provides the synonyms query. For example a user wants to query human, he/she can input man, homo or human being. new model. In the method of shape retrieval, the Knowledge-Base X  X  inference work completely irrelevant models. 
The annotation information of the completely relevant models contains all the se-http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type as the property of target model and retrieve all the models having the same property in the knowledge-base. 
The category relevant models are those models that they and sample model should belong to the identical category such as table and bed. Although they are not same mod-els, they both are the subclass of the concept furniture, namely they have the same hy-according to its concept, and th en return all of the instances of the upper level concept. 
If all of the results are completely irrelevant models, we should use the X-means algorithm to find the nearest neighbor cluster, and return all of the models in the near-est neighbor cluster. 
In addition, the completely relevant models have the highest priority, the category lowest priority. For the unknown model which was not in the knowledge-base, ac-vant model X  X  annotation and supply the unknown model as the instance of the certain concept to the knowledge-base. We use Jena [11] as the reasoning tool in the model retrieval process and use SPARQL [12] to assist Jena perform query. The Prot X g X -OWL Plugin was used to generate the SWRL.OWL files and to retrieve the rules from the SWRL.OWL files for Jess to process. retrieval knowledge-base. SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a kind of RDF query language which is proposed by W3C. Jess (Java Expert System is not open source but can be downloaded free for a 30-day evaluation period and is available free to academic users. In experiment, we use the models of Princeton Shape Benchmark. The main page of through the clustering arithmetic after user uploads a sample model in shape-retrieval. System also provides the model X  X  annotation information under the each result model. shows the final feedback result of the query in the Fig.6(a). 
In shape retrieval, we chose 20 kinds of the representative models, and selected one all the sample models from the PSB to improve the accuracy of the experiment. In the according to the relevant models X  annotation. But in other 6 tests, we cannot retrieve any semantic relevant or category relevant models at first time. So the system needs to return all the models in the nearest neighbor cluster of the sample model as the query function of the Princeton 3D search engine. The Princeton 3D search engine has about file. Table 1 shows the retrieval efficiency of Onto3D. 
From table 1 we can see that Onto3D system X  X  precision of the first time retrieval the relevant models after user X  X  first time relevance feedback. For those sample mod-els that had not retrieved any relevant models at first time, the experiment shows that the system can retrieve the semantic relevant models in 2 or 3 times user feedbacks. words, the system could not find any results. Secondly, content-based retrieval relies feedback many times, retrieval efficiency of the system must be reduced greatly. The paper explores an ontology and SWRL-based 3D model retrieval system Onto3D. It can infer 3D models X  semantic property by rule engine and retrieve the target mod-els by ontology. The experiments on Prin ceton Shape Benchmark show that Onto3D future work will concentrate on improve the system and promote the Onto3D system to adopt more of the widespread 3D model database.
