 Visual summarization is an attractive new scheme to sum-marize web pages, which can help achieve a more friendly user experience in search and re-finding tasks by allowing users quickly get the idea of what the web page is about and helping users recall the visited web page. In this pa-per, we perform a careful study on the recently proposed visual summarization approaches, including the thumbnail of the web page snapshot, the internal image in the web page which is representative of the content in the page, and the visual snippet which is a synthesized image based on the internal image, the title, and the logo found in the web page. Moreover, since the internal image based summariza-tion approach hardly works when the representative internal images are unavailable, we propose a new strategy, which retrieves the representative image from the external to sum-marize the web page. The experimental results suggest that the various summarization approaches have respective ad-vantages on different types of web pages. While internal images and thumbnails can provide a reliable summariza-tion on web pages with dominant images and web pages with simple structure respectively, the external images are regarded as a useful information to complement the inter-nal images and are demonstrated very useful in helping users understanding new web pages . The visual snippet performs well on the re-finding tasks since it incorporates the title and logo which are advantageous on identifying the visited web pages.

Search and re-finding tasks are among the most typical applications on the Internet [4]. In order to help users ac-complish these two tasks efficiently, systems usually provide a summarization of web page so that users can quickly judge whether the page is of interest. For example, the search engine usually presents the search result using the summa-rization of web pages, consisting of the URL, page title and a short textual snippets. When people try to re-find the web pages in the browsing history, they are likely to access the bookmarks in the web browser, where visited web pages are summarized by the url and the title. While most sys-tems summarize web pages by text, due to its compactness and simplicity, it is difficult for users to quickly and pre-cisely judge if one web page is of interest from the textual summarization, since it is often time-consuming for users to read a long text snippet or it usually cannot convey enough information if the text snippet is short.

A picture is worth a thousand words. Information search and re-finding tasks would become more efficient if the web pages are visually summarized, since it is easier for people to get a quick understanding by seeing an image than read-ing text. Google has recently released the  X  X mages from the pages X  feature [7] in its web search system, which summa-rizes the web page using the images in the page (we refer to it as internal images in this paper). This feature presents two images selected from the web page alongside the textual snippet to users, from which users can quickly identify the desired web pages, even without reading the textual snip-pets. Visual summarization can also used to enhance the bookmarks in a Web browser to help users easily accomplish the re-finding task. Apple X  X  web browser Safari 4 [15] has introduced a new feature called  X  X op Sites X , which visualizes users X  favorite web pages as a gorgeous 3D thumbnail wall generated from the downsized snapshot of the web pages.
Although thumbnails [15, 11] and internal images of web pages [7] are adopted by the mainstream companies due to the simplicity, they suffer from several disadvantages. First, for those web pages which have complex layout or rich con-tent, users are difficult to see clearly anything useful from the small thumbnails. Second, although the internal images are proved to be more informative than the thumbnail [12], they are unavailable for a large amount of web pages which do not contain useful images.

To deal with the above mentioned difficulties of internal image based visual summarization, in this paper we pro-pose to mine images from the external for the visual sum-marization of web pages without suitable internal images, which is so-called external image based visual summariza-tion. Furthermore, we perform a comparative study to in-vestigate the applicability of the different visual summariza-tion approaches to different kinds of web pages and for dif-ferent tasks including search and re-finding. The different approaches, including thumbnails, internal images, external images, and a recently proposed new scheme called visual snippet [17], are analyzed based on user study, from which some conclusions are drawn which can provide guidance for the practical application of visual summarization for web pages.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review related work. Three kinds of technology for generating vi-sual summarizations will be introduced in section 3, 4 and 5. Experimental results and user study are reported in Sec-tion 6 and 7. At last, we conclude this paper and point our future work in Section 8.
Thumbnail [18, 15, 6, 3, 5, 19, 20] and internal image [7, 12, 17] based visual summarizations are widely studied in research communities and commonly adopted in existing products.

Thumbnail is a scaled-down image which displays a snap-shot of a web page as rendered in the web browser. Due to its simplicity, it is commonly adopted in existing products [18, 15, 6]. Viewzi [18] presents users the search result using not only the text snippets, but also the thumbnail of the web page, for web search. Firefox  X  X astDial X  X 6], like Safari 4 [15], visualizes bookmarks as thumbnails. Alongside the widely adoption of visual summarization of web pages in industry, many research efforts have been invested on this problem in the academia as well. Some studies are focused on the de-sign of thumbnail. Cockburn et al. [3] generate thumbnails that consist of reduced images plus graphical icons that in-dicate bookmarked and frequently visited pages. Dziadosz and Chandrasekar [5] suggest that thumbnails of web pages used along with text snippets in search engine interface can help users in reducing predicting errors, at little time cost in processing time. Woodruff et al. [19, 20] design textually enhanced thumbnails, which enhance the readability of cer-tain parts of the document within the thumbnail and display highlighted keywords transparently overlaid on the reduced document. As a result, the enhanced thumbnail takes ad-vantages of both textual summaries and raw thumbnails. However, in the above applications, raw thumbnail has dis-advantages that for those web pages which have rich con-tent, users are difficult to see clearly anything useful from the small thumbnail. Though enhanced thumbnails [3, 19] address this problem to some extent, they are task specific because they only focus on elements relating to specific tasks (e.g., query term in the case of Woodruff et al. [19, 20] or visitation data in the case of Cockburn et al. [3]).
In order to address the problems of thumbnail based sum-marization, internal image based summarizations are pro-posed as an alternative approach since internal images usu-ally can describe the content of the hosting web page. In order to improve the relevance judgment of web search re-sults, Li et al. [12] proposes an internal image based scheme which extracts the dominant images from the web page as  X  X mage excerpt X . The dominant images are first detected by a trained model based on three levels of image features. And then the most relevant one is selected based on the relationship between the query and the image X  X  surround-ing text. Visual Snippet [17], which is an image generated by composing a dominant image from the web page, a wa-termarked logo, and salient text (e.g. title) from the web page, is an extension of  X  X mage excerpts X . These two domi-nant image based approaches are proved to be more infor-mative for search compared to the above thumbnail based approaches. Internal image based summarizations are also adopted by industrial products, such as Google X  X   X  X mages from the pages X  [7]. However, as aforementioned, for a large amount of web pages, useful internal images are unavailable, which limits the applicability of such approaches.
Some studies have involved how different summarizations perform in search and re-finding tasks. Woodruff et al. [20] conduct a study to examine the use of text summaries, raw thumbnails, as well as the enhanced thumbnails in a web search task and find that for some questions, text summaries outperform raw thumbnails while for other questions, raw thumbnails outperform text summaries. Enhanced thumb-nails have better and more consistent performance than ei-ther text summaries or raw thumbnails. Teevan et al. [17] ex-plore how text summaries, raw thumbnails and visual snip-pet perform in both search and re-finding tasks. In this paper, we explore not only how different summarizations perform in search and re-finding tasks, but also how differ-ent summarizations perform for different kinds of web pages.
The images contained in a web page are usually used to describe the content of the page, which are so-called internal images and can be directly used to summarize the web page. However, a typical web page may contain a lot of images, most of which are advertisement images, decoration images and logos. Hence we need to detect the most dominant among all the images in a web page for visual summariza-tion. In this paper, we adopt the learning-based algorithm proposed in [21] for dominant image detection, which will be described as follows.

First, we need to extract features for all the images based on the property of the image itself, the relationship of the image to the hosting web page, and the site information, as summarized in Table 1. The details of the features can be found in [21]. Then an image dominance detection model can be learned from some labeled training samples, which are represented as ( x i,j , y i,j ), where x i,j is the extracted fea-ture vector of the image i in the page j and y i,j is its labeled dominance. Each image for training is assigned an impor-tant level, namely 0 (useless), 1 (important) and 2 (highly important). We regard the dominance detection problem as a ranking problem since there are multiple dominance levels. Then we use linear Ranking-SVM [9] to train the ranking model for dominance detection. 1

 ages by synthesizing the salient text (e.g. title), dominant image, and logo into a single image. It X  X  designed to capture the respective advantages of textual snippets and internal images.

The visual snippet generation algorithm consists of four steps, which are described as follows. 1. Internal dominant image selection and process-2. Logo extraction: Logo images are detected by a 3. Title extraction: The title is extracted from the html 4. Image Composition: The logo is made semi-transparent
Figure 1 (a) and (b) show an example 2 of the dominant image selected by the algorithm in Section 3 and visual snip-pet generated by the algorithm as aforementioned.
The aforementioned summarization methods including in-ternal image and visual snippet both require that there are dominant images in the web page. However, for a large amount of web pages, the dominant images which can rep-resent the information of the web page don X  X  exist. How to generate a meaningful visual summarization for such web pages is a new challenge to the web page summarization problem.

The intuitive idea to address this problem is to retrieve images which can represent visually the web page from the whole Internet. It is so-called external image based approach compared with the internal images discussed before. The idea can be briefly stated as follows. Firstly the key phrases, which can represent the salient topics in the web page, are Figure 1: Dominant Image, Visual Snippet and Thumbnail Sample.
 Figure 2: The work flow of the proposed system.
 The circle boxes denote operations, and the rectan-gle boxes denote the results after the operations. extracted. Then the key phrases are used as queries to query the image search engine for the images relevant to the topics of the web page. Thirdly the returned image results are reranked based on the textual similarity between the web page containing the result image and the target web page to be summarized as well as the visual similarity among the result images. Finally the top ranked image are used to summarize the target web page.

Figure 2 illustrates the work flow of our approach.
In this paper we employ the KEX algorithm proposed in [2] to extract the key phrases from web pages.
In KEX, initial term sequences are first extracted by split-ting the texts up according to phrase boundaries such as punctuation marks and dashes. Then candidate key phrases are generated using all subsequences of these initial term sequences up to a given length (4 in [2]). After these candi-date key phrases are filtered using query logs, two kinds of features, including 3 structured features which are related to the structure of HTML file and 3 text features which are related to text content, are calculated. Finally given the features and user labeled salience score, a model is trained by logistic regression. More details can be seen in [2].
In our experiment, after we calculate the salience score of each candidate phrase, the top 4 key phrases with the high-est scores are used as queries to the image search engine. For each key phrase, 30 results including images and corre-sponding web pages are retrieved for further processing.
We develop algorithm to rerank and filter images in the key phrase based search result based on two assumptions. First, good candidate images for visual summarization are likely to appear in web pages textually similar to the target page; Second, an image is more important if more images are visually similar to it. Thereafter, in our algorithm, we firstly rank result images based on the textual similarities between the web pages containing the images and the target web page. Then we propose an algorithm to filter out visually unimportant images.

Textual similarity between two web pages is calculated by cosine similarity based on vector space model(VSM). First, TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) score is calculated for each term in the web page. a web page is represented as a vector where each component is a TFIDF score of a particular term in the page. Finally cosine simi-larity [16] is adopted to calculate textual similarity between each result web page and the target web page.

Visual importance of result images is calculated using Vi-sualRank [8]. For each image, we firstly extract local SIFT features which are a 128-dimensional vector. Then the sim-ilarity between two images is defined as the number of local features shared between them divided by the average num-ber of local features in the two images. Finally, a graph is constructed with images as vertices and visual similarities as weights on edges. PageRank is applied on the similarity graph and then the resulted rank score vector is employed to represent the importance of each image. The images whose importance score is below a threshold will be filtered out.
Consequentially the relevance of the image to the target web page can be defined as
Sim ( i, T W )= TI ( CW i ,TW ) , if VRScore &gt; Thresh 0 , otherwise. where CW i is the i th candidate web page, TW is the tar-get web page and TI ( CW i ,TW ) is the TFIDF cosine sim-ilarity between CW i and TW . VRScore is the importance computed by VisualRank. Thresh is the threshold which is set to the average of VRScore of all of the candidate images in our experiment.
We have conducted numerous experiments to evaluate the performance of various visual summarization approaches. First we introduce the dataset and our experimental setup. Then we evaluate the usefulness of external images of our system based on the labeled data in our dataset. Finally we discuss how various visual summaries perform for different kinds of web pages.
In order to evaluate our system, firstly we randomly se-lected 100 queries from the query set released by KDD CUP 2005, covering different queries including  X  X omputers X ,  X  X n-tertainment X ,  X  X nformation X ,  X  X iving X ,  X  X nline Community X ,  X  X hopping X  and  X  X ports X . Then we used the Bing Search API [1] to retrieve the top 100 search results for each of the queries. Then the web pages and the included images were crawled for the top 100 results for each of the 100 queries. Finally, our dataset including 8412 retrieved web pages was obtained.

For each web page in our dataset, we downloaded all of the internal images and retrieved external images using the aforementioned algorithm. After all of these images were obtained, we recruited expert labelers to annotate whether the internal images were dominant and the external images were relevant to summarize the corresponding web pages. In the remaining of this paper, the web pages with at least one internal image annotated as dominant are denoted as  X  X IP X . Those without any dominant internal image annotated are denoted as  X  X DIP X . In our dataset, we notice that about 41.8% of the web pages are NDIPs, which demonstrates that internal dominant images are unavailable for a large amount of web pages.

Moreover, in order to compare the different summariza-tion approaches, we generated the four summaries of nearly the same size so that the result is not affected by the differ-ent sizes. The settings to generate the four summaries are listed as follows: 1. Thumbnail (the size is of 160x120). As a tradeoff 2. Internal Image (the size is of about 160x120 while 3. Visual Snippet (the size is of 160x120). 4. External Image (the size is of about 160x120 while
After these summaries were generated, we asked the label-ers to judge which summary, including the internal image, the external image, the thumbnail, and the visual snippet, is the best to represent the web page. If the labeler thinks all of them cannot summarize the page, he/she can select  X  X thers X .
Table 2 shows the proportion of web pages which have at least one external images annotated as relevant in the entire dataset, DIPs and NDIPs, respectively. External images retrieved by our algorithm are labeled as relevant for 53.3% web pages in the entire dataset. Based on this observation, external images can be considered as a useful source for web page summarization.

Moreover, the external images are labeled as relevant for 59.9% of DIPs and 44.0% of NDIPs, respectively. We can see that surprisingly the proportion of web pages for which the Table 2: Proportions of web pages with annotated external images.
 Entire Dataset 8412 4480 53.3% external images are useful in DIPs is even larger than that in NDIPs. We argue it is because that web pages containing dominant images can be regarded as more appropriate for visual summarization, which, hence, can also be summarized well by a relevant image retrieved from the external. In ad-dition, the external images are useful for 44.0% web pages of NDIPs, which states that the external images are a valuable complement to internal images for visual summarization of web pages.
Based on the labelers X  judges on which summary is the best for each of web pages, we conduct the statistics on the proportion of web pages for which the various summaries are regarded as the best, in DIPs and NDIPs, respectively, as shown in Table 3.

We assume that web pages which have the same kind of best summarizations are likely t o have common characteris-tics. To explore these characteristics, we looked through our labeled data, and we also had an interview with our labelers to know their thoughts about this problem. Finally some conclusions about the summarization problem were drawn from our observation and the labelers X  suggestions.
The dominant image can only be adopted for DIP, and it is voted as the best one for 44.01% of DIP. Besides, visual snippet which is also a dominant image based summarization is voted as the best for 13.24% of DIP. Therefore, dominant image based summarizations are the best summarization for over a half DIPs. Summarizing web pages using dominant images is reasonable because dominant images can present the ideas of the web pages and often they are impressive to attract users X  attention. However, thumbnail and external image based summarization are voted as the best summa-rization for 27.99% and 14.69% of DIPs respectively. We will explain why these two summarizations outperform dominant image based summarization in the next two sections.
We also notice that for most web pages of DIP, the visual snippet is worse than the dominant image. This observation seems anti-intuition because a visual snippet contains more information (title and logo) than a single internal image. To explain this observation, we discussed with the labelers and found that some weakness slightly let down the appro-batory of visual snippet. Specifically, the title information sometimes doesn X  X  describe the content of the dominant im-age and this would mislead the users; more importantly, vi-sual snippet is composed of three kind of components, which seems a little rough-and-tumble. Therefore, though visual snippet is promising for representing web pages, current im-plementation limits its applicability.
We explain some characteristics of those web pages which are best summarized by thumbnails. By observing the web pages which can be best represented by thumbnails, we cat-egorize these pages into the following categories including  X  X ages in small size X ,  X  X ages with several images in snapshot area X ,  X  X ages with salient and clear image/text in snapshot area X ,  X  X ages with logo in snapshot area X ,  X  X ages with simple page structure X , and  X  X ages in well-known web site X . Among those pages for which thumbnails are not good summaries, most of them contain a large amount of text. Since texts are usually unable to be seen clearly in a thumbnail with small size, it is difficult for users to recognize or recall these pages containing many text in the body.

For 27.99% of DIP, the thumbnail based summarization outperforms all of the other summarizations. Based on our observations, users tend to choose thumbnail as the best summarization for  X  X ages with salient and clear image/text in snapshot area X . Since dominant images are contained and can usually be recognized in the thumbnail, users tend to choose thumbnails as better summarizations because thumb-nail can contain more information (e.g. structure of web page) than a single dominant image.

For 36.24% of NDIP, the thumbnail based summarization outperforms all of the other summarizations. This is partly because sometimes external images are not that relevant to the target web page. On the other hand, for NDIP, thumb-nail based summarization is preferential for  X  X ages with logo in snapshot area X  and  X  X ages in well-known web site X .
For 34.51% of NDIP, the external images are voted as the best summarization. For all of these web pages, external im-ages are annotated as relevant by labelers. However, 50.3% of external images are not relevant to web pages which are best summarized by other summarizations. Therefore, the relevance of external image is the crucial factor to select external image based summarization for NDIPs. However, though useful, external images often suffer from reliability problem, i.e., external images retrieved from the web are not always that relevant to the target web pages, which is demonstrated in Section 6.2. For NDIPs, external images with tremendous relevance scores can be adopted as reliable summarizations, otherwise, thumbnails are better, especially for  X  X ages with logo in snapshot area X  and  X  X ages in well-known web site X .

For 14.69% of DIP, the external images outperform the internal images. This is because for some web pages about popular topics, there are relevant images across the web. This suggests that external images, as well as internal im-ages, should be uniquely taken into consideration when we calculate the dominance of image based summarizations in our future work.
As a conclusion, after the comparison of web pages which are best represented by different visual summarizations, we propose several guidance of selecting summarization type here.

For NDIP, external images are useful summarizations, but they also suffer from reliability problem. Thumbnail based summarizations are also good for NDIP, especially for X  X ages with logo in snapshot area X  and  X  X ages in well-known web site X .

For DIP, if the dominant images are contained and can be recognized in the thumbnail, thumbnail is the best choice for summarization; otherwise dominant images are more re-liable. Besides, for a web page of DIP, if an exclusive domi-nant image is found and the title information agrees with the content of the dominant image, visual snippet tends to out-perform a single dominant image. Actually, an automatic learning algorithm for selecting the best summarization is our future work.
We have conducted a user study to compare how par-ticipants use different summarizations to understand and re-find web pages. The goal of this study is to explore how different summarization approaches (thumbnail, internal im-age, external image and visual snippet) support a under-standing or a re-finding task. 51 participants were invited to conduct our user study, all of whom have at least an Bachelor X  X  degree and range in age from 20 to 35 years old. Among them, 56% participants are male. Besides, the participants are all heavy web users, covering a large range of careers, such as computer engineers, researchers, designers, and students.

In this study, the participants were asked to complete a two-phase study. The first phase involves understanding the contents of web pages that have never been visited by the participants. The second phase involves re-finding the web pages that have been visited during the first phase.
The 11 web pages in this study are chosen from a range of different categories, for example amazon for online sales, wikipedia for information provider. 2 of the 11 web pages are NDIPs. A simple descriptive name extracted from the url for each web page is listed below the x axis in figure 3 and 4.
In this phase, the participants were asked to perform 11 tasks about the understanding of web pages. For each task, each participant was given a web page and one of the four visual summaries corresponding to the web page. The par-ticipants were asked to strictly perform the following two steps. First they guessed the content of the web page based solely on the provided visual summarization without reading the web page. The second step was to read the web page and torateascorerangingfrom-1to3basedonwhetherpar-ticipants have guessed the content of the web page from the visual summary. Specifically , score -1 means that the sum-marization misleads the participant; score 0 means that the participant cannot understand the summarization; score 1 means the summarization can help users grasp a rough idea on what the page is about and score 3 means the summa-rization can help users exactly understand the content of the web page; score 2 is the between of 1 and 3.

We note that the order in which the different summariza-tion methods are provided to users would affect the judges of the subsequent summaries. For example, if a participant sees the internal image first, she may get more from the thumbnail which may include the internal images, so that she would obtain a better understanding of the page from the thumbnail. In order to avoid such a bias, the partici-pants were divided into 4 groups. Each group was provided a single visual summarization type.
In several hours after participants completed phase 1, they were asked to accomplish the second phase of the user study. In this phase, we explored how the various summarization types would affect the recall of the web pages visited in phase 1. Participants were asked to re-find the web page based solely on one visual summary. In this phase, after we speci-fied a web page to be re-found, the participants were asked to select an image, which can remind them of the web page, from an image collection including a single kind of visual summary for all of the web pages.

The participants were also divided into four groups; each of them was exactly the same as that in phase 1. Since a vi-sual snippet is partly based on internal dominant images, we did not supply these two summarization types at the same time. Therefore, two groups were provided visual snippets; the other two groups were provided internal images.
In order to evaluate the performance of each summariza-tion type for this phase, we define the error rate of a sum-marization type ( e ( s )) as e ( s )= where I { GuessedW ebpage = TargetWebpage | s } is an in-dicator which equals to 1 when the web page guessed by a participant based on a summarization type ( s )isnotthe desired web page.
For each summarization method, we average the scores by different participants for each of web pages, respectively. The result is shown in Figure 3, from which we can draw the following conclusions.

From the figure, we can draw several conclusions about the performance of different summarizations for this under-standing task.

First, none of the summarization types always perform the best for any kind of web pages. For example, internal images perform well in DIP. However, they get a score below 0 for NDIP (e.g. coldwar 3 ). Therefore, we analyze the per-formance of summarizations for DIP and NDIP respectively.
For the 9 web pages which are DIP , internal images achieve an average score of 1.62 while the average scores for the thumbnail, the visual snippet, and external image http://www.coldwar.org/articles/90s/BorisYeltsin.asp are 1.27, 1.24 and 1.29, respectively. Moreover, for a large majority of DIPs (6 out of 9), dominant image achieves the best result. For the other three DIPs for which internal images are not the best, based on our interview with the participants we find that it is mainly because the partici-pants do not understand the contents of these images due to the limited expertise of the participants on these topics. In conclusion, for DIP, dominant internal images are regarded as the best summarization.

For the 2 web pages which are NDIP in our study, thumb-nail and external image based summarizations achieve rela-tively high average scores of 1.62 and 1.17 respectively, while the average scores for internal image and visual snippet are -0.65 and 0.46 respectively. The average score for internal image illustrates that the non-dominant internal images se-lected from NDIP would mislead users (e.g. coldwar in the study).
We draw the error rates of various summarizations ( e ( s )) for all of the web pages in Figure 4. From this figure, the error rates of some summarizations (e.g. internal image, thumbnail) vary among different web pages, i.e. this re-finding task is also web page dependent. However, we can draw some common conclusions for this specific task.
We average the error rate on all of the web pages for every summarization type and the result is shown in Table 4.
The visual snippet performs better than, or comparably with other summarizations. Especially, the dominant inter-nal images are worse than the visual snippet although the main informative visual part of the visual snippet is the dom-inant internal image. Thus, the additional two components of the visual snippet: title and logo information are useful for identifying different visited web pages.

The thumbnail based summarization outperforms visual snippet for NDIPs since the visual snippet is generated from non-dominant images in this case. However, it is worse than visual snippet for most of DIPs, which indicates that al-though users re-find the web page via visual information, a short but descriptive text (e.g. cropped title) is also impor-tant.

The external image based summarization is not suitable for this task. Intuitively, an image which the users do not see in the target web page before will not recall the users of the page. Besides, external images suffer from reliability problem, i.e., retrieved external images are sometimes not that relevant to the web pages. Therefore, external image based summarization is a useful complementary for NDIPs in understanding task, however, it is not suitable for re-finding task, even for NDIPs.
In this paper, we present a careful study on comparing the various visual summarization methods for web pages, including thumbnails, internal images, and visual snippets. An extension to internal image based visual summarization is proposed, which selects the representative images not from within the web page, but from the external entire Internet.
The experimental results and user studies suggest that the various summarization approaches have respective ad-vantages on different types of web pages and for different tasks. While thumbnails are simple and effective for web pages with simple structure or clear image and text with large size, internal images can summarize the web page well if it includes dominant images. The external images are a useful source for those web pages without dominant images and can be regarded as a valuable complement to internal images. Visual snippets are extremely effective in helping users identifying the visited web pages in the re-finding task.
The above conclusions suggest two future work. First, since the internal and external images have respective ad-vantages, we will develop an integrated framework which does not select the internal images and external images sep-arately, but selects the representative images from a com-bined pool of internal and external images. Second, we can develop an algorithm to automatically select the most ap-propriate visual summaries from the four types of candidates based on the type of the web page and the tasks for which the summaries are used, so that the user satisfaction is im-proved over each of the individuals.
