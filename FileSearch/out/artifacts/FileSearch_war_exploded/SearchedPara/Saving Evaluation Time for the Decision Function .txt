Imbalanced Class Prior In the so-called detection problem, the number of pos-itive examples is dominated by the number of negative examples in testing stage. However, positive and neg-ative examples are made equal size in training stage to design a reasonable classifier. In this case, only nega-tive training examples are used for the portion P t in EPL at each level.
 In the general case when class prior ratio in train-ing stage differs from that in testing stage, one needs reweigh the positive and negative examples when cal-culating the portion P t : instead of the original total probability theorem: 1.2. BDD and Threshold Function BDD is a data structure for general Boolean Ex-pression (BE) (Bryant, 1986). The BE with spe-cial structure as explained in main paper was firstly studied in (Hosaka et al., 1994) under the name Threshold Function. BDD construction for Thresh-old Function were studied by researchers from VLSI CAD tool (Hosaka et al., 1994) and Integer Program-ing (Behle, 2010; Mayer-Eichberger, 2008). The inter-val division techniques for BDD construction, as ex-plained in main paper, is credited to (Behle, 2010). 1.3. FastExit FastExit (with weight sorting) is a by-product in (Kim et al., 2012), based on the idea of (Sochman &amp; Matas, Behle, Markus. Binary decision diagrams and inte-ger programming .
