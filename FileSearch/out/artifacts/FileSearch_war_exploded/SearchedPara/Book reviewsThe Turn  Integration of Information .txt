Two leading international researchers/scholars in information science, information seeking behavior, and information retrieval, Dane Peter Ingwersen and Finn Kalervo Ja  X  lverlin, have written a comprehensive his-tory, critique and overview of research in these fields. This is an ideal work for beginning researchers and ad-vanced students preparing for research. The authors cover all the possible variables, models, methods and the major research results up to now, with few exceptions. The volume is well illustrated, and the text is nicely broken up into comprehensible chunks with appropriate headings. It concludes with a glossary with definitions of key terms, a complete list of references (in lieu of footnotes or chapter references), and a topical index.

The author of the index is not identified; it has few cross references, but no heading leads to excessive num-bers of pages. It would be nice if the index led the reader directly to paragraphs instead of pages, but few books do that yet. Unfortunately, the list of references, in alphabetical order by lead author, does not lead the reader back to a discussion of the author X  X  work. Also, the citations are abbreviated, so that authors full names have been reduced to initials  X  not a big problem if your name is Ingwersen or Ja  X  rvelin, but potentially misleading with an excessively common name like James D. Anderson, reduced to the even more common J.D. Anderson.
 The title of the book is unusual. It reminds me of the famous paper by Vannevar Bush,  X  X  X s We May
Think X  X  (Atlantic Monthly, July 1945), which has become a classic example of a work whose title does not tell the reader, or the seeker, much about the content of the work. Luckily, this book has a subtitle,  X  X  X ntegration of information seeking and retrieval in context X  X , but it would have been helpful if that came first (e.g.,  X  X  X nfor-mation seeking and retrieval in context: Turning toward Integration. X  X ).

But the authors seem to use  X  X  X urn X  X  in the more negative sense of  X  X  X urn off X  X . They explain the title as fol-lows:  X  X  X here are many words we would have liked to write into the book title in order to describe the nature of this book. However, all the words did not fit in the title the reader already saw. We therefore chose The Turn as the main title to communicate the idea that it is time to look back and to look forward to develop a new integrated view of information seeking and retrieval: the field should turn off (emphasis added) its separate narrow paths of research and construct a new avenue X  X  (Preface, p. vii).

Luckily, the rest of the book is much clearer in its presentation that this initial explanation. In fact, the book is very well organized, covering the various strands of Information Seeking and Information Retrieval research, and introducing the now dominant cognitive framework. In my experience, nearly everyone in the field now claims this orientation, even if their research may not necessarily reflect it. In the real word, most research addresses only a very small piece of the large picture, and it would be hard to include everything in every study; nevertheless I believe the battle for the cognitive framework presented by the authors has already been won on most fronts.

Despite its comprehensive overview of the entire field, there are a few surprising absences. The most striking is no discussion of browsing and interfaces that support browsing through faceted displays. The subject index has no entries under either term (browsing, faceted displays). A. Steven Pollitt, one of the chief advocates of faceted browsable interfaces, is not cited. Another leader in the development and testing of faceted displays,
Marty Hearst, is cited, but not her work on faceted interface displays. This surprise is compounded when variables relating to interfaces are grouped under  X  X  X lgorithmic Dimensions X  X , including the representation of documents and interface visualization and presentation. Indeed there are algorithms relating to these elements, but surely, the human design of interfaces and the representation and presentation of documents are not completely  X  X  X lgorithmic X  X .

In the 1990s, Birger Hj X rland and Hanne Albrechtsen, colleagues of Ingwersen at the Royal School of Li-brary and Information Science in Copenhagen, introduced a new emphasis in the study of information seeking behavior, which they called  X  X  X omain analysis X  X  and an  X  X  X ctivity-theoretical approach X  X . Their concern was to broaden the context of the often individualistic cognitive approach up to that time. Ingwersen and Ja  X  rvelin have incorporated many of their insights into this work, with a broader contextual cognitive framework, and have cited their work, but I believe the contribution of Hj X land and Albrechtsen merits a little more direct attention than the paragraph on page 244 X 245.

But these are minor caveats. This book is a wonderful contribution to a comprehensive understanding of a complete and integrated view of information seeking and information retrieval. All advanced students looking forward to entering the research arena must read it, and those already participating in research will benefit as well. Information Retrieval Design, James D.

About 10 years ago, when I started to teach bibliographic database design and construction in library schools, many students would think that the only technique needed in designing and building a good biblio-graphic database was computer programming, or how to use some existing applications like Microsoft Access,
FoxPro, or DB2. When they took the course, they expected to learn using VBA and other database-related computer languages. Key issues of bibliographic and textual database design, like specification of subject scope and documentary unit, analysis of indexable matter, method of controlled vocabulary management, decision on surrogation and surrogate displays, policy of specificity and exhaustivity of indexing, etc., have never occurred to most of the students.

Today, when almost all the database programs available in the market can easily handle not only metadata records, but also full text searching, retrieval and online delivery, this misunderstanding is even more prevalent than before. The only difference maybe just what computer languages or what information retrieval algo-rithms to learn and use (i.e., should it be XML or SQL?, should it be vector-based or probabilistic-based?, etc.). Not many people, including some information professionals and librarians, understand the crucial role an indexing system can play in designing a good and user friendly database, especially document-based data-base and textual information retrieval system.

Advanced technologies may help searching, but they may also make the right information less accessible, if they are implemented inconsistently or against the principles of information access. James Anderson and Jose  X
