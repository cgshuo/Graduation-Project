 Anomaly detection is of critical importance to prevent ma-licious activities such as bullying, terrorist attack planning, and fraud information dissemination. With the recent pop-ularity of social media, new types of anomalous behaviors arise, causing concerns from various parties. While a large body of work haven been dedicated to traditional anomaly detection problems, we observe a surge of research inter-ests in the new realm of social media anomaly detection. In this tutorial, we survey existing work on social media anomaly detection, focusing on the new anomalous phenom-ena in social media and most recent techniques to detect those special types of anomalies. We aim to provide a gen-eral overview of the problem domain, common formulations, existing methodologies and future directions.

Social media systems provide convenient platforms for people to share, communicate, and collaborate. The emer-gence and detection of anomalous behaviors in social media may shed light into early indication of important events, such as natural disasters and disease outbreak, which pro-vides crucial extra time to take actions. Meanwhile, many malicious behaviors, such as cyber attacks, bullying, terror-ist attack planning, and fraudulent information dissemina-tion, also exist on social media. Therefore it is extremely important that we can detect these abnormal activities as accurately and early as possible to prevent disasters and at-tacks. Needless to say, as more social information becomes available, the most challenging question is what useful pat-terns could be extracted from this influx of time-series social media data to help with the detection task.

Different from traditional anomaly detection scenarios, so-cial media provides us with additional information between users (e.g. social networks between users). We can sum-marize the anomalies into two types: one is point anomaly, which refers to the abnormal behaviors of individual users. The other type of anomaly is group anomaly, which involves hidden groups of people (also known as tribe) working col-lectively to achieve a malicious goal. Another way to sum-marize the anomalies is by their input type, which usually consists of sequential data, unstructured texts, and graphs.
This tutorial aims to provide the participants a broad and comprehensive coverage on the foundations and recent devel-opments on anomaly detection social media. We will provide both theoretical and practical results as well as illustrative demos. In contrast to previous tutorials on anomaly de-tection, we will focus on presenting and discussing a broad coverage of the emerging approaches to anomaly detection in the context of scalability and practicability. We will also offer useful and complementary information to the SIGKDD community and suggest directions for future research.
The 3-hour tutorial consists of two parts and a break in the middle. In Part 1, we will provide an introduction to anomaly detection for social media data, including an overview of anomaly detection, data types and properties of social media data, anomaly detection in network data [1, 2, 7, 12], and anomaly detection in temporal data [3, 4, 8, 9]. In Part 2, we will discuss recent advances in anomaly detection for social media data, including point anomaly detection in social media [6, 10], group anomaly detection in social media [5, 11], as well as applications and systems.
