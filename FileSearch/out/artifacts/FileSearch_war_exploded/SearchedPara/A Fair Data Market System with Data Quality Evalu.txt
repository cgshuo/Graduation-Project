 With the widespread of business needs of the big data, its unique value arrests more drawbacks of the existing data market have come out. need to invest considerable effo rts for consultation and trading. proposed to assess and improve the data quality in the literature [1] . However, existing data markets have not involved data quality issues in data pricing models. commodities. It is difficult for buyers to obtain a reliable assessment. data pricing. We designed and implemented a data market system, in which multiple fairness and security mechanisms are developed to ensure an organized system. 
The major features of the system are shown as follows ed to multiple data quality dimensions, which have potent effects on data usability. and trading course. based on data quality evaluation. In addition, it will repair the data set using reliable and efficient mechanism. As a result, the effectiveness of the system is ensured. and set a price on data in brief. Then, we introduce key techniques in Section 3, after which we discuss the plan of demonstrations in Section 4. system is shown in Fig. 1. The whole system is divided into 4 modules. result. In Repairing Recommendation Module, the system shows possible repairs for data Security Module provides security assurance in key process management. evaluation techniques and data repairing recommendation strategies. 3.1 Data Quality Evaluation It is acknowledged in the research community that accuracy, completeness, consisten-cy, currency are major dimensions of the data quality [4] . On account of this, we carry out the data quality evaluation mainly based on these four dimensions in our system. Here we only discuss the evaluation strategy of other two dimensions for the interest of space. We perform accuracy and consistency evaluation according to the methods introduced in [3] and [5], respectively. Completeness Evaluation. Completeness reflects the degree to which values are present in a dataset [4] . Appropriate amount of data, adequate attributes, few missing values in the table are important component when analyzing completeness dimen-sions. Thus, completeness is calculated according to (1), where  X   X  X  X  X  and  X   X  X  X  repre-mum attributes to describe sufficient features of an object, respectively.

We measure currency of a certain dataset in the following formula.  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  log  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  3.2 Repairing Recommendation corrected by our system automatically.
 Inaccuracy Repairing. According to the specific rules defined in the rules base, the replaced with more accurate value. Inconsistency Repairing. In this part, the inconsistent data repairing system (IDRS) violates CFDs [5], it provides appropriate repairing solutions. system will be shown in two aspects. 
From the aspect of data suppliers, the system first evaluates the quality of the dataset and returns the result (as shown in Fig.3), which shows the data-quality-sensitive feature (Fig.4). Suppliers have the option to upload the data commodity after assessment with an authorized and fair price which is beyond artificial revision. From the aspect of data con-sumers, they can find the resource by classification search and keyword search. Further-Consumers can make fair trades with authorized data suppliers. Acknowledgement.
