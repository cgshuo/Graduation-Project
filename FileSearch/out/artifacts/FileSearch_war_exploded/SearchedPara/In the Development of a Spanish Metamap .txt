 MetaMap is an online application that allows mapping text to UMLS Metathesaurus concepts , which is very useful interoperability among different la nguages and systems within the biomedical domain. MetaMap Tr ansfer (MMTx) is a Java program that makes MetaMap available to biomedical researchers. Currently there is no Spanish version of MetaMap, which difficult the use of UMLS Metathesaurus to extract concepts from Spanish biomedical texts. Our ongoing research is mainly focused on using biomedical concepts for cross-lingual text cla ssification and retrieval. In this context the use of concepts instead of bag of words representation allows us to face text classification tasks abstracting from the language [4]. In this paper we evaluate the possibility of combining automatic translation techniques with the use of biomedical ontologies to produce an English text that can be processed by MMTx.

In this paper we present GA LEN, a cross-lingual system to retrieve biomedical documents significantly related to medical records. Given a query in Spanish submitted by a person, it firstly retrieves a list of medical records ordered by relevance in two steps: 1) the query is expanded using concepts included in a biomedical ontology (i.e.: UMLS [2]); 2) medical records are ranked using a representation based on biomedical concepts. Then, the user can choose a record and the system will retrieve several lists of ranked documents as follows: 1) Spanish news; 2) English news; 3) Spanish article ab stracts; and 4) English article abstracts. This last step is done by using concepts to rank the documents against the selected medical record. Throughout all the phases we need to obtain a semantic document representation, which makes it definitely crucial to use an accurate system to extract concepts from text. Keeping in mind that we are mainly working with UMLS, we face the issue that currently there is only an English version of MetaMap [1], and MMTx. The development of equiva lent tools in Spanish would require a huge amount of work and specific knowledge and, although it would be a very valuable task, we wonder if it is really a must. The key point for us at current stage is to evaluate the necessity to develop a Spanish version of MMTx, against the possibility of using automatic translation system s (such as Google Translator or Systran) to obtain an English representation for a Spanish text and then, to apply MMTx to English text and obtain a semantic representation including similar c oncepts than in Spanish. A first simple approach to Spanish MetaMap uses Google Translator to obtain an English version of the text and then applies English MMTx to extract concepts. This approach presents some important mistakes when translating some technical biomedical terms, keeping them in Spanish. The second approach delegates on Google Translator in order to obtain the general translation, but uses a custom UMLS ontology mapper to translate biomedical terms. The first version of the custom UMLS ontology mapper has been created building a sub-ontology of UMLS by using only the  X  X sa X  relation. Then, for each of the concepts included, all Spanish and English string representations have been stored . Considering this mapper, this second approach involves the following steps: As we needed to evaluate the suitability of develop a Spanish MetaMap, we designed a set of expe riments with this orientation. To test the validity of our hypothesis, we need to compare the concepts extracted by MMTx from english texts to the concepts extracted by MMTx from spanish texts previously translated to english. For testing our hypothesis, we needed a corpus of biomedical documents in both languages: Span ish and English. MedLine Plus stores health-related news article s both in English and Spanish. All these news articles are tagged with a set of related MedLine Plus pages, which can be consider ed as topics or categories. From our original bilingual collec tion of news articles, we have generated 3 different collections: The main goal of these experiments is to compare the translated documents (ENG_TRANS and ENG_UNMKD) to the baseline (ENG) document collection. MMTx representation to a representation for a given text c ontains a list of concepts. We have developed 4 possible data representations derived from the MMTS output: A1 (uses compound concepts and ambiguity), A2 (uses compound concepts and no ambiguity), B1 (does not use compound concepts and ambiguity ), B2 (does not use compound concepts and no ambiguity). We ha ve also applied Zipf X  X  Law to reduce the number of attributes used for describing each document. The global number of concepts after this filtering process is shown in Table 1. 
Table 1. Different concepts for each document representation We have computed the similarity between the original ENG documents and the translated ones (ENG_TRANS and ENG_UNMKD) for each possible representation. Then, we have calculated the average value and standard deviation for the 600 news items contained in the globa l collection. Table 2 resumes the results of these experiments. Considering the four representa tions described above, the worst results in terms of similarity are achieved with the most complex and near-to-humans representation (A1). On the other side, B1 is a less complex and near-to-human s representation, and produces results within the A representa tions, while makes the values obtained for B get worse. Our next step will be to apply the Spanish MMTx to diverse text mining tasks, like Text Categoriza tion or Information Retrieval. Testing the documents representati ons evaluated in this paper on build a Spanish MMTx from scratch. We will evaluate other general translation systems, such as Systran or PAHOMTS, automatic translation software maintained by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
