 1. Introduction contact with the tool rake face from the cutting edge of the tool over certain distance known as tool X  X hip contact length which plays an important role in the metal cutting process. It defines the geometry of the chip formation zone, therefore controls the amount of heat generated in the secondary deformation zone during machining process. Knowing this contact characteristic together with contact stress distribution makes it possible to determine cutting forces and temperature pattern, calculate tool strength accurately, choose the optimal tool geometry and control the machining process as a whole.
 chip contact length ( Lee and Shaffer, 1951 ; Hastings et al., 1980 ; Friedman and Lenz, 1970 ; Ramalingman and Desai, 1980 ;
Poletika, 1969; Abuladze, 1962 ; Zorev, 1963 ; Bhattacharyya, 1963 ; Kato et al., 1972 ). The general assumption is that two regions of roughly equal length exist in a whole tool chip contact length, the first is the sticking region, or plastic zone, close to the tool edge where shear stress has its maximum value, and the second is the sliding region, or elastic zone, where the shear stress is believed to decrease down to zero at the end of this length ( Zorev, 1963 ; Bhattacharyya, 1963 ; Kato et al., 1972 ; Klushin, 1958 ). Fig. 1 shows a geometrical representation of the tool X  X hip contact length in orthogonal cutting process.

Among various presented models regarding with tool-chip contact length, some of them are more precise quantitatively which have been reviewed and used to evaluate the proposed GP of presented model in this paper. According to Lee and Shaffer X  X  slip-line solution (1951), the length of the sticking region on the tool X  X hip interface is a function of undeformed chip thickness, shear angle and tool rake angle.

Numerous experiments with various materials (such as armco-iron, carbon and stainless steels, different coppers, and bronzes with different hardness) and cutting conditions were conducted by Poletika (1969) showed that tool X  X hip contact length is uniquely related with the chip compression ratio, c , and undeformed chip thickness, a . Using another construction of plastic field inside the chip, Abuladze (1962) also suggested a formula to define plastic tool X  X hip contact length based on chip compression ratio and actual chip thickness. Many researchers suggested experimental relationships between tool X  X hip contact length, chip thickness, and chip compression ratio (Poletika, 1969; Zorev, 1963 ; Bhattacharyya, 1963 ; Kato et al., 1972 ; Rozenberg and Rozenberg, 1990 ). Using the split tool method,
Kato et al. (1972) reported that the contact length is twice the deformed chip thickness. Toropov and Ko (2003) concluded the same result using slip line field method.

Following Poletika (1969) , Marinov (1999) and Sutter (2005) used dimensional analysis to define the contact length for various workpiece materials; due to this reason, their mathematical form is similar as well, though with different coefficients. In addition, the difference in coefficients of Marinov and Sutter contact length models can be attributed to different cutting speeds used (using same workpiece material). This clearly shows the dependence of tool X  X hip contact length on workpiece material and cutting speed. Other important factors that may influence the contact length prediction are tool geometry, feed rate and interface friction. Sutter (2005) used different rake angle tools (  X  5 and 5 1 ) for contact length measurement and reported large dispersion for normalized contact length. Sutter noted that due to this large dispersion in the results, a clear trend between rake angle and contact length was not obvious. Thus, the model was only developed using the zero degree rake angle contact length data. This approach is however useful, as in machining, once a solid tool or tool holder and insert are selected, then the rake angle is set for the cutting conditions. Iqbal et al. (2008) reported a positive correlation between the interface friction coefficient and contact length when data for various chip compression ratios were considered. If a wide range of cutting speeds is considered, then reduced friction coefficients are experienced at the higher cutting speeds ( Devillez et al., 2004 ; Iqbal et al., 2007 ). Thus, a study of the effect of cutting speed on contact length incorporates friction aspects and cutting parameters. This is useful, as in industrial machining, the coefficient of friction is set by the choice of tooling and workpiece materials and then changes with the cutting conditions. In another study, Oxley proposed a complex model for low carbon steel based on shear angle, material properties and other parameters ( Oxley, 1989 ).

As it can be seen, a variety of ways to find the tool X  X hip contact length gives different results for one set of cutting conditions and tool geometry. This proves that there is still no clear analytical formula that reflects the interrelationship between the shear process in the primary zone and the tool X  chip contact length.

Considering performed researches in this field, it can be said that the majority of presented tool X  X hip contact length models are a function of the undeformed chip thickness and actual chip thickness, and some other require additional data such as shear angle, cutting force and material properties coefficients, such as Shuffer X  X  model and Oxley X  X  model, which can only be determined experimentally. Due to the mentioned shortages and complexity in previous studies, there is a great need for a Genetic Program-ming, GP, model which can connect the influential input and output parameters with a mathematical equation, so in this paper, a precise numerical way to predict the tool X  X hip contact length is proposed by the use of genetic programming, which will be applied into the manufacturing process for the determination of this length with a few numbers of experiments.
 Belonging to the family of evolutionary computation methods, GP imitates biological evolution of living organisms in nature.
This relatively new automatic programming technique was first described by Koza (1992) in his methods. He combined efficiently the concepts of evolutionary computation and automatic pro-gramming. In engineering, especially manufacturing engineering,
GP is frequently applied to model various processes and condi-tions. Some applications of GP have been reported in prediction of surface roughness ( Brezocnik et al., 2004 ); nonlinear system modeling ( Metenidis et al., 2004 ); investigation of the cutting force ( Milfelner et al., 2005 ) and machine scheduling problems ( Dimopoulos and Zalzala, 2001 ). It is noteworthy that this paper is the first research in which GP modeling method is used in the field of manufacturing engineering to predict the length of tool X  chip contact in the turning process.

To predict tool X  X hip contact length, two independent data sets were obtained on the basis of measurements: training data set and testing data set. Cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut are used as independent input variables, while contact length is the dependent output variable. An equation for contact length was developed on the basis of training data set and the accuracy of obtained model was proved on the testing data set by using fitness functions. The results obtained from presented model were also compared with results of other previous studies on tool X  X hip contact length. The overview of the methodology used in this paper is shown in Fig. 2 . 2. Material and methods 2.1. Genetic programming
Genetic algorithms (GA) are generally used as an optimization technique to search the global optimum of a function. However, this is not the only possible use for GA. Other fields of applications where robustness and global optimization are needed could also benefit greatly from GA. The two most important alternative domains applying GA are genetic based machine learning (GBML) and genetic programming (GP) ( Settea and Boullart, 2001 ). computer programs, while a GA usually operates on (coded) strings of numbers a GP has to operate on members. GP allows, in comparison with GA, the optimization of much more compli-cated structures and can therefore be applied to a greater diversity of problems ( Koza, 1992 ). A schematic overview of GP model application is given in Fig. 3 . The following steps are performed in each stage of programming. (III) Replacing the current population by a new population by (IV) Return to step 2.
 solves the problem. Possible solutions in GP are all the possible computer programs that can be composed in a recursive manner from a set of function genes F  X  { f 1 , f 2 , y , f m }, where m is the number of function genes, and the set of terminal genes T  X  { a , a 2 , y , a n }, where n is the number of terminal genes. Each individual function f i from the set F has a certain number of arguments z ( f i ). The appropriate number of arguments for func-tion genes from the set F is thus determined with the list { z ( f z ( f 2 ), y , z ( f m )}. The set of function genes F can include basic mathematical functions, Boolean functions, relation functions, program flow control functions, functions for recursion, and functions defined with respect to the problem area studied. The set of terminal genes T can include numerical constants, logical constants, variables, etc. Terminal genes are, in fact, function genes without arguments. An example of such a tree using the F and T is given in Fig. 4 .

The initial population is obtained with the randomly creation of members by the use of available function genes from the set F and the available terminal genes from the set T . Each member of generation represents a random point in the searching space.
The creation of the initial population is a blind random search for solutions in the huge space of possible solutions. The next step is the calculation of adaptation of individuals to the environment (i.e., calculation of fitness for each member of generation). Fitness is a guideline for modifying the structures undergoing adaptation.
In GP, the computer programs change, in particular, with two genetic operations: reproduction and crossover. The reproduction operation gives a higher probability of selection to more success-ful organisms. They are copied unchanged into the next genera-tion. The crossover operation ensures the exchange of genetic material between the offsprings. Fig. 5 shows the crossover operation of two parents chromosomes consisting of several function and terminal genes and mutation operation for a parent.
After finishing the first cycle which includes: (I) creation of initial population, (II) calculation of fitness for each individual of the population, and (III) genetic modification of contents of the computer programs, an iterative repetition of points 2 and 3 fol-lows. After a certain number of generations, the newly born off springs are usually much better adapted to the environment.
The meaning of the environment depends on the problem dealt with. The evolution is terminated when a termination criterion is fulfilled. This can be a prescribed number of genera-tions or sufficient quality of the solution. Since evolution is a non-deterministic process, it does not end with a successful solution in each run. In order to obtain a successful solution, the problem must be processed in several independent runs. The number of runs required for the satisfactory solution depends on the difficulty of the problem ( Brezocnik et al., 2004 ).
In this paper, for determination of the relationship between cutting parameters and tool X  X hip contact length, a genetic equa-tion with genetic programming has been developed. On the base of experimental data and with the selection of adequate arith-metic operations, the genetic equation for the tool X  X hip contact length was developed as:
L  X  LV , f , d  X  X  X  1  X 
L is a function which relates input parameters of V , cutting speed, f , feed rate, and d , depth of cut, to output parameter. The evolutionary parameters for the determination of the GP equation were population size M s  X  30 and number of generations G  X  2000.
The GP operations such as crossover and mutation must be con-sidered also, therefore the mutation rate is selected p m and crossover rate is selected p c  X  0.1. Moreover, arithmetic operations set as below: F  X f X  , , x = sqrt , x 2 , x 3 g X  2  X  2.2. Experimental work
All the experimental tests were performed on a CNC lathe machine and under dry conditions. To decrease the variation of cutting speed across the cutting edge, a large diameter workpiece were used. In order to establish the genetic equation, different values of cutting speed, v , feed rate, f , and depth of cut, d , were selected based on Taguchi and response surface methodology from values illustrated in Table 1 . Commercially available uncoated cemented carbide insert (TIZIT, TNMA220408, grade P20) were used in these tests. In order to make comparison with other researches, which has done in this field, AISI 4140 were selected as a workpiece material. For the measurement of the contact length, cutting inserts were examined using an optical microscope equipped with image processing software. Moreover, to be able to compare proposed model in this paper with other models, chip compression ratio, a 1 = a , in which a is undeformed chip thickness and a1 is actual chip thickness, was needed. So, in the specified cutting parameters of depth of cut 1.5 mm and feed rate 0.07 mm/rev and variable cutting speeds, thickness of actual chip was measured by a micrometer and then chip compression ratio was calculated for each set of experiments. This ratio is used in initializing previously mentioned models for the tool X  X hip contact length. Cutting parameters which are used for cutting experiments have been shown in Table 2 . In addition, in order to determine the correctness of obtained genetic equations, a series of test experiments were also carried out in different cutting parameters which has been shown in Table 3 . 2.3. Fitness functions
The accuracy of the developed equations was analyzed in terms of two statistical measures. These measures are the root-mean-square error, RMSE, and absolute fraction of variance, R which are defined as below:
RMSE  X 
R  X  1 where n is the number of data points, Y predicted,m and Y indicate the predicted value and the target value from experi-mental data, respectively, of one data point m. RMSE indicates the deviation between the experimental and predicted values. A very good fit yields R 2 value of 1, where as a poor fit results in a value near zero. Based on values obtained for RMSE and R 2 , the best operation for genetic programming will be selected.
 3. Results length and cutting parameters in turning process of AISI 4140 we developed the genetic equation with GP. In this order, the independent variables must be set as L  X  { V , f , d } where V is cutting speed, f is feed rate and d is the depth of cut. Arithmetic operations set as described in methods section. The best GP model using arithmetic functions according to Eq. (2) for tool X  X hip contact length was obtained as below:
L c  X  d 89 : 935 V
The values of RMSE and R 2 for selected genetic equation were obtained by described fitness functions as shown in Table 4 . 4. Discussion
In this paper, the length of the tool X  X hip contact is calculated by Eq. (5) . Results of this equation were compared with some other models proposed by previous researchers. The models which were used to make comparison are as below: The model of Poletika:
L  X  a 2 : 05 : c 0 : 55  X  X  X  6  X  The model of Abuladze:
L  X  2 a c  X  1 tan  X  a  X  X  X  sec a  X  X  7  X  And the model of Toropov:
L  X  2 a 1  X  8  X  The model of Marinov:
L  X  1 : 61 a 1 0 : 28 a  X  9  X 
In which a is undeformed chip thickness, a 1 is actual chip thickness, c is chip compression ratio, and a is rake angle. Fig. 7 shows the variation of chip compression ratio with the cutting speed in specified cutting condition according to results obtained from experiments.

The values of RMSE and R 2 were estimated to compare the precision of Eq. (5) with Eqs. (6) X (9) in feed rate 0.07 mm/rev and depth of cut 1.5 mm. Table 5 shows the RMSE and R 2 values obtained for these equations.

Considering the values given in Table 5 , it can be said that the genetic equation for tool X  X hip contact length presented in this study corresponds well with experimental data in given range of cutting parameters. In Fig. 6 , the accuracy of various models has been compared with results obtained from experiments ( Fig. 7 ).
The variation of the contact length with the cutting speed has been shown in Fig. 6 . This length shows a decreasing trend with increasing cutting speed. A similar trend was reported by Sadik and Lindstorm (1993) for turning SS1572 (0.35% C, quenched and tempered) steel, by Marinov (1999) for turning AISI 1020 at low and medium cutting speed and by Sutter (2005) for cutting XC18 (0.18% C) steel at very high speeds using ballistic machining setup. This can be contributed to the tribological phenomena along the tool X  X hip interface. Any increase in the cutting velocity leads to a reduction of the cutting forces. This decrease is due to the thermal softening effect (reduction of the material flow stress with temperature) and the decay of the apparent friction coeffi-cient, m ,( Bahi et al., 2011 ). The decrease of the apparent friction coefficient, m , in terms of cutting speed, leads to a decay of the contact length.

According to experimental results, increasing the feed rate corresponds with increasing in the tool X  X hip contact length.
There is an explanation for this change. As the feed rate increases, increased chip thickness and cutting forces are encountered ( Marinov, 1999 ). Thicker chips are more difficult to deform and hence associated with increased contact length. Similar variation was observed by Iqbal et al. (2007) for turning AISI 1045. It can be concluded that the contact length increases with the increasing undeformed chip thickness (or chip compression ratio). Chip compression ratio is an important parameter in evaluating the heat produced in machining and approximating the degree of the efficiency of chip formation ( Flom et al., 1984 ). A lower value of chip compression ratio leads to a higher shear angle, which in turn, leads to lower strain in the chip and reduced energy consumption. 5. Conclusion
In this paper, using GP methodology, a new model for tool X  chip contact length in terms of cutting parameters was developed. Performed experiments showed a decreasing trend for the contact length with increasing cutting speed and it was due to thermal softening effect. Also noticeable rise was observed in the contact length as feed rate increased because of increasing in chip thickness. Moreover, it was appeared that changes in depth of cut had a trivial effect on the value of contact length.
The results obtained from the proposed GP approach prove its effectiveness. The implication of the encouraging results obtained from the present approach is that such approach can be integrated on-line, with an intelligent manufacturing system for automated process planning. However, presentation of a mathematical equation on the basis of independent input para-meters and dependent output parameters can be considered a great preference. According to the mentioned advantages of GP methodology and its acceptable results, it seems that using this method in machining related problems has more reliable facility precision compared to other complex models.
