 Online user engagement optimization is key to many In-ternet business. Several research areas are related to the concept of online user engagement optimization, including machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, rec-ommender systems, online A/B (bucket) testing and psy-chology. In the past, research efforts in this direction are pursued in separate communities and conferences, yielding potential disconnected and repeated results. In addition, re-searchers and practitioners are sometimes only exposed to a specific aspect of the topic, which might be incomplete and suboptimal to the whole picture. Here, we organize the first workshop on the topic of online user engagement optimization, explicitly targeting the topic as a whole and bring researchers and practitioners together to foster the field. We invite two leading researchers from industry to give keynote talks about online machine learning and online experimentations. In addition, several invited talks from in-dustry and academic researchers have covered the topics of content personalization, online experimental platforms and recommender systems. Also, six novel submissions are in-cluded as short papers in the workshop such that new results are discussed and shared among the workshop.

Online user engagement plays a central role in the busi-ness success of many industry companies that own or operate Web sites, apps, and other online systems, including major This workshop aims to connect academic researchers and industrial practitioners who are working on or interested in online engagement optimization. The goal is to pro-vide a forum for industrial practitioners to expose real-world challenges to academic communities and for academic re-searchers to popularize state-of-art research outcomes to in-dustrial practitioners, and foster collaboration between the two.
One similar workshop in the past is: The First Interna-tional Workshop on Social Media Engagement (SoME 2011) in Hyderabad, India. This is the only previous workshop that has similar goals and topics. However, our proposed workshop would differ from SoME 2011 in several ways. For instance, SoME 2011 focused on the research of the engage-ment in social media context. Also, SoME 2011 does not explicitly focus on the research challenges for building ma-chine learning models for user engagement while this pro-posed workshop explicitly is targeting on those aspects. In particular, our topics about streaming data and how to de-sign effective online experiments are not tackled in SoME 2011. In addition, the format of the proposed workshop is to explicitly bring industrial practitioners and researchers to-gether and listen to each other X  X  perspective on all research issues by having a number of invited talks. Also, a proposed poster session will further boost the discussion on various topics in a more interactive fashion.

For user modeling, there is an established international conference for the topic: The International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP). UMAP has been held for more than 20 times while the lat-est version UMAP 2013 will be held in Rome, Italy in June, 2013. In general, UMAP is tackling similar topics as our proposed workshop. The conference spans a wide scope of topics related to user modeling and personalization, includ-ing construction of user models, adaptive responses, tailor-ing of search results, recommending products, Web usage mining, collaborative and content-based filtering. Yet, our proposed workshop distinguishes from UMAP significantly. For instance, UMAP tries to attract computer scientists, sociologists, information scientists and all other related re-searchers together, forming a forum to any research work concerning users while we focus on the aspect of engage-ment optimization solely. Also, we concentrate on metrics and data mining/machine learning techniques on the sub-jective, which is not addressed as a venue in the past.
