 assume that at least simple visual stimuli are processed, tr ansformed and compared to some inter-nal reference in a metric space. In cognitive psychology man y models of human categorisation, too, assume that stimuli  X  X imilar X  to each other are grouped together in categories. Within a cat-egory similarity is very high whereas between categories si milarity is low. This coincides with intuitive notions of categorization which, too, tend to rel y on similarity despite serious problems in defining what similarity means or ought to mean [6]. Work on similarity and generalization in psychology has been hugely influenced by the work of Roger She pard on similarity and categoriza-tion [12, 14, 11, 4, 13]. Shepard explicitly assumes that sim ilarity is a distance measure in a metric space, and many perceptual categorization models follow Sh epard X  X  general framework [8, 3]. This notion of similarity is frequently linked to a geometri c representation where stimuli are points in a space and the similarity is linked to an intuitive metric on this space, e.g. the Euclidean metric. In a well-known and influential series of papers Tversky and c olleagues have challenged the idea of a geometric representation of similarity, however [16, 17] . They provided convincing evidence that (intuitive, and certainly Euclidean) geometric represent ations cannot account for human similarity judgements X  X t least for the highly cognitive and non-perceptual stimuli they employed in their studies. Within their experimental context pairwise dissi milarity measurements violated metricity, in particular symmetry and the triangle inequality. Techni cally, violations of Euclideanity translate into non positive semi-definite similarity matrices ( X  X seu do-Gram X  matrices) [15], a fact, which imposes severe constraints on the data analysis procedures . Typical approaches to overcome these problems involve leaving out negative eigenvalues altoget her or shifting the spectrum for subsequent (Kernel-)PCA analysis [10, 7]. The shortcomings of such met hods are that they assume that the data really are Euclidean and that all violations are only due to n oise.
 Shepard X  X  solution to non-metricity was to find non-linear t ransformations of the similarity data of the subjects to make them Euclidean, and/or use non-Eucli dean metrics such as the city-block metric (or other Minkowski p-norms with p 6 = 2 )[11, 4]. Yet another way how metric violations may arise in experimental data X  X hilst retaining the notion that the internal, mental representation is really metric X  X s to invoke attentional re-weighting of d imensions during similarity judgements and categorisation tasks [1]. Here we develop a position in b etween the seeming dichotomy of  X  X etric versus non-metric X  internal representations: Our alternative and complementary suggestion is that a potentially very small subset X  X n fact a single obse rvation or data point or stimulus X  X f the data may induce the non-metricity, or at least a non-Eucl idean metric: in a theoretical setting it has been shown that systematic violation of metricity can be due to an interesting subset of the data X  X .e. not due to noise [5]. We show how conflictual judgments can introduce metric violation in a situation where the human similarity judgments are base d upon smooth geometric features and are otherwise essentially Euclidean.
 First we present a simple model which explains the occurrenc e of metric violations in similarity data, with a special focus on human similarity judgments. Thereaf ter both models are tested with data obtained from psychophysical experiments specifically des igned to induce conflictual judgments . A dissimilarity function d is called metric if: d ( x dissimilarity matrix D = ( D D = ( D ij ) will be called squared Euclidean if the metric derives from l 2 .
 It can be shown that D is l be the projection matrix on the orthogonal complement of e = (1 , 1 , . . . 1) 0 ). C is called the Gram matrix. An indefinite C will be called a pseudo-Gram matrix . A non-metric D is, a fortiori, non l and thus its associated C is indefinite. On the other hand, when C is indefinite, we can conclude that D is non l above four requirements.
 We now introduce a simple model for conflictual human similar ity. Let { f A given data point x between x assumes constant feature-perception, i.e. a constant ment al image with respect to different tasks. In the realm of human perception this is not always the case, a s illustrated by the following well known ambiguous figure (Fig. 1). We hypothesise that the ambi guous perception of such figures corresponds to some kind of  X  X erceptual state-switching X . If the state-switching could be experi-mentally induced within a single experiment and subject, th is may cause metric or at least Euclidean violations by this conflictual judgment .
 A possible way to model such conflictual situations in human s imilarity judgments is to introduce ment between objects then depends on the perceptual state (w eight) the subject is in. Assuming that With no further restriction this model yields non-metric di stance matrices.  X  may vary between different subjects reflecting their differ ent focus of attention, thus we will not average the similarity judgments over different subjects b ut only over different trials of one single subject, assuming that for a given person  X  is constant.
 In order to interpret the metric violations, we propose the f ollowing simple algorithm, which allows to specifically visualize the information coded by the negat ive eigenvalues. It essentially relies upon Figure 1: Left: What do you see? A young lady or an old woman? If you were to compare this picture to a large set of images of young ladies or old women, t he perceptual state-switch could induce large individual weights on the similarity. Right: S imple data distribution (left) used in the proof of concept illustration in subsection 2.1. the embedding of non-metric pairwise data into a pseudo-Euc lidean space (see [2, 9] and references therein for details): where V is the column matrix of eigenvectors,  X  the diagonal matrix of the corresponding eigenval-ues and M the block-matrix consisting of the blocks I The columns of X  X  Retaining only the first two coordinates ( P = { v projection onto the first two leading eigendirections. Reta ining the last two ( P = { v projection onto the last two eigendirections: This corresponds to a projection onto directions related to the negative part of C and containing the information coded by the l 2.1 Proof of concept illustration: single conflicts introdu ce metric violations We now illustrate the model for a single conflictual situatio n.
 Then we have d usual unweighted Euclidean norm.
 For a simple illustration we take 16 points distributed in tw o Gaussian blobs (Fig. 1, right) with squared Euclidean distance given by d mental subject is to pairwise compare these objects to give i t a dissimilarity score and that a con-these dissimilarities. For the sake of the example, we chose the (largely exaggerated) weights to be d (6 , 5) = d 2 (6 , 5)  X  220 . The corresponding d is non-Euclidean and its associated C is indefinite. The spectrum of C is given in Fig. 2, right, and exhibits a clear negative spect rum.
 Fig. 2 shows the projection onto the leading positive and lea ding negative eigendirections of the both the unweighted distance (top row) and the weighted distance matrix (bottom row). Both yield the same grouping in the positive part. In the negative eigenspa ce we obtain a singular distribution for the unweighted case. This is not the case for the weighted dissimilarity: we see that the dist ribution in the negative separates the points whose mutual distance h as been (strongly) weighted. The infor-mation contained in the negative part, reflecting the inform ation coded by metric or l codes in this case for the individual weighting of the (dis)s imilarities. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Figure 2: Proof of concept: Unperturbed dissimilarity matr ix (no conflict) and weighted dissimi-larity matrix (conflict). Single weighting of dissimilarit ies introduce metric violations and hence l violations which reflect in negative spectra. The conflictua l points are peripheral in the projection onto the negative eigenspace centered around the bulk of poi nts whose dissimilarities are essen-tially Euclidean. Note that because of the huge weights, the se effects are largely exaggerated in comparison to real world judgments. Twenty gray-scale 256 x 256 -pixel images of faces were generated from the MPI-face data base 1 . All faces were normalized to have the same mean and standard devi ation of pixel intensities, the same area, and were aligned such that the cross-correlation of ea ch face to a mean face of the database was maximal. Faces were presented at an angle of 15 degrees an d were illuminated primarily with ambient light together with an additional but weak point sou rce at 65 degrees azimuth and 25 degree eccentricity.
 To show the viability of our approach we require a data set wit h a good representation of the notion of facial similarity, and to ensure that the data set encompass es both extremes of (dis-)similarity. In the absence of a formal theory of facial similarity we hand-sele cted a set of faces we thought may show the hypothesised effect: Sixteen of the twenty faces were se lected because prior studies had shown them to be consistently and correctly categorised as male or female [18]. Three of the remaining four faces were females that previous subjects found very di fficult to categorise and labelled them as female or male almost exactly half of the time. The last fac e was the mean (androgynous) face across the database. Figure 3 shows the twenty faces thus sel ected.
 Prior to the pairwise comparisons all subjects viewed all tw enty faces simultaneously arranged in a 4 x 5 grid on the experimental monitor. The subjects were asked to inspect the entire set of faces to obtain a general notion of the relative similarity of the f aces and they were instructed to use the entire scale in the following rating task. Subjects were all owed to view the stimuli for however long they wanted. Only thereafter did they proceed to the act ual similarity rating stage. Pairwise repetitions resulting in a total of 760 trials per subject.
 During the rating stage faces were shown in pairs in random or der for a total duration of 4 seconds (200 msec fade-in, 3600 msec full contrast view, 200 msec fad e-out). Subjects were allowed to respond as fast as the wished but had to respond within 5 secon ds, i.e. 1 second after the faces had disappeared at the very latest. Similarity was rated on a discrete integer scale between 1 (very dissimilar) and 5 (very similar). The final similarity ratin g per subject was the mean of the four repetitions within a single subject. Figure 3: Our data set: Faces 1 to 8 are unambiguous males, faces 9 to 16 are unambiguous females. Faces 17 to 19 are ambiguous and have been attributed to either sex in rough ly half the cases. Face 20 is a mean face.
 All stimuli were presented on a carefully linearised Siemen s SMM21106LS gray-scale monitor with 1024 x 768 resolution at a refresh rate of 130Hz driven by a Cambridge Re search Systems Visage graphics controller using purpose-written softwar e. The mean luminance of the display was 213 cd / m 2 and presentation of the stimuli did not change the mean lumin ance of the display. Three subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision X  naive to the purpose of the experiment X  acted as observers; they were paid for their participation.
 are summarized.
 In order to exhibit how a single conflictual judgment can brea k metricity, we follow a two-fold procedure: we first chose a data set of unambiguous faces whos e dissimilarities are Euclidean or essential Euclidean. Second, we compare this subsets of fac es to a set with those very same unam-biguous males and females extended by one additional conflic t generating face creating (see Figure 4 for a schematic illustration).
 Figure 4: The unambiguous females and unambiguous males lea d to a pairwise dissimilarity ma-trix which is essentially Euclidean. The addition of one sin gle conflicting face introduces the l violations. 3.1 Subject 1 We chose a subset of faces which has the property that their mu tual dissimilarities are essentially Euclidean (Fig. 5). The conflict generating face is 19 and will be denoted as X . Fig. 5 shows that the set of unambiguous faces is essentially Euclidean: the s mallest eigenvalues of the spectrum are almost zero. This reflects in an almost singular projection i n the eigenspace spanned by the eigen-vectors associated to the negative eigenvalues. The projec tion onto the eigenspace spanned by the eigenvectors associated to the positive eigenvalues separ ates males from females which corresponds to the unique salient feature in the data set. . . . . Figure 5: Left: Spectrum with only minor l eigenspace.
 In order to provoke the conflictual situation, we add one sing le conflicting face, denoted by X . This face has been attributed in previous experiences to either s ex in 50 % of the cases. This addition causes the spectrum to flip down, hinting at a unambiguous l conflicting judgment reflecting that violation indeed is met ric in this case. . Figure 6: Left: Spectrum with l X is separated from the bulk of faces corresponding to the Eucl idean dissimilarities.
 The positive projection remains almost unchanged and again separates male from female faces with X in between, reflecting its intermediate position between th e males and the females. In the negative projection the X can be seen as separating of the bulk of points which are mutua lly Euclidean. This corresponds to the effect, albeit not as pronounced, descri bed in the proof of concept illustration 2.1. Thus we see that the introduction of a conflicting face within a coherent set of unambiguous faces is the cause of the metric violation. 3.2 Subject 2 and 3 The same procedure was applied to the similarity judgments g iven by Subject 2 and 3. Since the individual perceptual states are incommensurable between different subjects (the reason why we do not average over subjects but only within a subject) the extr acted Euclidean subset were different for each of them. However, the process which created the l 8 show this process: a conflicting observation destroys the u nderlying Euclidean structure in the judgements.
 Both for Subject 2 and 3 the X lying between the unambiguous faces reflects outside the bul k of Euclidean points concentrated around the singularity in th e negative projections. Figure 7: Subject 2: In the upper row, the subset of faces whic h whose dissimilarities are Euclidean. The lower row shows the effect of introducing a conflicting fa ce X and the subsequent weighting. . . . . . . . . . Figure 8: Subject 3: In the upper row, the subset of faces whic h whose dissimilarities are essentially Euclidean. The lower row shows the effect of introducing a co nflicting face X and the subsequent weighting.
 Again we obtain that the introduction of a single conflicting face within a set of unambiguous faces for which the human similarity judgment is essentially Eucl idean introduces the l strongly corroborates our conflict model and the statement t hat metric violations in human similarity judgments have a specific meaning, a conflictual judgment for this case. We presented a simple experiment in which we could show how a s ingle, purposely selected stimulus introduces l facial attributes. Importantly, thus, it may not be that the re is a clear dichotomy in that internal representations of similarity are either metric or not, rat her that they may be for  X  X asy X  stimuli but  X  X mbiguous X  ones can cause metric violations X  X t least l shown that these violations are caused by conflictual points in a data set: the addition of one such point caused the spectra of the Gram matrices to  X  X lip down X  re flecting the l Further research will involve the acquisition of more pairw ise similarity judgements in conflicting situations as well as the refinement of our existing experime nts. In particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to create larger, scalable conflicts, i.e. conflicts which lead to a much stronger re-weighting and thus to clearer separation of the conflicti ng point from the bulk of Euclidean points.
