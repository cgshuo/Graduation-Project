 We describe WordSeer, a tool whose goal is to help schol-ars and analysts discover patterns and formulate and test hypotheses about the contents of text collections, midway between what humanities scholars call a traditional  X  X lose read X  and the new  X  X istant read X  or  X  X ulturomics X  approach. To this end, WordSeer allows for highly flexible  X  X licing and dicing X  (hence  X  X liding X ) across a text collection. The tool allows users to view text from different angles by selecting subsets of data, viewing those as visualizations, moving lat-erally to view other subsets of data, slicing into another view, expanding the viewed data by relaxing constraints, and so on. We illustrate the text sliding capabilities of the tool with examples from a case study in the field of humanities and social sciences  X  an analysis of how U.S. perceptions of China and Japan changed over the last 30 years.

This paper describes a new tool for exploratory data anal-ysis [3] that attempts to provide frictionless access to text and its metadata. Although many tools have been devel-oped to analyze numerical and categorical data, language in its written form of text has special properties that makes it more difficult to analyze. Text has both linear and hierar-chical structure, its meaning is ambiguous given its repre-sentation, it has tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of features, and frequencies of words are usually distributed via a power law.

Even a small fragment of text does not stand alone, but evokes, in the reader X  X  mind, other texts containing the same can consist of drilling down (narrowing, selecting), or broad-ening (by removing constraints), or following a new thread (moving laterally) or finding related words or sentences (also moving laterally).
In WordSeer, views are window-like panels, and the user can open up any number of panels in the interface to facil-itate comparison across views. Views contain the following components, as illustrated in Figure 1(b): 1) A drop-down menu for switching to a different view of the same slice (see Figure 5), 2) Breadcrumbs describing the searches and filters that de-fine the current slice, 3) A visualization of the data in the slice. Currently, the choices are:  X  A list of sentences,  X  A list of documents that match the sentences in the slice,  X  An interactive Word Tree [4] of the most common word in the slice, or the search term, if specified,  X  Charts showing distributions of the slice X  X  sentence counts across various metadata categories,  X  A document reader,  X  Bar charts showing how often different words in the slice appear in grammatical relations. 4) Summary statistics of:  X  How many sentences within the slice match different metadata categories,  X  The most frequent nouns, verbs, adjectives and multi-word phrases in the slice.

The simplest sliding interaction in WordSeer is creating a different view of the same slice. There is a drop-down menu at the top left corner of each view which provides this function (Figure 5). A history panel allows revisiting of earlier views.

When a user opens up WordSeer for the first time, instead of showing a blank screen a requiring the user to think up a query, the tool provides summary statistics immediately, as shown in Figure 1(a) for the case study. Figure 1(b) breaks this down into its core components. This is a single view with a Word Tree visualization of the most frequent content word ( X  X hina X ) in the slice consisting of  X  X he entire collection X .
The easiest way to make slices in WordSeer is by intersect-ing searches and filters . A search restricts the collection to just the sentences matching the query, and a filter restricts it to just sentences matching a particular metadata value. One of C.F X  X  first goals in the case study was to get a sense of the different ways China was discussed in the  X 80s,  X 90s and  X 00s. To do this, he assembled three slices, one for each decade, by starting with a search for  X  X hina X  (Figure 2) and then filtering the  X  X ear X  category to range over each ten-year period (Figure 6(a)). WordSeer does not require metadata to be numerical ranges, it can also work with categorical values. If he had wanted to, C.F. could have filtered these results to just editorials whose main topic tag was China or Japan, using the controls shown in Figure 6(b).

WordSeer X  X  overviews showed clear differences between the decades. In particular, the increasing frequencies of By traversing these indexes, we can compute the associations for a slice. From a slice, we can query for all the words, phrases, or grammatical relations in the sentences in that slice, and from there, to all the other sentences that contain each particular item.

Grammatical relationships are identified using the Stan-ford dependency parser[1] which extracts many kinds of re-lationships; some of the more easily understood ones include noun compound , where two nouns come together to signify a new concept, adjective modifier where an adjective describes another word, and direct subject in which a word is the agent of a verb.

Each view automatically presents the most common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and phrases (Figure 7), along with their counts in a panel at the bottom.

Individual words are jumping-off points. They can be acted upon wherever they appear via the Word Menu (Fig-ure 3) which enables lateral movement . Any time a user sees a word, they can follow up on it by examining the grammat-ical relations in which it occurs, seeing related words, and creating visualizations of the slice of sentences that contains the word, as well as the slices containing various relation-ships to other words.

The related words option in the Word Menu shows the nouns, verbs, and adjectives that co-occur most frequently with the clicked-on word. For example, if we click on  X  X apan X  and open up the related words (Figure 8) the pop-up shows the words that co-occur most frequently with  X  X apan X  in this collection. Each of these related words can be clicked in turn, opening up a new Word Menu. These menus have the additional option to  X  X ee co-occurences X , as shown in the new Word Menu for  X  X xports X . Selecting that option opens up a new view showing just those sentences in which the two words appear together (in this case,  X  X apan X  and  X  X xports X ).
The word menu reduces friction in both discovery and search. It only takes one menu click to discover that  X  X x-ports X  occurs frequently with  X  X apan X , and only one more to see all the sentences in which  X  X apan X  and  X  X xports X  are mentioned together.
Searches and filters are useful, but cannot always express specific analysis goals. WordSeer therefore allows users to construct custom slices through Word-, Sentence-, and Doc-ument Sets. These custom slices behave like any other slices, [3] J. W. Tukey. Exploratory data analysis. Reading, MA , [4] M. Wattenberg and F. B. Viegas. The word tree, an
