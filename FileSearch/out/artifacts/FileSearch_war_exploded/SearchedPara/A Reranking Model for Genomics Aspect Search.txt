 In this paper, we propose a reranking model to improve the aspect-level performance in the biomedical domain. This model iteratively computes the maximum hidden aspect for every retrieved passage and then reranks these passages from aspect subsets. The experimental results show the improve-ments of the aspect-level performance up to 27.14% for 2006 Genomics topics and 27.09% for 2007 Genomics topics. H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Search and Re-trieval Experimentation Aspect search, Genomics IR, reranking The motivation of the TREC Genomics Track is to pro-pose something in a system that attempts to provide short, specific answers to questions and put them in context by providing linking to original sources [4]. Genomics aspect search will need to not only rate the retrieved passages, but also group them by aspect that all answers inside are sim-ilar. For the TREC 2006 Genomics track, systems were tasked with extracting out passages and grouped them into aspects identified by one or more MeSH terms. The perfor-mance was scored using mean average precision (MAP) at the passage-level, aspect-level and document-level [4]. For the TREC 2007 Genomics track, there was a refinement of evaluation measures used in 2006. A new character-based MAP measure (called Passage2) was added to compare the accuracy of the extracted answers, modified from the origi-nal measure in 2006 (called Passage). The aspect measure remained the same as 2006, except that instead of using assigned MeSH aspects the answer entities assigned by the relevance judges were used [5]. The official evaluation mea-sures indicated, if the aspect-level performance was good, a number of passages with complementary aspect information would be retrieved and ranked highly.

However, there is not too much previous work on Ge-nomics aspect search. In the TREC 2006 Genomics track, University of Wisconsin reranked the passages using a naive clustering-based approach, although its aspect-level perfor-mance was not as good as the original results [3]. Later in the TREC 2007 Genomics track, most teams tried to get aspect-level performance through their passage2-level results, instead of doing something on aspect-level. For ex-ample, National Library of Medicine (NLM) combined re-sources to find passages containing answers to biomedical questions [2]. University of Illinois at Chicago interpreted queries into two types for passage extraction and they kept the same passage ranking list for aspect search [7].
In this paper, we focus on improving aspect search per-formance using a reranking aspect model. The central idea of the model is to compute the maximum probability of its hidden aspect for each retrieved passage iteratively until all aspect subsets achieve stability, and then rerank these pas-sages from different aspect subsets. In a series of experi-ments, with different tuning constant values of the Okapi system, all results show the improvements of aspect-level MAP performance for both 2006 and 2007 topics. In this section, a reranking aspect model is proposed to cal-culate the hidden aspects 1 of the retrieved passages. In the model, we build up a keyword sample space for every topic and present the passages using those keywords. Then pas-sages are iteratively grouped into different subsets according to their hidden aspect estimations. Finally a reranking list is generated from different aspect subsets.
 For each topic, the system outputs N retrieved passages. Each passage can be expressed by x i as a vector and the retrieved results for each topic can be presented as a matrix X . Topics and the retrieved passages are represented as the keyword sequences. As follows t shows a topic where w stands for a keyword.

 X  is a set of aspects with  X  = {  X  1 ,  X  2 , ...,  X  l } , where every  X  ( j = 1 , 2 , ..., l ) is a hidden aspect vector. Let us assume  X  is subjected to the Poisson distribution and each  X  j is independent. As the input, the probability of x i is known based on the Okapi auto-system results [6].
An hidden aspect is a vector which includes different char-acteristics of the retrieved passage.
The maximum probability of aspect  X  1 j for the 1st itera-tion is estimated by Equation 8 according to the posterior probabilities of  X  j given x i . The posterior probability is pre-sented by Equation 7 which can be interpreted by P ( x i |  X  because P (  X  j ) and P ( x i ) are known.
Initially we set k = N in Equation 9 so that each retrieved passage corresponds to one of these N aspects. After the computation of Equation 8, a new k value is generated and each passage is assigned to the subset which has the same estimation parameter  X  1 j . This aspect computation process is repeated until there are no passages moved among the subsets. As follows are the final aspect set and passages { x j 1 , x j 2 , ..., x jq } in each subset  X  p j after p iterations.
For reranking results,  X  p +1 is generated by sorting  X  p cording to its value v j . We choose the top passage in  X  as the first one and select the second one from  X  p +1 2 . This reranking process is repeated until all the passages are cho-sen from the above k subsets. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the effec-tiveness of the proposed model on the 2006 and 2007 TREC Genomics data sets. The aspect-level performance for the original results and reranking results is presented in Table 1 and 2. The first and second columns are Okapi tuning constant values for k 1 and b . The fourth and fifth columns describe the aspect-level MAP performance for the original and reranking results. The last column shows the relative rate of improvement over the original result. To illustrate the reranking performance graphically, we re-plot the data in Figure 1, in which the y-axis shows the retrieval perfor-mance in terms of aspect-level MAP. From Figure 1, we can see that almost all the reranking results from five different parameter settings are much better than the original results.

Table 2: Aspect-Level MAP Performance 2006 The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we pro-pose a reranking model for Genomics aspect search. We build up this model by generating the aspect subsets through iteratively computing the maximum probability of the hid-den aspect for each passages and reranking the results based on these aspect subsets. Second, the exact number of k aspect subsets for each topic is decided dynamically when there are no passages moved among the subsets. Third, the experimental results on both 2006 and 2007 Genomics data sets show the improvements of aspect-level MAP per-formance and the stability of the proposed model.
