 The XPDL specification uses XML as the mechanism for process definition inter-in a form that supports automated manipulation, such as modeling, or enactment by a workflow management system. The process definition consists of a network of activi-applications and data, etc [1] . 
The UML activity diagram also can create business process model in forms of sets map the business process model represented by the standard UML activity diagram to UML activity diagram can not be directly associated to entities defined in the process definition. Hence the paper will propose a method of generating an XPDL document from a business process model represented by an extended activity diagram. late works. The third section describes the XPDL document structure and entity defi-mapping from the business process model represented by extended activity diagram to conclusion and future work. The references will be listed in the end. tools or workflow systems, there must be a common interchange standard existing for mechanism for process definition interchange. XPDL specification provides the work-terface also defines a formal separation between the development and run-time envi-ronments, enabling a process definition, generated by one modelling tool, to be used as input to a number of different workflow run-time products [5] . 
A business process model can be expressed conveniently by using the UML activ-proposed in the fourth section. The content of a XPDL document mainly describes Process Definition(s). The top-level entities are contained within a process definition[7]. The top-level entities are: Workflow Process Definition : The Process Definition entity provides contextual information that applies to other entities within the process. Workflow Process Activity : An activity represents work, which will be processed by a combination of resource specified by partic ipant assignment and/or computer applica-tions specified by application assignment. Transition Information : Activities are related to one another via flow control condi-tions. Each individual transition has three elementary properties, the from-activity, the to-activity and the condition under which the transition is made. act as the performer of the various activities in the process definition. humans, programs, or machines. Workflow Application Declaration : This provides descriptions of the IT applications automate, the processing associated with each activity, and identified within the activ-ity by an application assignment attribute(s). process instance during process execution. management system or the local system environment Data Types and Expressions : The meta-model (and associated XPDL) assumes a data types are relevant to workflow relevant data, system or environment data or par-ticipant data. 
According to the descriptions of the top-level entities in process definition, a busi-formation X  entity. The task of the mapping from business process model represented by the UML activ-ment structure. Considering that one  X  X ctivity X  element in UML activity diagram can different types of activities which can be directly related to the  X  X egular X  three differ-between the elements of extended activity diagram and entities defined in XPDL. 
Fig. 1 presents a process called  X  X Order X  wh ich is used to present an electrical or-der process. 4.1 The Mapping of  X  X tart State X  Element and  X  X nd State X  Element The  X  X tart state X  and  X  X nd state X  element can be mapped to the  X  X oute activity X  entity defined in XPDL. A route activity has neither a performer nor an application and its  X  X Order X  process model. 4.2 The Mapping of Activity Element mapped to  X  X egular X  activity entities with three different implementation types which are defined in XPDL:  X  X o Implementation X ,  X  X ool X , and  X  X ubflow X  respectively. Fig. 3 shows XPDL representations of activities in the  X  X Order X  process.  X  X o Implementation X  type means that the implementation of this activity is not sup-type means that the activity is implemented by (one or more) tools. A tool may be an application program.  X  X ubflow X  type means that the activity is refined as a subflow. 4.3 The Mapping of Synchronization Element A synchronization element can be mapped to a route activity with  X  X ransition Restric-tion X  attribute with kind of  X  X oin X  or  X  X plit X , which is defined in XPDL Fig. 4 shows synchronization element in the  X  X Order X  process. 4.4 The Mapping of Decision Element A decision element can be mapped to a route activity entity with transition restriction of split kind with XOR type, which is defined in XPDL. Fig. 5 shows the XPDL rep-resentation of  X  X heck Order Type X  decision element in the  X  X Order X  process. 4.5 The Mapping of Transition Element A transition element can be mapped to a transition entity defined in XPDL. The tran-XPDL representations of all transition elements in the  X  X Order X  process. model represented by extended activity diagram to XPDL document. The complete structure of XPDL document and the related detail information about associated XPDL entity definitions should be referred to in XPDL specification. Fig. 7 presents a demonstration of the implementation of automatic XPDL document generation corre-sponding to the method. model represented by extended activity diagram to XPDL document and provide the implementation for that approach. 
The approach proposed in this paper provides the important guidance for the map-ping from other similar business process models, which are used in different software products, to XPDL document. The approach can successfully generate XPDL docu-ment from business process model presented by UML activity diagram. Now the implementation still can not generate the complete XPDL document from business process model presented by UML activity diagram because the XPDL document contains some data information that can no t be obtained directly from the UML activ-ity diagram. Therefore, In the future it is necessary to improve the implementation for the complete XPDL document generation.
