 H.3.3 [ Information Storage &amp; Retrieval] : Information Search &amp; Retrieval Keywords -News, Blogs, Social Media Over the last few years both availability and accessibility of current news stories on the Web have dramatically improved [3]. In pa rtic-ular, users can now access news from a variety of sources host ed on the Web, from newswire presences such as the New York Times , to integrated news search within Web search engines. Howeve r, of central interest is the emerging impact that user-generate d content (UGC) is having on this online news landscape. Indeed, the em er-gence of Web 2.0 has turned a static news consumer base into a dynamic news machine, where news stories are summarised and commented upon. In summary, value is being added to each news story in terms of additional content.

Importantly, however, while there has been movement in com-mercial circles to exploit this extra value to enrich online news [5], there has been little research from the academic community o n how can be achieved. Indeed, the main purpose of this thesis is to re-search practical techniques for the integration of UGC to im prove the news search component of the most ubiquitous of Web tools , i.e the Web search engine. Importantly, we identify the foll owing three key aspects of news search which might be improved thro ugh the application of UGC.

Intuitively, the first task that the news vertical search asp ect of a Web search engine needs to accomplish when confronted with a user query is to decide whether the query is in fact news-rela ted, and hence requires news content to be included. However, que ries themselves are sparse in nature, being often comprised of on e of two tokens only. This presents issues when performing query clas-sification, as there are few features to distinguish the news related queries. We attest that UGC can help alleviate this ambiguit y. In-deed, we hypothesise that there is a strong link between the v olume of UGC content being posted mentioning a query and the likeli hood of that query being news-related within a specific timeframe .
Secondly, we consider the task of real-time event detection . It is imperative for search engines to maintain knowledge of the e vents of the moment, such that the results displayed are updated. T radi-tionally, systems have detected new events through the clus tering of newswire articles [1]. However, in the current fast-pace d news search environment where users begin querying for events wi thin a couple of minutes of their occurrence [4], relying on slow ne wswire reporting is unacceptable. On the other-hand, UGC sources s uch as Twitter provide a natural alternative, as the high post rate and pop-ularity of news topics makes a site such as this an ideal mediu m from which to monitor emerging events. Indeed, many paid jou r-nalists maintain personal blogs and other social media acco unts for the reporting of fast-breaking news stories [2].

Lastly, we examine the presentation of results to the user. T he presentation of news articles to satisfy news-searches is g enerally accepted. However, with the ever-increasing pace of news re porting world-wide, there is now no guarantee that a trusted news sou rce will have yet published upon the story. In these cases, one mu st look else-where for content to satisfy the user. We hypothes ise that UGC is ideal for presentation in these cases as the delay betw een an event occurring and commentary appearing in UGC sources l ike Twitter or the Blogosphere is mear minutes. Moreover some in -formation needs cannot be easily solved using newswire arti cles alone. For example, the correct result for the query  X  X urren t news X  would be a list of news stories ranked by their importance for the day in question. This is a difficult ranking problem, as  X  X mpo rtance X  is greatly dependent upon the perspective of the user. In thi s case, one solution might be to leverage  X  X ublic opinion X  as repres ented in UGC, for example by taking  X  X he pulse of the Blogosphere X . In-deed, we have examined such during TREC 2009.

In conclusion, we have identified multiple areas of the news-search process which cannot be satisfied by traditional news wire articles. We hypothesise that the application of user-gene rated con-tent can be leveraged to improve the field of news-search in re lation to the rich and timely information that UGC provides.
