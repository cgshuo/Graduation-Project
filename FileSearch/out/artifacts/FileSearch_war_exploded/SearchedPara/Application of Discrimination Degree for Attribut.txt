 Formal concept analysis is a mathematical framework developed by Rudolf Wille and his colleagues at Darmstadt/Germany that is useful for representation and analysis of building. So attributes reduction is necessary. This paper presents a new method for the attributes reduction, which based on discrimination degree. 
Inclusion degree theory has been proposed by Professor Wen-Xiu Zhang ten years method and so on. Thus it provides a general principle for the uncertain inference. In mathematics theory. In some domains, such as artificial intelligence, expert system and rough set, the theory has been applied [8, 9]. Moreover, formal concept analysis is also an ordered mathematics theory. Inclusion de gree has been brought into formal concept analysis in literature [8, 10]. 
After researching inclusion degree from the literature [7], we present discrimination reduction algorithm that based on the new theory. The paper is organized as follows: discrimination degree is presented, the complementary relation with inclusion degree is based on the new degree is indicated, and we get a conclusion that reduction can make which didn X  X  reduce attributes. Section 5 is the conclusion and future work. 2.1 Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) Bases [1] relation I between G and M . The elements of G are called the objects and the as  X  X he object g has the attribute m  X . Definition 2. For a set AG  X  of objects we define : A  X  = { | mMgIm  X  for all which have all attributes in B ). 
AG  X  , BM  X  , AB  X  = and BA  X  = . We call A the extent and B the intent of the concept (, ) AB . corresponding object concept as: :({},{}) ggg  X   X  X   X  = % . In the same way, for mM  X  ,  X  , and all attribute concepts compose () M  X  . 2.2 Inclusion Degree contained in another set [7]. by set B is called an inclusion degree, denoted as (/) DB A = conditions: (2) (/) DB A =1 if and only if AB  X  ; (4) For  X  C , (/) DAC  X  (/) DB C if and only if AB  X  . and (4) show the monotone, it is to say that a smaller set is more easily contained by other sets than a larger set. 3.1 Definition of Discrimination Degree Definition 6. The discrimination degree D between two sets is defined as the degree of one set differentiates from the other set. is called a discrimination degree, denoted as (/) DB A = conditions: (2) (/) DB A =0 if and only if AB  X  ; which accords with people habit. Example. X is a finite set, subsets ,, ABC X  X  , Records X ={x1,x2,x3,x4, x5,x6,x7}, A ={x1,x2,x3,x4}, B ={x3,x4,x5,x6,x7}, C ={x1,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7}. From the above definition, (/) DC A = degrees; And (/) DC A = degrees; C is the complement set of C . After calculating, we have (/) DC A =3/4, (/) DB A =2/4; BC  X  , (/) DC B =1; complementarity of two degrees; for BC  X  , (/) DC B =0 satisfies Condition (2), and (/) DC A &lt; (/) DB A satisfies Condition (4). 3.2 The Significance of Discrimination Degree cognitive process. For example, children know that apples and oranges are juicy, sweet and have delicious flavor. They can distinguish potato out from fruit. But it can X  X  be accomplish only by the common characters such as juicy, sweet and delicious flavor when people divide apples and oranges from a heap mixture of apples and oranges. So combined. Another example is to identify twin brothers, we can easily identify that they come from the same family (by inclusion degree), then distinguish their differences (by discrimination degree), compare them by the memory features (in the formal context), we will be able to tell who is the elder and who is the younger (classification). 
The two examples above show the importance of differences among the concepts, improve classification accuracy and supplement to inclusion degree theory by using the new degree. 3.3 Concept Formation Theorem Based on Discrimination Degree Theorem. Given a formal context :(, ,) KGMI = , for gG  X  X  and mM  X  X  , then the second section can be proved in the same way.
 constitute a new concept. 3.4 The Relationship Between Discri mination Degree and Discernibility Matrix some reduction is implemented by the matrix in FCA. Based on the differences among concepts we present discrimination degree. So we research on the two theories to find their relations. The discernibility matrix number of objects in the formal context. And discrimination degree here is: (/) DB A = elements sets, and B represents the complement set of B . object i g . Using discrimination degree, we get ij C by: thus the formation of concept nodes and lattice construction can be simplified. Following is the algorithm: Step1: Each element of discernibility matrix is obtained by: Step2: Disjunctive logic expressions are composed by elements which are nonempty Step3: All the disjunctive logic expressions ij L intersect to get Step4: Then L is transformed to the disjunctive normalize formulation i Step5: According to the result of reduction, concepts are formed based on the concept Step6: Concept lattice is built according to the algorithm given in literature [13]. 
Table 1 is a formal context about biology field, for convenient, objects are recorded land; nc X  X eeds chlorophyll; 2lg X 2 leaf germination; 1lg X 1 leaf germination; mo X  X s motile; lb X  X as limbs; sk X  X uckles young) are recorded as {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i}. Through the beginning three steps, we have the following: =h  X  (c  X  h)  X  (b  X  c  X  h  X  i)  X  (d  X  f  X  g)  X  (c  X  d  X  f  X  g)  X  (b  X  c  X  d  X  e  X  g) attributes that can be omitted; Step4: The output is L  X  =bchef  X  bched  X  bcheg  X  bchf  X  bchfd  X  bchfg=bchf  X  Step5: We choose (b,c,e,h,g) to form con cept nodes according to the concept formation Step6: Building concept lattice, as Fig.2. Without attributes reduction, there are 19 concept nodes and 30 lines in Fig.1. But in Fig.2, we reduce the formal context firstly , then 14 concept nodes are formed according Moreover the concept nodes (6, bc) and (4, cgh) can be removed, while 4 correlative Fig. 1. Concept lattice without reduction Fig. 2. Concept lattice based on reduction be identified only Frog in Fig.2. By comparison, the complication of lattice building is greatly simplified after reduction but the key information is retained. relationship between the discrimination degree and discernibility matrix was explained. lattices. 
At information age, intelligence and high efficiency of information processing have topic in the study [9, 14]. Moreover, the discrimination degree theory need to further information are future work. Acknowledgement. This paper is supported by Natural Science Foundation of Gansu, China.
