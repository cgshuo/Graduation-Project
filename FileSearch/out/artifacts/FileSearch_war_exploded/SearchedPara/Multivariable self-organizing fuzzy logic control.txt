 1. Introduction
In multivariable fuzzy logic control systems, the high dimen-sionality of the relational matrix ( Liu, 2003 ; Scherer, 2009 ) leads not only to computational difficulties but also to memory overload ( Watkins, 1995 ). Hence, it is important to simplify these systems by extracting the main input X  X utput mappings, and to develop a corresponding controller for every input and output mapping to avoid the problem of fuzzy rule explosion ( Jeon and Lee, 1995 ). In the general structure of decoupled control, traditional multiple Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) or
Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) sys are designed as dominating controllers to deal with each degree of freedom from each single independent loop; while appropriate compensators are incorpo-rated to counteract the residual interactions between the various channels according to the characteristics of the system X  X  interaction.

A significant amount of work has already been carried-out around the architectures of Single-Output fuzzy logic dominating controllers. Self-Organizing Fuzzy Logic Control (SOFLC) based approach rewards the time-delay inherent inside SOFLC. More recently, neural-network based self-organizing systems seem to have retained the attraction of relating such self-organizing architectures to mathematical formulations and analyses tools more easily ( Kumar et al., 2007 ; Quek et al., 2009 ). However, such hybrid structures do generally compromise the overall system X  X  transparency, a feature which is paramount to fuzzy logic driven systems as they strive and usually succeed in translat-ing  X  X atural language X  (expert knowledge) into a mathematical model.

The dominating controllers X  design faces the limitations as well since the interactions are unclear or unpredictable in most cases. Dealing with each degree of freedom without consideration of the interactions is one possible way to simplify the problem ( Moon and Lee, 2003 ). It is feasible when the sub-systems are loosely interacted. Steady-state compensators ( Bristol, 1966 )in the form of relative gain arrays (RGA) are valuable and widely used tools for eliminating undesirable pairings between channels, especially effective for linear multivariable processes. Neverthe-less, steady-state tools cannot provide direct information about control performance, especially when they ignore the dynamics of the closed-loop system. Hence, off-line pre-design using trial-and-error provides one possibility of improving the control performance ( Mollov and Babuska, 2004 ). However, unpredicted interaction will undoubtedly degrade the control performance since the system cannot cope with changes in system dynamics adequately. The inclusion of an on-line adjustment scheme helps to tackle this problem and such related work can be found in
Bagheri and Moghaddam (2009) , Liu (2003) , Ma (2007) , Nounou and Rehman (2007) , and Perez et al. (2007 ). The on-line optimi-zation strategies include Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) ( Perez et al., 2007 ), adaptive scheme ( Bagheri and Moghaddam, 2009 ; Liu, 2003 ), decoupling neural network ( Bagheri and Moghaddam, 2009 ; Ma, 2007 ) and Auto Regression Moving Average (ARMA) model ( Liu, 2003 ). The effectiveness of such on-line adjustment schemes has been demonstrated in simulations or practical environments. However, further improvements can still be made vis-a-vis the learning actions, the adjustment layers, and the set-point tracking speed.

In the light of the above, it can be concluded that further work is still needed to render the decoupled control systems more flexible and model-independent (less constrained). First, the ability of learning the unmodelled system dynamics (such as inaccurate decoupling from the roughly estimated compensating gains, the unpredicted variations of dominating I/O loops) is required for such further improvements, at least as far as tracking effectiveness with a low computational burden and even with the conditions of being free of any system model are concerned; secondly, almost all previous work considered the main controller and the compensator as two main separate components, without any inherent synergy between them.

Therefore, a new decoupled control structure for multivariable systems is proposed and developed in this paper. The SOFLC architecture is applied for the dominating controller design due to the merits discussed above. In order to avoid the limitations emanating from the pre-designed fixed Performance Index table which is included in the SOFLC architecture, the idea of a  X  X ynamic (on-line evolving) Performance Index table X  is explored. In the compensator controller, the steady-state Relative Gain
Array (RGA) is used to measure the interactions between chan-nels. Specifically, in order to improve the tracking performance, an on/off switching mode of the compensators, which is deter-mined by the system X  X  instant tracking information, is also proposed.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , a standard RGA based decoupled control system is described. 3. The dominating controller: a new self-Organizing fuzzy logic controller using a dynamic performance index table 3.1. System architecture
The SOFLC architecture proposed by Procyk and Mamdani (1979 ) includes two basic levels: the first level is a simple fuzzy controller, whereas the second level consists of the self-organiz-ing mechanism, acting as a monitor and an evaluator of the low-level controller performance. The self-organizing part consists of three main blocks: a performance measure, a model estimator, and a rule modification. The measure of system performance represents a critical step in producing a successful  X  X earning X  controller. Usually, two physical features, including the system output Error ( E ) and the Error Change ( CE ) are measured to evaluate the system performance. The performance measure is employed to calculate the correction value, named by P i  X  nT  X  , which is related to each fuzzy rule based on the estimation model.
The block  X  X odel X  is used to transform the performance correction value P i  X  nT  X  to the rule modification Po  X  nT  X  with the relationship between the system output performance and the control input.
For a system that includes a time-lag of m samples, it can be assumed that the control action at the sampling instant  X  nT mT  X  X  has contributed most to the process performance at the sampling instant  X  nT  X . Thus, the rule included reads as follows:
E  X  nT mT  X  -CE  X  nT mT  X  -U  X  nT mT  X  X  P o  X  nT  X  X  3  X  where  X  E  X  is the error and  X  CE  X  is the change of error. The new rules with a new antecedent will be added into the fuzzy rule bank, while rules with a similar antecedent and a different consequent would be used to modify the existing rules in the rule bank.
Obtaining the rule modification P o  X  nT  X  represents the main task that would affect the performance of the closed loop system directly.
It is fair to say that the majority of self-organizing control architec-tures are beset by one overarching problem which is related to the performance index table which guides the process towards generat-ing the (aspired to)  X  X ptimal X  fuzzy rule-base on-line. It is also fair to say that this performance index table has always taken the form of a fixed set of fuzzy rules, which canno t be considered to be  X  X eneric X  to a wide range of processes. In this paper, a model-free Self-Organizing Fuzzy Logic System with a dynamic performance index table (SOFLC-
DPI) is proposed; the system architecture is shown in Fig. 2 .Insteadof the pre-designed and fixed Perfor mance Index table in the self-organizing part  X  X  X , a more flexible structure is designed and updated instantly using an on-line Genetic Algorithms (GA) ( Lu and Mahfouf, 2010 ). At each sampling instant, the new genetic individual with the
Update the performance index table : Once the cell  X  X 44 X  is indexed by the SOFLC algorithm again late r following the control process, the shaded individual  X 0000101 X  for instance, with the highest fitness, will be chosen to produce the modification value. Modify the low-level FLC rules : Cell X32 indexed by E ( nT ) amd
CE ( nT ) is invoked to infer the modification P i ( nT ) for the low level simple fuzzy logic. The shaded individual  X 0000111 X  in set
A, with the highest fitness, will be chosen to produce the modification value. 3.3. Genetic based operations
Among the genetic based operations of this algorithm, fitness evaluation of the individuals is an important factor as far as the speed and the efficiency of the algorithm are concerned, espe-cially without the a priori system model. Limited by on-line applications, only one chromosome from a population is evalu-ated at each sampling instant according to the system perfor-mance. The fitness values of the other chromosomes in the population are then estimated based on their relationships to the current optimal individual. 3.3.1. Performance evaluation
A local criterion is suitable here due to the on-line environment, where considers only the limited neighbor states of the current sampling instant. The assessmen t index can only evaluate the performance of the particular indi vidual at that particular instant, often in binary forms of  X  X ood X  or  X  X ad X ; and it is very likely that a conflicting decision would be given to the same individual during a different sampling interval. To cope with these problems, several improvements were suggested in the past ( Hu et al., 2006 ; Ma et al., of on-line GAs are either based on existing process models, or used to optimize the process model and then calculate the controller output using this optimized system model. A typical application of the local performance assessment was provided by Linkens and Nyongesa (1995 ) using the polarity of the predictive error gradient function to allocate a binary good/bad performance evaluation. The predictive carries-out this task using the reward/penalty mechanism with the idea of  X  X  X einforcement learning X  X .

Since different individuals in one generation represent differ-ent degrees of modification of the low-level fuzzy logic rules, one can infer the possible performance ( Good , Moving Away or Over-
Shoot ) of the individuals I k ( k  X  1, 2, y , i 1, i  X  1, individual I i . With such an inferred performance, a reward or a penalty can be given to each individual; the degree of reward (or punishment) depends on the difference of the particular indivi-dual to the optimal individual I i .

The credit assignment process is outlined in Fig. 5 , where all punishments and rewards work towards making the error con-verge to  X  X  X ero X  X . Some important definitions are given as follows: (1) Increment/decrement : The controlled system output increases/ (2) Little/big/equal : Labels referring to the individuals I (3) Punish : If a particular individual I kjl has to be punished, then (4) Reward : If a particular individual is to be rewarded, then the 3.4. A summary of the algorithm
The operation cycle of SOFLC-DPI for an  X  mT  X  sampling time delayed system can be summarized as follows: (1) M sets of individuals are generated randomly to code the strategy is proposed according to such variable effect that such interactions have on the channels.

A simple estimation on whether the interaction has a positive contribution to the error tracking or not can analyzed as follows:
First, the evaluation for the dominating controller X  X  output can be obtained as follows:
IF ^ E i  X  nT  X  kT  X  o 0 THEN u 0 ii  X  nT  X  o u ii  X  nT  X  is required
ELSE u 0 ii  X  nT  X  4 u ii  X  nT  X  is required for less residual error  X  8  X  _
E  X  nT  X  kT  X  is the predicted tracking error in channel i after k steps from the current sampling instant, which is calculated via Eq. (4).
The applicability of such a simple ( X  X rude X ) estimation emanates from the insensitivity of the dominating controller (SOFLC-DPI) to the performance evaluation; u ii is the dominating controller output in channel i ; u 0 ii is an ideal controller output that can make the system approach the set-point closer.

Secondly, the compensator switching strategy works as fol-lows: if the dominating control signal u ij in the interacting channel j enlarge the difference between u ii and u 0 ii , then the interaction is allowed ;otherwise , the compensating control force u is applied to counteract the interaction imposed by channel j on channel i .

When the compensating controller being designed using the above reasoning, part of its effort is used to cope with the adverse effect of the interactions, while the remaining  X  X onstructive X  interactions are combined with the dominating controller to reduce the tracking error. As a result, one can reduce the required level of the control energy, as well as improve the control effectiveness. This is different from the typical decoupled con-trollers whose objective is to minimize all the interactions of a given system, without any consideration as to whether or not those interactions can be used to enhance the control effort.
It is worth noting that in steady-state, the compensator is always switched-on regardless of the current error tracking status. It aims at dealing with the following situation: when both channels are in their respective steady-states and channel i suffers a sudden change, it is most likely that the interaction effect is large enough to lead to the tracking signal of channel j being further from the set-point, regardless of the interaction polarity.

As a result, the switching strategy of the linguistic compensa-tor, which is used to counteract the interactions imposed by channel j on channel i , can be summarized in Fig. 6 . u jj the dominating control signals in channels j and i . u 0 ii expected control input based on system performance evaluation shown in Eq. (8).

This strategy is based on the assumptions of: the control signal u and u ii provides the same increase/decrease effect on channel i when they have the same polarity. If it is not satisfied, the switching rule of: randomly generated at the initial sampling instant. They both included five equally partitioned fuzzy sets for the tracking error and its trends of the corresponding channel.

The set-points for CO and MAP were square-like but with different time of change in order to show the interactive effects and to demonstrate the compensating ability possessed by the proposed architecture. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 7 .
Fig. 8 shows the compensators X  activation/deactivation history. It can be found that the interactions compensation between chan-nels are often switched off to speed up set-point tracking, especially during the transient period. 5.1. Controller sensitivity to the input/output scaling factors
With respect to the system X  X  sens itivity to the scaling factors X  configuration, the system responses under varied factors were also simulated and analyzed. The experiments for other two types of systems, which are SOFLC-DPI control system with RGA-based scalar compensators and the standard SOLFC control system with RGA based scalar compensators, respectively, were also carried-out for comparison. The response figures are omitted here due to the limited space, however, the largest variations of the scaling factors with control ability, under which the sy stem X  X  performance is acceptable, are outlined in Table 1 .

It can be concluded that, the proposed decoupled system (system 1 in Table 1 ) possesses a lowest sensitivity to the scaling factors due to its on-line learning ability. The distances of the sensitivities between these three systems show that the high robustness to the scaling factor comes mainly from the learning ability of the proposed SOFLC-DPI algorithm. 5.2. Robustness to varying system dynamics
In this section, the system X  X  robustness is tested by varying the 5.3. Robustness to the compensator design
Since the compensators are designed originally around the system steady-state gains, it is very important for the controller to possess the robustness ability to the steady-state gains X  estimation. Four groups of estimation are used to test the robustness, which are: Case 4 : l c 12  X  0 , l c 21  X  0
Here, l n cij is the accurate compensator element used to counteract the interaction from channel j to channel i ; l cij is the actual value used in the simulation cases below. In each case, l c 12 and l changed by a different amount. This variation may reflect an performance index c is defined as follows:
D ~ c  X  c c r c where c r is the index for the referential case. In this study, the system with the response shown in Fig. 6 is taken as the referential system.

Fig. 15 provide the comparison of th e performance indices for three types of control schemes, which are SOFLC-DPI control system with switching mode linguistic compensators, SOFLC-DPI control system with a RGA based scalar compensators and a well-designed fuzzy logic control system with a RGA based scalar compensators ( Nie and Linkens, 1995 ), respectively. The standard SOFLC algorithm does not considered here for index analysis, because the control requirement cannot be satisfied with varied steady state gains. Case 4 for system 2 is omitted here since it is the same control process with that of system 1 under such setting.
 good set-point tracking ability even under conservative system information. A new Self-Organizing Fuzzy Logic Control algorithm (named SOFLC-DPI) was proposed as the dominating controller.
Thereafter, a linguistic compensator was developed with the ability of evaluating the interactions and deciding the compensation status without an exact measurement of the interactions and their effect.
A number of simulations on a two by two drug dynamics model using such a new decoupled architecture were conducted and the results demonstrated the merits of the proposed architecture to improve the system X  X  performances with the following conclusions: 1. The proposed decoupled architecture is robust under various conditions including the system dynamics, the system X  X  input/ output scaling selection and the steady-state gains X  estimation. 2. The dominating controller SOFLC-DPI makes the control sys-tem less dependent on the compensator to eliminate the system interactions than the well-designed fuzzy logic con-troller and the standard SOFLC algorithm, especially when no compensation is provided. 3. The proposed switching mode compensator has advantages over the standard RGA based scaling compensator in improv-ing the system X  X  robustness and the system X  X  response speed.
This is due to the fact that the former compensator works as a bridge between the dominating control loops and the interac-tion loops while the latter works independently from the dominating controllers.
