 Silke Scheible Abstract Although superlatives are commonly used in natural language, so far there has been no large-scale computational investigation of the types of compar-isons they express. This article describes a comprehensive annotation scheme for superlatives, which classifies superlatives according to their surface forms and motivates an initial focus on so-called  X  X  X SA superlatives X  X . This type of superlative comparison is especially suitable for a computational approach because both their targets and comparison sets are explicitly realised in the text, and the proposed annotation scheme offers guidelines for annotating the spans of such comparative elements. The annotations are tested and evaluated on 500 tokens of superlatives with good inter-annotator agreement. In addition to providing a platform for investigating superlatives on a larger scale, this research also introduces a new text-based Wikipedia corpus in which all superlative instances have been annotated according to the proposed annotation scheme, and which has been used to develop a tool that can reliably distinguish between different superlative types, and identify the comparative components of ISA superlatives.
 Keywords Superlatives Annotation Wikipedia Resources Adjectives 1 Introduction The most common form of comparison in English is found in the use of gradable adjectives or adverbs. Many adjectives describe qualities that can be measured in degrees (such as size, beauty, age, etc.). In linguistics, the term gradability refers to the possibility of placing the adjective on a scale of comparison, at a higher or lower position than the slot occupied by the adjective itself. Similarly, gradable adverbs specify a degree to which the adverb applies, which may be either higher or lower than its base form.

While gradability can be expressed by using degree adverbs such as barely , very , or highly , adjectives and adverbs can also take different forms to indicate their position on a scale of comparison, as illustrated by these examples comparing the prices of different Volkswagen (VW) car models: (1) a. The Touran is more expensive than the Golf. (2) a. {The Phaeton} is the most expensive [VW model].
The comparative form of an adjective or adverb is commonly used to compare (a) and (b), two different VW models are ranked according to how expensive they are. The superlative form of an adjective expresses the end spectrum of the scale, and is a powerful way to compare and contrast a target entity with a set of other entities. For example, in a sentence like (2) (a), the superlative most expensive compares the target entity the Phaeton (indicated by curly brackets) with the other members of its comparison set (all VW models, square brackets).

An initial investigation of superlative forms showed that two types of relation hold between a target and its comparison set:  X  Relation 1: IS-A relation  X  Relation 2: Superlative relation
The IS-A relation expresses the membership of the target in the comparison class (e.g. its parent class in a generalisation hierarchy). The superlative relation specifies a property which all members of the set share, but which the target has the highest (or lowest) degree or value of. Both relations are of great potential interest in relation extraction. Milosavljevic ( 1999 ), who investigates the use of comparison in the description of entities, classifies superlatives as a type of domain-based comparison , whose discourse goal is to highlight the uniqueness of the target entity, and to prevent the hearer from forming misconceptions about the similarity of the members in the comparison set. Superlatives are thus an important means of characterising entities and setting them apart from their member class.

Although superlatives are not a high-frequency phenomenon [with roughly one superlative form in every 17 sentences in newspaper text, Scheible ( 2007 )], this study claims that when superlatives do occur, they are generally judged as important and/or interesting by people, and can thus serve as indicators for potentially interesting information. One major objective of the present study was therefore to create a tool which can identify superlatives in text and extract their main components, i.e. triples of the kind sup (T, CS), where: 1. T is a designator of the target entity 2. CS is a designator of the comparison set 3. sup is a designator of the superlative relation holding between T and CS For example, in (2) (a), the triple to be extracted is most expensive ( The Phaeton, VW model ).

However, one of the central problems in extracting the components of superlative relations is that no unified computational treatment of superlatives is possible because of their great semantic complexity and the variety of syntactic structures in which they occur. Compare for example: (3) The blue whale is the largest mammal. (4) Of all pubs in Edinburgh, the White Hart Inn is the oldest . (5) Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women. (6) This hotel is located in the most privileged area of the Costa del Sol. (7) Orders will be shipped the most quickly when they are placed Monday or (8) The Royal Mile is busiest during the Festival season.
 All of the above examples contain a superlative form (highlighted in italics). which they express a comparison. The top examples contain a clear-cut comparison between a target item and its comparison set: the blue whale versus mammal in (3); the White Hart Inn versus all pubs in Edinburgh in (4), breast cancer versus cancer among women in (5). Although examples (6) X (8) also involve comparisons, their targets and/or comparison sets are not that straightforward to identify. For example, sentence (6) does not specify the name of the target item (which would be the name of the most privileged area of the Costa del Sol), because it is not needed for the sentence to make sense. Other cases, like (7) and (8), do not involve a comparison between entities , but rather between different states or parts of one single entity. For example, in (8) we understand that of all times in the year, the Royal Mile is busiest during the Festival season. Thus, the comparison does not involve the Royal Mile and a set of other places, but how busy it is at different times in the year.
Examples (3) X (8) show that superlatives differ not only in their semantics, i.e. in the ways in which they express comparisons, but they also occur in a wide variety of syntactic structures. For a computational treatment of superlatives that has as its goal to extract the main components of a superlative comparison (i.e. information about the target and comparison set), it is of vital importance to distinguish between the different types of comparison that superlatives can express, and to identify the ones whose components lend themselves most readily for extraction. The latter task is complicated by the fact that the relation between semantic type of comparison and syntactic surface form is far from straightforward, especially since surface forms are often ambiguous between different semantic readings.

Although superlatives are commonly used in natural language, so far there has been no large-scale computational investigation of the types of comparisons they express. In theoretical linguistics, most studies of superlatives have focused on particular semantic ambiguities which may only rarely occur in everyday language (Szabolsci 1986 ; Heim 1999 ). Two recent studies by Bos and Nissim ( 2006 ) and technology, but neither study exhaustively deals with the different constructions in which superlatives occur. The present study aims to pave the way for a comprehensive computational treatment of superlatives, and starts by focussing on the task of automatically extracting useful information about their target entities and comparison sets. For this purpose, a novel annotation scheme for superlatives is introduced, which aims to facilitate a computational approach to superlatives as well as provide data for a more detailed theoretical investigation of the syntax and semantics of superlatives.

The article is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides further motivation for distinguishing between different types of superlatives by describing their use in the area of Question Answering (QA). Section 3 discusses previous computational approaches to superlatives and their limitations. Section 4 introduces a text-based Wikipedia corpus ( X  X  X extWiki X  X ), in which all superlative occurrences have been annotated according to a two-part annotation scheme, which is described in Sect. 5 . The first annotation classifies superlatives according to their surface form, while the second one addresses the identification of target and comparison set spans for straight-forward superlative comparisons, which is crucial for the proposed superlative relation extraction task. The final part of this article describes the results of using the annotation scheme in practice, which involves annotation of all superlative instances in TextWiki, and an evaluation of the scheme on a test corpus of 500 superlative tokens (Sect. 6 ). 2 Motivation The work described in this article is based on the claim that superlatives serve as indicators for potentially important information. However, not all superlatives are of equal interest, and this section aims to show that only particular types of superlatives are useful for addressing particular tasks. An automated treatment of superlatives should be able to distinguish between these types, and, crucially, be able to ignore those superlatives that are irrelevant. The following paragraphs provide evidence for this claim from open-domain Question Answering (QA).

Over the last decade, research in QA has mainly focused on open-domain systems, which rely on unstructured data such as large natural language corpora or the World Wide Web, and attempt to deal a wide variety of questions and topics, such as factoid questions (e.g. What is the capital of France? ), list questions (e.g. What movies did Julianne Moore appear in? ), and definition questions (e.g. What is pragmatics? ). Up until recently, the annual TREC Conference ( T ext Re trieval C onference) 1 featured a QA track in which current systems X  performance on different question types was assessed. The knowledge base used in this evaluation is the AQUAINT corpus, 2 which consists of around 375 million words of 1999 American English newswire text.

In 2004, the TREC QA track became topic-based, which meant that questions were no longer independent from each other but were clustered around a particular target, such as for example  X  X  X he band Nirvana X  X : 3  X  Target: the band Nirvana  X  FACTOID: Who is the lead singer/musician in Nirvana?  X  LIST: Who are the band members?  X  FACTOID: When was the band formed?  X  FACTOID: What is their biggest hit?  X  LIST: What are their albums?  X  FACTOID: What style of music do they play?  X  OTHER: Other
The majority of questions about the question target are factoid or list questions, apart from the last one, which is a so-called  X  X  X ther X  X  question. 4 This last question type requires systems to return as many text snippets (so-called  X  X  X uggets X  X ) from the AQUAINT corpus as possible that are relevant for an understanding of the topic. The idea that superlatives might be useful with respect to answering  X  X  X ther X  X  questions is based on the observation that superlatives are often used for the purpose of defining an entity: They not only place the entity in a generalisation hierarchy, but also distinguish it from the other members of its class. To corroborate this claim, a small study which involved the TREC 2004 and 2005  X  X  X ther X  X  question nuggets was carried out (Scheible 2007 ). The assumption is that nuggets of text can either be relevant for answering a question or not. The  X  X  X ther X  X  question nuggets are relevant snippets, and are further divided up into  X  X  X ital X  X  or  X  X  X kay X  X  ones to distinguish between important relevant nuggets and not so important relevant nuggets. Each of these nuggets has been assessed individually by ten human judges (for more information on this procedure, see Lin and Demner-Fushman 2006 ).

A closer study of the nuggets showed that there is a positive correlation between nuggets containing superlatives and nuggets being judged as  X  X  X ital X  X , which supports the general claim that superlatives convey interesting information (Scheible 2007 ). Looking at the distribution of superlatives among the  X  X  X elevant X  X  nuggets, it turned out that of 139  X  X  X ther X  X  questions (64 in TREC 2004 and 75 in TREC 2005) and 1,338 nuggets in total, 51 questions contain at least one superlative nugget, with 69 superlative-containing nuggets altogether. Out of these 69 nuggets, 20 were judged  X  X  X ital X  X  by all ten assessors (almost one third). Another 12 nuggets were judged as  X  X  X ital X  X  by nine assessors. Altogether, about 86% (59 out of 69) of the nuggets containing superlatives were judged as  X  X  X ital X  X  by at least five judges.
More strikingly, some types of superlatives were considered more relevant by the judges than others. Three different classes can be formed according to the relation contains superlative nuggets where T S coincides with T Q (this will be referred to as class C1). The second one includes nuggets where T S is a part of or closely related contains those superlatives where T S is not closely related (or unrelated) to T Q (class C3). 5 Table 1 shows an example of each class (T S indicated by curly brackets, and CS by square brackets.) 6 : The subclass C1 contains 46 nuggets, C2 contains 15 nuggets, and C3 contains 8. Table 2 shows that 87% of all judgements of the C1 instances are  X  X  X ital X  X , while the vital judgements of the members of C2 and C3 are much lower, with 59 and 38%, respectively. Furthermore, all 20 cases judged as  X  X  X ital X  X  by all ten assessors are of type C1. With the exception of one case, all remaining 26 members are judged as fewer than half of the assessors almost exclusively belong to the C2 or C3 classes.
To put these results into perspective, the number of occurrences of comparative forms in the  X  X  X ther X  X  question nuggets was also investigated (such as greater or more interesting ). Although comparatives occur far more frequently in newspaper text than superlatives (Biber et al. 1999 ), there are only 5 relevant nuggets that contain comparative forms. Moreover, the judges X  assessments of these nuggets show them to be not very important, with only one of the five being judged as  X  X  X ital X  X  by more than five judges.

To draw reliable statistical conclusions one would also have to analyse occurrences of superlatives in  X  X  X nrelevant X  X  nuggets. However, the above results strongly suggest that human judges rate superlative statements about a given topic as more vital for the definition of the topic than other statements. The study further demonstrates that not all superlatives are of equal importance: Superlatives belonging to the C1 class are good indicators of the importance of nuggets, while C2 and C3 may be less relevant. Experiments carried out in the framework of TREC 2006 further supported these findings by showing that a simple approach based on superlative forms alone (i.e. without taking class membership in C1, C2 or C3 into account) does not improve the results (Kai X er et al. 2006 ): A simple algorithm that reranked the  X  X  X ther X  X  questions output of Kaisser X  X  QA system by moving snippets that contain superlatives higher up in the list did not score higher than the original output. An analysis of the superlative instances revealed that this is due to a large amount of C2 and C3 superlatives, i.e. superlatives which are not directly related or unrelated to the target of the question (Kai X er et al. 2006 ). A similar simple technique was used by Bos ( 2006 ) and by Razmara and Kosseim ( 2007 ). All just looked for the presence of a superlative and raised the score without further analysing the type of superlative or its role in the sentence. This calls for a more sophisticated approach, where C1 superlatives can be identified, which is what this research proposes. 3 Previous work In recent years a number of studies have investigated gradable adjectives from a computational point of view. For example, Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe ( 2000 ) study the effects of gradability and semantic orientation on sentence subjectivity. It has been shown that there is a statistically significant correlation between the presence of adjectives and subjectivity (Bruce and Wiebe 1999 ). Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe found that by restricting the class of adjectives to those that have a positive or negative semantic orientation and/or are gradable, these results can be further improved, and their study attempts to learn these features automatically from corpora (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe 2000 ). The ability to form comparatives and superlatives serves as an important indicator for the gradability of adjectives. So far, only limited resources have been available for the study of superlatives. Although they have been investigated within the framework of theoretical linguistics, these studies mainly focus on semantic properties without extensive use of corpus data (Szabolsci 1986 ; Heim 1999 ; Kennedy 1997 ). In computational linguistics, two relatively recent studies by Jindal and Liu ( 2006 ) and Bos and Nissim ( 2006 ) illustrate the usefulness of superlatives for language technology, and both provide data in which superlatives have been manually annotated. However, neither of the two studies takes into account the different types of comparisons that superlatives can express. The following sections review their definitions of the class of superlatives and their annotation schemes, paying special attention to what extent different types of superlatives are taken into account, and how comparative elements (i.e. the target and comparison sets) are annotated in their data. 3.1 Jindal and Liu In 2006, two papers were published by Jindal and Liu 7 that propose the study of comparative sentence mining . By  X  X  X omparative sentence X  X  Jindal and Liu denote sentences that express an ordering relation between two sets of entities with respect to some common features ( 2006 ). Their interest lies mainly in subjective comparisons, which is why they focus on evaluative texts on the web, such as reviews, forum postings, and blogs. They define comparative sentence mining as a two-step task, where the first step is to identify comparative sentences in a given text, and the second one is to extract comparative relations from the identified sentences. In particular, they define the term  X  X  X omparative relation X  X  as follows:
A comparative relation captures the essence of a comparative sentence and is represented with the following: (relationWord, features, entityS1, entityS2, type) where relationWord : The keyword used to express a comparative relation in a sentence. features : a set of features being compared. entityS1 and entityS2 : Sets of entities being compared. Entities in entityS1 appear to the left of the relation word and entities in entityS2 appear to the right of the relation word. type : non-equal gradable , equative or superlative .
An entity in this context is defined as the name of a person, a product brand, a company, a location, or similar, under comparison in a comparative sentence, and a feature is taken to be a part or property of the entity that is being compared. Entities and features can only be nouns (including plural and proper nouns) or pronouns. The use of relationWord depends on the type of comparative relation expressed ( non-equal gradable , equative or superlative ), which are further discussed below. Thus, for a sentence like  X  X  Canon X  X  optics is better than those of Sony and Nikon  X  X , their system is expected to extract the following relation:
The following paragraphs focus on Jindal and Liu X  X  treatment of superlatives, assessing their definition of the class of superlatives and their annotation scheme which is used to develop and evaluate their tool. Their corpus, which consists of 3,248 sentences from customer reviews, forum discussions, and random news articles taken from the Internet, was manually annotated by two humans for the  X  X  X omparative sentence mining X  X  task. Disagreement was resolved through discussion.
 As superlatives are considered as a particular  X  X  X ype X  X  of comparative relation, Jindal and Liu X  X  corpus ( 2006 ) looks like a useful resource for the study of superlatives. However, a closer inspection of their data reveals a number of problems. The first concerns their definition of the superlative class. Jindal and Liu define the four different types of comparison non-equal gradable , equative , superlative , and non-gradable , as follows 8 : 1. Non-equal Gradable : Relations of the type greater or less than that express a 2. Equative : Relations of the type equal to that state two entities as equal with 3. Superlative : Relations of the type greater or less than all others that rank one 4. Non-Gradable : Sentences which compare features of two or more entities, but
Thus, their class of superlatives contains not only grammatical superlatives, but also constructions such as  X  X  X op X  X ,  X  X  X nly X  X ,  X  X  X ne of the X  X , and  X  X  X ne of the few X  X . This definition is problematic, because even though these constructions specify something as being unique, which is a feature of superlatives, they don X  X  imply a superlative. In addition, it is far from clear what is meant by ranking one entity over  X  X  all others X  X . This definition may lead to difficulties in deciding which of the two classes a sentence belongs to ( non-equal gradable or superlative ). Consider for example (9), which uses a comparative form, indicating a  X  X  X on-equal gradable X  X  type, but which could also be considered as belonging to the  X  X  X uperlative X  X  class according to Jindal and Liu X  X  definition: (9) Canon X  X  optics is better than those of all other cameras of this price.
For a comprehensive study of superlatives Jindal and Liu X  X  definition is clearly problematic.

The second important question is to what extent Jindal and Liu X  X  annotated corpus takes different types of superlatives into account, and how comparative elements (i.e. the target and comparison set strings) are annotated. As illustrated in the introduction, superlatives can vary greatly in the kind of comparison they express, and in how easy it is to identify their comparative elements.

An investigation of Jindal and Liu X  X  data shows that no distinction is made between different superlative constructions. This means that annotation of the comparative elements of superlatives using their definition of the entity sets entityS1 and entityS2 will run into serious problems when applied in practice. Membership in the two sets is not determined by semantics, but by relative position in the sentence: entityS1 appears to the left of the  X  X  X elation word X  X  (in this case, the superlative), and entityS2 appears to the right of it (see definition above). This definition was probably derived from the consideration that the relation that holds between the two sets is asymmetric for both the non-equal gradable and the superlative classes. This means that, like in a mathematical  X  X  X reater than X  X  relation, the greater argument should occur on the left hand side of the relation symbol, and the smaller argument on the right hand side. However, unlike in maths, natural language does not always conform to such a strict ordering of constituents, and an asymmetric relation can manifest itself in a variety of surface forms. This particularly applies to the superlative relation. Consider for example the following sentences, which are semantically equivalent with respect to the best relation: (10) The White Hart Inn offers the best wine selection of all pubs in Edinburgh. (11) Of all pubs in Edinburgh, the best wine selection is offered at the White Hart
According to the above definition of entityS1 and entityS2 , such variation would result in different relation vectors for these sentences: (10) (best, wine selection, The White Hart Inn, all pubs in Edinburgh) (11) (best, wine selection, all pubs in Edinburgh, The White Hart Inn)
Obviously, such an approach runs into severe semantic problems when interpreting the output of the system: An entity X  X  occurrence in the entityS1 slot does not necessarily mean that, from a formal perspective, it occurs on the left hand side of the relation. Jindal and Liu X  X  result of 100% precision for entityS1 should therefore be considered with caution.

The problem just described could be easily solved by using a semantic definition of the entity sets, where entityS1 is associated with the entity in focus (the target of comparison) and where entityS2 represents the comparison set , i.e. the set of entities the target is compared to. However, a closer look at how instances of the superlative class are annotated in the gold standard data reveals further problems. According to Jindal and Liu, for superlatives the entityS2 slot is  X  X  X ormally empty X  X  (2006). Assuming that entityS2 represents the comparison set, this would mean that the comparison set is  X  X  X ormally empty X  X , which is somewhat counter-intuitive. A closer investigation of the data and its annotation shows why this is the case (Jindal and Liu 2006 ): (12) i think, apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price. (13) simply without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i  X  X e seen. (14) overall, the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any In constructions where the superlative form is incorporated into an NP, Jindal and Liu consistently interpret the string following the superlative form as feature . While this may be appropriate for cases like (10) or (11), it does not apply to superlative comparisons involving the copula verb  X  X  X o be X  X . Here, the NP denotes the comparison set rather than a feature [the feature is expressed by the superlative form standard annotation, the entityS2 slot remains empty even in cases where the comparison set is explicitly mentioned (as in (14), where the comparison set consists of current &gt;4 megapixel digicams ).

A further major problem is that a number of important semantic aspects are completely disregarded. For example, important restrictions on the comparison set (or feature , in their terms), are not considered: (15) After Fiat, Coca-Cola is now the second biggest investor in Poland.
This results in the inaccurate information that Coca-Cola (and not Fiat ) is the biggest investor in Poland. Furthermore, negation is not taken into account: (16) the software is somewhat nice to look at, using it is not the easiest. (17) the scroll button is n X  X  the best, as it sometimes can be hard to select.
Although the task of comparative sentence mining described by Jindal and Liu ( 2006 ) proposes to extract both the target and comparison set of superlatives and the relations that hold between them, the data reveals some serious theoretical problems. While their annotation scheme of comparatives ( non-equal gradables ) may be accurate, this is not the case for superlatives. The annotation scheme does not take different surface structures into account, and as a consequence, annotation of target and comparison set strings is handled incorrectly. We can conclude that Jindal and Liu X  X  data set is unsuitable for a more detailed investigation of superlatives. 3.2 Bos and Nissim In contrast to Jindal and Liu ( 2006 ), Bos and Nissim X  X  treatment of superlatives is based on semantic principles ( 2006 ). They describe an implementation of a system that can automatically detect superlatives, and determine the correct comparison set span for attributive cases, where the superlative form is incorporated into an NP. In order to develop and evaluate their system they manually annotated a corpus with occurrences of superlatives, which was compiled from parts of the Wall Street Journal, the Glasgow Herald, questions from the TREC QA exercise and from natural language query logs.

Bos and Nissim do not provide an explicit definition of the general class of superlatives. Instead, they provide a number of examples, drawing attention to the variety of syntactic and morphological forms that superlatives can take in English. They state that  X  X  X ne-syllable adjectives and some two-syllable adjectives X  X  are directly inflected with the suffix  X  X -est X  X , and that some words of two syllables and all words of three or more syllables are introduced by  X  X  X ost X  X  or  X  X  X east X  X . They further note that there are superlative adverbs, such as  X  X  X ost recently X  X , and idiomatic usages.

Bos and Nissim distinguish between the following four classes of superlatives 9 : 1. attributive: the strongest dividend growth 2. predicative: its rates will be among the highest 3. adverbial: free to do the task most quickly 4. idiom: who won the TONY for best featured actor?
Each superlative in their corpus is classified as belonging to one of these classes. Regarding the annotation of the comparative elements of superlatives, Bos and Nissim only consider the comparison set span for attributive cases. They state that the comparison set denotes  X  X  X he set of entities that are compared to each other with respect to a certain dimension X  X . For example, in  X  X  X he oldest character in the book X  X , the members of the comparison set are characters in the book, and the dimension of comparison is age (Bos and Nissim 2006 ). They further draw attention to the fact that the identification of the comparison set span is complicated by syntactic issues such as the presence of possessives as in  X  X  X S Roma X  X  quickest player X  X , which extends the comparison set to players of AS Roma. They note that prepositional phrases (PPs), gerunds, and relative clauses introduce further complexity: PPs that are attached to the head noun of the superlative are part of the comparison set, while those that modify the entire NP are not, and similarly, restrictive relative clauses are included in the comparison set, while non-restrictive ones aren X  X  (Bos and Nissim 2006 ).

To calculate inter-annotator agreement on superlative detection and type identification, one section of the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) was annotated by two independent annotators. In addition to identifying superlatives in the text, they annotated each superlative instance with its type (one of the four classes above, and for attributive cases the span of the comparison set, with high inter-annotator agreement: 0.963 F-score on sentences containing superlatives (79 superlative phrases in total), 0.974 F-score on the type of superlative, and 95.31% agreement on the span of the comparison set for attributive cases. The attributive type was the most reliable with an F-score of 1 (total agreement on 64 cases), while predicative and adverbial cases achieved 0.9 and 0.8 F-score, respectively. No idiomatic uses were detected in the doubly-annotated data set. The attributive class was also the most common in the whole corpus: Of 3,045 superlatives in total (which amounts to around one superlative in every 25 sentences or questions), 89.1% were labelled as attributive, 6.9% as predicative, 3.0% as adverbial, and 0.9% as idiomatic.
From a linguistic point of view, Bos and Nissim X  X  approach represents a major improvement to Jindal and Liu X  X  annotation of superlatives, as they focus on one treatment of the span of the comparison set. However, their approach does not take different types of superlative comparison into account, and it disregards the question of what the target of the superlative comparison is. Consider the examples described in the introduction: (18) The blue whale is the largest mammal. (19) This hotel is located in the most privileged area of the Costa del Sol. (20) Of all pubs in Edinburgh, the White Hart Inn is the oldest .

According to Bos and Nissim X  X  classification, comparison set spans would be computed for examples (18) and (19), as they would be classified as attributive . However, their approach does not take into account that (18) describes an explicit comparison between a target item (the blue whale) and a comparison set (the class of mammals), while (19) does not involve an explicit comparison, as no target is mentioned in the sentence. For a computational treatment of superlatives it would clearly be of interest to distinguish between different types of comparison, and to identify the target span of superlative comparisons in cases like (18). Furthermore, even though examples like (20), which contain a  X  X  X used head X  X , are similar to (18) and clearly describe a set comparison with both target and comparison set realised in the sentence, they are excluded from consideration in Bos and Nissim X  X  classification as they would be categorised as predicative . 3.3 Limitations of previous work The discussion of the studies by Jindal and Liu ( 2006 ) and Bos and Nissim ( 2006 ) draws attention to the fact that in order to deal with superlatives computationally, a thorough linguistic investigation of their syntax and semantics is required. Jindal and Liu do not distinguish between different superlative types at all, which causes major problems in the interpretation of their results. Bos and Nissim, on the other comparison, and exclude  X  X  X used head X  X  cases from consideration [cf. example (20)]. The following sections describe a novel computational approach to superlatives, which aims to overcome the limitations of previous studies by providing: (1) A clear definition of the superlative class; (2) a useful classification of superlatives which takes different types of comparison into account; and (3) information about the spans of both target and comparison set. The next section introduces a new data set which has been annotated according to these principles. 4 TextWiki corpus: a resource for the study of superlatives Previous investigations have shown that superlatives are particularly frequent in encyclopedia text (Scheible 2007 ). For this reason a novel Wikipedia 10 corpus was compiled (called TextWiki), in which all superlative instances have been identified and annotated according to the annotation scheme presented in Sect. 5 , which considers different types of superlatives, and the comparative components of so-called ISA superlatives. The current section describes the design of the corpus, and briefly provides an outlook of how it has been used to develop a tool that can reliably distinguish between different superlative types, and identify the compar-ative components. 4.1 Overview Existing Wikipedia corpora such as the Wikipedia XML corpus by Denoyer and Gallinari ( 2006 ) are primarily aimed at Information Retrieval tasks such as INEX, 11 and have several shortcomings with respect to studying linguistic phenomena like superlatives. Firstly, the XML conversion in Denoyer X  X  corpus retains most of the original wiki-markup, and thus includes information that is redundant for linguistic investigations (e.g. formatting). Furthermore, database structures such as tables, lists, figures, galleries, and templates are included, which usually do not contain full sentences and may therefore skew experimental results. Finally, the corpus includes many empty or incomplete articles ( X  X tubs X ) which are of little interest from a linguistic point of view.

For these reasons a new Wikipedia corpus was compiled, TextWiki, which contains over 450,000 words and aims to be especially suitable for linguistic research. The corpus is marked up in XML and excludes information that is irrelevant or may skew linguistic investigations:  X  All tables, lists, figures, galleries, and templates have been deleted.  X  No empty or incomplete articles ( X  X tubs X ) are included in the corpus.  X  Document structure markup is reduced to title, body, and paragraph and  X  Formatting markup is reduced to a small set of tags (e.g. &lt;b&gt; for bold text, &lt;i&gt;  X  Only hyperlinks to other Wikipedia articles are retained.

All superlatives in the corpus have been identified, including hyphenated superlatives like kindest-hearted , and irregular superlative forms like best , worst ,or furthest (cf. Sect. 5.1 ). All 1,380 superlatives in TextWiki have further been annotated according to the annotation scheme outlined in Sect. 5 . This involves their classification according to surface form (Sect. 5.2 ), and for superlatives classified as  X  X  X SA X  X , marking up the target and comparison set strings (Sect. 5.3 ). Results of the annotation are described in Sect. 6.3 .

TextWiki aims to be a balanced corpus that draws equally from five different top level Wikipedia categories ( X  X ulture and the arts X ,  X  X eography and places X ,  X  X ealth and fitness X ,  X  X istory and events X , and  X  X atural and physical sciences X ), covering 492 topics altogether. Due to Wikipedia X  X  complex categorisation structure and its open-endedness, an exhaustive and even coverage of the whole encyclopedia is not possible. However, the same random sampling technique of articles was applied to each of the five categories, resulting in a corpus containing articles from a broad number of areas. Table 3 gives the number of words (#W), articles (#A), and superlatives (#S) across the five categories in TextWiki. The table shows that each category contains just over 90,000 words, and that there are around two to three superlatives on average per Wikipedia article.

TextWiki is available upon request. 13 The package consists of five directories (representing the Wikipedia top-level categories), which contain XML-annotated files (one per Wikipedia article), as well as their associated XML Schema file. The original Wikipedia pages are also available as MHTML archive files, so that any omitted tables, lists, figures, etc. can be viewed as they originally appeared on the webpage. 4.2 Application Due to its balanced structure and careful composition, TextWiki is especially useful for linguistic investigations. Another objective of creating this resource was to obtain data for developing a tool which can automatically extract useful information from superlative comparisons. A computational treatment of superlatives should solve at least the following tasks:  X  TASK 1: Decide whether a given sentence contains a superlative form.  X  TASK 2: Given a sentence containing a superlative form, identify what type of  X  TASK 3: For set comparisons, identify the target and the comparison set spans,
The ISA type of superlative comparison, which will be discussed in further detail in Sect. 5.2 , turned out to be especially suitable for this purpose, because both their targets and comparison sets are explicitly realised in the text.

Scheible ( 2009 ) describes how the TextWiki corpus has been used to develop a tool that can reliably address the three tasks. The so-called  X  X  X uperlative Relation Extractor X  X  (SRE) consists of three components. The first one can identify superlatives in free text with high precision and recall, addressing TASK 1. The second component is able to reliably classify superlative instances according to the surface forms described in Sect. 5.2 , solving TASK 2. One of the classes it can recognise is ISA-1, whose members lend themselves most readily for an extraction of their components. For any member of this class, the third component of SRE is able to identify the target and comparison set span, thus solving TASK 3 (based on the annotation described in Sect. 5.3 ) All components integrated in SRE were developed, tested, and evaluated on the TextWiki corpus with very good results.
The SRE tool employs a rule-based approach based mainly on tag sequences and dependency relations [using the output of the C&amp;C tools, cf. Clark and Curran ( 2004 )]. SRE employs rules rather than machine learning due to the relatively small number of superlatives in the TextWiki corpus and the low frequency of some superlative types, which would represent a problem for a learner. An additional difficulty concerns the fact that the tools used to obtain the tags and dependency relations will have been optimised to correctly tag frequently occurring phenomena in its target text type (in this case, newspaper texts), in order to achieve the highest possible performance score. As superlatives are relatively low frequency phenom-ena, with most types occurring far down the end of low frequency patterns (part of  X  X  X he long tail X  X ), even a relatively high-performance tagger like C&amp;C may perform poorly at tagging them, because it will make little difference to the tagger X  X  overall performance score. SRE X  X  approach involves highly flexible and fine-tuned rules which can take these factors into account wherever necessary. 5 An annotation scheme for superlatives This section describes the annotation scheme according to which superlatives in the TextWiki corpus have been annotated. After providing a definition of the class of superlatives, a two-part annotation scheme for superlatives is introduced. The first annotation classifies superlatives according to their surface form. The second one only applies to superlatives that express straight-forward comparisons between targets and their comparison sets (ISA class), and deals with the identification of target and comparison set spans. 5.1 Defining superlatives The study described in this article uses a linguistic definition of the class of superlatives, which (compared to Jindal and Liu X  X  functional approach outlined in Sect. 3.1 ) has the advantage of providing clear guidelines for verifying a word X  X  membership in the class. Generally, superlatives can be formed via two different paradigms: An inflectional one, where the inflectional suffix -est is appended to the base form of the adjective or adverb, or an analytical one, where the adjective or adverb is preceded by the analytical markers most or least . Which of these paradigms is used depends on the nature of the adjective/adverb. A common assumption is that the choice between inflection and periphrasis is related to the length of the base form. Quirk et al. ( 1985 ), for example, classify adjectives according to their number of syllables, stating that monosyllabic adjectives more typically form superlatives by inflection (e.g. lowest , nicest , smartest ), while trisyllabic or longer adjectives can usually only be formed analytically [ most beautiful , most difficult ; cf. also Bos and Nissim ( 2006 )]. Disyllabic adjectives are generally said to occur in both the analytical and inflectional forms ( politest / most polite ). It has been argued that the reason why no clear paradigm can be stated for the formation of superlatives is that it may be affected by language change in progress (Bauer 1994 ). Over the past centuries, English has gradually dropped most of its inflectional endings, thus developing towards being an analytical language. Some adjectives and adverbs, however, have irregular, lexicalised forms and are therefore unlikely to be affected by regularisation (Table 4 ).

As discussed in the introduction, in order to be able to form superlatives, the input adjective or adverb must be gradable, that is, it must be possible to place it on a scale of comparison, at a position higher or lower than the one indicated by the base form. While the majority of adjectives and adverbs are gradable, there are also some that are non-gradable . This will be the case, inter alia, when the base form already indicates the highest or lowest position on a scale, for example dead or awake . Such adjectives do not usually have superlative forms, apart from in some poetic or intensifying uses (e.g.  X  X  X t is deader than the deadest parrot X  X ). The gradability of adjectives has been studied extensively in semantics, often in combination with investigations of their polarity or semantic orientation (e.g. Lyons 1977 ; Kennedy 1997 ; Klein 1980 ). Polarity refers to the direction in which an adjective strays from its lexical field (Lehrer 1974 ). Adjectives denoting desirable properties are usually conceived as positive, while those denoting undesirable properties are considered of negative polarity, for example beautiful versus ugly . 5.2 Classification Superlatives differ not only in their semantics, i.e. in the ways in which they express comparisons, but they also occur in a wide variety of syntactic structures. For a computational treatment of superlatives that has as its goal to extract the main components of the comparison (i.e. information about the target and comparison set), it is of vital importance to distinguish between the different types of comparison that superlatives can express, and to identify the ones whose components lend themselves most readily for extraction. The latter task is complicated by the fact that the relation between semantic type of comparison and syntactic surface form is far from straightforward, especially since surface forms are often ambiguous between different semantic readings. The first type of annotation therefore proposes an exhaustive classification of superlative surface forms which provides a useful platform both for a computational extraction task, and for a closer theoretical investigation of the semantics of superlative comparisons.

The proposed classification distinguishes between three main groups, containing eight structural classes altogether:  X  Adjectival superlatives: ISA (Types 1 and 2), DEF, INDEF, FREE  X  Adverbial superlatives: ADV  X  Idiomatic superlatives: PROP, PP, IDIOM
Annotators are asked to label each occurrence of a superlative form in the corpus as belonging to one of these eight classes. 14 For this purpose, the annotator is provided with the binary tree displayed in Fig. 1 , where each node represents a question about the superlative form at hand, and each leaf stands for one of the superlative classes. Depending how each successive question is answered, the superlative is labelled with the leaf that is reached. The adjectival group contains the four right-most leaves (ISA, DEF, INDEF, and FREE). Adverbial superlatives form a class of their own (ADV). The third group contains superlative instances that are of an idiomatic nature, represented by the PROP, PP and IDIOM leaves in the tree. The following sections provide a brief overview of each of the eight superlative classes.

The first question in the tree (Q1) aims to distinguish idiomatic superlatives from non-idiomatic superlatives. An idiomatic superlative is a superlative form that is in some way lexicalised. Idiomatic superlative forms are usually not produced by an from the base adjective/adverb), but are part of a fixed phrase or expression. The proposed classification distinguishes between three different types:  X  PROP (identified by Q2)  X  PP (identified by Q3)  X  IDIOM (identified by Q3)
The PROP class contains instances of the superlative form most where it is used as a proportional quantifier, usually in phrases of the form  X  X  most ? ( of ? (DET)) ? (NP) X  X  (brackets indicate optional constituents). Here, most does not have a superlative function but means  X  X  X ore than half X  X  or  X  X  X he majority X  X .

The PP class contains idiomatic superlative forms that are part of a so-called PP superlative construction (Corver and Matushansky 2006 ). These are usually phrases of the form [preposition ? ( the ) ? ( very/ ... ) ? superlative], such as at most , at ( the very ) least , at best , at worst , at the earliest , in the slightest , to its fullest .
The IDIOM class contains superlative forms that still constitute a comparison of some sort, but which are lexicalised, and as a result tend to behave differently from conventionally formed superlative phrases. Examples are:  X  Fixed names/titles of awards: e.g. Best Western, the Oscar for Best Actress, ...  X  Uses of superlatives as nouns: e.g. do my best , the worst that could happen, ...  X  Other lexicalised expressions: last but not least , the latest results, ...
The fourth question in the tree (Q4) aims to separate adjectival from adverbial superlatives. As adverbial superlatives have not been studied much in linguistic literature, they form a class of their own, so that they can be investigated separately.
Adverbial superlatives ( ADV ) occur in a variety of syntactic constructions and can modify verbs (21 X 24), adjectives (25), and even whole phrases (26). (21) First Class mail usually arrives the fastest . (22) Tom laughed loudest of all. (23) The lark sings loudest when flying fast. (24) A neutron star radiates most strongly at its magnetic poles. (25) Finland is the most strongly pro-European Nordic country. (26) Most importantly , do not forget to turn off the gas.

The examples show that adverbial superlatives can express a variety of semantic types, which have in common that the superlative modifies a verb (or adjective/ phrase) and not the set itself (e.g. in (21), the superlative fastest modifies the action of arriving rather than an inherent property of the comparison set of mail delivery services). This means that adverbial set comparisons compare a target to its comparison set with respect to how it performs a particular action , and not with respect to a general property. As a consequence, it is not always straightforward to identify the target and comparison set spans.

As Fig. 1 illustrates, the first syntactic feature that is used to distinguish between different adjectival superlatives is whether they are bound in an NP (in which case they are referred to as  X  X  X uperlative NP comparisons X  X ) or occur freely in a sentence (Question Q5). If they occur freely in the sentence, they are classified as FREE. Among the superlative NP comparisons, a further syntactic feature (represented by Question Q6) distinguishes between definite and indefinite (classified as INDEF) superlative NPs. Among the definite cases, Question Q7 further distinguishes between explicit (classified as ISA) and implicit surface forms (classified as DEF). The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the four adjectival classes.
The ISA class contains definite superlative NP comparisons where both target and comparison set are explicitly mentioned in the context. This is achieved by using a surface form which makes the IS-A relation that holds between target and comparison set explicit (cf. Relation 2 in Sect. 1 ) The class contains the following subclasses:  X  Type 1 ( X  X  X SA-1 X  X ), which contains surface forms where the target is explicitly  X  Type 2 ( X  X  X SA-2 X  X ), which contains surface forms where the target and comparison (27) {The whale shark} T is the largest [fish] CS .[ X  X  to be  X  X  ] (28) The largest [fish] CS , {the whale shark} T , weighs up to 13.6 tonnes. (29) (There are many [fish] CS .) The largest , {the whale shark} T , weighs up to 13.6 (30) {The whale shark} T is considered the largest [fish] CS . (31) {Mexico} T claims to be the most peaceful [country in the Americas] CS . (32) {Nestle  X  } T emerges as the most boycotted [brand in the UK] CS .

The ISA class is very suitable for extracting the components of the superlative comparison, because ISA superlatives always express set comparisons where both target and comparison set are mentioned in the context. This means that superlatives classified as ISA allow two types of relation to be extracted: (1) The IS-A relation that holds between target and comparison set, and (2) the superlative relation indicated by the superlative form.

The DEF class contains definite superlative NP comparisons where the comparison set is explicitly mentioned in the text, but where the target is left implicit (i.e. there is no target designator in the sentence). Examples are: (33) The largest [mammal] weighs around 200 tons. (34) Of all the [pupils in Year 7], {Katy} owns the most expensive [mobile phone]. (35) Beth tells the best jokes [when she is drunk]. (36) Tina ordered the largest [pizza].

The examples show that members of the DEF class can express a variety of semantic types: Set comparisons with no explicit target as in (33), where the superlative NP is used as a referential phrase denoting the target item; relative readings as in (34), where the comparison is not just between mobile phones, but also between their owners; and superlatives that compare different states of an entity rather than the entities themselves (35). Example (36) illustrates the fact that superlatives of the DEF type are often ambiguous between different semantic readings. Here, the comparison could be between Tina and a number of other people ordering pizza [similar to (34)], or only between different pizzas on the menu (and Tina is ordering the largest of these). The DEF class is therefore of particular interest for theoretical studies of the ambiguity between  X  X  X bsolute X  X  and  X  X  X elative X  X  readings of superlatives, an observation first discussed by Ross ( 1964 ), and elaborated in a number of papers, most notably the ones by Heim ( 1985 , 1999 ) and Szabolsci ( 1986 ).

Syntactically, the members of the DEF class are straightforward to identify, as the superlative form is incorporated in an NP, and the main verb is usually a non-copula verb. However, there are also cases where the main verb is a copula, as in: (37) Britain X  X  highest mountain is in Scotland. (38) The most beautiful house in Edinburgh is up for sale.

Both of these are included in the DEF class. This shows that the presence of  X  X  X o be X  X  as main verb is no reliable indicator on its own for inclusion in the ISA class.
The INDEF class contains cases of NP-bound superlatives which are preceded by an indefinite determiner. They are often used as intensifiers, especially when they have the indefinite article  X  X  a  X  X  as determiner, as illustrated in (39). While (40) could be said to also have an intensifying reading, it still seems to involve a set comparison (between different times). Example (41), on the other hand, clearly describes a set comparison, and cases like this often occur in headlines or textual descriptions that aim to provide the reader with an overview of a specific topic. Sentence (41) could for example occur as the first sentence in a encyclopedia entry on tigers. (39) It X  X  a most interesting book. (40) Coffee has been used as a stimulant from earliest times. (41) Tiger, largest member of the cat family.
 The FREE class contains adjectival superlatives that are not bound in an NP. They can involve a comparison of states or parts of an entity (e.g. (42), which compares the height of the African elephant at different locations on its body), set comparisons ((43), which compares zebra finches to other finches/birds), and intensifiers (45). (42) The African elephant is tallest [at the shoulder]. (43) Most common in Africa is [the zebra finch]. (44) The zebra finch is most common in Africa. (45) I am most disappointed with the decision of the Federal Court.

Members of the FREE class are often subject to semantic ambiguities, which can arise not only between intensifying and superlative uses, but also among superlative uses. For example, although the constituents of (44) are the same as in (43), (44) has a different salient reading, in which the distribution of the birds in different regions is compared (rather than comparing the zebra finch to a set of other birds). Such ambiguities can only be resolved by investigating the context.

This subsection proposed an exhaustive classification of superlative surface forms, which allows a detailed study of the relationship between the respective surface forms and their semantic readings. Furthermore, the classification groups together superlative surface forms that are suitable for extracting the components of superlative comparisons. The ISA class is of particular interest, because its instances always express explicit set comparisons with both target and comparison set designators mentioned in the context. In Sect. 6 the classification system is tested and evaluated on 500 instances of superlatives in Wikipedia text. 5.3 Annotating target and comparison set spans The second annotation aims to identify the main components of superlative comparisons. Unlike Bos and Nissim ( 2006 ), who only consider the CS spans for attributive superlatives (cf. Sect. 3.2 ), the current approach intends to mark up both target and comparison set strings, allowing for an extraction of superlative relation vectors of the kind sup (T, CS), where: 1. T is a designator of the target entity 2. CS is a designator of the comparison set 3. sup is a designator of the superlative relation holding between T and CS
The discussion of superlative types in Sect. 5.2 showed that the ISA class is particularly suitable for this purpose as both T and CS strings are usually mentioned in the context. For this reason, the annotation of target and comparison set spans is restricted to superlatives classified as  X  X  X SA X  X  members.

For each ISA instance, annotators are asked to identify and mark up the strings representing the target T and the comparison set CS. For example: (46) Sentence: Philadelphia Zoo is the oldest zoo in America.
The main challenge for the annotators is the fact that the comparison set can be restricted in a variety of ways, for example by preceding possessives and premodifiers, or by postmodifiers such as PPs or various kinds of clauses (cf. also Bos and Nissim 2006 ). Compare for example: (47) {VW} T is [Europe X  X ] largest [car manufacturer] CS . (48) {VW} T is the largest [European car manufacturer with this product range] CS . (49) {VW} T is the largest [car manufacturer in Europe] CS with an impressive (50) [In China], {VW} T is the largest [car manufacturer] CS .

The phrases of cars and car in (47) and (48) both have the role of specifying the type of manufacturer that constitutes the comparison set. The phrases Europe X  X  , European and in Europe occur in determinative, premodifying, and postmodifying position, respectively, but all have the role of restricting the set of car manufacturers occur in postmodifying position, but differ in that the one in (48) is involved in the comparison, while the one in (49) is not. In addition, restrictors of the comparison can also occur elsewhere in the sentence, as shown in (50). Similarly, the target can also be pre-or postmodified. Thus, when aiming to extract superlative relation vectors of the form sup (T, CS), all restrictions should be taken into account: 17  X  (47): largest (VW, [Europe X  X , car manufacturer])  X  (48): largest (VW, European car manufacturer with this product range)  X  (49): largest (VW, car manufacturer in Europe)  X  (50): largest (VW, [in China, car manufacturer])
The annotation guidelines illustrate the task using the descriptive model of noun phrases (NPs) proposed by Quirk et al. ( 1985 ), which describes NPs as headed phrases, in which the NP head represents the only obligatory element, while the other constituents (determiners, premodifiers, and postmodifiers) are optional. According to Quirk et al., their model describes the ordering of the NP constituents in terms of how they really occur in language use, with the sequence of constituents shown in Table 5 .

The annotation guidelines further draw attention to the fact that the  X  X  X eterminer X  X  category is often realised as a whole phrase ( X  X  X eterminative phrase X  X ), consisting of three determiner subfunctions, which are mutually exclusive and usually have a fixed word order: Predeterminer, central determiner and postdeterminer (Quirk et al. 1985 ). They can be realised by the following word classes:  X  Predeterminer : pronouns (exclamatory, universal, quantifying); numerals  X  Central determiner : article (definite, indefinite); pronouns (demonstrative,  X  Postdeterminer : numeral (cardinal, ordinal), pronoun (quantifying)
The advantage of considering the determinative phrase in terms of these three subcategories is that the superlative form can receive its own category, which prevents us from committing it to one of the above classes, and allows it to occur before the postdeterminer, as for example in  X  X  X he largest two numbers X  X . Thus, the superlative NP can be considered to consist of the components shown in Table 6 . These constituents usually occur in a linear fashion, with all elements apart from SUP and HEAD being optional. In the special case of  X  X  X used head X  X  constructions [cf. example (29)], the SUP and HEAD elements are merged.

Annotators are asked to mark up the determinative phrase of the superlative ( X  X  X SDet X  X ), and the main comparison set span , which is defined to consist of premodifiers, the CS head, and any postmodifiers. They are further instructed to mark up any clear cases of external modifiers and preposed elements [as the underlined phrase in (51) or  X  X  X n China X  X  in (50)]. (51)  X  After the World Cup , the most important [football competitions] CS are {the
With respect to the determinative phrase, annotators were further instructed to mark up the  X  X  X xtended X  X  determinative phrase where it seems to indicate the target X  X  position and uniqueness compared to the other members of the comparison set. For example, while  X  X  the two (largest)  X  X  o r  X  X  the other (largest)  X  X  imply non-uniqueness unspecified. As a result, the CS component of the superlative relation vectors sup (T, CS) usually consists of two parts CSDet and CSMain , resulting in vectors of the kind sup (T, [CSDet, CSMain]) (cf. the example given for (47) above).

With respect to distinguishing restrictive from non-restrictive postmodifiers, the annotators are instructed to annotate any constituents which in their opinion restrict the comparison set. The annotation guidelines provide a list of postmodifier types, decision:  X  PP: prepositional phrase, e.g. in the country  X  ADVP: adverbial phrase, e.g. still , yesterday  X  ADJP: adjectival phrase, e.g. likely , blue  X  CL-NONF: non-finite clause, e.g. playing guitar , to sell the house  X  CL-REL: restrictive relative clause (non-restrictive ones are excluded), e.g.  X  CL-SUB: subordinate clause, e.g. because they were planted in spring  X  NP: noun phrase, e.g. park
For annotating the target string ( X  X  X ARGET X  X ), the only guidance given is that it should be kept as minimal as possible. That is, for cases like (52), where the target  X  X  X he Academy Awards X  X  is followed by further information in brackets, only the main string (describing  X  X  X ssential X  X  information) should be included in the target span. (52) {The Academy Awards} T (also known as  X  X  X he Oscars X  X ) are [the] most
The annotation scheme does not yet address resolution of pronouns or other anaphoric expressions which may occur in the target and comparison set strings. These will have to be resolved in a second, separate step, which is outside the scope of this work. 6 Annotating superlatives in TextWiki This section shows how the annotation scheme introduced in Sect. 5 has been applied to annotate superlatives in the TextWiki corpus. Before presenting the results of the annotation, the first two subsections describe the annotation tool and format, and discuss the results of a pilot annotation study which was carried out on a separate sample of Wikipedia data to validate the proposed annotation scheme for superlatives. 6.1 Annotation tool The annotation of superlatives described in this article was carried out using the GATE tool. 18 GATE allows users to define new annotation schemas, which can be used to annotate texts manually (in XML format). A  X  X  X uperlative schema X  X  was defined to annotate:  X  The span and class of superlatives (XML element: SUP , attribute: class , with  X  For ISA-1 and ISA-2 superlatives, the target span (XML element: TARGET ) and
Examples (53) and (54) illustrate the annotation of two superlative containing sentences in the TextWiki articles  X  X ssociation football X  and  X  X ictoria Stilwell X . The former contains an ISA-1 superlative, and the latter a superlative classified as ISA-2 (cf. Sect. 5.2 ). The examples show that the annotations are saved back into an inline XML format (using GATE X  X   X  X  X ave Preserving Format X  X  option), retaining the original annotations such as sentence tags and links to other Wikipedia pages. 6.2 Pilot annotation study A pilot annotation study was carried on a separate data set drawn from the Wikipedia XML corpus by Denoyer and Gallinari ( 2006 ) to evaluate the proposed annotation scheme. 19 The pilot corpus consists of 142 articles randomly selected from Part-0 of the Wikipedia XML corpus (excluding articles with less than 50 words and all database structures), and contains 500 tokens of superlatives, with (on average) one superlative per 14 sentences.

Superlative instances were identified and annotated as described in Sect. 5 .In addition to the author, a second annotator was recruited and trained to test the validity of the proposed annotation scheme. Errors were discussed and resolved after each set of 100 superlative-containing sentences. The following paragraphs summarise the results of the pilot study. 6.2.1 Classification task The classification task (Sect. 5.2 ) achieved an overall inter-annotator agreement of 89% (444/500 instances). Disagreements were discussed after each set of 100 instances, and were, with the exception of three cases, resolved in favour of Annotator 1 (the author). The feedback sessions caused the performance curve to rise steadily, with 76% agreement after the first 100 cases and 95% agreement after the last set (Fig. 2 ).

The largest source of disagreement was the ADV class, in cases where adverbial superlatives occured in ISA-like constructions (cf. also example (25) in Sect. 5.2 ): (55) There is not even complete consistency to be found between The Lord of the
Despite their structural resemblance to ISA comparisons, adverbial superlatives as shown in (55) do not modify the comparison set head, but rather one of its modifiers. Here, most closely modifies the deverbal adjective related and not the NP head works . Further problems occurred in cases where adjectival superlatives preceded deverbal adjectives: (56) An Egyptian scribe named Ahmes wrote the oldest known text to give an
Although similar to longest known , which should be classified as ADV, the superlative oldest in this context modifies the CS head text rather than the deverbal adjective known . (56) should therefore be labelled as DEF.

With 99.4% agreed accuracy, it was concluded that Annotator 1 X  X  labelling could be reliably used as gold standard for the classification of superlatives in the TextWiki corpus (cf. Sect. 6.3 ). 6.2.2 Target and comparison set identification The results of the Target and Comparison Set Identification for ISA superlatives are also positive (cf. annotation guidelines in Sect. 5.3 ). Of 116 superlatives classified as ISA-1 (89 cases) or ISA-2 (27 cases) by both annotators, there was full agreement for target and comparison set spans in 108 cases (93%). Of the eight disagreements between the two annotators, five concerned the span of ISA-1 targets.

Considering the fact that slightly over two thirds of ISA-1 superlatives (60/89) have a comparison set with at least one postmodifier, the results look very impressive. However, a closer investigation reveals that only four of these (4/60, around 7%) have a postmodifier that is marked non-restrictive by the annotators. This implies that given a postmodified comparison set, there is a chance of approximately 93% that the postmodifier is restrictive. (The probability may actually be even higher since some comparison sets have more than one postmodifier.)
Compared to ISA-1 comparison sets, ISA-1 targets are less likely to be postmodified: Only 32 out of 89 ISA-1 targets have at least one postmodifier (around 36%). However, the proportion of non-restrictive postmodifiers among them is much higher, with 16 out of 32 ISA-1 targets having a non-restrictive postmodifier (50%). In most cases these are postmodifying clauses (such as relative and non-finite clauses).

According to English comma rules, it should be possible to distinguish between non-restrictive (usually referred to as  X  X  X on-defining X  X ) and restrictive ( X  X  X efining X  X ) relative clauses by the presence or absence of a comma. In the following example, the comma after Ceres indicates that the following relative clause is to be considered non-defining: (57) [The] biggest [asteroid belt member] CS is {Ceres} T , which is about 1,000 km
However, commas are not used reliably, as the following sentence illustrates: (58) [The] most famous [diesel-hydraulic locomotive] CS is {the german V200} T
If the relative which -clause was a defining one, this would imply that there are at least two separate versions of the german V200 , which is very unlikely.

Interestingly, it seems that distinguishing between defining and non-defining relative clauses also causes problems for the annotators, even when correct comma rules have been applied: (59) {The temporary exhibition Treasures of Tutankhamun} T , held by the British
Annotator 2 X  X  target string includes the relative clause  X  X  X eld by ...  X  X , which should be considered non-restrictive in this context. The unreliability of commas in practice means that annotators must rely on their world knowledge in order to identify target and comparison set spans correctly.

With an inter-annotator agreement of 93%, we can conclude that the identifi-cation of target and comparison set spans as described in Sect. 5.3 is a well-defined and straightforward task, and can be carried out by a single annotator. 6.3 Annotation results in TextWiki After the inter-annotator study was completed successfully, all superlatives found in the TextWiki corpus were annotated according to the proposed annotation scheme. Table 7 shows the results of annotating the 1,380 superlatives found in TextWiki with their respective class label. Column 2 gives the total number of instances of each class, and Column 3 the overall distribution of superlatives classes in the corpus.
The ISA class is clearly the most populous, containing nearly one third of all superlative instances (428/1,380), which justifies the focus on this class in the present study. The high number of proportional quantifiers (25.4%) can be explained by the fact that encyclopedia entries usually define classes, and proportional quantifiers are a good way of describing properties that do not apply to all members of a class (but to most of them). The lowest frequency is found for the FREE and INDEF classes with values of 1.9 and 1.8%, respectively. 7 Conclusion and future work This article introduced a novel annotation scheme for superlatives which aims to facilitate a computational approach to superlatives on the one hand, and provide data for a more detailed theoretical investigation of the syntax and semantics of superlatives on the other hand. The first annotation classifies superlatives according to their surface form, while the second one addresses the identification of target and comparison set spans for straight-forward superlative comparisons (ISA class). In addition to providing a platform for investigating superlatives on a larger scale, the article also introduced a text-based Wikipedia corpus ( X  X  X extWiki X  X ), in which all superlative occurrences have been annotated according to the proposed annotation scheme, and which has been used to develop a tool (SRE) that can reliably distinguish between different superlative types, and identify the comparative components of ISA superlatives.

This work promises to be useful for a variety of NLP areas. Scheible ( 2009 ) discusses possible applications in Ontology Learning and Natural Language Generation, showing ways in which these areas can benefit from an automatic treatment of superlatives. Scheible ( 2010 ) describes a first practical application in the area of Sentiment Analysis/Opinion Mining. The investigation shows that ISA-1 superlatives are special indicators of product features in customer reviews, the identification of which is a major task in Opinion Mining. The study shows that the SRE tool can reliably identify such superlatives, and extract from them potential product feature strings and opinion words.

From the point of view of theoretical linguistics, the TextWiki corpus represents an interesting resource for the linguistic study of superlatives, as all superlative instances have been identified and grouped together according to their surface forms. From a computational point of view, further investigation of the DEF class comparisons, which have been shown to be of great potential interest in areas such as Opinion Mining (Scheible 2009 ). Future work might also see the implementation of a further classifier which can distinguish relative set comparisons from other semantic types in the DEF class.

The identification of the target and comparison set spans of ISA superlatives also offers interesting future research directions. Further annotations and methods could be developed that address the following issues: 1. Semantic role labelling . In order to interpret the constituents of the comparison set semantically, a suitable set of semantic roles is required. In particular, one interesting aspect will be to determine the difference between NP-head comple-ments and NP-head modifiers, defined by Huddleston and Pullum ( 2002 ) as follows:
Here, cases [i] are complements of the NP head, while cases [ii] are modifiers. It appears that complements of the superlative NP head have the role of  X  X  X efining X  X  the members of the comparison set, while modifiers have the role of restricting the set by only considering a subset of these members, for example those in specific locations or at specific times. A correct handling of these issues is crucial for the task. A first point of reference could be the work by Merlo and Leybold ( 2001 ) and Merlo and Ferrer ( 2006 ). 2. Anaphora resolution . A substantial proportion of ISA targets and comparison sets require anaphora resolution. To achieve useful semantic representations of the components of ISA comparisons, this issue will need to be addressed, and should thus be incorporated in the annotation scheme. 3. Tenses and modality . So far, the treatment of ISA superlatives does not take different tenses of the verb  X  X  X o be X  X  (or other copula verbs) into account. These may have an effect on the reliability of the comparison: Past tense forms, for example, can imply that the facts or opinions expressed by the superlative comparison are no longer correct. In addition, modality of verbs should be taken into consideration, as it may also affect the reliability of facts. 4. Negation . The annotation scheme presented in this article does not yet take negation into account. Future work will extend the annotation scheme to cover polarity. Initial investigations suggest that negated superlative relations only occur very rarely in a corpus like TextWiki, but may be more prominent in more informal registers such as customer reviews (e.g.  X  X  X he zoom on this camera is not the best. X  X ).
Finally, the TextWiki corpus itself could be extended to include a further set of top-level categories from Wikipedia, in which superlatives are identified and annotated according to the annotation scheme described in this article. This may facilitate theoretical studies of the distribution and use of superlatives across different topic areas. A larger set of annotated data would also be beneficial for implementing a machine learning approach to the classification of superlatives and the identification of their components.
