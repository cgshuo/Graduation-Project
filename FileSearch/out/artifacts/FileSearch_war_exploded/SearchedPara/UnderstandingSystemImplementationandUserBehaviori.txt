It is well said that two minds are better than one. When it comes to accessing or pro cessing some information, it seems natural to exp ect that when people work together in col-lab oration they (1) can accomplish more, (2) bene t from other people's exp erience and exp ertise on the given topic, and (3) in uence eac h other and dev elop a more profound understanding of the sub ject than when they are isolated.
While it seems that doing collab oration with others will mak e sense in man y situations, the value of collab oration is often overlo oked. Based on their extensiv e study with paten t oce work ers, Hansen and Jarv elin [2] concluded that the assumption that information retriev al performance is purely individual needs to be reconsidered. Twidale and Nic hols [4] argued that a truly user-cen tered system must ackno wledge and supp ort collab orativ e interactions between users and sho wed that users often desire to collab orate on searc h tasks. As the need to collab orate con tinues, the beha vior of users in a collab orativ e environmen ts remains under-studied, and the tools to facilitate collab orativ e information seeking have left much to be desired, my prop osed researc h for studying Collab orativ e Information Seeking (CIS) is not only timely , but also very imp ortan t.

So far my researc h has primarily been focused on the sys-tem side. For instance, my work with others has sho wn the e ectiv eness of com bing queries from di eren t users for the same topic [1], as well as of algorithmically mediating the results for a collab orativ e searc h environmen t [3]. I would now like to focus my atten tion on more user-cen tric IR sys-tems that facilitate inten tional, interactiv e, and immediate collab oration among users. As a rst step in this direc-tion, I have dev elop ed a system called Coagmento , whic h allo ws a pair of users to searc h TREC collections and col-lab orate using a set of tools for a common information need. Preliminary studies with actual users have pro vided me en-couraging results about the e ectiv eness of this system. In the course of conducting these pilot runs, it became eviden t that (1) the notion of collab oration needs to be well-de ned, (2) users may be reluctan t to collab orate e ectiv ely because of the additional cognitiv e load, and (3) evaluating various parameters of a collab orativ e environmen t is hard. I intend to run a lab study as well as a eld study with Coagmento to gain an additional understanding of this col-lab orativ e environmen t. I also plan to conduct interviews to elicit how people collab orate and what tools they need. Together these planned studies will enable me to (1) build and enhance systems and interfaces that supp ort collab ora-tive information seeking, (2) study user beha vior in a col-lab orativ e environmen t, and (3) dev elop metho dologies and evaluations for studying suc h environmen ts.

I believ e my prop osed researc h will help us understand some of the issues in collab oration for various forms of in-formation seeking and give indications to enhancing user exp erience in a collab orativ e environmen t. The results of the studies that I prop osed will augmen t our understanding of the way collab oration works and beha vior of the users in a collab orativ e environmen t. In the course of conducting my studies I shall also be dev eloping some systems and building interfaces that can serv e as the testb eds for further conduct-ing and evaluating various forms of collab orativ e pro cesses. In addition to this, I believ e I would be con tributing by dev eloping a terminology and a metho dology to study and evaluate collab orativ e environmen ts. [1] X. Fu, D. Kelly , and C. Shah.
