 movements of the series. be more time consuming. overshoot and undershoot problems to some extent. component series into the trend of it and a set of nearly mono-component sequences trend of series by now [5]. 
The procedure to decompose time series is called sifting process. If the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings of a sequence point, the sequence will be decomposed into a few IMFs the sifting process [8]. The sifting process can be expressed as follows [9]. 1. Initialize: 2. Extract the i th IMF: a) Initialize: b) Extract the local maxima and minima of d) Calculate mean of the upper and lower envelopes of e) Define: f) If IMF criteria is satisfied, then set 3. Define 4. If decomposition is completed and successfully based on the improved EMD method. 3.1 Problems of the Spline Interpolation applied choice is the piecewise cubic spline polynomial. 
A set of n+1 points order spline polynomial that is generally defined by three conditions: 1. the following two boundary conditions: 3. Two neighbored polynomials compatibility conditions: to have large swings [9] as shown in figure 1. 
From figure 1, we can see serious problems occur at the ends of the lower envelope needed to discuss in the following. 3.2 A Solution of the Problems finding successive extrema. So overshoot and undershoot problems can be alleviated and EMD method can be improved by the proposed method. found, because the proposed method gets mean envelopes by utilizing means of them. series has only one minimum or maximum. From figure 1, we can see there are two additional boundary data points and the method to find additional interior knots. will not swing widely at both ends of time series when it has fixed values to keep. We will illustrate how to find additional interior extrema by the following figure. means minima. In subgraph (a), abscissa of the first maximum is smaller than that of the first minimum. In subgraph (b), abscissa of the first maximum is bigger. 
Suppose a series has n maxima as an accurate minimum i min , two cases should be taken into account. 
When abscissa of the first maximum is smaller than that of the first minimum, the new maximum i x ma  X  can be got by formula (5). 
If abscissa of the first maximum is larger than that of the first minimum, the new maximum i x ma  X  will be gained by formula (6). accurate maxima. After successive extrema have been found, mean envelopes can be as follows. a) Initialize: b) Extract the local maxima and minima of c) Get additional boundary and interior extrema of d) Calculate means of successive extrema and interpolate them by a cubic spline to e) Define: f) If IMF criteria is satisfied, then set 
In the new sifting process, additional extrema are extracted and times of the spline problems are greatly alleviated. 3.3 Extracting Trend of Time Series Problems existed in the spline interpolation are alleviated, EMD method is improved and trend of time series can be extracted by now. following criteria: either when the component than the predetermined value, or when trend of original series
The improved EMD method can extract trend of time series perfectly and it will be proved by experiments. original one via comparing their time complexity and accuracy. experiments are stock data from http://kumo.swcp.com/stocks. There are 467 kinds of stock data after pretreatment, and they are 253-days transaction data from 2004/8/26 to 2005/8/25. We use opening prices in the following experiments. Results of this algorithm will be shown in table one and figure 3. Results of this algorithm are in table one and figure 3, too. making it even more attractive for larger databases. overshoot and undershoot problems at both ends of time series. And the trend got by descends in the middle of it. So trend got by the previous EMD method cannot give method is better at trend extraction than it. This paper discusses extracting trend of time series based on improved EMD method, of EMD and finishing trend extraction with it are the main tasks. phenomena, a novel method is proposed in this paper. We obtain mean envelopes by using simple means of successive extrema instead from the envelope mean, the times Experimental results show that improved EMD method outperforms the original one when they are used in trend extraction. planned projects for young teachers X  research funds of Anhui province (2005jq1035).
