 Opinion mining is a text understanding technology that assists users to automatically out the subject of the opinions. The opinion targets discussed in this paper are equiva-lent to attribute and features discussed in [1] and [2]. 
Many research works on target extraction have been reported. Popular approaches opinion targets, sentiment keywords, modifiers and negations. To improve coverage, the lexicon is further expanded with synsets. The corpus statistics are usually frequen-cies of co-occurrences. Ghani et al. (2006) proposes a direct solution [1], where opin-within the review texts using co-EM algorithm. It is due to these works that a funda-mental framework for opinion target system has been setup. However, there is a lot of room for improvement to achieve better performance. Study on the previous works on opinion target extraction leads to following observations. 
Human-compiled opinion targets are used as seeds in the previous researches. For brightness and image . However, they are too large to be considered effective seeds so far as granularity is concerned. One undesir able consequence of this is low coverage. seeds, more powerful patterns for opinion target extraction can be made. Meanwhile, improve coverage. relations. There are always exceptions and new occurrences of opinions despite a try to build a complete dictionary. Hence, on e cycle of opinion target extraction cannot give a satisfactory performance. 
In our work, manually compiled opinion targets are viewed as compound opinion targets and an atomization algorithm is design ed to extract atom opinion targets from the compound opinion targets. We define atom opinion target and compound opinion target as follows. Definition 1: Atom opinion target (AOT) 
An atom opinion target is an opinion target that is: Definition 2: Compound opinion target (COT) A compound opinion target is an opinion target that combines atom opinion targets in particular patterns. demand. As they are smaller and more general, the atom opinion targets are deemed better seeds for opinion target extraction. 
With atom opinion targets, the opinion target patterns (OTP) can be generated ac-curately. The atom opinion targets work effectively with synsets, so synsets can be used fully to improve coverage. Furthermore, atom opinion targets are classified into components (COM) and attributes (ATT) from the perspective of ontology to further improve power of opinion target patterns. A novel framework to organize atom opin-ion targets, compound opinion targets, synsets and opinion target patterns, the opin-targets and attribute targets are located in different layers, synsets for the atom opin-4) generate the opinion target patterns. To make the OTN more generalized, propa-gation algorithm is designed to utilize of atom opinion targets as seeds to synthesize rithm and the propagation algorithm iteratively for a few years so that the OTN can be updated and verified. Experiments on Chinese opinion target extraction show that the method outperforms the baseline by 0.078 on f-1 score in the first cycle and by 0.112 in the last cycle. clude the paper in Section 6. Opinion target extraction resear ch is either viewed as a subtask of opinion mining or taken as an independent information extraction task. We summarize the related works as follows. 
Hu and Liu (2004) proposed to find frequent opinion targets with association miner and infrequent opinion targets with syntactic patterns based on opinion words [2]. To product and proposed to identify the opinion targets connected with the product name through corresponding meronymy discriminators [4]. Ghani et al. (2006) developed a pairs. Kobayashi et al. (2007) adopted machine learning techniques to extract aspect-of relation from a blog corpus, which is viewed as statistical patterns for opinion tar-targets and sentiment keywords to find unknown opinion targets [6]. Our work is closely related to but different from the aforementioned spellings. 
The idea of seed-based learning is followed. However, unlike previous works, we atom opinion targets automatically. The atom opinion targets, being smaller and more target candidates. Synsets are also adopted in this work to organize synonyms for the atom opinion targets. Also, in addition, it is used to classify the atom opinion targets targets. 
Opinion targets including seeds and opinion target candidates are organized in lists in previous works. We design a graph-based opinion target network to maintain atom candidates and patterns. 
An iterative mechanism of the co-EM algorithm is mentioned in [1]. But their opin-ion target extraction method is still one-cycle. In this work, a bootstrapping method is method has proven worthwhile which will be shown later in the paper. 3.1 Formalism The opinion target network is a two-layer graph G OTN defined as follows, that the edges are all directed, which point fr om the subsequent atom opinion target to architecture and the edges bridging components and attributes are of peculiar interest. Meanwhile, paths in the opinion target network forms compound opinion targets and often discloses opinion target patterns. 
Note that a node within the opinion target network is a synset, which covers all al-ternative names of the component or attribute. In this work, synsets for attributes are extracted from HowNet [7] while those for components are extracted from the Opin-mine corpus [8]. 3.2 An Illustrative Case An illustrative opinion target network is given in Figure 1. button of lens and button of panel , are compound opinion targets. 
On the attribute layer, the node scale is the root attribute, which is used for catego-edges merely reflect the categories they belo ng to. Normally, there is no edge between forms a tree. that each edge in the component layer represents. The edges are just naturally created based on opinion target patterns that some atom opinion target follows to form com-pound opinion target. 3.3 The Advantages Three advantages of opinion target network have been found. (i) The inference ability comes into being as seeds b ecome cohesive and patterns effective. With atom opinion method reveals some interesting information. The opinion target network shows that, in real reviews, attributes and components must work with each other in order to form opinion targets. Another finding is that the core part of opinion is the attribute, which contacts opinion keyword explicitly or implicitly. These findings help understand how automatically. 4.1 The General Workflow alization and propagation, and executes in a bootstrapping manner (see Fig.2). 
In the workflow, the annotation review corpus provides the initial compound opin-ion target set for generalization and propagation. After the first cycle, more compound opinion targets are extracted from the raw review corpus. Then after a few cycles, size of the compound opinion target set starts to stabilize and the opinion target extraction task is deemed accomplished. opinion target patterns are generalized from the compound opinion targets, referred to plied on raw review corpus to find compound opinion targets. 
Note that in every cycle, parsers should be updated with newly obtained atom opin-ion targets so that atom opinion targets would be considered normal words in lexical analysis and dependency parsing. 4.2 Generalization nally to generate opinion target patterns from the compound opinion targets. Atomization Atom opinion targets are extracted based on degree of cohesion and degree flexibility mation [4]. The flexibility degree of word W is calculated as follows, words, and N R (x) returns those of right-neighboring words. It can be seen from Equa-cal thresholds, which are obtained in our experiments. Classification A probabilistic classifier is designed to recognize components and attributes consider-ing the following two features. (1) Average Edit Distance ( d AVG ) Average edit distance measures string similarity which is calculated as follows, the function to measure edit distance between t and x i . With Equation (2), we are able to calculate how likely it is for an atom opinion target to be from component set C or attribute set A . (2) Overall Position Tendency ( t OVA ). Overall position tendency measures how likely an atom opinion target is to be a com-ponent or an attribute according to position heuristics. In certain language, the attrib-tendency is calculated as follows, which t appears after the components. 
Note that the initial component and attribute sets are extracted from annotation re-view corpus. To improve coverage, we ex tract human-compiled attribute words from WordNet and HowNet. Finally, atom opinion target can be classified as component or attribute by simply comparing d AVG and t OVA . Clustering clustering algorithm to group the atom opinion target set into a few clusters. Then we adjust parameters to find a cluster that satisfies the following two conditions: (i) The cluster contains more than three atom opinion targets carrying same (ii) The cluster contains at least one new atom opinion targets. Once such a cluster is found, the atom opinion targets with unknown synset label are considered synonyms of the other atom opinion targets. This updates the atom opinion target set. We repeat the clustering process until no unknown atom opinion targets can be assigned any synset label. The following two features are considered in atom opin-ion target clustering. (1) Opinion words neighboring the atom opinion targets in the raw review sen-(2) Edit Distance between unknown atom opinion targets and known ones. There must be some unknown atom opinion targets that cannot be assigned any synset label. We run the clustering algorithm merely on these unknown atom opinion targets and attempt to find new synsets. A new synset is created if one cluster is found satis-fying the following two conditions. (i) The cluster contains more than three atom opinion targets. (ii) Number of atom opinion target occurrences is over three on average for this opinion target with most occurrences. unknown synset label. These atoms could be catered for in the next iteration. Patternization The opinion target patterns follow regular expressions of the form image is the synset label named after image, color the synset label named after color, and of the pattern string. 4.3 OTN Update Once new atom opinion targets and new opini on target patterns are found, we create nodes and/or edges in the OTN. Note that no node will be created if a new atom opin-ion target carries known synset label. New edges should be drawn when new opinion target patterns are found. 4.4 Propagation The propagation algorithm aims to extract unknown opinion targets with OTN. To do so, the algorithm first makes use of OTN as well as dependency parsing tool to infer candidates. Inference with Opinion Target Network OTN is capable of inferring new opinion targets with atom opinion targets and opin-ion target patterns. In other words, if an edge exists between atom opinion target syn-sets A and B , combinations between atom opinion targets in synset A and in synset B probably exist. Based on this assumption, a large number of opinion target candidates can be inferred. confidence measure on the raw review corpus to estimate how likely atom opinion tar-number of binary combinations. An empiri cal threshold for sequence confidence is set in our experiments. Inference with Dependency Relations atom opinion targets may syntactically depend on some words or vice versa. We fol-dependency-based propagation reliable, we setup the following constraints: (1) No more than four dependency relations, i.e. ATT (modifying), COO (coor-(2) Atom opinion target candidates should adjoin the known atom opinion tar-(3) An atom opinion target candidate is not adjective or pronoun. quality atom opinion targets that carry unknown synset labels. 4.5 Bootstrapping The bootstrapping algorithm dispatches the generalization and propagation algorithm when no new atom opinion target or pattern is extracted any longer. This goal can be achieved in a few cycles. 5.1 Setup Two corpora are used in our work. Opinmine corpus [8] contains 8,990 human-judged opinions on digital camera. The raw review corpus contains 6,000 reviews in the same precision (p), recall (r) and f-1 score (f) in this evaluation. 
We apply HIT Language Technology Platform [9] for Chinese word segmentation and dependency paring. 5.2 Experiments Baseline Method The baseline method is defined as the one that uses human-compiled opinion targets as seeds. To find more opinion targets, similar dependency relations and rules are also considered. The inten tion is to prove necessity and effectiveness of OTN for the opin-ion target extraction task. The fundamental difference is that OTN views atom opin-ion targets as seeds. Our Method on parameter optimization. Results method concludes in eight cycles. Experimental results are shown in Fig.3. 5.3 Discussions Two comparisons are done based on the experimental results. Firstly, we compare our baseline by 0.051 on f-1 score, in which recall is improved by 0.085 while the loss of precision was an insignificant 0.014. This proves that OTN is necessary and suitable cant loss of precision. significance of the bootstrapping process. set for every cycle in Table 1. same time. We find that with extension of the above sets, performance of our method This proves that OTN is reasonable and effective. Two issues are addressed in this paper. First, the opinion target network is proposed to manage synsets of atom opinion targets as nodes in two layers and the atom opin-ion targets interact with each other via paths that represent opinion target patterns. Second, an OTN-based opinion target extraction method is presented to extract generalization and propagation algorithms to improve overall performance in lim-ited cycles. method fits other domains such as mobile phone, movie and hotel scenarios.
