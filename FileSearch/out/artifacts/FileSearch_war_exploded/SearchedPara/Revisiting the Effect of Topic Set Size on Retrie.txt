 H.3.4 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Systems and Software X  performance evaluation Experimentation, Measurement Test Collections, Measurement Error
Evaluating retrieval systems in a controlled environment with a large set of topics has been the core paradigm in the information retrieval community. Voorhees and Buckley proposed to estimate the reliability of retrieval experiments by calculating the probability of making wrong effectiveness judgments between two retrieval systems over two retrieval experiments[2], which is called Retrieval Experiment Error Rate (REER) in this paper. They have successfully shown how the topic set sizes affect the retrieval experiment relia-bility. However, the REER model in the previous work was empirically justified without providing a derivation based on statistical principles. We fill this gap and show that REER can indeed be derived from statistical principles. Based on the derived model we can explain why a successful experi-ment design depends on factors including a sufficient num-ber of topics, large enough measurement score difference be-tween systems, and a homogeneous distribution of retrieval scores for topics and systems, which reduces the variance of the score differences.
In a TREC-like retrieval experiment, a test document col-lection and a topic set T of size |T| are given to participants, and participants run their retrieval system over the test col-lection and return rank lists for each topic. Human assessors

 of the individual event probabilities,
Pr( D  X  0) is the cumulative density function of D . From (3) we know D is normally distributed, and hence we can represent Pr( D  X  0) in the standard normal cumulative density function  X , Plug (7) back into (6), we finally obtain REER as follows, REER = 2 X 
From (8) it can be easily shown that the range of REER fall between 0 and 0.5 for the  X  function ranges between 0 and 1.
Voorhees and Buckley empirically fitted REER in the fol-lowing model [2], where b 1 and b 2 are two parameters. At the first sight the empirical model in (9) and our theoretically derived model in (8) bear no resemblance, but we will show that the empirical model in fact is an approximation of the theoretical model 3
The theoretical REER (8) is not in closed form because of the integral in the standard normal cumulative density function  X , where z is a standard normal random variable, and Erf is the so-called error function.

There have been efforts to approximate the Erf function in closed form, one of which is proposed by Williams[3] as follows,
By replacing the Erf function in (11) with the approx-imation in (12), the theoretic REER model in (8)can be approximated as follows,
If we compare the approximation in (13) with the empir-ical model in (9), they are clearly in exactly the same form. Therefore, we show that the empirical REER model pro-posed in [2] is indeed an approximation of the theoretical REER.
Note that our goal here is not to approximate REER but to show the connection between the exponential form of the empirical REER model in (9) and the theoretical REER model in (8).
