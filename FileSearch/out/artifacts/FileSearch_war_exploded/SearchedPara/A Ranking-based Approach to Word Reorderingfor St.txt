 Modeling word reordering between source and tar-get sentences has been a research focus since the emerging of statistical machine translation. In phrase-based models (Och, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003), phrase is introduced to serve as the funda-mental translation element and deal with local re-ordering, while a distance based distortion model is used to coarsely depict the exponentially decayed word movement probabilities in language transla-tion. Further work in this direction employed lexi-calized distortion models, including both generative (Koehn et al., 2005) and discriminative (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006) variants, to achieve finer-grained estimations, while other work took into account the hierarchical language structures in trans-lation (Chiang, 2005; Galley and Manning, 2008).
Long-distance word reordering between language pairs with substantial word order difference, such as Japanese with Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure and English with Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) struc-ture, is generally viewed beyond the scope of the phrase-based systems discussed above, because of either distortion limits or lack of discriminative fea-tures for modeling. The most notable solution to this problem is adopting syntax-based SMT models, es-pecially methods making use of source side syntac-tic parse trees. There are two major categories in this line of research. One is tree-to-string model (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) which directly uses source parse trees to derive a large set of translation rules and associated model parameters. The other is called syntax pre-reordering  X  an approach that re-positions source words to approximate target lan-guage word order as much as possible based on the features from source syntactic parse trees. This is usually done in a preprocessing step, and then fol-lowed by a standard phrase-based SMT system that takes the re-ordered source sentence as input to fin-ish the translation.

In this paper, we continue this line of work and address the problem of word reordering based on source syntactic parse trees for SMT. Similar to most previous work, our approach tries to rearrange the source tree nodes sharing a common parent to mimic the word order in target language. To this end, we propose a simple but effective ranking-based ap-proach to word reordering. The ranking model is automatically derived from the word aligned parallel data, viewing the source tree nodes to be reordered as list items to be ranked. The ranks of tree nodes are determined by their relative positions in the target language  X  the node in the most front gets the high-est rank, while the ending word in the target sentence gets the lowest rank. The ranking model is trained to directly minimize the mis-ordering of tree nodes, which differs from the prior work based on maxi-mum likelihood estimations of reordering patterns (Li et al., 2007; Genzel, 2010), and does not require any special tweaking in model training. The ranking model can not only be used in a pre-reordering based SMT system, but also be integrated into a phrase-based decoder serving as additional distortion fea-tures.
 We evaluated our approach on large-scale Japanese-English and English-Japanese machine translation tasks, and experimental results show that our approach can bring significant improvements to the baseline phrase-based SMT system in both pre-ordering and integrated decoding settings.

In the rest of the paper, we will first formally present our ranking-based word reordering model, then followed by detailed steps of modeling train-ing and integration into a phrase-based SMT system. Experimental results are shown in Section 5. Section 6 consists of more discussions on related work, and Section 7 concludes the paper. Given a source side parse tree T e , the task of word reordering is to transform T e to T 0 e , so that e 0 match the word order in target language as much as possible. In this work, we only focus on reordering that can be obtained by permuting children of every tree nodes in T e . We use children to denote direct de-scendants of tree nodes for constituent trees; while for dependency trees, children of a node include not only all direct dependents, but also the head word itself. Figure 1 gives a simple example showing the word reordering between English and Japanese. By rearranging the position of tree nodes in the English Figure 1: An English-to-Japanese sentence pair. By permuting tree nodes in the parse tree, the source sentence is reordered into the target language or-der. Constituent tree is shown above the source sentence; arrows below the source sentences show head-dependent arcs for dependency tree; word alignment links are lines without arrow between the source and target sentences. parse tree, we can obtain the same word order of Japanese translation. It is true that tree-based re-ordering cannot cover all word movement operations in language translation, previous work showed that this method is still very effective in practice (Xu et al., 2009, Visweswariah et al., 2010).

Following this principle, the word reordering task can be broken into sub-tasks, in which we only need to determine the order of children nodes for all non-leaf nodes in the source parse tree. For a tree node t with children { c 1 ,c 2 ,...,c n } , we re-arrange the children to target-language-like order { c position  X  ( i ) of child c i as its  X  rank  X , the reorder-ing problem is naturally translated into a ranking problem: to reorder, we determine a  X  X ank X  for each child, then the children are sorted according to their  X  X anks X . As it is often impractical to directly assign a score for each permutation due to huge number of possible permutations, a widely used method is to use a real valued function f to assign a value to each node, which is called a ranking function (Herbrich et al., 2000). If we can guarantee ( f ( i )  X  f ( j )) and (  X  ( i )  X   X  ( j )) always has the same sign, we can get the same permutation as  X  because values of f are only used to sort the children. For example, con-sider the node rooted at trying in the dependency tree in Figure 1. Four children form a list { I , am , try-ing , play } to be ranked. Assuming ranking function f can assign values { 0 . 94 ,  X  1 . 83 ,  X  1 . 50 ,  X  1 . 20 } for { I , am , trying , play } respectively, we can get a sorted list { I , play , trying , am } , which is the desired permutation according to the target.

More formally, for a tree node t with children { c 1 ,c 2 ,...,c n } , our ranking model assigns a rank f ( c i ,t ) for each child c i , then the children are sorted according to the rank in a descending order. The ranking function f has the following form: where the  X  j is a feature representing the tree node t and its child c i , and w j is the corresponding feature weight. To learn ranking function in Equation (1), we need to determine the feature set  X  and learn weight vector w from reorder examples. In this section, we first describe how to extract reordering examples from parallel corpus; then we show our features for rank-ing function; finally, we discuss how to train the model from the extracted examples. 3.1 Reorder Example Acquisition For a sentence pair ( e,f,a ) with syntax tree T e on the source side, we need to determine which re-ordered tree T 0 e 0 best represents the word order in target sentence f . For a tree node t in T e , if its chil-dren align to disjoint target spans, we can simply ar-range them in the order of their corresponding target Figure 2: Fragment of a sentence pair. (a) shows gold alignment; (b) shows automatically generated alignment which contains errors. spans. Figure 2 shows a fragment of one sentence pair in our training data. Consider the subtree rooted at word  X  Problem  X . With the gold alignment,  X  Prob-lem  X  is aligned to the 5th target word, and  X  with latter procedure  X  are aligned to target span [1, 3], thus we can simply put  X  Problem  X  after  X  with latter procedure  X . Recursively applying this process down the subtree, we get  X  latter procedure with Problem  X  which perfectly matches the target language.
As pointed out by (Li et al., 2007), in practice, nodes often have overlapping target spans due to er-roneous word alignment or different syntactic struc-tures between source and target sentences. (b) in Figure 2 shows the automatically generated align-ment for the sentence pair fragment. The word  X  with  X  is incorrectly aligned to the 6th Japanese word  X  ha  X ; as a result,  X  with latter procedure  X  now has target span [1, 6], while  X  Problem  X  aligns to [5, 5]. Due to this overlapping, it becomes unclear which permutation of  X  Problem  X  and  X  with latter procedure  X  is a better match of the target phrase; we need a better metric to measure word order similar-ity between reordered source and target sentences. We choose to find the tree T 0 e 0 with minimal align-ment crossing-link number ( CLN ) (Genzel, 2010) to f as our golden reordered tree. 1 Each crossing-link ( i 1 j 1 ,i 2 j 2 ) is a pair of alignment links crossing each other. CLN reaches zero if f is monotonically aligned to e 0 , and increases as there are more word reordering between e 0 and f . For example, in Fig-ure 1, there are 6 crossing-links in the original tree: ( e ( e nal tree is 6. CLN for the reordered tree is 0 as there are no crossing-links. This metric is easy to com-pute, and is not affected by unaligned words (Gen-zel, 2010).
 We need to find the reordered tree with minimal CLN among all reorder candidates. As the number of candidates is in the magnitude exponential with respect to the degree of tree T e 2 , it is not always computationally feasible to enumerate through all candidates. Our solution is as follows.

First, we give two definitions.  X  CLN ( t ) : the number of crossing-links  X  CCLN ( t ) : the number of crossing-links Apparently CLN of a tree T 0 equals to CLN ( root of T 0 ) , and CLN ( t ) can be recur-sively expressed as: Take the original tree in Figure 1 for example. At the root node trying , CLN ( trying ) is 6 because there are six crossing-links under its sub-span: ( e 1 j 4 ,e 2 j 3 ( e and ( e 4 j 2 ,e 5 j 1 ) . On the other hand, CCLN ( trying ) is 5 because ( e 4 j 2 ,e 5 j 1 ) falls under its child node play , thus does not count towards CCLN of trying . From the definition, we can easily see that CCLN ( t ) can be determined solely by the order of t  X  X  direct children, and CLN ( t ) is only affected by the reorder in the subtree of t . This observation en-ables us to divide the task of finding the reordered tree T 0 e 0 with minimal CLN into independently find-ing the children permutation of each node with min-imal CCLN . Unfortunately, the time cost for the sub-task is still O ( n !) for a node with n children. Instead of enumerating through all permutations, we only search the Inversion Transduction Grammar neigh-borhood of the initial sequence (Tromble, 2009). As pointed out by (Tromble, 2009), the ITG neighbor-hood is large enough for reordering task, and can be searched through efficiently using a CKY decoder.
After finding the best reordered tree T 0 e 0 , we can extract one reorder example from every node with more than one child. 3.2 Features Features for the ranking model are extracted from source syntax trees. For English-to-Japanese task, we extract features from Stanford English Depen-dency Tree (Marneffe et al., 2006), including lexi-cons, Part-of-Speech tags, dependency labels, punc-tuations and tree distance between head and depen-dent. For Japanese-to-English task, we use a chunk-based Japanese dependency tree (Kudo and Mat-sumoto, 2002). Different from features for English, we do not use dependency labels because they are not available from the Japanese parser. Additionally, Japanese function words are also included as fea-tures because they are important grammatical clues. The detailed feature templates are shown in Table 1. 3.3 Learning Method There are many well studied methods available to learn the ranking function from extracted examples., ListNet ( ? ) etc. We choose to use RankingSVM (Herbrich et al., 2000), a pair-wised ranking method, for its simplicity and good performance.

For every reorder example t with children { c 1 ,c 2 ,...,c n } and their desired permutation { c set of pair-wised training instances. For any two children nodes c i and c j with i &lt; j , we extract a positive instance if  X  ( i ) &lt;  X  ( j ) , otherwise we ex-tract a negative instance. The feature vector for both positive instance and negative instance is (  X  c where  X  c
E-J c l c l  X  dst c l  X  pct c l  X  dst  X  pct c l  X  lc l c l  X  rc l c l  X  lc l  X  dst c l  X  rc l  X  dst c l  X  c lex c l  X  h lex  X  dst c l  X  c lex  X  pct c l  X  c lex  X  pct c l  X  h lex  X  pct c l  X  h lex  X  pct
J-E c tf  X  rc t c tf  X  lc t  X  dst c l  X  rc t  X  dst Table 1: Feature templates for ranking function. All templates are implicitly conjuncted with the pos tag of head node. c : child to be ranked; h : head node lc : left sibling of c ; rc : right sibling of c l : dependency label; t : pos tag lex : top frequency lexicons f : Japanese function word dst : tree distance between c and h pct : punctuation node between c and h respectively. In this way, ranking function learning is turned into a simple binary classification problem, which can be easily solved by a two-class linear sup-port vector machine. There are two ways to integrate the ranking reorder-ing model into a phrase-based SMT system: the pre-reorder method, and the decoding time constraint method.

For pre-reorder method, ranking reorder model is applied to reorder source sentences during both training and decoding. Reordered sentences can go through the normal pipeline of a phrase-based de-coder.

The ranking reorder model can also be integrated into a phrase based decoder. Integrated method takes the original source sentence e as input, and ranking model generates a reordered e 0 as a word order ref-erence for the decoder. A simple penalty scheme is utilized to penalize decoder reordering violating ranking reorder model X  X  prediction e 0 . In this paper, our underlying decoder is a CKY decoder follow-ing Bracketing Transduction Grammar (Wu, 1997; Xiong et al., 2006), thus we show how the penalty is implemented in the BTG decoder as an example. Similar penalty can be designed for other decoders without much effort.

Under BTG, three rules are used to derive transla-tions: one unary terminal rule, one straight rule and one inverse rule: We have three penalty triggers when any rules are applied during decoding:  X  Discontinuous penalty f dc : it fires for all rules  X  Wrong straight rule penalty f st : it fires for  X  Wrong inverse rule penalty f iv : it fires for in-The above three penalties are added as additional features into the log-linear model of the phrase-based system. Essentially they are soft constraints to encourage the decoder to choose translations with word order similar to the prediction of ranking re-order model. To test our ranking reorder model, we carry out ex-periments on large scale English-To-Japanese, and Japanese-To-English translation tasks. 5.1 Data 5.1.1 Evaluation Data We collect 3,500 Japanese sentences and 3,500 English sentences from the web. They come from a wide range of domains, such as technical docu-ments, web forum data, travel logs etc. They are manually translated into the other language to pro-duce 7,000 sentence pairs, which are split into two parts: 2,000 pairs as development set ( dev ) and the other 5,000 pairs as test set ( web test).

Beside that, we collect another 999 English sen-tences from newswire domain which are translated into Japanese to form an out-of-domain test data set ( news test). 5.1.2 Parallel Corpus
Our parallel corpus is crawled from the web, containing news articles, technical documents, blog entries etc. After removing duplicates, we have about 18 million sentence pairs, which contain about 270 millions of English tokens and 320 millions of Japanese tokens. We use Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to generate the word alignment for the parallel corpus. 5.1.3 Monolingual Corpus
Our monolingual Corpus is also crawled from the web. After removing duplicate sentences, we have a corpus of over 10 billion tokens for both English and Japanese. This monolingual corpus is used to train a 4-gram language model for English and Japanese respectively. 5.2 Parsers For English, we train a dependency parser as (Nivre and Scholz, 2004) on WSJ portion of Penn Tree-bank, which are converted to dependency trees us-ing Stanford Parser (Marneffe et al., 2006). We con-vert the tokens in training data to lower case, and re-tokenize the sentences using the same tokenizer from our MT system.

For Japanese parser, we use CABOCHA, a chunk-based dependency parser (Kudo and Mat-sumoto, 2002). Some heuristics are used to adapt CABOCHA generated trees to our word segmenta-tion. 5.3 Settings 5.3.1 Baseline System We use a BTG phrase-based system with a Max-Ent based lexicalized reordering model (Wu, 1997; Xiong et al., 2006) as our baseline system for both English-to-Japanese and Japanese-to-English Experiment. The distortion model is trained on the same parallel corpus as the phrase table using a home implemented maximum entropy trainer.

In addition, a pre-reorder system using manual rules as (Xu et al., 2009) is included for the English-to-Japanese experiment (ManR-PR). Manual rules are tuned by a bilingual speaker on the development set. 5.3.2 Ranking Reordering System
Ranking reordering model is learned from the same parallel corpus as phrase table. For efficiency reason, we only use 25% of the corpus to train our reordering model. LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) is used to do the SVM optimization for RankingSVM.
We test it on both pre-reorder setting ( Rank-PR ) and integrated setting ( Rank-IT ). 5.4 End-to-End Result E-J J-E Table 2: BLEU(%) score on dev and test data for both E-J and J-E experiment. All settings signifi-cantly improve over the baseline at 95% confidence level. Baseline is the BTG phrase system system; ManR-PR is pre-reorder with manual rule; Rank-PR is pre-reorder with ranking reorder model; Rank-IT is system with integrated ranking reorder model.
From Table 2, we can see our ranking reordering model significantly improves the performance for both English-to-Japanese and Japanese-to-English experiments over the BTG baseline system. It also out-performs the manual rule set on English-to-Japanese result, but the difference is not significant. 5.5 Reordering Performance In order to show whether the improved performance is really due to improved reordering, we would like to measure the reorder performance directly.
As we do not have access to a golden re-ordered sentence set, we decide to use the align-ment crossing-link numbers between aligned sen-tence pairs as the measure for reorder performance.
We train the ranking model on 25% of our par-allel corpus, and use the rest 75% as test data ( auto ). We sample a small corpus (575 sentence pairs) and do manual alignment ( man-small ). We denote the automatic alignment for these 575 sen-tences as ( auto-small ). From Table 3, we can see E-J J-E Table 3: Reorder performance measured by crossing-link number per sentence. None means the original sentences without reordering; Oracle means the best permutation allowed by the source parse tree; ManR refers to manual reorder rules; Rank means ranking reordering model. our ranking reordering model indeed significantly reduces the crossing-link numbers over the original sentence pairs. On the other hand, the performance of the ranking reorder model still fall far short of or-acle, which is the lowest crossing-link number of all possible permutations allowed by the parse tree. By manual analysis, we find that the gap is due to both errors of the ranking reorder model and errors from word alignment and parser.

Another thing to note is that the crossing-link number of manual alignment is higher than auto-matic alignment. The reason is that our annotators tend to align function words which might be left un-aligned by automatic word aligner. 5.6 Effect of Ranking Features Here we examine the effect of features for ranking reorder model. We compare their influence on Rank-ingSVM accuracy, alignment crossing-link number, end-to-end BLEU score, and the model size. As Table 4 shows, a major part of reduction of CLN comes from features such as Part-of-Speech tags,
E-J
J-E Table 4: Effect of ranking features. Acc. is Rank-ingSVM accuracy in percentage on the training data; CLN is the crossing-link number per sentence on parallel corpus with automatically generated word alignment; BLEU is the BLEU score in percentage on web test set on Rank-IT setting (system with in-tegrated rank reordering model); lex n means n most frequent lexicons in the training corpus. dependency labels (for English), function words (for Japanese), and the distance and punctuations be-tween child and head. These features also corre-spond to BLEU score improvement for End-to-End evaluations. Lexicon features generally continue to improve the RankingSVM accuracy and reduce CLN on training data, but they do not bring further im-provement for SMT systems beyond the top 100 most frequent words. Our explanation is that less frequent lexicons tend to help local reordering only, which is already handled by the underlying phrase-based system. 5.7 Performance on different domains From Table 2 we can see that pre-reorder method has higher BLEU score on news test, while integrated model performs better on web test set which con-tains informal texts. By error analysis, we find that the parser commits more errors on informal texts, and informal texts usually have more flexible trans-lations. Pre-reorder method makes  X  X ard X  decision before decoding, thus is more sensitive to parser er-rors; on the other hand, integrated model is forced to use a longer distortion limit which leads to more search errors during decoding time. It is possible to use system combination method to get the best of both systems, but we leave this to future work. There have been several studies focusing on compil-ing hand-crafted syntactic reorder rules. Collins et al. (2005), Wang et al. (2007), Ramanathan et al. (2008), Lee et al. (2010) have developed rules for German-English, Chinese-English, English-Hindi and English-Japanese respectively. Xu et al. (2009) designed a clever precedence reordering rule set for translation from English to several SOV languages. The drawback for hand-crafted rules is that they de-pend upon expert knowledge to produce and are lim-ited to their targeted language pairs.

Automatically learning syntactic reordering rules have also been explored in several work. Li et al. (2007) and Visweswariah et al. (2010) learned probability of reordering patterns from constituent trees using either Maximum Entropy or maximum likelihood estimation. Since reordering patterns are matched against a tree node together with all its direct children, data sparseness problem will arise when tree nodes have many children (Li et al., 2007); Visweswariah et al. (2010) also men-tioned their method yielded no improvement when applied to dependency trees in their initial experi-ments. Genzel (2010) dealt with the data sparseness problem by using window heuristic, and learned re-ordering pattern sequence from dependency trees. Even with the window heuristic, they were unable to evaluate all candidates due to the huge num-ber of possible patterns. Different from the pre-vious approaches, we treat syntax-based reordering as a ranking problem between different source tree nodes. Our method does not require the source nodes to match some specific patterns, but encodes reordering knowledge in the form of a ranking func-tion, which naturally handles reordering between any number of tree nodes; the ranking function is trained by well-established rank learning method to minimize the number of mis-ordered tree nodes in the training data.

Tree-to-string systems (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) model syntactic reordering using minimal or composed translation rules, which may contain reordering involving tree nodes from multiple tree levels. Our method can be naturally extended to deal with such multiple level reordering. For a tree-to-string rule with multiple tree levels, instead of rank-ing the direct children of the root node, we rank all leaf nodes (Most are frontier nodes (Galley et al., 2006)) in the translation rule. We need to redesign our ranking feature templates to encode the reorder-ing information in the source part of the translation rules. We need to remember the source side con-text of the rules, the model size would still be much smaller than a full-fledged tree-to-string system be-cause we do not need to explicitly store the target variants for each rule. In this paper we present a ranking based reorder-ing method to reorder source language to match the word order of target language given the source side parse tree. Reordering is formulated as a task to rank different nodes in the source side syntax tree accord-ing to their relative position in the target language. The ranking model is automatically trained to min-imize the mis-ordering of tree nodes in the training data. Large scale experiment shows improvement on both reordering metric and SMT performance, with up to 1.73 point BLEU gain in our evaluation test.
In future work, we plan to extend the ranking model to handle reordering between multiple lev-els of source trees. We also expect to explore bet-ter way to integrate ranking reorder model into SMT system instead of a simple penalty scheme. Along the research direction of preprocessing the source language to facilitate translation, we consider to not only change the order of the source language, but also inject syntactic structure of the target language into source language by adding pseudo words into source sentences.
