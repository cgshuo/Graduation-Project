 Gravity R&amp;D has been providi ng recommendation engines as SaaS solutions since 2009. The company has a strong research focus and recommendation quality has always been their primary recommendation algorithms are of little use to our technology team as a result of the superior ity of our in-house developed, proprietary algorithms. Gravity R&amp;D experienced many challenges while scaling up their services. The sheer quantity of data handled on a daily basis increased exponentially. This presentation will cover how overcoming these challenges perm anently shaped our algorithms and system architecture used to generate these recommendations. computation and data access for every single request. To generate responses in real-time, current us er inputs have to be compared against their history in order to deliver accurate recommendations. We then combine this user inform ation with specific details about available items as the next step in the recommendation process. It becomes more difficult to provide accurate recommendations as the number of transactions and items increase. It also becomes difficult because this type of analysis requires the combination of multiple heterogeneous algorithms that all require different inputs. Initially, the architecture was designed for MF based models and serving huge numbers of request s but with a limited number of items. Now, Gravity is using MF, neighborhood based models and metadata based models to generate recommendations for millions of items within their databases. This required a shift from a monolithic architecture with in-process caching to a more service increase in the number of com ponents and number of clients, managing the infrastructure can be quite difficult. Even with these challenges, we don X  t believe that it is worthwhile to use a fully distributed system. It adds unneeded complexity, resources, and overhead to the system. We prefer an approach of firstly optimizing current algorithms and architecture and only moving to a distributed system when no other options are left.

After successes in the Netflix Prize competition, the research team transformed into a company providing recommendation and personalization solutions on a Software as a Service basis for companies all over the world. As one of the founders of the company, he has been working at Gravity R&amp;D since its origination and has been continuously nurturing the development of its recommendation engine from the beginning. In the last couple of years the company scaled up exponentially. This occurred not only in the number of recommendations served per day, from several million to more than 100 million, but also in the number of recommendable items stored in their database, which went from a couple thousand to tens of millions. Simultaneously, the company increased the number of recommendation and personalizati on related features. A new focus has been undertaken, focusing on the quality of the user experience and also improving the quality of the proprietary algorithmic features. Botty X n has contributed in this evolution in several ways from developing the data mining tools, designing the system architecture, and devel opment of the operation workflow. recommendation algorithms in real world problems to help Gravity X  X  clients deliver more engaging and relevant user KPIs.
