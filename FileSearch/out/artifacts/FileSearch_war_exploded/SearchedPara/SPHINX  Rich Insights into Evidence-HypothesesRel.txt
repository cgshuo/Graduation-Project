 We demonstrate our SPHINX system that not only derives but also visualizes evidence-hypotheses relationships on a parameter space of belief and plausibility. SPHINX facilitates the analyst to inter-actively explore the contribution of different pieces of evidence to-wards the hypotheses. The key technical contributions of SPHINX include both computational and visual dimensions. The computa-tional contributions cover (a.) flexible computational model selec-tion; and (b.) real-time incremental strength computations. The vi-sual contributions include (a.) sense-making over parameter space; (b.) filtering and abstraction options; (c.) novel visual displays such as evidence glyph and skyline views. Using two real datasets, we will demonstrate that the SPHINX system provides the analysts with rich insights into evidence-hypothesis relationships facilitat-ing the discovery and decision making process.
 H.5.0 [ INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION ]: General Hypothesis testing, evidence gathering, visual analytics
Motivation. Confirmatory hypothesis testing is widely used in domains from scientific discoveries in physics, biology and medicine, forensic investigation to weather forecasting [2,3]. Yet, existing hy-pothesis analysis tools [2 X 4] have two key limitations.First, these tools are heavily dependent on the domain knowledge and exper-tise of analysts. Analysts drive all activities including formulating hypotheses, devising experiments, assigning weights to collected evidence and selecting the tests to apply. For large amounts of data observed or generated for such analysis, it becomes virtually im-possible to manually inspect all the data to extract evidence sup-porting or refuting a particular hypothesis. Despite much domain  X

 knowledge and ample experience, the analyst may still not be aware of certain relevant evidence hidden within the abundant data.
Existing tools [2 X 4] also lack support for sense-making of the evidence-hypothesis relationships. Some static aspects may be avail-able apriori, e.g., (a.) evidence collected for each hypothesis; and (b.) analyst X  X  estimated belief in some evidence. Yet certain dy-namic aspects are only learnt during the testing process including (a.) combined effect of multiple evidence on a hypothesis; (b.) cor-relation among multiple hypotheses. At times, the analysts may give undue importance to some evidence while overlooking other genuine pieces of evidence that may be hidden due to the sheer size or complexity of the datasets and models [3]. Insights, such as how the inclusion or exclusion of an evidence may influence the hypothesis strength computation, or which evidence group domi-nates the computation, may be particularly useful in complex de-cision support systems with a large number of hypotheses being tested, with an overwhelmingly large evidence set per hypothesis. Unfortunately, existing hypotheses analysis tools [2 X 4], that em-ploy black box computations, are ill-equipped to handle dynamic hypotheses analysis scenarios as motivated below.

Example Scenario. An insurance analyst performs predictive analytics about potential health risks, e.g., collecting evidence to-wards frequent infections leading to Pneumonia. While analyzing reported cases of Pneumonia [6] she takes into account four single-ton hypothesis, namely, (a.) bacterial; (b.) viral; (c.) fungal; and (d.) parasitic. For example, the analyst may infer that patient X contracted Pneumonia from { bacteria } . Further, Pnuemonia may be contracted due to a composite hypothesis (e.g., { bacteria, viral } ). Collection of individual hypotheses forms the frame of discern-ment , denoted by  X  = { bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic } . Figure 1 depicts all possible hypotheses for Pneumonia.

Sources ranging from hospital reports, regional health alerts to past outbreak records can provide valuable evidence for this anal-ysis. Yet another source is social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook [8]. A good number of messages on these sites may con-vey implicit or explicit health information. Posts such as " I could not get out of bed today ", " The pharmacy was out of flu shots ", and " The doc says I have a stomach bug " could be used as evidence towards a flu outbreak.

The analyst assigns belief to pieces of evidence of different types such as posts clustered on geolocation, and posts correlating symp-toms (e.g., itchy eyes) with a viral infection (e.g., conjunctivitis). The overall likelihood of an outbreak hypothesis is computed by combining the belief values of all evidence confirming (or, discon-firming) the hypothesis. The analyst must tackle real-world ambi-guities and noise. For example, the post " I have itchy eyes " does not distinguish "itchy eyes in conjunctivitis" from those "due to prolonged use of contact lenses". Support for computationally and visually analyzing multiple evidence in terms of their combined ef-fect on the hypotheses scores may provide valuable insights. In addition, features such as filtering, decluttering and evidence visu-alization are required to deal with a large set of evidence.
Demonstration. In this paper, we present the S calable P attern and H ypothes I s a N alysis using X mdvtool ( SPHINX ) system. The open-source XmdvTool [11] software is being developed at WPI for over 15 years with six NSF grants. SPHINX extends XmdvTool to support interactive parameter space exploration of Evidence-Hypotheses (E-H) relationships. It enables analysts to compare and contrast pieces of evidence towards multiple hypothesis and analyze their individual as well as combined effect on the hypothe-ses scores. We tackle both computational and visual challenges. The computational contributions cover (a.) flexible computational model selection; and (b.) real-time incremental strength compu-tations. The visual contributions include (a.) sense-making over parameter space; (b.) multiple filtering and abstraction options; (c.) novel evidence glyph and skyline visual displays. We demonstrate SPHINX using real datasets emotions [7] and iris [9]. [4] proposes traditional hypothesis testing methods. [1, 2] em-phasize on the evidence aggregation process to compute strength of a hypothesis using models such as Certainty Factor (CF) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) [2]. [3] developed an automated hypothesis generation and analysis system. While, these techniques provide only blackbox computation of strength scores; our SPHINX sys-tem, instead, provides an interactive parameter space view for rich insights into Evidence-Hypotheses relationships.
Figure 2 depicts the SPHINX Framework. SPHINX Explorer supports user interactions via Hypotheses and Evidence views. The Hypothesis View enables analysts to visually navigate through the evidence groups supporting different hypotheses distributed on the belief-plausibility parameter space (or the bp-space ). The Ev-idence View displays the details of the selected evidence groups. The Evidence Extraction module extracts evidence from disparate sources, disambiguates them and stores them in the evidence store. The Evidence-Hypothesis (E-H) Score Computation module han-dles on-the-fly recomputation ofscores based on user selections.
The E-H Score Computation module establishes and maintains the evidence-hypotheses relationships. SPHINX uses well-defined measures such as belief and plausibility [1, 2]. Strength of a hy-pothesis is represented as a combination of the belief values of the evidence confirming or disconfirming it. The chosen model (e.g., CF or DS) combines two pieces of evidence based on their relation-ship (see [1, 2] for details). The Evidence-Hypotheses relationships can be visually explored on the SPHINX Explorer .
SPHINX encompasses several computational and visual innova-tions to enable interactive exploration of E-H relationships. The key computational contributions of SPHINX are as follows.
Flexible Computational Model Selection. Analysts may prefer to use alternate computational models that best fit their data and domain. Therefore, SPHINX allows flexibility to plug in any com-putational model for aggregating beliefs of evidence to compute hypotheses scores including Certainty Factor (CF) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) models [1, 2]. Further, in addition to belief and plau-sibility other measures can also be used for the parameter space instead of or in conjunction with our chosen measures.

Incremental Strength Computations. Rapid responsiveness is a key requirement for interactive systems. When analysts filter out evidence, recomputing hypothesis scores from scratch may have unacceptably high response times. We thus devise an incremental strength computation algorithm such that the response times are within acceptable time range even for huge numbers of evidence and hypotheses. The incremental algorithm uses the insight that if, for a hypothesis, out of 100 pieces of evidence, 10 are filtered out; instead of recomputing the new score from scratch using the 90 pieces, the old score (previously computed using 100 pieces) can be adjusted by considering the 10 filtered pieces with the opposite effect. Thus, previously confirming (disconfirming) filtered pieces are now accounted as disconfirming (confirming). The SPHINX Explorer has the following contributions.

Sense-making over Parameter Space. SPHINX enables the analysts to interactively investigate the bp-space via a rich set of novel exploratory interactions. Different hypotheses are depicted with distinct colors, whereas the evidence types are shown on the bp-space in different shapes. In Fig. 3 green triangles denote evi-dence of type eye aperture ( triangle ) towards hypothized emotion surprise ( green ).

The supported interactions provide insights at two granularities, namely, Hypothesis and Evidence views (Fig. 3). For example, one interesting pattern could the analysts can observe are the distribu-tions of evidence within the bp-space by hypothesis for different datasets. In Fig. 3 the overall scores of two hypotheses H fear ) and H 2 (e.g., anger ) are similar, yet in reality fear has several medium to low belief evidence and anger has fewer yet with high belief and plausibility evidence. The visual display helps the au-dience to visualize such subtle differences between such hypothe-ses. Similar insights on contributions of different evidence types are useful. For example, SPHINX discovers the significance of petal width in distinguishing different iris species.
Filter and Abstraction Options. Huge number of evidence pieces may clutter the bp-space and hinder sense-making. SPHINX provides multiple filter and zoom options based on hypotheses, ev-idence types, belief and plausibility. We also cluster co-located evi-dence groups into rectangular boxes to avoid cluttered view similar to our prior work [5]. Analysts can select certain evidence groups and explore their details in the tabular Evidence view (Fig. 3-RHS).
Evidence Glyph View. Beyond the straightforward tabular view (Fig. 3-RHS), we designed a novel evidence glyph view (Fig. 4-RHS) to facilitate efficient visual analysis of evidence sets. Glyphs are effective visualizations for shape comparisons as well as find-ing clusters or outliers by applying glyph placement strategies. A comprehensive taxonomy of glyph placement strategies has been studied in [10]. However, we are the first to employ glyph visual-izations for evidence groups and explore placement strategies (Fig. 5) in the context of our proposed evidence glyph view. The glyphs are also color coded to match the corresponding hypotheses.
Evidence Skyline View. In Fig. 6, consider evidence E 1 E . While E 1 .plausibility &gt; E 2 .plausibility, E 1 .belief &lt; E Thus, neither of them fully dominates the other on both measures. Such pareto-optimal pieces of evidence can be displayed to analysts using the skyline view for them to explore.

The key innovations of SPHINX will be demonstrated using two popular real datasets emotions [7] (Fig. 3) and iris [9] (Fig. 4).
Hypothesis View. In the hypothesis view (LHS of Fig. 3) the pieces of evidence are plotted on the two-dimensional bp-space . The hypothesis scores are displayed on the scoring bar (Fig. 3-RHS). As described in Sec. 4.2, interesting patterns of the E-H relationships can be observed using different colors and shapes.
Using the hypotheses drop down menu, the audience may select a subset of hypotheses by control+click such that only the evidence corresponding to the selected hypotheses are displayed. In Fig. 3, only the emotions anger , surprise and fear are chosen. Further, the evidence drop down menu is used to filter the evidence type(s) an-alysts want to view. These filtering features are useful in cases of overcrowding of evidence on the bp-space. We will also demon-strate the evidence skyline view as described in Section 4.2.
Evidence View. The RHS of Fig. 3 depicts the evidence view that lists the details of evidence valid within the selected hypothesis and evidence types via cross links between the views. The evidence can be viewed either in a table (Fig. 3) or as glyphs [10] (Fig. 4). The glyphs can further be clustered using layout strategies (Fig. 5).
Belief-Plausibility Slider. Fig. 4 depicts the bp-slider. The bp-slider is adjusted to filter out evidence (shown in grey) and the scor-ing bar is incrementally refreshed with the new scores.

Conclusion: We demonstrate our SPHINX system that provides rich insights into the E-H relationships.
