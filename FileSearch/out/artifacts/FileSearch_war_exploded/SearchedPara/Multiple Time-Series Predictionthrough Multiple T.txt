 Previous studies have found that in multiple time-series data relating to real world phenomena in the Biological and Economic domains, dynamic relation-ships between series exist, and being go verned by them these series move together through time. For instance, it is well known that movement of a stock market index in a specific country is affected by the movements of other stock market indexes across the world or in that particular region [1],[2],[3]. Likewise, in a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) the expression level of a Gene is determined by its time varying interactions with other Genes [4],[5].

However, even though time-series prediction has been extensively researched, and some prominent methods from the machine learning and data mining arenas such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines have been developed, there has been no research so far into developing a method that can predict multiple time-series simultaneously based on interactions between the series. The closest researches that take into account mul tiple time-series variables are that of ([6],[7],[8],[9]) which generally used historical values of some independent variables as inputs to a model that estimates future values of a dependent variable. Consequently, these methods do not have the capability to capture and model the dynamics of relationships in multiple time-series dataset and to predict their future values simultaneously.

This research proposes a new method for modeling the dynamics of relation-ships in multiple time-series and to simultaneously predict their future values without the need for generating multipl e models. The work thus focuses on the discovery of profiles of relationships in multiple time-series dataset and the recur-ring trends of movement that occur in a specific relationship X  X  form to construct a knowledge repository of the system under evaluation. The identification and exploitation of these profil es and recurring trends is expected to provide knowl-edge to perform simultaneous multiple time-series prediction, and that it would also significantly improve the accu racy of time-series prediction.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows; in the next section we briefly re-view the issues involved in time-series modeling and cover the use of both Global and Localized models. Section 3 describes and explains the method proposed in this paper to discover profiles of relationships in multiple time-series dataset and their recurring trends of movement . In section 4 we present our experimen-tal findings, and to end with, in section 5 we conclude the paper summarizing the main achievements of the research and briefly outline some directions for future research. In the last few decades, the use of a singl e global model to forecast future events based on known past events has been a very popular approach in the data mining and knowledge discovery area [10]. Global models are built using all available historical data and thus can be used to predict future trends. However, the trajectories that global models produce oft en fail to track localized changes that take place at discrete points in time. This is due to the fact that trajectories tend to smooth localized deviations by averagi ng the effects of such deviations over a long period of time. In reality localized disturbances may be of great significance as they capture the conditions under which a time-series deviates from the norm.
Furthermore, it is of interest to capture similar deviations from a global tra-jectory that take place repeatedly over time, in other words to capture recurring deviations from the norm that are similar in shape and magnitude. Such local-ized phenomena can only be captured accu rately by localized models that are built only on data that define the phenomenon under consideration and are not contaminated by data outside the underlying localized phenomenon.
 Local models can be built by grouping together data that has similar behavior. Different types of phenomena will define their own clusters. Models can then be developed for each cluster (i.e. local regr essions) that will yield better accuracy over the local problem space covered by the model in contrast to a global model. Having a set of local models also offers greater flexibility as predictions can be made either on the basis of a single model or, if needed, on a global level by combining the predictions made by the individual local models [11]. Inthisresearchamethodtoconstruct local models of multiple time-series containing profiles of relationships between multiple time-series by utilizing a non-parametric regression model in combination with the ECM, Evolving Clus-tering Method [12] is proposed. The construction of local models in the proposed methodology consists of two main steps, that are the extraction of profiles of re-lationships between time-series and th e detection and clustering of recurring trends of movement in time-series when a particular profile emerges. The prin-cipal objective of the methodology is to construct a repository of profiles and recurring trends as the knowledge-base and key data resource to perform multiple time-series prediction.

To attain such objective a 2-level local modeling process is utilized in the pro-posed methodology. The first level of local modeling which deals with the extrac-tion of profiles of relationships between series in a sub-space of the given multi-ple time-series data is outlined in Section 3.1. The second level of local modeling, which is the procedure to detect and cluster recurring trends that take place in time-series when a particular profile is emerging, is described in Section 3.2.
Constructed local models are expected to be able to capture the underly-ing behavior of the multiple time-series under examination, in terms of their tendency to move collectively in a similar fashion over time. Knowledge about such underlying behavior is expected to be helpful in predicting their upcoming movements as new data becomes available. This premise has been experimentally verified in the work presented in this paper. 3.1 Extracting Profiles of Relationship of Multiple Time-Series Most of the work in clustering tim e-series data has concentrated on sample clus-tering rather than variable clustering [13]. However, one of the key tasks in our work is to group together series that are highly correlated and have similar shapes of movement (variable clustering), as we believe that these local models representing clusters of similar profiles will provide a better basis than a single global model for predicting future movement of the multiple time-series.
The first step in extracting profiles of relationships between multiple time-series is the computation of cross-correla tion coefficients between the observed time-series using the Pearson X  X  correlation analysis. Additionally, only those sta-tistically significant correlati on coefficients identified by the t-test with confi-dence level of 95% are taken into account. The following step of the algorithm is to measure dissimilarity between time-series from the Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient (line 1, Algorithm 1) by calc ulating the Rooted Normalized One-Minus Correlation [13] (known hence as normalized correlation in this paper) given by, where a and b are the time-series being analy zed. The normalized correlation coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, in which 0 denotes high similarity and 1 signifies the opposite condition.

Thereafter, the last stage of the algorithm is to extract profiles of relationships from the normalized correlation matrix. The methodology used in this step is outlined in line 3 to 24 of Algorithm 1. The whole process of extracting profiles of relationships is illustrated in Figure 1. In any case, the fundamental concept of this algorithm is to group multiple time-series with comparable fashion of movement whilst validating that every time-series belong to the same cluster are correlated and hold significant level of similarity.
 The underlying concept of Algorithm 1 is closely comparable to the CAST, Clustering Affinity Search Technique , clustering algorithm [14]. However, Al-gorithm 1 works by dynamically creating new clusters, deleting and merging existing clusters as it evaluates the coeffi cient of similarity between time-series or observed variables. Therefore, Algorithm 1 is considerably different compared to CAST which creates a single cluster at one time and perform updates by adding new elements to the cluster from a pool of elements, or by removing elements from the cluster and return i t to the pool as it evaluates the affinity factor of the cluster in which the elements belong to.

After the profiles have been extracted, then the next step of the methodol-ogy is to mine and cluster series X  trends of movement from each profile. This process is outlined and explained in the next section. Additionally, as the time-complexity of Algorithm 1 is O ( 1 2 ( n 2  X  n )), to avoid expensive re-computation Algorithm 1. Extracting profiles of relationship of multiple time-series and extraction of profiles, extracted profiles of relationships are stored and being updated dynamically instead of being computed on the fly. 3.2 Clustering Recurring Trends of a Time-Series To detect and cluster recurring trends of movement from localized sets of time-series data, an algorithm that extracts patterns of movement in the form of polynomial regression function and groups them on the basis of similarity in the regression coefficients has been propos ed in a previous study [15]. However, in this proposed algorithm to eliminate the assumption that the data is drawn from a Gaussian data distribution when estimating the regression function, a non-parametric regression analysis is used in place of the polynomial regression. The process to cluster recurring tr ends of a time-series by using kernel regression as the non-parametric regression method is outlined in Algorithm 2 as follows,  X  X tep1 , perform the autocorrelation analysis to the time-series dataset from  X  X tep2 , create the first cluster C 1 by simply taking the trend of movement  X  X tep3 , if there is no more data snapshot, then the process stops (go to  X  X tep4 , find a cluster C a (with centre Cc a and cluster radius Ru a )fromall  X  X tep5 ,if S i,a &gt; 2  X  Dthr ,where Dthr is a clustering parameter to limit the  X  X tep6 ,if S i,a  X  2  X  Dthr , current trend of X ( i ) , w i , joins cluster C a .  X  X tep7 , end of the procedure.
 In the procedure of clustering trends the following indexes are used,  X  number of data snapshots: i =1 , 2 , ... ;  X  number of clusters: l =1 , 2 , ..., m ;  X  number of input and output variables: k =1 , 2 , ..., n .
 Clusters of trends of movement are then stored in each extracted profile of rela-tionship. This information about profiles of and the trends of movements inside them will then be exploited as the knowledge repository to perform simultaneous multiple time-series prediction. 3.3 Knowledge Repository and Multiple Time-Series Prediction To visualize how Algorithms 1 and 2 extract profiles of relationships and cluster recurring trends from multiple time-serie s to construct a knowledge repository, a pre-created simple synthetic dataset is conferred to the algorithms, as it is shown in Figure 2, in this paper. The most suitable window size of snapshot is defined by implementing the auto-correlation analysis as it is explained in previous section and indicated in the first step of Algorithm 2.
Figure 2 illustrates how a repository of profiles of relationships and recurring trends is built from the first snapshot of the observed multiple time-series and how it is being updated dynamically after the algorithm has processed the third snapshot. This knowledge repository of profiles and recurring trends acts as the knowledge-base and is the key data resource to perform multiple time-series prediction.

After the repository has been built, there are two further steps that need to be performed before prediction can take place. The first step is to extract current profiles of relationships between th e multiple series. Thereafter, matches are found between the current trajectory and previously stored profiles from the past. Predictions are then made by implementing a weighting scheme that gives more importance to pairs of series that belong to the same profile and retain comparable trends of movement. The weight w ij for given pair ( i, j ) of series, is given by the distance of si milarity between them. 4.1 New Zealand Climate Data Air pressure data collected from variou s locations in New Zealand by the Na-tional Institute of Weather and Atmosphere (NIWA, http://www.niwa.co.nz ) constitutes the multiple time-series in t his research. The data covers a period of three years, ranging from 1 st January 2007 to 31 st December 2009.

Findings from previous study about global weather system [16] which argue that a small change to one part of the system can lead to a complete change in the weather system as a whole is the k ey reason that drives us to use such dataset. Consequently, being able to reveal profiles of relationship between air pressure in different locations at various time-points would help us to understand more about the behavior of our weather system and would also facilitate in constructing a reliable prediction model. 4.2 Prediction Accuracy Evaluation To examine the performance of the proposed algorithm in predicting changes in weather patterns across the multiple stations, a prediction of future air pres-sure level in four locations from 1 st October 2009 to 31 st December 2009 was performed. Additionally, to confirm that forecasting movement of multiple time-series simultaneously by exploiting relationships between multiple series would provide better accuracy, prediction out comes are also compared to results from the commonly-used single time-series prediction methods, such as multiple linear regression and the Multi-Layer Perceptron.

Throughout the conducted experiments, the window size used to perform bootstrap sampling in extracting profiles of relationships and recurring trends from the training dataset is set to 5, as suggested by the results of autocorrelation analysis performed on the New Zealand air pressure dataset. Furthermore, the parameters in clustering recurring trends process (Algorithm 2) are set to dx = 0 . 1 , X  =0 . 1 , and Dthr =0 . 5.
 Generally, error rates of prediction and estimated trajectories RMSE, Rooted Mean Square Root Error , as outlined in Table 1 and Figure 4, reveals that the proposed algorithm demonstrates its superiority in predicting movement of dy-namic and oscillated time-series data with a consistently high-degree of accuracy in relation to multiple linear regression and the Multi-Layer Perceptron. These results confirm proposals in previous studies which states that by being able to reveal and understand characteristics of relationships between variables in mul-tiple time-series data, one can predict th eir future states or b ehavior accurately [2],[3],[4].

In addition, as it is expected, the proposed algorithm is not only able to provide excellent accuracy in predicting future values, but it is also capable of extracting knowledge about profiles of relationship between different locations in New Zealand (in terms of movement of air pressure level) and clustering recurring trends which exist in the series as illustrated in Figure 5 and 6. Consequently, our study is also able to reveal that the air pressure level in the four locations are highly correlated and tend to move in a similar fashion through time. This is showed by the circle in the lower left corner where number of occurrences of such profile is 601 in Figure 5.
 Outcomes of conducted experiments undoubtedly prove that predicting move-ment of multiple time-series on the same real world phenomenon by using profiles of relationship between the serie s improves prediction accuracy.

Additionally, the algorithm proposed in this study demonstrates the ability to: (1) extract profiles of relationships and recurring trends from a multiple time-series data i.e., the air pressure dataset from four observation stations in New Zealand; (2) perform prediction of multip le time-series all together with excel-lent precision; and (3) evolve, by continui ng to extract profiles of relationships and recurring trends over time. As future work, we plan to explore the use of correlation analysis methods which are capable of detecting non-linear correla-tions between observed variables (i.e. correlation ratio, Copula, etc.) in place of the Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient to ext ract profiles of relationships of multiple time-series.
