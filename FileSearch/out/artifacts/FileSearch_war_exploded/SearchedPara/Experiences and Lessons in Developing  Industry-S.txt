 Traditionally academic machine learning and da ta mining researchers focus on proposing new algorithms. The task of implementing these methods is often left to companies that are developing software packages. However, the gap between the two sides has caused some problems. First, the practical deployment of new algorithms still involves some challenging issues that need to be studied by researchers. Second, without furt her investigation after publishing their papers, researchers have neither the opportunity to work with real problems nor see how their methods are used. We discuss the experiences in developing two machine learning packages LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR, that are widely used in both academia and industry. We demonstrate that the interaction with users leads us to identify some important research problems. For example, the decision to study and then support multi-class SVM was essential in the early stage of developing LIBSVM. The birth of LIBLINEAR was driven by the need to classify large-scale documents in Internet companies. For fast training of large-scale problems, we had to create new algorithms other than those used in LIBSVM for kernel SVM. We present some practical use of LIBLINEAR for Internet applications. Finally, we give lessons learned and future perspectives for developing industry-strength machine learni ng and data mining software.

Chih-Jen Lin is currently a distinguished profe ssor at the Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan University and a visiting principal research scientist at eBay Research Labs. He obtained his B.S. degree from National Taiwan University in 1993 and Ph.D. degree from University of Michigan in 1998. His major resear ch areas include machine learning, data mining, and numerical optimization. Dr. Lin is best known for his work on support vector machines (SVM) for data classification. His soft ware LIBSVM is one of the mo st widely used and cited SVM packages. Several major companies use this software for classification and regression applications. More recently, his team developed the software LIBLINEAR for large-scale document classification. This package has quickly gained attention as Internet companies routinely use it for their applications. Dr. Lin has received many awards for his research work. A recent one is the ACM KDD 2010 best paper award. He is an IEEE fellow and an ACM distinguished scientist for his contribution to machine learning algorithms a nd software design.
