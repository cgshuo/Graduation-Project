Although Spanish-language applications are emphasized, the textbook contains examples from English, French, Portuguese, and Russian as well. This text is freely available in an electronic format. Supplementary materials, links to the relevant resources, and errata can be found on-line as well.
 meaning X  X ext theory (MTT) (Mel X   X  cuk 1974), and head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1994). These choices reflect primarily practical considerations. On the one hand, MTT can be used to describe any language but is particularly well-suited for the description of free-word-order languages. On the other hand, HPSG is arguably the most advanced, widely used, and user-friendly formalism in natural-language description and processing.

 to Leonard Bloomfield to Noam Chomsky, discussing context-free grammars, transfor-mational grammars, and more up-to-date approaches to grammar. Covering concepts such as valence, constraints, and unification formalism, the authors introduce Fillmore X  X  work (Fillmore 1968), generalized phrase structure grammar (Gazdar et al. 1985), and HPSG. The last several sections are devoted to MTT. MTT has influenced the design of new grammar formalisms such as Dependency Tree Grammars, and some aspects have been adopted into other theories (e.g., integrating lexical functions into Pustejovsky X  X  Generative Lexicon; Wanner 1997).
 included discussion serves to illustrate that all of the relevant applications require so-phisticated linguistic knowledge. The general lesson of this chapter can be summarized thus:  X  X ost language processing tasks can be considered as special cases of the general task of language understanding, one of the ultimate goals of CL and AI.

The last section of the book includes various exercises, review questions, and multiple-choice problems.

The current volume complements other textbooks available now by of-fering an overview of MTT, providing a survey of the current state of Spanish NLP research, introducing the field of CL from the linguistic point of view (explaining what specific linguistic knowledge is involved in each  X  X L product X  rather than introducing the techniques used in CL/NLP to create that product), providing plenty of examples and exercises, and making this book freely available on-line.
 amples for the benefit of potential readers who are not Spanish-speakers. Additionally, exercises, comprehension questions, relevant literature, scientific associations, on-line tools, and language resources should be listed at the end of each chapter instead of at relevant skill set, and allow readers to more easily test their comprehension of each chapter.
 already some background in computer science but lack special training in linguis-tics. However, those using this textbook in the classroom should consider providing supplementary materials that discuss the fundamental algorithms and techniques for speech and language processing as well as certain linguistic areas, such as phonetics and pragmatics. These topics receive relatively little attention here.
