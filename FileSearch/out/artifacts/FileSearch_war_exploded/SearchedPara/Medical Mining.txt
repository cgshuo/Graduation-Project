 In year 2015, we experience a proliferation of scientific pub-lications, conferences and funding programs on KDD for medicine and healthcare. However, medical scholars and practitioners work differently from KDD researchers: their research is mostly hypothesis-driven, not data-driven. KDD researchers need to understand how medical researchers and practitioners work, what questions they have and what meth-ods they use, and how mining methods can fit into their re-search frame and their everyday business. Purpose of this tutorial is to contribute to this learning process. We address medicine and healthcare; there the expertise of KDD schol-ars is needed and familiarity with medical research basics is a prerequisite. We aim to provide basics for (1) mining in epidemiology and (2) mining in the hospital. We also ad-dress, to a lesser extent, the subject of (3) preparing and annotating Electronic Health Records for mining.
 This tutorial is intended for conference participants who are interested in medicine (including healthcare and medical re-search) as application domain for mining. Background on data mining is expected, since we will not explain the learn-ing approaches (e.g. artificial neural networks, density-based clustering etc) but only how each approach has been ad-justed to a medical mining task. Experts in some field of medical mining (e.g. knowledge discovery from medical im-ages, machine learning for brain signals) may be familiar with some part of the tutorial but not with all of them. There is abundance of medical data and of applications that require KDD methods. One serious obstacle in deploying mining in medical research is that this research is hypothesis-driven and follows workflows, which do not agree with the way mining scholars work. Many medical researchers are willing to offer their data for mining, but it is the task of mining scholars to analyze the data in a way that can be understood and exploited by medical researchers. A most disappointing experience for a mining scholar, especially for novice ones, is to hear a medical researcher say  X  X ice results but I will not use them X . We discuss this kind of experience in our tutorial and elaborate on reasons that lead to it. Our purpose is to provide underpinnings, guidelines and exam-ples that will help KDD scholars avoid such experiences. Myra Spiliopoulou is Professor of Business Information Systems at the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Faculty of Computer Science. Her publications are on min-ing evolving objects, adapting models to drift and building models that capture drift. In her research she focuses on two application areas: business (mainly opinion stream mining and adaptive recommenders) and medical research (mainly learning from epidemiological studies). She has held tutori-als on advanced mining topics at KDD 2009, PAKDD 2013 and in many ECML PKDD conferences.
 Pedro Pereira Rodrigues is Professor at the Depart-ment of Health Information and Decision Sciences, Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, and a researcher at the Biostatistics and Intelligent Data Analysis group of the Center for Health Technologies and Services Research. His publications are on big (stream) data analysis, health data analysis, health informatics and clinical research. He is cur-rently devoted to Bayesian networks applications to clinical research and decision support, and has co-organized tutori-als in IBERAMIA 2012 (on streams) and ECMLPKDD 2014 (on medical mining).
 Ernestina Menasalvas is Professor at the Department of Computer Systems Languages and Sw Engeneering, Faculty of Computer Science of Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM) and a member of the MIDAS, Data Mining and data simulation group, at the Center of Biotechnology at UPM. Her subject area is Data Mining, and most recently using medical data. She has also participated in a range of projects related to data integration and mining on mobile devices. She has published three international books on web mining (edited by Springer in 2003, 2004 and 2009 respectively) as well as in several key international journals.
 Part of the work reported by Myra Spiliopoulou was funded by the German Research Foundation project SP 572/11-1  X  X MPRINT: Incremental Mining for Perennial Objects X .
