 In this paper, a hierarchical c lassification framework has been proposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-level image annotation automatically. First, the semantic gap between the low-level computable visual features and the users X  real information needs is partitioned into four smaller gaps, and multiple approaches are proposed to bridge these smaller gaps more effectively. To learn more reliable contextual relationships between the atomic image concepts and the co-appearances of salient objects, a multi-modal boosting algorithm is proposed. To enable hierar-chical image classification and avoid inter-level error trans-mission, a hierarchical boosting algorithm is proposed by incorporating concept ontology and multi-task learning to achieve hierarchical image classifier training with automatic error recovery. To bridge the gap between the computable image concepts and the users X  real information needs, a novel hyperbolic visualization framework is seamlessly incorpo-rated to enable intuitive query specification and evaluation by acquainting the users with a good global view of large-scale image collections. Our experiments on large-scale im-age databases have also obtained very positive results.

However, the performance of such keyword-based image retrieval approach largely depends on three inter-related issues: (1) representative visual features for characterizing diverse visual properties of images [3]; (2) effective algorithms for classifier training and automatic im-age annotation [4-5, 20-21]; (3) suitable system interfaces for intuitive query specification and evaluation [1-2].
To address the first issue, the underlying visual patterns for feature extraction should be able to characterize the im-age semantics at the object level effectively and efficiently [3-5]. To address the second issue, robust techniques for image classifier training are needed to bridge the seman-tic gap successfully [1-2, 20-21]. Because one single image may contain different meanings at multiple semantic lev-els, hierarchical image classification is strongly expected for achieving multi-level image annotations [20-21]. Hierarchi-cal image classification can provide at least two advantages: (1) The classifiers for the high-level image concepts can effec-tively be learned by combining the classifiers for the relevant image concepts at the lower levels of the concept ontology (i.e., low-level image concepts with smaller within-concept variations of visual principles); (2) The computational com-plexity for training the classifiers for large amounts of image concepts can significantly be reduced through exploiting the strong correlations between the image concepts. The major problem with such hierarchical approach is that the classi-fication errors may be transmitted among different concept levels (i.e., inter-level error transmission ) [20]. To ad-dress the third issue, there is an urgent need to develop new visualization framework, so that users can visually be acquainted with what keywords are used to annotate and index the images and can be used for query specification.
As mentioned above, classifying images into the most rele-vant image concepts at different semantic levels is one promis-ing solution to enable automatic multi-level image annota-tion. Motivated by this observation, we have proposed a novel scheme by incorporating the concept ontology for im-age concept organization and hierarchical image classifier training and visualizing large-scale image collections.
Following the idea of WordNet [11], a hierarchical network is used as the representation of the concept ontology. In this network, each node represents either one image concept at one certain semantic level or one specific salient object class. We define the former nodes as the concept nodes because they represent the semantics of the whole image ,andthe
