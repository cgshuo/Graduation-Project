 Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.5.2 User Inter-faces, I.2.7 Natural Language Processing General Terms: Design, Human Factors Keywords: Email, Content-Based Ranking Traditionally personal email clients have been designed to handle quite moderate amount of information. They are built upon the assumption that the primary model about the contents of the email collection resides in the user X  X  mind. We are interested in the situation where user faces an unseen large scale corpus of emails, e.g. a mailing-list archive con-taining tens or hundreds of thousands of messages. In this case forming an overall picture of the corpus, which is a nec-essary prerequisite for more detailed information retrieval, poses a considerable challenge to the user. We demonstrate a system which supports the user in the above situation by providing multiple facets or viewpoints to the corpus. The system can be seen as a combination of tightly intervowen data mining and information retrieval methods. The ability to  X  X ix and match X  various facets makes the system quite versatile for handling large scale email archives. In the fol-lowing we briefly describe the provided facets.

Search Engine provides a familiar interface for the user to start exploring the corpus. It provides a powerful way to retrieve arbitrary subsets of the corpus given some exact attributes to match, such as keywords, timestamp, recipient or subject line. Subsequent operations with other facets may be focused to this subset. As the result set does not require user X  X  attention as such, one may use rather broad queries without having to consider the burden of browsing the matches manually.

Content based ranking integrates seamlessly to the search engine. Given a subset of corpus, we must rank or sort its contents according to a certain conception of rele-vance. The well-known challenge of content-based ranking is to be able to infer this conception from a scarce query. Our approach is to let the user to provide explicitly some cue words which guide the ranking into desired context. It is crucial that the cues may be vague and they are interpreted as such, as we cannot expect the user to be able to explicate her needs with respect to the corpus in an exact manner. We accomplish this by using aggressive query expansion and global discriminative lexical co-occurrence analysis. As the result, our system makes possible to search e.g. emails by N.N in the context of books or all emails of year 2002 dealing broadly with Linux.

Multinomial Principal Component Analysis [1] is a statistical dimensionality reduction method akin to latent semantic indexing. The system uses MPCA to support ex-ploration and data mining. Based on the corpus a global model is built showing some general topics taking place in the discussions. This helps the user to quickly grasp an over-all idea about the existing themes. Typically this knowledge helps the user to form cues for ranking more easily.
Topical trends [2] visualize temporal dynamics of the corpus with respect to a facet. Emails possess a natural ordering in time. Using this facet it is possible to explore how discussions evolve and themes vary in the corpus. Espe-cially the topics given by MPCA tend to provide interesting information when plotted against time.

Social networks are inferred automatically by analyzing senders and recipients of the emails in the corpus. The net-works can be used to explore tacit social structures in the corpus. Also the social networks may be contrasted with the other facets.

The system X  X  feasibility emerges from combinatorial power of the above facets. For instance, one may combine simple keyword based queries with social graphs or MPCA top-ics and continue to constrain the topics to the periods when they are most active. More subtle combinations may be use-ful as well, e.g. one may examine how social structures in the results change when cues for ranking are varied. The cen-tral paradigm is to help the user to build a mental model of the corpus by being interactive and iterative and by letting the user to compare and contrast the results from various angles.
 We demonstrate the system with a dataset from The Mail Archive 1 . The dataset consists of some 20GB of public mail-ing lists of various subjects. [1] W. Buntine and A. Jakulin. Applying discrete PCA in [2] J. Perki  X o, W. Buntine, and S. Perttu. Exploring http://www.mail-archive.com/
