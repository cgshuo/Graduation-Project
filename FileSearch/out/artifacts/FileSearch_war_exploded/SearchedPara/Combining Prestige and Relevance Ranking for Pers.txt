 In this paper, we present an adaptive graph-based personalized recommendation method based on combining prestige and relevance ranking. By utilizing the unique network structure of n-partite heterogeneous graph, we a ttempt to address the problem of personalized recommendation in a two-layer ranking process with the help of reasonable measure of high and low order relationships by analyzing the representation of user X  X  preference in the graph. With different in itialization and surfing strategies, this graph-based ranking model can take different type of data into account to capture personal interests from multiple perspectives. The experiments show that this algorithm can achieve better performance than the traditional CF methods and some graph-based r ecommendation methods.

The ongoing rapid expansion of the Internet greatly increases the necessity of effective recommender systems for filtering the abundant information. Recommendati on is a particular form of information filtering which exploits user historical behaviors and multidimensional similarities to generate a list of information items that is personally tailored to an end-user X  X  preferences. There are many different methods have been presented to solve this problem from diverse persp ectives. Traditional content-based models need to rely on sufficien t information of user and item profiles which are usually difficult to obtain. Memory-based CF [1] such as item-CF and user-CF can X  X  guarantee the performance of prestige and relevance for improving the personalized recommendation performance. There is a wide range of othe r information such as user X  X  demographic data and item X  X  profiles that can be incorporated into the recommendation effort for better recommendation quality. All the additional heterogeneous information from attributive data to temporal data can reflect the user X  X  latent preference in different ways. We want to use different connected bipartite graph to represent the diversity of objects and relationships, and could generate recommendations from multidimensional query. After considering different ranking me thods and representation of heterogeneous data, this paper pr esents a two-layer graph-based ranking methods with different in itialization and surfing strategies for personalized recommendation. Empirical experiments on typical dataset are conducted to compare its recommendation effectiveness with other graph-based method and model-based CF method. The experiment results validate that our algorithm can get better performance due to incorporating reasonable ranking methods and different latent inte rmediaries of user X  X  multiple preferences. The main purpose of recommender system is predicting your personal preference to those objects you have not yet selected, based on the historical record of users' activities. And the output of the system is recommendation list sorted in rank of predicting scores. Since real users are usua lly concerned only with the top part of the recommendation list, a more practical approach is to consider the number of a user's relevant objects ranked in the top-N places. This recommendation method contai ns two steps of different random walk procedures based on connected multiple bipartite graphs. First step is a co-ranking model in user-item graph to give objects with different prestige scor es for subsequent query-based recommendation. The second collaborative ranking step is a targeted fusion of different relevance ranks got by collective propagation for initial query vectors in many graphs. Essentially, a recommender system consists of users and items and additional data assigned to them, each user has selected or rated some items. Most of researches on recommendation algorithms treat each user equally. But there exist reliable users or experts that have much deeper and broader knowledge of a specific domain. These users X  preference information is more credible and convincing [11]. Item X  X  quality is an important feature [6] easy to be neglected in recommender system. In movie or shopping recommendations, recommending items with high scores to users can often achieve better conversion rate. The quality of different items is diverse, and the collective ratings of users can reflect the macroscopic evaluation about the item. Moreover, prior research [12] shows that user ratings are imperfect and noisy which limits the measurable predictive power of many recommender systems. To solve these latent problems in original data, we design a co-ranking method in user-item weighted bipartite graph. In Information Retrieval area, we can use the link analysis algorithm such as PageRank to give each node a prestige score to measure its global importance. Likewise, we can execute some similar ranking process in the network c onstructed based on historical relationships of users and items. We denote the set of user X  X  rank Where  X  is the regularization parameter. Thus the iteration in equation (2, 3) can be transformed into the following optimization problem, It X  X  provable that that the result of this optimization framework is equivalent to the above iteration algorithm. After this co-ranking for users and items, we can get the user X  X  rank as his expertise score and item X  X  rank as its estimated quality score. Like the important role of pagerank values during the ranking of search results in IR, both these prestige scores of users and items are significant in the following query-based relevance ranking process. It is noteworth y that the HITS-like prestige ranking is not personalized due to its global statistics. By using the collective rating relations, we can identify the user X  X  authority and item X  X  quality as the input stru cture of personalized relevance ranking. Integrating and mediating heter ogeneous sources of information can be the efficient way to improve the performance of recommender systems. In typical music social communities, such as Last.fm 1 , there is rich social media information including various types of objects and rela tions among these objects. Fig. 1 shows an example of Last.fm . In Last.fm, each user can make friends with other users, join groups, listen to music tracks, and use tags to bookmark resources like music tracks, albums and artists. Graph-based structure provide s a natural way for modeling heterogeneous data sets. Based on different types of explicit and implicit personal preferences and item profiles, such as ratings, multidimensional relationships can be built in n-partite heterogeneous graph. And then the personalized recommendation can be transformed as a relevance ranking process in this multiple connected bipartite graph. We treat the recommendation for target user as an input query vector Q , and then implement the collaborative ranking of initial query from different type of direct and indirect links in this multi-graph to get the relevance ranking scores for target items. Q corresponds to a profile vector capturing the user preferences. The ranking model begins from the query of target user, and then executes iterative ranking process between its adjacent bipartite graphs. If its neighbors are target items, then neighbors can get their relevance ranking scores, othe rwise the query is transferred to its neighbors for next ranking process to reach the target items. http://www.last .fm. http://www. last.fm/api. We compare the top-k recommendation performance with several existing methods: item-based and user-based CF, Item-based random walk (RW) and matrix factorization (MF). CF and MF methods are tested based on My MediaLite [14] which is good library of recommender system algorithms. For evaluation metrics, we use Precision, Recall, F1, Mean Average Precision (MAP) and No rmalized Discount Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure the performance of different recommendation algorithms. We divided our datasets (by random sampling) into 85% training-15% testing sets and report the average results of a 5-fold cro ss-validation. The performance of these different recommendation algor ithms on the two datasets are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Table 2. Performance on MovieLens dataset (  X  is set at 0.78) ItemKNN 0.454 0.126 0.217 0.689 UserKNN 0.466 0.135 0.229 0.721 Our Model 0.518 0.175 0.269 0.797 Table 3. Performance on Last.fm dataset (  X  is set at 0.85) ItemKNN 0.157 0.131 0.163 0.413 UserKNN 0.161 0.148 0.196 0.420 Our Model 0.268 0.196 0.229 0.507 From the performance comparison results we can find that the two-layer collaborative ranking method can achieve better performance due to its graph-based iterative optimization of reasonable rankings and incorporating multidimensional data. As the initial query vector can be multiple and target ranking can be arbitrary nodes, this method is more scalable and flexible for various recommendation types in practice. In this paper, we try to addr ess the personalized recommendation problem in the way of graph-based ranking methods by referencing the typical ranking forms in Information Retrieval. To measure the different prestige score of user and item for discriminatory participating in the subsequent relevance ranking, we design a co-ranking method in us er-item bipartite graph. To incorporate heterogeneous information into the recommendation, we present the query-based relevance ranking model in n-partite graph and fuse user X  X  preferences from different perspectives to improve the recommendation performance. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve better performance than the traditional CF methods and some graph-based recommendation methods. As the future works we will explore adjust the prestige ranking method to prevent spam records and try to improve the novelty and diversity during the relevance ranking, we will also consider integrating into temporal information and high-order complex relationships.
