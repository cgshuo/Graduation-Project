 The evolution of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the smart-phone technologies have played a key role in the rev-olution of our daily life. The location-based social networks (LBSN) have emerged and facilitated the users to share the check-in information and multimedia contents. The Point of Interest (POI) recommendation system uses the check-in information to predict the most potential check-in locations. The different aspects of the check-in information, for in-stance, the geographical distance , the category , and the tem-poral popularity of a POI; and the temporal check-in trends , and the social (friendship) information of a user play a cru-cial role in an efficient recommendation.
 In this paper, we propose a fused recommendation model termed MAPS ( M ulti A spect Personalized P OI Recom-mender S ystem) which will be the first in our knowledge to fuse the categorical, the temporal, the social and the spatial aspects in a single model. The major contribution of this paper are: (i) it realizes the problem as a graph of location nodes with constraints on the category and the distance as-pects (i.e. the edge between two locations is constrained by a threshold distance and the category of the locations), (ii) it proposes a multi-aspect fused POI recommendation model, and (iii) it extensively evaluates the model with two real-world data sets.
 POI Recommendation, Social network analysis The LBSNs, such as, the Facebook 1 , the Foursquare 2 , the Gowalla 3 , and so forth have facilitated the users to share the check-in information of the places of interest. Such check-in information has been the subject of interest to predict the POIs that are most likely to be visited in the future. Albeit, the generic recommendation concept has been used for POI the problem as a graph with the users as the nodes, and the following/followers relation as the directed edges. The rank of a user with respect to the location and a time range was defined using the personalized PageRank [3]. The topic sen-sitive factor for the ( user, location (p), time ( t 1 ,t 2 ) ) tuple was taken as the ratio of the number of check-ins for the tuple to the number of check-ins for the ( location (p),time ( t ,t 2 ) ) tuple over all the users. Similarly, the rank of a location within a time interval was defined. This model also ignored the geographical, categorical and the social aspects. Wang et. al. [11] had the users and the locations as the graph nodes, the user-user friendship edges, and the user-location check-in edges. The friendship similarity was real-ized by starting from the target user and by ranking all the users ( that form user-user link ). This was followed by the ranking of all the places visited by those users. The places with the highest rank and within a given threshold distance from the past visits were recommended to the user. Their model also ignored the categorical aspect.
The PageRank [8] approach used the number and the quality of the links to a web page to estimate its impor-tance. It was extended to the Topic-Sensitive PageRank [3] by introducing some bias to the PageRank vector. It incorporated the set of influential or representative ( or ad-ditional context relevant attributes ) topics to address the im-portance of particular topics. For a given query, it identified the most closely associated/contextual topics and such rel-evant topic-sensitive (biased) vectors were used to rank the documents satisfying the query. The convergence of PageR-ank is assured only if the graph is strongly connected and aperiodic [7]. This becomes true if we add the damping con-stant (1  X   X  ) to the rank propagation which improves the quality of PageRank not only by limiting the effect of the rank sinks [2], but also by assuring the convergence to a unique rank vector [3].
 The MAPS is based on the Topic-Sensitive PageRank, where the representative topics are the spatial and the categorical aspects of the LBSN. The rank of a location ( l ) in the context of a user ( u ) and the time ( t ) is influenced by the check-in user X  X  check-in history has frequent check-ins in Starbucks coffee shop at 2 pm, then it is more likely that she will visit a coffee shop at that time in future. This temporal aspect should be taken care while recommending some coffee (or relevant category) shops to her. If that coffee shop is in-accessible, the user might not be surprised if a nearby cafe is recommended. Such a dual affinity of the time and the location category has motivated the MAPS to incorporate the categorical and temporal bias in the POI rankings. Given two candidate POIs, suggesting the near one is more relevant [10]. If the check-in history of a user depicts that the check-ins were made within some distance of other check-ins, then introducing the distance constraint might give better recommendation. MAPS uses such check-in trends to incor-porate the spatial bias in the location ranking problem. In MAPS , every location is termed as a node of a graph and the bag of user, time tuple is considered as an attribute of the location node. The location-location edges exist if they have the same category or are located within some thresh-old distance. It uses the categorical and the spatial bias in its Topic-Sensitive PageRank model. The terms used in rank is the fusion of the two ranks and is defined as: where  X  1 ,  X  2 are tuning parameters for the two aspects. The likelihood of the check-in for the user i at the location l within the time frame t 1 , t 2 is defined as:
P ( u,l,t 1 ,t 2 ) =  X  t 1 ,t 2 ( l )  X  (  X  d  X  X The terms  X  d , X  c , and  X  s are defined using TF-IDF [9, 12] for each user. For a user u , where n d is the number of visits by the user u that are within the threshold distance , n is the total visits count by u , N is the number of POIs, and N d is the number of POIs that are within the threshold distance from the user X  X  check-in history. For the categorial factor, we use the relation: where n c is the number of visits by the user u to the cate-gory c , and N c is the number of POIs with the category c . Similarly, , where n s is the number of visits by the user u in common to her friends, and N s is the number of visits in common to the friends for all the users u  X  U .
 Based on the aspects we considered, we have analyzed the performance of three different models, the categorical link based model (CLM) (defined in Eqn. (1) and (2)), the spa-tial link based model (SLM) (defined in Eqn. (3) and (4)), and the fused model MAPS (defined in Eqn. (5)).
We used the Weeplaces and the Gowalla dataset [6], which was collected from the popular LBSNs Gowalla and the Weeplaces. The Weeplaces dataset has 7,658,368 check-ins from 15,799 users over 971,309 different locations. The Gowalla dataset has 36,001,959 check-ins from 319,063 users over 2,844,076 locations. These datasets were well defined and had the attributes relevant to the context of the prob-lem, such as, (i) the location category, (ii) the geospatial co-ordinates, (iii) the friendship information, and (iv) the check-in time. After avoiding incomplete records, the 5 most checked-in categories (and their check-in count) were: (i) Home/Work/Other: Corporate/Office (437,824), (ii) Food: Coffee Shop (267,589), (iii) Nightlife:Bar (248,565), (iv) Shop: Food&amp; Drink:Grocery/Supermarket (161,016), and (v) Travel: Train Station (152,114) for Weeplaces, and (i) Corporate Table 3: Precision@N, Recall@N of MAPS against other studies among the three set of parameters the unified model per-formed best with the categorical aspect weight of 0.25. The comparative performance of different models is illustrated in Table -2. The observed difference was statistically signif-icant at 95% confidence level. The Table -3 lists the average metrics across the top 5, 10, and 15 recommendation scores.
We analyzed the check-in data based on (a) the categori-cal, (b) the social, (c) the spatial, and (d) the temporal as-pects. This multi-aspect recommendation model with rea-sonable performance was a significant contribution to the relevant area. Our next task is to analyze the same model against several other contexts, datasets and problem do-mains.
