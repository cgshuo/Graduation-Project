 In this paper, based on a novel shape-similarity-based retrieval method, we propose an interact ive partial-distance-map (PDM)-based high-dimensional i ndexing scheme to speed up the retrieval performance of the large Chinese calligraphic character databases. Specifically, we use the appr oximate minimal bounding hyper-sphere of query character to search the PDM and utilize the users X  relevance feedback to refine the search process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to testify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

The large amount of Chinese callig raphic scripts in existence is a valuable part of the Chinese cultural heritage. Although these scripts can be available through publ ic libraries or Internet, they can hardly be retrieved by optical character recognition (OCR) which performs well only on machine printed characters against clean background. No effective techniques can support the retrieval of Chinese calligraphic characters written in different styles due to their complexity, deformation and degradation. 
Moreover, so far, no efficient t echniques have been proposed to retrieve and index large Chinese calligraphic character databases. In essence, the indexing issue of Chinese calligraphic character belongs to the category of high-dimensional data indexing when we represent each character as a vector. With respective to the high-dimensional indexing issue, considerable research works have been done [1]. Unfortunately, these existing high-dimensional indexing methods can not be directly applied to the Chinese calligraphic characters due to their unique characteristics:  X  To depict each Chinese calligraphic character, a set of  X  The number of contour points of each character is different In this paper, we address the efficient issues of retrieving Chinese calligraphic ch aracter. We propose an interactive high-dimensional indexing scheme based on partial distance-map (PDM), which is specifically designed for indexing the large Chinese calligraphic characters. 
The key problem in Chinese calligraphic characters retrieval is the matching of similar isolated characters. In this paper, we search the character using the Approximate Point Context (APC)-based retrieval method [1]. In order to speed up the retrieval efficiency, we present a nove l interactive high-dimensional indexing technique, called the Partial Distance Map (PDM). PDM is designed to establish the link between semantic-level concepts of characters and low-level shape features through the user relevance feedback, where a user only needs to mark which characters he or she thinks are similar to the query character. During the retrieval process, the PDM and its Pruning Distance Table (PDT) are updated dynamically via the relevance feedback to correctly reflect the users X  query needs. In PDM, each character is regarded as a reference one, the distances between the character a nd its neighboring characters are pre-calculated to generate a partial distance map with the constraint of the pruning distance ( PD ) which is set through user relevance feedback. D
EFINITION 1. A Partial Distance Map (PDM for short) is an adjacency list where ij dPDM  X  and ij d refers to the distance between the i-th character and its j-th nearest neighboring character. 
The basic idea of the pruning distance table is to record and update the PD of each character via user relevance feedback so as to adjust the PDM dynamically. D
EFINITION 2 . The Pruning Distance Table (PDT for short) is defined as a sequence of pairs which contains the corresponding PDs of the different characters, formally denoted as : where () i P DV refers to the pruning distance of the i-th character. 
In this section, we present the hyper-centre relocation ( HCR ), to find 1-NN character of the query one, and pseudo k -NN to support PDM-based k -NN search with previously retrieved 1-NN result. Approximate Minimal Bounding Hypersphere  X  Given a query hypersphere () , q Vr  X  , the approximate minimal bounding hyper-sphere ( AMBH ) of it is a new hypersphere () , p VR  X  where 1-NN character of q V and () p R VQR V = . That is to say, 
A MBH V r V R = X  either contains or approximates to Clustering Characters  X  In order to further reduce the search region, the characters in  X  are first grouped into T clusters using agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, e.g., BIRCH[3], the result of which is saved in an auxiliary structure. For a cluster C , [1, ] iT  X  , we randomly select a character in centroid, i O of this cluster, except the character at the boundary of this cluster. Thus we model a cluster as a tightly bounded hyper-sphere described by its centroid and radius . D
EFINITION 3 (C LUSTER R ADIUS ). Given a cluster distance between i O and the character which is farthest to defined as the cluster radius of i C , denoted as i CR . 
Given a cluster i C , the cluster hypersphere of it is denoted as 
OCR  X  , which is represented as a dash circle in Figure 8, where i O is the centroid of cluster i C , i CR is the cluster radius. D
EFINITION 4 (C ENTROID D ISTANCE ). Given a character centroid distance is defined as the distance between the centre of cluster that i V belongs to: 
AMBH is proposed to approximately represent the query hyper-sphere. We now present how to quickly get the new center, by using the DDM -based approach consisting of the uniform-start-distance and centroid-distance-based methods. D EFINITION 5 (S TA RT D ISTANCE ). Given a character i V , the Start-Distance(SD for short) of it is the distance between character and character o V , formally defined as: where (, ) io dV V is the distance between i V and dimensionality of i V is the same to that of o dimensional coordinate values of each point in o V is &lt;0,0&gt;. D
EFINITION 6 (U NIFORM S TA RT -D ISTANCE ). Given a characters V with dimensionality i d , the Uniform Start-Distance(USD for short) of i V are formally defined as: where i d is the dimensionality of i V , D refers to the uniform dimensionality and it satisfies i D d  X  , [1, ] in  X  . 
For a character i V in a cluster, it could be represented as a four-tuple: where i refers to the i -th character and Cid is the ID of the cluster V belongs to. Then the USD and the CD of i V are combined to get the index key of i V which is shown as follows: where  X  X  X  (), i CD V  X  denotes a rounded () places and  X  ={1,2,3,...}. The c is a large constant which is used to constant which should be set la rge enough to normalize the value 
USD V into the range of [0,1] via division by MAX_USD . Thus, it is guaranteed that the search range of USD and CD would not be overlapping. Given a character i V , the  X  of i V is defined as the distance between i V and its 1-NN character, i.e., () dV NNV , where 1() i NN V refers to the 1-NN character of
According to the query rationale of PDM, given a query character q V , due to the introduction of relevance feedback process, once k is set by a relatively large value, the k-NN search of may not surely guarantee to return k nearest neighbor characters since the number of semantically identical characters to pseudo k-NN search (P k -NN), which is performed in two steps: first, when a user submits a query character q V , the procedure of hyper centre relocation is invoked to return its 1-NN, p V . Secondly, the search starts with a small radius, and step by step, the radius is increased to form a bigger query sphere iteratively. Once the number of candidate characters is larger than k , the () Sk characters which are farthest to the query one are identified and removed from S . In this way, just the k nearest neighbor characters 
V is returned. 
We present an extensive performance study to evaluate the effectiveness of PDM and compare it to the following competitive techniques: iDistance and NB-Tree. To verify the effectiveness of PDM, we used the Chinese Calligraphic characters image data from China-America Academic Digital Library Project [4] as the experimental data which contains a set of contour point features extracted from the 12,000 characters images in which each feature the number of page accesses and the total response time as the performance metric. The results are reported in Figure1. (a) I/O cost vs. Data size Figure 1 reveals that PDM is superi or to iDistance and NB-tree in terms of both I/O and CPU cost.
