 Yuxiang Wu, Qing Zhou, Christine W. Chan n 1. Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is one of the important greenhouse gases (GHG) responsible for about 70% of the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming. This is currently an important issue because greenhouse gas emissions have serious adverse effects on the environment, including rising sea levels, flooding of coastal cities, severe drought conditions in inland regions, and species endangerment. Combustion of carbon-based fuels in power generation and in various industrial processes such as cement manufacture and hydrogen production have produced large amount of carbon dioxide. Due to escalating public concerns about environmental pollution and global warming, the post-combustion CO 2 capture technology is commonly adopted for reducing industrial CO 2 emissions. Research on the CO 2 capture technology is currently ongoing at the International Test Centre for CO 2 capture (ITC) located in Regina, Saskatchewan of Canada. The process of amine-based CO 2 capture implemented at ITC can be briefly described as follows: the pre-treated industrial flue gas reacts with the amine solvent in the absorber column. With the high temperature steam, the amine solvent selectively absorbs CO 2 from the flue gas. Then, the rich amine solvent that is carrying CO 2 is passed through a regeneration column. The CO 2 is extracted from the amine solvent in the column, and the lean amine solvent is regenerated. The regenerated amine solvent returns to the process for further CO 2 absorption. The CO is post-treated and can be stored or used for other industrial purposes.

The research on post-combustion CO 2 capture has been ongoing in the last two decades, and its primary objective is to improve efficiency of the CO 2 capture process while reducing specific operating problems such as solvent degradation and corrosion. A prerequisite for enhancing efficiency of the CO capture process is to obtain a good understanding of the intricate relationships among parameters involved in the CO 2 capture process. The objective of our study is to explicate the nature of relationships among the key process parameters using the approaches of data modeling and analysis. Since the rate of CO production is a significant variable for measuring performance of the pilot plant, this is a key parameter under study. A review of the relevant literature reveals that the most significant para-meters influencing the CO 2 production rate include heat duty, circulation rate of the solvent, CO 2 lean loading, and solvent concentration. The data which provided the basis of our modeling study were collected from the amine-based post-combustion CO capture process at ITC.

Since this is an exploration study that aims at unraveling the nature of relationships among the key parameters of this important process, different data analysis techniques were adopted because it was not known at the start of the study which technique is best suited for the domain. This paper reports on the work conducted applying the statistical and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches. In the statistical approach investigation, the parameters that have significant impact on the plant performance were used for developing four mathematical models ( Zhou et al., 2008 ). In the second approach, neural network models were developed on the relationships among parameters based on the operational data, and the sensitivity analysis method was applied to each model to reveal the order of significance among the input parameters. This paper describes the modeling and analysis procedure adopted in the two approaches, as well as a comparison of the results generated.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the background literature relevant to the areas of CO 2 capture, statistical regression, artificial neural network, and sensitivity analysis. Section 3 describes the procedures and results of statistical modeling. Section 4 describes the process of neural network modeling combined with sensitivity analysis. Section 5 presents process of expert validation and the refined models developed as a result are discussed in Section 6. Section 7 provides a comparison of the results from the two modeling approaches, a conclusion, and some directions for future work. 2. Background 2.1. CO 2 capture domain The configuration of the CO 2 capture plant of ITC is shown in Fig. 1, and the CO 2 capture process is described as follows. Prior to
CO removal, the flue gas is pre-treated in the inlet gas scrubber (1), where the flue gas is cooled down, and particulates and other impurities such as sulfur oxide (SO x ) and nitrogen oxide (NO removed as much as possible. The pre-treated flue gas is passed into the absorber (2) from its bottom by an inlet-gas feed blower (3), which provides the necessary pressure for the flue gas to overcome the pressure drop in the absorber. The lean amine solution pumped from the lean amine storage tank (4) entered the upper portion of the absorber. The flue gas and lean amine solution contact each other counter-currently in the absorber.
With the high temperature steam provided by the boiler (5), the amine solution selectively absorbs CO 2 from the flue gas. The CO free flue gas, called off gas, is passed into the off gas scrubber (6), where the off gas is cooled down by the circulated cooling water and then vented into the atmosphere.

The amine solution carrying CO 2 , which is called CO 2 -rich amine, is passed through the rich amine surge vessel (7), where the hydrocarbon is separated from the amine solution, and then the rich amine solution is sent to the lean/rich amine heat exchanger (8). In the lean/rich amine heat exchanger, the rich amine is heated to about 105 1 C by means of the lean amine solution. The heated CO 2 -rich amine then enters the upper portion of the stripper (9). The reboiler (10) under the stripper provides the steam to extract CO 2 from the rich amine solution, which is recovered to the lean amine solution. Most of the lean amine solution passes through the lean amine cooler (11), where the lean amine is cooled down by the circulated cooling water and then is recycled in the lean amine storage tank for further CO absorption. A small portion of the lean amine is fed to a reclaimer (12), where the degradation by-products and heat stable salts (HSS) are removed. The non-regenerable sludge is left behind in the reclaimer and can be collected and disposed of. The CO product and water vapor from the top of the stripper is passed through a reflux condenser (13). Most water is condensed here, and then the residual amine solvent passes through the reflux accumulator (14) and flows back to the stripper column reflux section to help desorb CO 2 again. The CO 2 product enters a CO wash scrubber (15), where the CO 2 gas is cooled down to the desired temperature of 4 1 C. From there, CO 2 can be vented into the atmosphere or passed through a dryer and purification unit (16) to produce food grade quality CO 2 .

The objective of our study is to focus on the key parameters that are significant for assessing the process efficiency and plant performance. Among over one hundred parameters in the CO 2 capture process, the domain experts identified the four para-meters that significantly affect process efficiency. They include CO 2 production rate, heat duty, lean loading, and CO 2 absorption efficiency. These are defined as dependent variables in our study, and they are briefly explained as follows: (1) CO 2 production rate reflects the amount of wet CO 2 extracted (2) Heat duty is the amount of heat required for amine solvent (3) CO 2 absorption efficiency reflects the amount of the CO (4) Lean loading is the amount of CO 2 contained in the
It is noted that CO 2 absorption efficiency and CO 2 production rate are two completely different parameters measured at different phases of the CO 2 capture process. CO 2 absorption efficiency indicates the percentage of CO 2 initially extracted from the flue gas. It is measured at the absorption phase of the process and is an indicator for performance of the absorber. The extracted CO 2 will be further processed after absorption, and is desorbed by the amine solution in the regeneration phase. It is cooled in the CO 2 wash scrubber, and then processed by the dry and purifica-tion unit to become the final product. The CO 2 production rate represents the amount of wet CO 2 product produced before drying and being released into the atmosphere, and its unit is in ton/day. This parameter is an indicator for the performance of multiple components in the process because uneven performance of any single component can influence the amount of wet CO produced. 2.2. Statistical regression
The statistical study is conducted using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences or SPSS (Trademark of SPSS Inc., USA). SPSS has been selected because of three reasons: (1) it can implement multivariate statistical procedures to analyze the characteristics of the data samples, (2) it supports both linear and non-linear function modeling, and (3) it can generate mathematical models that describe the nature of the relationships among the para-meters. SPSS can perform multiple regressions to develop a linear equation, in which each predictor variable has its own coefficient, and the outcome variable is predicted from a combination of all the variables multiplied by their respective coefficients ( Field, 2000 ). The equation can be expressed as follows: Y  X  b 0  X  b 1 X 1  X  b 2 X 2  X  X  b n X n  X  e i Y is the outcome variable, b 1 the coefficient of the first predictor X , b 2 the coefficient of the second predictor X 2, b n the coefficient of the predictor X n , and e i the difference between the predicted and the observed value of Y .

Moreover, SPSS provides 10 curve functions, which include logarithmic, inverse, quadratic, cubic, power, logistic, exponential, etc. If the scatter-plot of the data shows that the parameters are not linearly related, SPSS can perform curve estimation and fit the data with all the curve functions. The curve which best fits the data is selected and a non-linear model can be developed. 2.3. Artificial neural network and sensitivity analysis
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational system based on the operation mechanism of biological neural networks ( Dorf, 1997 ). During the process of neural network training or learning, a set of data including inputs and desired outputs are provided to the network model. Based on different learning algorithms, the neural network is constructed by fitting itself to the training data to  X  X earn X  to predict the unknown outputs.
Sensitivity analysis (SA) is the study of how the variation or uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model can be apportioned, qualitatively or quantitatively, to different sources of variation in the input of a model ( Cacuci et al., 2005 ). Sensitivity analysis helps to reveal the relative significance of input parameter(s) in predicting output values ( Yao, 2003 ). The approach also helps model builders study the uncertainties associated with the model parameters, which is especially important for domains that are not well understood ( Hodouin et al., 1991 ).

The requirements for setting up ANN systems include data on the past performance of the studied system and a selected set of neural-network models ( Kalogirou, 2001 ). Kreider and Wang (1995) applied ANNs to predict the rates of energy use in commercial buildings for determining the energy use of chillers by employing hourly averaged data collected from the system, and their results have satisfactory prediction accuracy. Anderson et al. (1996) used simulated performance values to train an ANN to predict the steady-state output of a proportional-integral (PI) controller, and the study was able to improve performance with respect to tracking the temperature set-point of a simulated heating-coil. In Christo et al. (1995) , an ANN was successfully applied to model the chemical reactions in turbulent combustion simulations, and the results showed that the ANNs could describe the general behavior of the chemical reactions with high accuracy. Some relevant works on applying ANN modeling combined with sensitivity analysis (SA) have been conducted in the domains of business, and engineering ( Baker et al., 1999; Cullen and Frey, 1999; Embrechts et al., 2001; Poh et al., 1998; Fraedrich and Goldberg, 2000; Kleijnen, 1995 ).

The approach of combining ANN and SA was applied to the abundant operational data from the CO 2 capture process. In addition to applying the combined approach, the results gener-ated were also validated by the domain experts. The detailed triangulation of modeling results constitutes a novelty of our study. 3. Application 3.1. Parameter selection
As mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, the four dependent parameters of the study are CO 2 production rate, heat duty, lean loading, and CO 2 absorption efficiency, and the independent parameters are the process parameters that influence CO 2 efficiency and system performance, which are: amine concentration, amine circulation rate (FT-600), steam flow rate (FT-103C), steam pressure (PT-103A), reboiler pressure (PT-660), CO 2 concentration in flue gas (AIT-203), absorber inlet gas actual flow factored for concentration (FI-200ACT), and off gas flow rate (FI-901). Based on a review of relevant literature ( Idem et al., 2006; Rao et al., 2006;
Aroonwilas and Veawab, 2004, 2007; Sakwattanapong et al., 2005 ) and the operators X  expertise, the relations between the key parameters have been developed and are presented in Fig. 2.
The arrows in Fig. 2 connect from each dependent parameter to the related independent parameters which influence it. For example, the dependent parameter of CO 2 production rate is influenced by heat duty, reboiler pressure (PT-660), amine circulation rate (FT-600), and amine concentration. The depen-dent parameters are called predicted or output variable and the independent parameters are the predictors or input variables.
While both statistical analysis and ANN analysis approaches were adopted for developing models for the four predicted variables, the set of the predictor variables selected was different for the two approaches. The statistical study relied on the relationships indicated in Fig. 2 for modeling each predicted variable, while ANN modeling included all the predictors for modeling each predicted variable. For example, while only the three parameters of steam pressure (PT-103A), steam flow rate (FT-103C), and amine circulation rate (FT-600) were used for modeling heat duty in the statistical study, all the eight predictor variables were used for predicting heat duty in the ANN study. 3.2. Data filtering
The data were collected from the CO 2 capture process at ITC during the years from 2003 to 2006. To enhance the accuracy and reliability of the models, the data were examined and filtered in three steps so that only stable data were used for building the models. The filtering process includes three steps as follows:
Step 1: During some days, the data were collected during short time frames of half an hour. These data were considered not stable enough to reflect the changing trend of the operations at the plant and hence, removed.

Step 2: Typically, the plant does not perform in a stable manner in the morning and during the one hour before shut down, and the data collected during these periods of time were considered unreliable. Therefore, the data before 12:30 pm and after 3:30 pm were removed.

Step 3: After examination of the data set, it was found that some of the parameters behaved in an erratic manner; for example, the steam pressure increases 20 kPa in 10 min. Data that exhibit abnormal performance are deemed unreliable and hence, they are removed.

The data that remained after the filtering steps appeared to be stable and reflect noticeable trends on a daily basis. This set of data was assumed to describe normal and reliable plant performance; it was used as input for our modeling study. 4. Regression analysis
The statistical modeling process involved three steps: (1) correlation analysis, (2) regression analysis, and (3) model assessment. In the process of correlation analysis, the significance of the correlations among each independent variable and dependent variables were examined. The insignificant indepen-dent parameters were removed, and the significant ones remained as inputs for the regression analysis. In the second step, multiple linear regression was implemented to fit the data samples. If the data set appeared to fit a non-linear relationship, then curve estimation was applied using the non-linear functions in SPSS. The function that best fitted the data was selected and the non-linear model was developed. The three steps are discussed in greater details as follows. 4.1. Correlation analysis
The significance of the correlation between each independent and dependent variable was examined by correlation analysis.
Since all the variables are correlated to some extent, the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable are confounding. Hence, the correlation test was conducted to identify a unique relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable while controlling the effects of the other independent variables.

Based on the relations shown in Fig. 2, the parameters that can influence CO 2 production rate (FT-700) include amine circulation rate (FT-600), reboiler pressure (PT-600), heat duty, and amine concentration (molarity). Table 1 lists the correlation between
CO production rate (FT-700) and each relevant independent variable, and the significance of the correlation.

Generally, any probability value below 0.05 is considered statistically meaningful and regarded as indicative of a genuine effect. Table 1 shows that all independent variables except reboiler pressure (PT-660) (which has a significance value of 0.121) were found to have a significance correlation-coefficient.
Since reboiler pressure (PT-660) does not have a significant effect on CO 2 production rate (FT-700), it is removed from the regression analysis. 4.2. Regression analysis
The regression model of CO 2 production rate (FT-700) is summarized in Table 2.
 CO 2 Production Rate Heat Duty Lean Loading Absorption Efficiency 
The model includes the independent variables of heat duty, amine circulation rate (FT-600), and amine concentration (molarity). R represents the value of the multiple correlation coefficients, which indicates that there is a strong correlation between the values of the observed FT-700 and that of FT-700 predicted by the model ( R  X  0.847). R 2 represents the amount of variation in the consequent variable of CO 2 production rate (FT-700) that is accounted for by the model, and measures how well the regression model performs in predicting FT-700. It shows that the three independent variables of heat duty, amine circulation rate, and amine concentration can explain 71.8% of the variation in CO 2 production rate ( R 2  X  0.718). The F -ratio is a measure of how much the improvement in prediction made by the model compared to the level of inaccuracy of the model. Since a good model can be defined as one which has a large improvement in prediction and small inaccuracy, a good model should have a large F -ratio that is at least greater than 1. The F -ratio for the model is 92.60 and the associated significance shows the F -ratio is highly significant ( p o 0.001). All the factors listed in Table 2 support our conclusion that the model including heat duty, amine circulation rate (FT-600), and amine concentra-tion (molarity) has fairly high prediction power on the CO production rate.

Table 3 provides the details of the model parameters and the significance of these values. The estimated regression coefficients are given under the column of  X  X  X nstandardized Coefficients X  X , which represents the predicted change in the CO 2 production rate (FT-700) when the independent variable is changed by one unit. The t -value is a measure of whether the independent variable is making a significant contribution to the model. If the t -value associated with a coefficient is significant, i.e. if the value in the column label sig. is less than 0.05, then the independent variable is making a significant contribution to the model. The smaller the value of sig . and the larger the value of t , the greater is the contribution of that independent variable. Table 3 lists the t -values of all the independent variables. It shows that the parameters of amine circulation rate ( t (1 1 3)  X  14.107, p o 0.001), heat duty ( t (1 1 3)  X  6.960, p o 0.001) and amine concentration ( t (1 1 3)  X  2.046, p o 0.05) are all significant predictors of the production rate of CO 2 . Moreover, the variable of amine circulation rate (FT-600) has the largest impact while that of amine concentration has the smallest impact on the CO production rate. Based on the coefficient of each independent variable, the regression model for the CO 2 production rate (FT-700) is: CO 2 production rate  X  0 : 042  X  X  0 : 027 amine-circulation-rate  X  The coefficients reveal the degree to which each predictor affects the CO 2 production rate: (1) if the amine circulation rate increases by 1 kg/min, then the CO 2 production rate increases by 0.027 units, (2) if the heat duty increases by 1000 BTU/lb Mole-CO then the CO 2 production rate increases by 0.004 units, (3) if the amine concentration increases by one mole, then the CO 2 production rate increases by 0.025 units. 4.3. Model assessment
After developing the regression model, its acceptability and reliability are assessed in this step. The modeling process involved three assumptions, and each assumption is assessed individually as described below: 1. There is no multicollinearity between the independent vari-ables. The variance inflation factor (VIF) indicates whether a predictor has a strong linear relationship with the other predictors, and any VIF value that is greater than 10 would be a concern. Tolerance is the reciprocal of VIF, and a tolerance value of less than 0.1 indicates a serious problem. Since it can be seen from Table 3 that the values of VIF are less than 10 and those of tolerance are greater than 0.1, it can be concluded that the assumption of no multicollinearity is satisfied. 2. The residuals are randomly distributed. The residuals measure the difference between the values of the dependent variable predicted by the model and the values of the independent variable observed in the sample. The standardized residual plot generated by SPSS shows that 95% of the standardized residuals lie within the range from  X 2 to 2, which indicates that the assumption of random distributed residuals is satisfied. 3. The residuals arise from a normal distribution. The normality probability plot is generated by SPSS, which plots the standardized residuals expected from a standard normal distribution against the observed residuals. The result shows that the assumption of normal distributed residuals is satisfied.
The above assessment procedures show that the assumptions of statistical modeling are all satisfied. Hence, it can be concluded that the developed model is acceptable and reliable. 4.4. Model summary
Similar to the prediction model for CO 2 production rate, the statistical models for predicting heat duty, lean loading, and absorption efficiency were developed and summarized in Table 4. The values of R 2 show that the accuracy of the four models is between 70% and 90%. In an effort to improve upon the prediction accuracy of our developed statistical models, we adopted the ANN approach, which is presented in Section 5. 5. Neural network modeling combined with sensitivity analysis
The second approach of combining neural network and sensitivity analysis was adopted to generate an analytical model that relates the 8 independent with 4 dependent variables. The data analysis process involves: (1) constructing the artificial neural network models, (2) conducting sensitivity analysis on the modeling results, (3) validating the results with experts, and (4) reformulating and reapplying the neural network model to the data and generating results. The process is shown in Fig. 3, and discussed in detail as follows. 5.1. Construct the ANN models
The typical architecture of a simple three-layered ANN model is shown in Fig. 4. It consists of an input layer responsible for accepting input signals, and an output layer for exporting the output data. The middle layer, called the hidden layer, is only visible internally and has no direct contact with the outside.
Relevant research shows a correlation between the accuracy of predictive results and the network configurations ( Han and
Kamber, 2006 ), hence the configuration of the network has to be determined before importing the data. It has been suggested that a back-propagation neural network is an efficient function approximator, because the network includes a sufficient number of hidden nodes with sigmoid output functions ( Poh et al., 1998 ).
In our study, a feed-forward back-propagation neural network was adopted for its simplicity and maturity. Generally, the number of units in the input layer depends on the number of known inputs, and the number of the output layer units is determined by the desired outputs. Since there are 4 dependent and 8 independent parameters in our study, the number of units in the input and output layer are, respectively, 4 and 8. The number of hidden layers was set to 1 because a one hidden layer network is typically sufficient for modeling industrial tasks. As no clear rule exists for determining the number of hidden layer units, one suggestion is to define the number of hidden units as half of the sum of the inputs and output units ( Poh et al., 1998 ). Hence, the number of units in the hidden layer is set to 6 in our study.
The learning rate and momentum are set to 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, because the two values are commonly used in industrial process modeling ( Hodouin et al., 1991 ). The ANN models were run for 500, 1000, and 2000 iterations during the model building process, and it was found that there is no significant difference among the accuracies of the generated models. Hence, we adopted 500 iterations as a reasonable number of runs.

After determining these parameters, the ANN model was trained with the following parameters: Number of inputs: 8 Number of outputs: 4 Number of hidden layers: 1 Number of hidden layer units: 6 Learning rate: 0.3 Momentum: 0.2 Activation function: sigmoid function Number of epochs: 500
The back-propagation network searches for an optimal con-figuration, or the best choices of the weights for all neurons, which would fit the network to the provided data. The procedure generally consists of two steps: First, when the inputs are transmitted to a neuron, the activation values are propagated to the output units, and the actual network output is compared with the desired output values. An error is found in each of the output units. The total error is calculated using a formula called the error function or cost function as shown below ( Poh et al., 1998 )
E  X  1 2 where O ip represents the actual value from the i th output unit in the p th training samples, while t ip is for the desired output.
In the second step, the errors calculated in the first step are passed back from the outputs to the inputs via the hidden layer(s). Each unit X  X  output error can be calculated from the total error from the first step based on the weights in the unit . This is why the method is called back-propagation. Since the errors from each unit X  X  output is known, the network updates the weights from the output unit back to all the hidden units that are connected to it until it reaches the input units, in order to minimize the error ( Poh et al., 1998 ). w where Z is the learning rate set by the researcher; and r E is an estimate of the gradient of E with respect to w k in the k th iteration.
After the weights are adjusted, step one is repeated to check if the result can satisfy the preset condition. If not, these two steps will be repeated recursively until the total error converges. 5.2. Results of ANN modeling
The ANN models were constructed using Weka version 3.4.12 (Trademark of Weka), which is a data mining software in Java that includes a collection of machine learning algorithms. The 8 independent input parameters of the 4 ANN models include (1) absorber in gas actual flow (FI-200ACT), (2) input absorber fluid CO 2 gas (AIT-203), (3) absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901), (4) lean amine to absorber flow rate (FT-600), (5) reboiler pressure (PT-660), (6) pressure of steam entered reboiler (PT-103A), (7) steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C) and (8) amine concen-tration (molarity). Four different prediction models were devel-oped for each of dependent variables: (1) CO 2 production rate, (2) heat duty, (3) CO 2 absorption efficiency and (4) lean loading.
A summary of the four prediction models developed for each of the four target outputs is shown in Table 5. The correlation-coefficient ( R ) represents the amount of variation in the consequent variable that is accounted for by the model ( Field, 2000 ); it is a measure of how well the model performs in predicting the dependent variable ( Einspruch, 1998 ). The R -value for the ANN prediction model for CO 2 production rate is 99%, while the prediction models for heat duty, absorption efficiency and lean loading all approximate or are over 90%. From the prediction results, it can be seen that the models are simulating the relationships between the 8 independent variables and the 4 dependent variables with high accuracy.

We hypothesized that not all the independent parameters contribute significant influences on the target dependent outputs, and hence, they can be removed without reducing the predictive power of the model. To analyze the contribution of each input variable, sensitivity analysis on all the input parameters was conducted. 5.3. Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variables ( Poh et al., 1998 ), and a prediction model can be made more efficient by cutting the insignificant predictors. Two sensitivity analysis methods were adopted in this study, namely the equation method and the variable perturbation method. 5.3.1. Equation method
Hashem (1992) introduced the equation method of calculating output sensitivities to inputs X  variations for feed-forward ANN ( Hashem, 1992 ). His sensitivity calculation method was based on research results of Hornik et al. (1990) , who stated that the function to be approximated by the ANN need not be differenti-able in the classical sense as long as it possesses a generalized derivative, as is the case for certain piecewise differentiable functions. As shown in Sherif X  X  theory, the derivative of the ANN model X  X  output parameter with respect to the independent inputs can reveal the influence of the input variables. as the sensitivities of the outputs. The method formula is shown as followed. S  X  @ O @ I  X  O  X  1 O  X   X  where O is the value of an output node; h n k the input sum value of the ( n 1)th layer to the k th node in the n th layer; V n value of j th node in the n th layer after applying the activation equation to the sum value from previous layer; I i the i th input to the network; w n jk the connection weight between the j th node in layer n 1 and the k th node in layer n. S i the sensitivity result to the i th input.

The S i represents each input variable X  X  relative influence on the output parameter. The value is directly proportional to its influence. The ranking of the S i reveals the priority in which the input parameters influence the output variable. 5.3.2. Variable perturbation method
The other sensitivity calculation approach was presented in ( Klimasauskas, 1991 ). Klimasauskas used first-order sensitivity analysis, based on the perturbation of one input variable at a time and monitoring the outputs X  variations ( Hashem, 1992 ). Yao (2003) suggested two forms of the variable perturbation, which are: I  X  I n  X  d  X  8  X  or I  X  I n d  X  9  X  where I n represents the n th input and d the change that is introduced to the input variable I n . This method is more intuitive and straightforward compared to the equation methods. It adjusts oneinputvalueby d while keeping the other inputs unchanged and monitors the output variations. This procedure is applied recur-sively to every data point for that particular observed input variable. Then output changes are gathered from each run and an averaged value is calculated. The average value can indicate the influence of the observed input to the output. This step is repeated on each input parameter until all of their sensitivities are obtained.

Since the equation and variable perturbation methods calcu-late the sensitivities in different ways, the two methods use different units and are incomparable. However, each method generates a sensitivity ranking for the input variables, which reveals the relative influences of the inputs. 5.3.3. Sensitivity analysis results
Since Weka is an open source software, customized code can be added to enhance the capability of the software. The equation and variable perturbation methods of sensitivity analysis were implemented by adding a small module into Weka version 3.4.12 (Trademark of Weka). The enhanced system was then applied to each of the four ANN models presented in Section 5.2. In the prediction model for CO 2 production rate (FI-700), the model consists of 9 independent parameters, which include (1) absorber in gas actual flow (FI-200ACT), (2) input absorber fluid CO (AIT-203), (3) absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901), (4) lean amine to absorber flow rate (FT-600), (5) reboiler pressure (PT-660), (6) pressure of steam entered reboiler (PT-103A), (7) steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C), (8) amine concentration (molarity) and (9) the amount of energy used for solvent regeneration (heat duty). The sensitivity analysis results and relative influences of each parameter to the CO 2 production rate are listed in Table 6. It is noted that while heat duty is a dependent variable, it can act also as an independent variable because according to the experts, it might have significant influence on the production rate. Hence it is added as an independent or input variable in this model.
As we can see from Table 6, the steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C) has the greatest influence on the CO 2 production rate based on the equation method of sensitivity analysis. On the other hand, the results from applying the variable perturbation method show that not only the steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C), but also amine concentration (molarity) contribute significantly to the CO 2 production rate. The different mechanisms used in the two methods caused the divergent results. The equation method calculates the sensitivity layer by layer recursively, which means it can identify the hidden connections between the input and the output variable inside the hidden layer(s). On the other hand, the variable perturbation method is more intuitive because it adjusts one input at a time while keeping the others unchanged, and then evaluates the change caused by the changed input on the output variable.

While it cannot be determined from the results which method is more accurate, it is possible to identify which parameter(s) are not useful to this model. From Table 6 it can be seen that both methods reveal that absorber in gas actual flow (FI-200ACT), input absorber fluid CO 2 gas (AIT-203), absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901), lean amine to absorber flow rate (FT-600) and reboiler pressure (PT-660) have very low sensitivities compared to the other independent parameters. In other words, changes in these parameters would not affect the target outputs. By elimin ating the insignificant variables from the model, we can simplify the model.

Similar analyses were conducted on the other 3 prediction models for heat duty, lean loading, and absorption efficiency, and the results are shown in Tables 7 X 9.

For the heat duty model (Table 7), it is observed that the equation method results are very different from those of the variable perturbation method. But in either case, the parameter of amine concentration (molarity) and absorption efficiency both show relatively low sensitivities to the heat duty compared to the other inputs. Hence, the two input parameters can be eliminated.
In the lean loading model (Table 8), it can be observed that all the parameters show some influence on the output and no input variables need to be eliminated. This observation needs to be validated by the experts.

Table 9 describes the prediction model for absorption efficiency. It can be observed that the sensitivity analysis results from the two SA calculation methods are very similar. Based on our observation, only the parameter of lean loading needs to be removed from the inputs. Again, this has to be validated by the experts. The expert validation process will be discussed in the next section. 6. Expert validation and model reformulation
The process engineer and chief operator of ITC validated the results generated from the SA during an interview. Their observations are discussed as follows. In the prediction model for CO 2 production rate (FI-700) (Table 10), the SA results suggest that the parameters of (1) reboiler pressure (PT-660), (2) pressure of steam entered reboiler (PT-103A), (3) steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C), (4) amine concentration (molarity) and (5) the amount of energy used for solvent regeneration (heat duty) have significant influence on the output parameter of CO 2 production rate. The experts agreed with the SA results. In addition, they considered the following parameters to be important predictors of CO 2 production rate (FI-700): (a) absorber in gas actual flow (FI-200ACT) and (b) lean amine to absorber flow rate (FT-600). The difference between the experts X  opinions and the SA results can be explained by the range of values of the modeled data. The experts believed that even though the two latter parameters are not so important within the range of the training data, they should be included as key factors for predicting CO 2 production rate in the general case.

Based on the SA results, the CO 2 production rate model was refined and the two parameters of input absorber fluid CO (AIT-203) and absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901) were removed from the model to reduce its complexity. Table 10 (last column) shows the reformulated ANN model for CO 2 production rate prediction, in which the parameters used in the model are marked by  X  X  X . It is noted from the last row of Table 10 that the R of the refined model (0.999) is the same as the R -value of the original model (0.999). In other words, the refined model is able to predict
CO production rate as well as the original model even though two input parameters were eliminated.

Similar validations were conducted for the other three prediction models, which are discussed as follows.

For the heat duty model (Table 11), the SA results showed that the amine concentration (molarity) and absorption efficiency parameters contribute little influence to the heat duty output.
However, the experts insisted that the two parameters are useful in the general situation. Moreover, they suggested that the parameters of absorber in gas actual flow (the tag name is
FI-200ACT), absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901) and reboiler pressure (PT-660) can be removed from the model. Although this suggestion does not agree with our observations from the SA, the model was refined according to the experts X  suggestions because we believe that the experts X  experiences are more valuable. The
R -value in the refined model is 0.9018, which is about 2% less than the original model X  X  R -value of 0.929. Hence, we conclude that the elimination of the three parameters was acceptable.

In the lean loading model (Table 12), the SA results from the two different methods were not consistent. During the validation process, we found the experts X  opinions were more aligned with the results from the perturbation method. Hence, the experts X  opinions were combined with the perturbation method results and we concluded that the input parameters of absorber fluid CO gas (AIT-203), absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901) and heat duty can be removed from the original model. The R -value of the refined model is 0.851 and compared to the R -value of the original model of 0.884, this is only a 3% decrease. Therefore, the elimination of the three variables was acceptable.

For the absorption efficiency model (Table 13), the SA results suggested that the lean loading parameter can be eliminated. The experts validated the SA results and hence, the lean loading parameter was removed from the original model. Compared to the original model X  X  R -value of 0.9475, the refined model X  X 
R -value is 0.9233. The decline of about 2% in the R -value indicates that the elimination of the parameter of lean loading was acceptable.

It can be observed from the R -values for the three prediction models for heat duty, lean loading and absorption efficiency that the refined models can still predict the target outputs with relatively high accuracy. Since the reductions in the refined models X  R -values have been limited to within 3 percentage points, the predictive powers of the refined models are considered acceptable and with fewer input parameters, the refined models have the advantages of greater simplicity and requiring less training time. Table 14 gives a comparison between the R -values derived from the ANN modeling and the statistical study, which shows that the ANN approach was able to predict the CO 2 production rate with higher accuracy than the statistical study. For predicting the other three parameters of heat duty, lean loading, and absorption efficiency, the two approaches provide comparable results. 7. Discussion and conclusion This section discusses some observations on the statistical and ANN modeling approaches from the perspectives of predictive accuracy, inclusion of parameters, support for exploration and explication of problem space, modeling uncertainty, and involve-ment of experts.

On predictive accuracy, the correlation-coefficient ( R ) repre-sents the amount of variation in the consequent variable that is accounted for by the model. The correlation-coefficient is a good indicator for evaluating the model X  X  prediction accuracy. From Table 14, it can be seen that both the statistical and ANN models generated fairly high R -values for the prediction models for lean loading, heat duty, and absorption efficiency. On the other hand, the ANN model can predict the CO 2 production rate with a much higher accuracy of 0.999 compared to the statistical method, which has an accuracy of 0.847.

In terms of support for exploration and explication of problem space, while the statistical approach can only develop linear and specific non-linear relationships among the parameters, the ANN technique supports exploration of all types of irregular non-linear relationships among the parameters. Therefore, the ANN techni-que supports a more comprehensive exploration and modeling of the problem space. However, the ANN model acts like a black box and cannot explicate the nature of the relationships among the process parameters. By contrast, the statistical method developed mathematical equations that explicate the relationships among the independent and dependent parameters.

In terms of parameter inclusion, the statistical study had relied solely on experts X  opinions for selection of inputs. The experts specified the input parameters they believed are causally related to each dependent parameter, and any uncertain input para-meters were ignored. In the ANN modeling study, all of the eight independent parameters were initially used for neural network training. When the relative importance of the input parameters was revealed through sensitivity analysis, some of them were eliminated from the neural network models. Therefore, compared to the statistical study, the ANN modeling process included more input parameters.

In terms of modeling uncertainty, the statistical models were developed based on human expertise, and the relationships among the independent and dependent parameters were defined before model development. In this process, the uncertainty that existed in the relationships was ignored. By contrast, the ANN models included all relevant parameters, whether they are certain or uncertain. Subsequent application of sensitivity analysis revealed the less significant parameters, which were eliminated from the developed models. Since both certain and uncertain parameters are included, we believe this approach of combining ANN and sensitivity analysis is more reliable. This approach is also more suitable especially when a new domain is tackled, and a quick prediction model is desired.

In terms of involvement of experts, although the statistical study relied strongly on the experts X  opinions for formulating the initial relationships, the ANN study involved more frequent discussions with the experts during validation of the SA results. It can be noted that the sensitivity analysis results often diverged from the experts X  opinions. This can be a strength of the approach because the difference triggered the experts to reconsider the relationships among the parameters. In fact, some of the uncertain parameters initially ignored in the statistical modeling process are later found to have some effects on the dependent parameters.

In conclusion, the objective of our work is to enhance understanding about the CO 2 capture process by attempting to explicitly model the relationships among the key process parameters that affect system efficiency. Since it was unknown at the onset of the study which approach would yield the best results, diverse data modeling approaches were adopted. In this paper, we present our work applying the statistical and neural network modeling approaches to the process data, and also compared the results from the two approaches. We observe that each approach can provide a different perspective on the generated data models. The two approaches have been adopted among others that will be used. In the future, we will continue to explore other data modeling approaches, so as to identify one which will provide satisfactory results and fulfill our objective of achieving explicate models of the CO 2 capture process.
