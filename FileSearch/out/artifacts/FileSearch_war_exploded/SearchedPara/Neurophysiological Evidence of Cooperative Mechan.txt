 The human visual system is able to extract three-dimensional (3D) structures in random noise stereograms even when such images evoke no percep tible patterns when viewed monocularly [1]. Bela Julesz proposed that this is accomplished by a stereopsis mechanism that detects correlated shifts in 2D noise patterns between the two eyes. He also suggested that this mechanism likely involves cooperative neural processing early in the visual system. Marr and Poggio formalized the computational constraints for solving stereo matching (Fig. random dot stereogram patterns [2]. Their algorithm was based on two rules: (1) each ele-ment or feature is unique (i.e ., can be assigned only one dispar ity) and (2) surfaces of objects are cohesive (i.e., depth change s gradually across space). To desc ribe their algorithm in neu-rophysiological terms, we can consider neurons in primary visual cortex as simple element or feature detectors. The first rule is implemented by introducing competitive interactions (mutual inhibition) am ong neurons of different disparity tuning at each location (Fig. 1b, location. The second rule is implemented by introducing cooperative interactions (mutual facilitation) among neurons tuned to the same de pth (image disparity) across different spatial locations (Fig. 1b, along the red dashed diagonal lin es). In other words, a disparity estimate estimates. A dynamic system under such constraints can relax to a stable global disparity map. Here, we present neurophysiological evidence of interactions between disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex that is consistent with this general approach. We sam-while displaying DRDS stimuli defined at various disparities (see stimulus Fig.1b). We then measured the dynamics of interactions by assessing the temporal evolution of correlation in neural responses. Figure 1: (a) Left and right images of random dot stereogram (right image has been shifted (red dashed lines) among disparity-tuned neurons with respect to space as defined by Marr and Poggio X  X  ster eo algorithm [2]. 2.1 Recording and stimulation Recordings were made in V1 of two awake, behaving macaques. We simultaneously re-corded from 4-8 electrodes providing data from up to 10 neurons in a single recording ses-sion (some electrodes recorded from as many as 3 neurons). We collected data from 112 neurons that provided 224 pairs for cross-correlation analysis. For stimuli, we used 12 Hz dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS; 25% density black and white pixels on a mean luminance background) presented in a 3.5-degree aperture. Liquid crystal shutter goggles were used to present random dot patterns to each eye separately. Eleven horizontal dispari-ties between the two eyes, ranging from  X 0.9 degrees, were tested. Seventy-four neurons (66%) had significant disparity tuning and 99 pairs (44%) were comprised of neurons that both had significant disparity tuning (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). Figure 2: (a) Example recording session from five electrodes in V1. (b) Receptive field (white box X  X rrow represents direction preference) and random dot stereogram locations for same recording session (small red square is the fixation spot). a b 2.2 Data analysis Interaction between neurons was described as "effective connectivity" defined by cross-correlation methods [3]. First, th e probability of al l joint spikes ( x and y ) between the two neurons was calculated for all times from stimulus onset ( t 1 and t 2 ) including all possible lag times ( t 1 -t 2 ) between the two neurons (2D joint peristimulus time histogram X  X PSTH). Next, the cross-product of each neuron X  X  PST H (joint probabilities e xpected from chance) was subtracted from the JPSTH; this differen ce is referred to as the cross-covariance histo-gram. Finally, the cross-cova riance histogram was nor malized by the geometric mean of the auto-covariance histograms: This normalized cross-covariance histogram is a 2D matrix of Pearson X  X  correlation coeffi-cients between the two neurons where the axes represent time from stimulus onset (Figure opposite diagonal represents lag time between the two neurons. We derived three measure-ments from this matrix to describe the  X  X ffectiv e connectivity X  between neuron pairs. Using bootstrapped samples of stimulus trials, we estimated 95% confidence intervals for these three measurements [4]. We first integrated along the principal diagonal to produce correla-tion versus lag time (i.e., the traditional cro ss-correlation histogram X  X CH). We used CCHs to find significant correlation at or near 0 ms lag times (suggesting synaptic connectivity between the neurons). Second, we integrated under the half-height full bandwidth of signifi-cant correlation peaks to quantif y effective connectivity. Fi gure 4 shows the population av-erage of normalized CCHs ( n = 27) and 95% confidence intervals. Finally, we repeated this integration along the principal diagonal to obtain the temporal evolution of effective connec-tivity (computed with a running 100 ms window). In computing effective connectivity with Equation 1, we assume trial-to-trial stationarity. If peaks can emerge that are not due to effective connectivity [5]. We applied a correction to equation 1 [5,6] based on the average firing rate for each trial. However, no significant dif-ference in correlation peaks was observed. In addition, changes in DRDS properties other than disparity did not cause significant changes to correlation peak properties. Finally, al-ternative cross-correlation methods (CCG) [7] using responses to the same exact random dot in correlation peak properties. These observations justify our assumption that the effective connectivity computed in our case does not arise due to trial-to-trial non-stationarity. Figure 4: (a) Population average CCH for 27 neuron pairs with a significant correlation (mean  X  s.e.m.). The primary indicator of whether or not a neuron pair had a significant correlation peak at or near a 0 ms lag time, for this class of stimuli, was similarity in disparity tuning between the two neurons. Neuron pairs with significant correlation peaks ( n = 27; 27%) tended to have more similar disparity peaks, bandwidths, and frequencies (deter mined from fitted Gabor functions) than neuron pairs that did not have significant correlation peaks. We quantified similarity in tuning using the similarity index ( SI ), which is Pearson X  X  product-moment cor-relation [8]: where i is each point on the disparity tuning curve, x and y are the firing rates at each point Figure 5a and 5b clearly show that both the probability of correlation and strength in correla-tion increase with greater SI ( n = 27 pairs). This relationship is limited to long-range inter-actions among neurons because our electrodes were all at least 1 mm apart. This suggests they are likely mediated by the well known long-range intracortical connections in V1 that link neurons of similar orientation across space [9]. Our results suggest that these connec-also depended on orientation (Figure 5c), V1 connectivity among neurons appears to depend on similarity across multiple cue dimensions. Figure 5: (a) Likelihood of significant correlation peak with respect to similar disparity tun-ing. (b) Strength of correlation increases with similarity. (c) Correlation is also more likely if orientation preference is similar. From the 12 pairs of neurons recorded on a single electrode, correlation was observed among neuron pairs with very similar disparity tuning as well as among neurons with nearly oppo-site disparity tuning (see also [8]). This suggests that antagonistic disparity-tuned neurons tend to spatially coexist, and their interactions are likely competitive. The interaction between pairs of neurons was no t simply a function of the similarity between their receptive field properties but was also a fu nction of the input stimuli (or stimulus dis-parity in our case). The effective connectiv ity was significantly modulated (1-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.05) by the stimulus disparity for 25 out of the 27 pairs. We are not suggesting synaptic connections physically change, but rather that the effectiveness of those connections can change depending on the spiking activity and th erefore the stimulus input. For neuron pairs with similar disparity tuning, the strongest corre lation was observed at their shared preferred disparity, i.e. the peak of the disparity tuning curves based on firing rate (as shown in Figure 6). This suggests facilitation is strongest when a frontal parallel plane activated these neu-rons simultaneously at their preferred depth. As the stimulus plane moved away from this depth, the effective connectivity between the neurons became w eaker. This was observed in 10 pairs (e.g., Figure 6c). For the other 17 pairs (e.g., Figure 6d), the correlation or effective connectivity was again strongest at the neuron pa ir's shared preferred disparity. However, these pairs in addition exhibited secondary correlation peaks for disparity stimuli that pro-duced the lowest firing rates (eve n below the baseline for DRDSs). Figure 6: Top row are disparity tuning curves based on firing rates (mean  X  s.e.m.). Bottom row are disparity tuning curves based on correlation for the corresponding pairs of neurons in the top row. Error bars are 95% confiden ce intervals and dashed lines represent 95% con-fidence of the mean correlation. Cross-correlation peaks ar e interpreted as a result of effectiv e circuits that may represent any combination of a variety of synaptic connections that may have a bias in direction (one neu-ron drives the other) or may not have a bias in direction (zero lag ti me; both neurons receive a common drive) [10]. As correlation peaks beco me broader, as in our case (mean = 42 ms), this interpretation becomes more ambiguous (mor e possible circuits). The broader positive correlation peaks can even be caused by common inhibitory circuitry. One way to poten-tially disambiguate our interpretations is to consider firing rate behavior. The positive corre-lation measured at the preferred disparity suggests that the interaction was likely facilitatory in nature based on the increased firing of the neurons. The positive correlation measured at the disparity where both neurons' firing rates were depressed, i.e. at the valley of the firing-rate based disparity tuning curves, suggests that the correlation likely arose from common inhibition (presumably from neurons that preferred that disparity). We can compare the temporal dynamics of the correlation with the temporal dynamics of the firing rate of the neurons to gain more insight into the possible underlying circuitry. We computed the correlation every 1 msec over a 100 ms running window, and found that the (250-350 ms post-stimulus onset) than the correlation peaks at the non-preferred disparity (100-200 ms). Figure 7 illustrates the temporal dynamics of correlation for the example neu-the preferred and the non-preferred disparities was consistently observed for all 27 pairs of neurons. Even for the example shown in Figure 6c, there were peaks in correlation in the phases of correlation was also rather consistent over the population of pairs.

Contour map of correlation versus time and disparity. Disparity tuning based on correlation for the early (blue) and late (red) portion of the response (95% confidence inter-vals). Correlation was calculated every 1 ms over 100 ms windows. By examining the interplay between firing rate and correlation, we were able to gain even greater insight about the interactions among neuron pairs. To summarize this interplay across our population, we compared the temporal evolution of the correlation at three distinct dis-parities with the temporal evolution of the firing rates at the same disparities (also smoothed with 100 ms time windows). The first disparity, the preferred disparity A , is where we measured the strongest correlation and was at or near the highest firing rate measured in in-dividual neurons (see Figure 8, left). The second important disparity, the most non-preferred disparity C , was where we measured secondary correlation peaks and coincided with the was in between disparities A and C . Figure 8 shows that neurons responded better to their preferred disparity over other dispari-ties very early, resulting in immediate moderate firing rate-based disparity tuning. Then However, the suppression in firing rate is much stronger for C where the firing rate diverges strong common inhibition. Figure 8: Population average of norm alized correlation versus time ( top ) for three disparities shown on the left . Population average of normalized PSTHs for same three disparities ( bot-tom ). Both correlation and firing rates were calculated every 1 ms over 100 ms windows. Once the correlation peak at C subsided (200 ms), the correlation increased for A ( red dashed line ). When the correlation for A peaked, the correlation decreased for B and C , lead-ing to very sharp correlation-based disparity tuning (see also Figure 7). This correlation-based tuning can facilitate depth estimates by changing how effectively these signals are integrated downstream as a function of disparity [12]. Our interpretation is that the initial firing rate bias leads to antagonistic disparity-tuned neu-rons generating common inhibiti on that suppresses firing at non-preferred disparities, re-moving potential mismatches. The immediacy s uggests that mutual inhibition was local, which is consistent with our observation that many opposing disparity-tuned neurons spa-tially coexisted. The slower correlati on peak at the preferred disparity A is indicative of mu-tual facilitation that occurred when the depth estimates of spatially distinct neurons matched. This facilitation leads to a more precise estimate of depth. The findings from this study provide support to Julesz X  X  proposal that cooperative and com-petitive mechanisms in primary visual cortex are utilized for estimating global depth in ran-dom dot stereograms [1], which was later described formally by Marr and Poggio [2]. More recent cooperative stereo computation models allow excita tory interaction between neurons of different disparities separate d by long distance. This is used to accommodate the compu-tation of slanted surfaces [13,14]. In this e xperiment, we only tested frontal parallel planes, thus, we cannot answer whether or not effectiv e connections and facilitation exist between neurons with larger disparity differences over long distances. This will require further ex-periments using planes with disparity gradients. The observation that initial correlation peaks occurred at disparities that evoked the lowest firing rates in neurons, suggests that correlation peaks emerged from common inhibition for non-preferred disparities. The observation that later correlation occurred at disparities that evoked the highest firing rates suggests that ne urons were mutually exciting each other at their preferred disparity. Our neurophysiological data reveal interesting dynamics between network-based (effective connectivity) and firi ng rate-based encoding of depth estimates. The observation that inhibition precedes facilitation suggests th at competition is local (re-calling neurons at the same electrode tend to have opposite disparity tuning) and cooperation is more global (mediated through long-range connectivity). Local competition between neu-rons encoding different depths is consistent with the uniqueness principle of Marr and Pog-gio's algorithm [2]. In addition, cooperation among neurons encoding the same depth across space was predicted by the second rule of thei r algorithm: matter is cohesive. These two interactions are robust at removing potential ambiguity during stereo matching and depth inference. Previous neurophysiological data had suggested that intracortical connectivity in primary visual cortex underlies compet itive [15] and cooperative [16] mechanisms for improving estimates of orientation. Our data suggests similar circuitry might play a role also in stereo matching [17]. However, this study is distinct in that it provides detailed empirical support for computational algorithms for solving stereo matching. It thus highlights the importance of computational algorithms in generating hypo theses to guide future neurophysiological studies.
