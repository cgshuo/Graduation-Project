 Tandem mass spectrometry -based protein identific ation and quantification is the foundation for shotgun proteomics. Most of the labelled experiments (eg: iTRAQ and TMT) were d esigned for the ultimate purpose of identifying protein biomarkers. For the purpose of biomarker identification two or more groups including a healthy group have to be used. The term 'biomarker' can be seen in different contexts in bioinformatics such as p roteomics, medicine, cell biology, microbiology, etc. [1]. Measurable characteristics or indicators that reflect a particular disease/ bio -logical condition are defined as biomarkers [2] [3]. In this paper we propose a fast, accurate and open -source R -base d pipeline for biomarker discovery in shotgun proteomics for lebelled iTRAQ and TMT high resolution experiments.

A typical pipeline of protein identification starts with a set of digested peptides by some protease (eg: trypsin, pepsin, etc.) and ends with thousands of identified proteins. In quantitative proteomics approach, the common next step after the digestion is labelling of peptides for the identification of different samples although there have been some quantitative techniques reported in label -fre e experiments [4] [5]. The labelled peptides are then subjected to mass spectrometry where they are ionized (pre -cursor ions/parent ions) and fragmented (fragmented ions/daughter ions). Peptide identification is then performed with several available free a nd commercial tools and software (eg: Mascot, SEQUEST and Proteome Discoverer commercial tools).The corresponding proteins have to be identified through a mapping process or an assembling process. Downstream analysis of protein identification has to be uti lized in order to extract significant proteins as biomarkers where the levels of expression of proteins over different fractions of the protein mixture have to be considered [6] [7] [8].

Biomarkers are commonly used in designing new drugs, management, iden tification and classification of disease conditions. With the development of new disease conditions as well as for the clarification and management of existing biomarkers, new discovery of biomarkers (eg proteins, genes or metabolites) is required. In addi tion, identified biomarkers could be integrated into the pre -processing stage of the general shotgun proteomics pipeline to reduce the time complexity of the disease specific protein identification process significantly. iTRAQ and TMT are recognized as two types of labelling techniques that often utilize in mass spectrometry based protein quantification and identification in biomarker discovery. This involves several steps that have to be integrated together and therefore it requires a proper pipeline. In t his paper we present an open -source pipeline that provides down -stream analysis of protein identification to identify biomarkers from the combination of MS1 and MS2 spectra information.

Section II discusses the problem that we address in this paper. Metho dology is discussed in section III. Results and the conclusion are discussed in section IV and V respectively. 1 . 1 Problem Formulation There are few pipelines available for biomarker discovery purpose and most of them ignore the information of MS1 spectra in the identification process of peptides. Combination of quantification of reporter ions via MS2 spectra and considering MS1 spectra in identifying a peptide can definitely speed up the common process of biomarker discovery as the process eliminates extensiv e search of huge database of peptide spectra. Further, current proteomics tools do not provide proper down -stream analysis. Several commercial and non -commercial protein identification software and pipelines can be found in the literature [9] [10] [11]. As commercial tools are very expensive (eg: Mascot, SEQUEST, ProteinPilot, Proteome -Discoverer and Peaks), non -commercial tools have high demand among general users (eg: MaxQuant, ProteinProphet). Some non -commercial to ols also require additional con figurati ons and parameter settings and cannot be used by a general user (eg: TPP). In addition, there is no way to formally ascertain the efficiency claims of commercial tool chains other than through empirical evidence after using them. However, it still consumes days/hours to carry out the processes of protein biomarker discovery using these tools. Further, accuracy of the tools have to be considered as it affects in drug discovery applications. We have developed an open -source pipeline to overcome all of the abo ve issues. We have developed a novel, open source biomarker identification pipeline by integrating MS1 based peptide identifications considering net charge state on a peptide for a particular pH value of the solution with quantification of reporter ions for biomarker identification. Our biomarker identification pipeline considers real intensities of peptides in calculating fold -change ratios of proteins and extract significant proteins based on Wilcoxon based p -value. This pipeline is completely an open source tool which can be integrated with MSnbase package in R.

Most of the existing software and tools are based on MS/MS fragment ions and consider at least one unique peptide from the identified peptide list per protein in the protein identification process. Since high -resolution mass spectrometry produces accurate m/z of peptides, MS1 information could be utilized for identifying proteins with unique m/z peptides. Therefore, the pipeline reduces the time of MS/MS spectral matching using high resolut ion mass spectrometry data by utilizing a method of m/z matching of theoretical spectra, which is more similar to peptide mass fingerprinting, which we also utilized in protein mixture identification as current high -resolution mass spectra output the masse s more accurately in three to four decimal places [12].

Different protein fold -change ratios have been used in different tools without considering the effect on the accuracy of finding the biomarkers for a particular disease condition. It has been reported that the mostly used average or median of peptide ratios propagate errors more than the sum of actual intensities of peptides in calculating protein fold change ratios [13]. Hence, utilizing sum of the peptide intensities method can be expected to provide users with a more accurate set of biomarkers.

Further, an R -based open -source pipeline will allow users to access, use and modify the code according to their preference. 2 . 1 Data In developing the biomarker discovery pipeline, Ref -Seq database was used. As of 31st March 2015, this database was composed of 72,349 human proteins and 3838132 peptides with redundant entries. One can reduce the entries of protein database by applying CD -HIT clustering algorithm considering non -redundancy of proteins.
 2 . 2 Biomarker Discovery Pipeline There are limitations that arise due to biological, proteomics or mass spectrometric factors in the process of biomarker discovery. Biological factors are inter a nd intra -individual protein concentration and protein stability. Proteomics and mass spectrometric limitations include a) lacking of quantitative relationships between ion intensity and amount of analyte, b) deviation from a linear correlation between amou nt of protein and spectral intensity, and c) some processes in shotgun proteomics such as fractionation, derivatization, and trypsin digestion causing high variability and low reproducibility [17]. A pipeline of biomarker discovery has to concern these fac tors too (See Fig. 1 for stages of the pipeline) .

Most of the existing software and tools are based on MS/MS fragment ions and consider at least one unique peptide from the identified peptide list per protein in the protein identification process. Since hi gh -resolution mass spectrometry produces accurate m/z of peptides, MS1 information could be utilized for identifying proteins with unique m/z peptides. Therefore, the pipeline reduces the time of MS/MS spectral matching using high resolution mass spectrome try data by utilizing a method of m/z matching of theoretical spectra, which is more similar to peptide mass fingerprinting, which we also utilized in protein mixture identification as current high -resolution mass spectra output the masses more accurately in three to four decimal places [12].
 Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ) and Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) based quantification allow to simultaneous comparison of multiple samples. For that reason, iTRAQ and TMT are widely used in bio marker discovery projects. From next paragraph on -wards this paper describes the steps of our entire R -based open source biomarker discovery process in iTRAQ and TMT labelled experiments, which overcomes limitations described in previous section.

Various t ypes of raw data is generated in mass spectrometric experiments (eg: .wiff, .raw, .dat, etc.). In isobaric tagged experiments, the raw input could be of two types; .raw files (from Thermo mass spectrometer) or .wiff files (from AB SCIEX mass spectrometer). These types of raw files cannot be directly read by most of the tools/software in proteomics as their difficulty in reading and parsing binary format. For that reason, in most of the proteomics processing pipelines, the raw file types are converted into s ome computer readable file types such as .mzXML, .mzML and .mgf. As the first step in our pipeline, the conversion of the raw dataset into the .mzXML format is conducted by MSConvert tool of Proteowizard [14] [15].
 The converted files are then subjected to quantification, which is facilitated in the MSnbase package in R platform (version 3.1 or later). Here the major task is to process MS level2 scans (fragmented daughter ions of peptides) to extract reporter ion abundances for protein quantification. Some o ther information of precursor ions (peptide ions) and reporter ions are also kept with the output object used in quantification output. These information can be utilized in the downstream process of protein identification and biomarker discovery. The impur ity matrix provided by the manufacturer is utilized here for the correction of quantified reporter ion intensities. In this process application of corrections for the impurities of reporter ions is utilized. Different impurity matrices could be used for iT RAQ 4 -plex, 8 -plex and for TMT 6 -plex and 10 -plex while having different number of samples. In the quantification process, imputation of missing intensity values of reporter ions can be performed with Bayesian miss ing value imputation method or k -nearest neighbour method available in MSnbase package in R. In the quantification process of iTRAQ/TMT, the functions facilitated by R (eg: purity correction and missing value imputations) have already been proved as having consistent management and reproducible w ith iTRAQ and TMT labelled experiment data [16] [17].
Our pipeline was developed to perform the digestion on any FASTA formatted database based on their format. It was already validated with three databases, Uniprot -SwissProt, RefSeq, and TAIR data -base (r elease 10).

In the next step of our pipeline, the observed mass to charge ratios of charged peptide ions (precursor ions) can be used to identify peptides based on theoretically calculated mass to charge ratios of precursor ions. This approach is known as peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) in single protein identification pipelines (eg: Mascot PMF, Profound, MS -FIT). It can also be utilized in mixtures up to few samples/multiple proteins [18] [19]. Mascot peptide mass fingerprinting is developed for protein mixture identification with up to 6 components [20]. Our pipeline has combined several features that contributed to accuracy such as mass value (m/z) generated by HRMS, application of post -translational modifications, calculation of charge state based on post -translational modifications and the pH value of the solution (should provide by the laboratory biologists), removal of repeating m/z in database search, reporter ion ratios (quantification) which were calculated from the already validated MSnbase pack age, use the most accurate protein fold change ratio and correct mass tolerance in peptide identifications. Further, it has combined several features that contributed to speed such as utilizing a methodology similar to Peptide Mass Fingerprinting rather th an Peptide Fragmentation Fingerprinting, extraction of unique peptides in the search and mapping of proteins to peptides while digestion is performed. An optimization strategy for the results of peptide mass fingerprinting in mixture identification was int roduced by Zengyon et al. [21]. There are limitations and advantages in this method and was not introduced to specifically for identifying labelled mixtures. The advantage of current pipeline is that the molecular weight and pI/pH values can be incorporate d into the peptide matching process [22] and peptides that seem to be weak and neglected to perform MS2 fragmentation can further be identified [21]. The limitation in MS1 based search is the identification of peptides that have identical mass to charge, b ut with high resolution input spectra the pipeline can perform better as it provides mass value for several decimal places. Therefore, in analysing low abundance proteins, our methodology could support the identification process if the samples are pure wit h more accurate m/z values and more optimization to this method is done [21]. Here we allow a mass tolerance in the identification of peptides from m/z ratios, which defines the maximum mass difference between the theoretical m/z and the experimental m/z o f the peptide.

In order to measure the abundance levels of proteins, peptide fold -change ratios (the ratio of protein expression in disease samples with respect to healthy controls) were calculated first. The protein fold -change ratios are generally calcul ated based on these peptide fold -change ratios. Labelled experiments can utilize several existing methods of protein fold -change ratio calculations such as average of peptide ratios, libra ratio, linear regression, principal component analysis, the sum of the peptide intensities [23] and median of the peptide ratios [24] [25].Furthermore, most of the current tools use average of the peptide ratios (eg: Mascot, ProteinProphet etc.) or median of the peptide ratios (eg: Proteome Discoverer [24] and MaxQuant [2 5]) in calculating protein fold -change ratios without considering the propagation error of calculating protein fold -change ratios. Therefore, in our pipeline the sum of peptide intensities method was utilized as it has already been mathematically and exper imentally proven as having the best performance and better than mostly used averages of the ratios method [22][16]. The propagation of errors in calculating protein ratios from sum of the peptide intensities method (in iTRAQ/ TMT labeled experiments) was p roved to be less than in other methods [22].

Biological and technical replicates are the two major types of replicates present in mass spectrometry experiments. These biological replicates can be from various patients and healthy groups. Technical replicat es use the result from separate fractions of the same sample or exactly the same sample is tested at multiple times. In shotgun proteomic methods, which involve isobaric tagging, technical replicates are often used by selecting fractions of the same sample . The resulting different sets of proteins identified from separate fractions are then considered as the total amount of protein identifications from these fractions. Wilcoxon test based probability (p -value) is calculated to extract potential significant biomarkers from the set of identified proteins. As the distribution of protein intensities were not normally distributed Wilcoxon test was used. For the validation of our pipeline a significant level of 0.05 was considered. Here, the null hypothesis was re jected when p value &lt; 0.05 (this is corresponding to 95% significance level). A small p -value can be observed in a properly designed experiment for a false of null hypothesis and not as a result of random sampling [26].

The term up -regulation is used for h igher expression of the proteins of patient in the cell and it is down -regulated if the expression gets reduced. The up -regulated and down -regulated proteins, which are over -expressed or under -expressed in patient samples with respect to control -healthy sa mples could be identified by observing the protein fold change ratios. These proteins can be taken as the biomarkers, if the significance of these proteins is high as mentioned in the earlier paragraph (based on the calculated p -value). Pipeline w as validated using several datasets from the PRIDE proteomics database; breast cancer dataset [27], chikungunya dataset [28] and pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma dataset [29]. The parameters were set as in [27], [28] and [29].
Time consumption of R pipeline and MaxQuant was compared. This process performs protein identification and quantification in a personal computer and was measured for the Chikungunya dataset available in PRIDE, which was also used by [28]. This dataset consists of 22 fraction f iles from an iTRAQ experiment. The personal computer we used was an Intel Core i7 3.4GHz machine with 12 GB memory. On the PC around 40 min, 160 min, 160 min, 30 min, 20 min, 50 min were spent for quantification, trypsin digestion, m/z database generation, peptide identification, protein identification and biomarker identification, respectively. Biomarker discovery is a process in down -stream analysis of protein identification and is not included in MaxQuant tool. From these, trypsin digestion and m/z datab ase generation functions can be utilized once for a particular organism in the pre -processing stage. Therefore, total time spent on a PC could be considered as 140 min (2 hours and 20 min) and it is 90 min after excluding biomarker identification task. Thi s time is less than the time taken from MaxQuant tool that takes more than 3 hours, only for protein identification and quantification processes (without biomarker discovery). When the number of allowed missed cleavages gets increased, the time consumed fo r each peptide and protein search also gets increased gradually. For example, the time gets doubled approximately (eg: Chikungunya dataset) for the peptide and protein search if the allowed cleavages are increased from 0 to 1.
In our pipeline False Discove ry Rate (FDR) of peptide identifications were performed by a reverse database search, which allows estimating the FDR by a target -decoy search [30]. This is automatically performed by reversing a given FASTA formatted database. FDR can be calculated by dou bling the number of decoy matches (False Positives) and dividing this by the total number of matches (False Positives + True Positives). According to the experiments, FDR ranges from 0.0003 to 0.0009 in our pipeline. By combining different para meters that are not considered in common pipelines, our proposed pipeline facilitates fast and accurate identification of biomarkers.
 As mentioned above, this high -throughput data could be identified and quantified on a PC within 90 min. The FDR of protein identifications ranges between 0.0003 and 0.0009. Therefore, the biomarker identification system is accurate and operates in a considerable speed (2 -4 magnitude) than open -source and commonly used MaxQuant tool.
