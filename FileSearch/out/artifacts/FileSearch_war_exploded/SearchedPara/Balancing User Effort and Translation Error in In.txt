 In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the translation is modelled as a decission process. For a given source string f J seek for the target string e I which maximises posterior probability: Within the Interactive-predictive Machine Translation (IMT) framework, a state-of-the-art SMT system is employed in the following way: For a given source sentence, the SMT system fully automatically generates an initial translation. A human translator checks this translation from left to right, correcting the first error. The SMT system then proposes a new extension, taking the correct prefix e i steps are repeated until the whole input sentence has been correctly translated. In the resulting decision rule, we maximise over all possible extensions e I
An implementation of the IMT famework was performed in the TransType project (Foster et al., 1997; Langlais et al., 2002) and further improved within the TransType2 project (Esteban et al., 2004; Barrachina et al., 2009).

IMT aims at reducing the effort and increas-ing the productivity of translators, while preserv-ing high-quality translation. In this work, we inte-grate Confidence Measures (CMs) within the IMT framework to further reduce the user effort. As will be shown, our proposal allows to balance the ratio between user effort and final translation error. 1.1 Confidence Measures Confidence estimation have been extensively stud-ied for speech recognition. Only recently have re-searchers started to investigate CMs for MT (Gan-drabur and Foster, 2003; Blatz et al., 2004; Ueffing and Ney, 2007).

Different TransType-style MT systems use con-fidence information to improve translation predic-tion accuracy (Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Ueff-ing and Ney, 2005). In this work, we propose a fo-cus shift in which CMs are used to modify the in-teraction between the user and the system instead of modify the IMT translation predictions.

To compute CMs we have to select suitable con-fidence features and define a binary classifier. Typ-ically, the classification is carried out depending on whether the confidence value exceeds a given threshold or not. In the conventional IMT scenario a human trans-lator and a SMT system collaborate in order to obtain the translation the user has in mind. Once the user has interactively translated the source sen-tences, the output translations are error-free. We propose an alternative scenario where not all the source sentences are interactively translated by the user. Specifically, only those source sentences whose initial fully automatic translation are incor-rect, according to some quality criterion, are in-teractively translated. We propose to use CMs as the quality criterion to classify those initial trans-lations.

Our approach implies a modification of the user-machine interaction protocol. For a given source sentence, the SMT system generates an ini-tial translation. Then, if the CM classifies this translation as correct, we output it as our final translation. On the contrary, if the initial trans-lation is classified as incorrect, we perform a con-ventional IMT procedure, validating correct pre-fixes and generating new suffixes, until the sen-tence that the user has in mind is reached.
In our scenario, we allow the final translations to be different from the ones the user has in mind. This implies that the output may contain errors. If a small loss in translation can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those sentences that the CMs classify as incorrect.

It is worth of notice that our proposal can be seen as a generalisation of the conventional IMT approach. Varying the value of the CM classifi-cation threshold, we can range from a fully auto-matic SMT system where all sentences are clas-sified as correct to a conventional IMT system where all sentences are classified as incorrect. 2.1 Selecting a CM for IMT We compute sentence CMs by combining the scores given by a word CM based on the IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993), similar to the one described in (Blatz et al., 2004). We modified this word CM by replacing the average by the max-imal lexicon probability, because the average is dominated by this maximum (Ueffing and Ney, 2005). We choose this word CM because it can be calculated very fast during search, which is cru-cial given the time constraints of the IMT sys-tems. Moreover, its performance is similar to that of other word CMs as results presented in (Blatz et al., 2003; Blatz et al., 2004) show. The word confidence value of word e where p ( e bility, and f From this word CM, we compute two sentence CMs which differ in the way the word confidence Train Dev.

After computing the confidence value, each sen-tence is classified as either correct or incorrect, de-pending on whether its confidence value exceeds or not a sentence clasiffication threshold  X   X  s = 0 . 0 as correct whereas if  X  will be classified as incorrect. The aim of the experimentation was to study the possibly trade-off between saved user effort and translation error obtained when using sentence CMs within the IMT framework. 3.1 System evaluation In this paper, we report our results as measured by Word Stroke Ratio (WSR) (Barrachina et al., 2009). WSR is used in the context of IMT to mea-sure the effort required by the user to generate her Figure 1: BLEU translation scores versus WSR for different values of the sentence classification threshold using the MEAN CM. translations. WSR is computed as the ratio be-tween the number of word-strokes a user would need to achieve the translation she has in mind and the total number of words in the sentence. In this context, a word-stroke is interpreted as a single ac-tion, in which the user types a complete word, and is assumed to have constant cost.

Additionally, and because our proposal allows differences between its output and the reference translation, we will also present translation qual-ity results in terms of BiLingual Evaluation Un-derstudy (BLEU) (Papineni et al., 2002). BLEU computes a geometric mean of the precision of n -grams multiplied by a factor to penalise short sen-tences. 3.2 Experimental Setup Our experiments were carried out on the EU cor-pora (Barrachina et al., 2009). The EU corpora were extracted from the Bulletin of the European Union. The EU corpora is composed of sentences given in three different language pairs. Here, we will focus on the Spanish X  X nglish part of the EU corpora. The corpus is divided into training, de-velopment and test sets. The main figures of the corpus can be seen in Table 1.

As a first step, be built a SMT system to trans-late from Spanish into English. This was done by means of the Thot toolkit (Ortiz et al., 2005), which is a complete system for building phrase-based SMT models. This toolkit involves the esti-mation, from the training set, of different statisti-cal models, which are in turn combined in a log-linear fashion by adjusting a weight for each of them by means of the MERT (Och, 2003) proce-Figure 2: BLEU translation scores versus WSR for different values of the sentence classification threshold using the RATIO CM with  X  dure, optimising the BLEU score on the develop-ment set.

The IMT system which we have implemented relies on the use of word graphs (Ueffing et al., 2002) to efficiently compute the suffix for a given prefix. A word graph has to be generated for each sentence to be interactively translated. For this purpose, we used a multi-stack phrase-based de-coder which will be distributed in the near future together with the Thot toolkit. We discarded to use the state-of-the-art Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) because preliminary experiments per-formed with it revealed that the decoder by Ortiz-Mart  X   X nez et al. (2005) performs better in terms of WSR when used to generate word graphs for their use in IMT (Sanchis-Trilles et al., 2008). More-over, the performance difference in regular SMT is negligible. The decoder was set to only consider monotonic translation, since in real IMT scenar-ios considering non-monotonic translation leads to excessive response time for the user.

Finally, the obtained word graphs were used within the IMT procedure to produce the refer-ence translations in the test set, measuring WSR and BLEU. 3.3 Results We carried out a series of experiments ranging the value of the sentence classification threshold  X  between 0 . 0 (equivalent to a fully automatic SMT system) and 1 . 0 (equivalent to a conventional IMT system), for both the MEAN and RATIO CMs. For each threshold value, we calculated the effort of the user in terms of WSR, and the translation quality of the final output as measured by BLEU. Figure 1 shows WSR (WSR IMT-CM) and BLEU (BLEU IMT-CM) scores obtained varying  X  for the MEAN CM. Additionally, we also show the BLEU score (BLEU SMT) obtained by a fully automatic SMT system as translation quality base-line, and the WSR score (WSR IMT) obtained by a conventional IMT system as user effort baseline. This figure shows a continuous transition between the fully automatic SMT system and the conven-tional IMT system. This transition occurs when ranging  X  sired effect, since for almost a half of the possible values for  X  of our proposed IMT system.

The RATIO CM confidence values depend on a word classification threshold  X  ried out experimentation ranging  X  and 1 . 0 and found that this value can be used to solve the above mentioned undesired effect for the MEAN CM. Specifically, varying the value of  X  sition between the fully automatic SMT system and the conventional IMT system is produced, al-lowing us to obtain smother transitions. Figure 2 shows WSR and BLEU scores for different val-ues of the sentence classification threshold  X  ing  X  of  X   X  w = 0 . 4 cording to Figure 2, using a sentence classification threshold value of 0 . 6 we obtain a WSR reduction of 20% relative and an almost perfect translation quality of 87 BLEU points.

It is worth of notice that the final translations are compared with only one reference, therefore, the reported translation quality scores are clearly pessimistic. Better results are expected using a multi-reference corpus. Example 1 shows the source sentence (src), the reference translation (ref) and the final translation (tra) for three of the initial fully automatically generated translations that were classified as correct by our CMs, and thus, were not interactively translated by the user. The first translation (tra-1) is identical to the corre-sponding reference translation (ref-1). The second translation (tra-2) corresponds to a correct trans-lation of the source sentence (src-2) that is differ-ent from the corresponding reference (ref-2). Fi-nally, the third translation (tra-3) is an example of a slightly incorrect translation. In this paper, we have presented a novel proposal that introduces sentence CMs into an IMT system to reduce user effort. Our proposal entails a mod-ification of the user-machine interaction protocol that allows to achieve a balance between the user effort and the final translation error.

We have carried out experimentation using two different sentence CMs. Varying the value of the sentence classification threshold, we can range from a fully automatic SMT system to a conven-tional IMT system. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect trans-lations while significantly reducing user effort.
Future research aims at the investigation of im-proved CMs to be integrated in our IMT system.
