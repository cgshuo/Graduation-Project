 In this paper, we report findings on how user behaviors vary in tasks with different difficulty levels as well as of different types. Two behavioral signals: document dwell time and number of content pages viewed per query, were found to be able to help the system detect when users are working with difficult tasks.

Despite the fact that search engines have done a good job with some easy tasks, for e xample,  X  X hen and where will SIGIR 2010 be held? X , people still have difficulties in finding information for difficult tasks, for example,  X  X hich food additives pose a risk to your physical health ? X  [2] . Better search syste ms are needed that can help people more easily locate desired information in difficult tasks, meanwhile, it is also important for the system to be able to detect when the users are working with difficult tasks. Task difficulty has been attracting much res earch attention and has been found to be a significant factor influencing users X  search behaviors and search performance. In difficult tasks, users are more likely to visit more web pages ( [2] , [3] ), issue more queries ( [1] , [3] ), and spend longer time on search result pages ( [1] ), and so on. However, the behavioral and pe rformance aspects addressed in most previous work have focused mainly on the overall task level, so that the variable parameters cannot be obtained until the end of the whole task. Therefore, it is not easy or practical for systems to detect task difficulty in real time based on the previously examined behavioral aspects. More work is needed to explore behavioral signals for systems to learn dynamically if users are dealing with a difficult task so that they can adapt search towa rds the user X  X  specific situation. Task type is another factor that has attracted much attention in studying searchers  X  beh avioral differences. Among the many existing classification method s, one classifies tasks as closed (specified factual answer(s)) or open -ended (unspecified answer (s)), and with single or multiple answer (s). It was found that for ope n-ended task s, users spent more overall time and performed more moves than for closed tasks [4] . Like task difficulty, there is also a need to look at the behavioral factors which are real -time det ectable to differentiate task types. One such behavioral signal that is good for real -time detection is document dwell time, which measures how long a user reads the retrieved document. Dwell time has been studied as a potential factor for predicting docum ent usefulness [6] but not in conjunction with task difficulty yet. In addition, previous studies tended to look at mean dwell time on all behaviors including time reading both search result list pages and content pages, as well as time (re)formulating queries. We think that mean dwell time on the content pages only would be more informative since the content pages are what users really focus on in finding documents. In addition, the first dwell time of a content page, i.e., the dwell time each page was first shown to users , could be easily tracked by the system in earlier phase s of an information -seeking session ; thus it would be helpful to see if it can help predict task difficult y. Another behavioral signal which could be good for real time tracking is the number of viewed documents per query. These signals are named  X  section -level  X  factors in this study , different from task -level ones that cannot be captured until the e nd of a task . We wanted to see if section -level behaviors can suggest task difficulty levels and task types, and if so, how. Data came from a lab experiment that was designed to explore users X  behavioral differences in different types of task s. The stud y had 12 search tasks: 8 of them were created by Toms et al. [5] , 4 of which were open -ended tasks and the other 4 were multiple -item closed tasks; the remaining 4 were created by us, and were single -item closed tasks. Participants were asked to conduct 6 tasks of different types on the English Wikipedia. For each task, each participant was allowed to choose between two tasks of the same type but on different topics. Each experiment s ession was 1.5 to 2 hours long, and user interaction with the computer was logged. Participants were 48 students (17 females and 31 males), with an average age of 27 years. After completing each task, users were asked to rate the difficulty level of the ta sk based on a 5 -point scale. For the purpose of the current analysis, we chose 8 tasks out of 12: 4 were open -ended tasks and the other 4 were single -item closed tasks.
 We first looked at users X  behavioral differences in tasks of different difficulty le vels (Table 1). The original rating scale was 5-point, which was appropriate for users to evaluate. In our analysis, the difficulty scores were collapsed into 2 groups based on the distribution (scores 1 -3 into a  X  X ifficult X  group, and scores 4-5 into an  X  easy X  group), which was more appropriate for the system to differentiate difficulty levels.
 Examining the task -level factors, i.e., task completion time, number of queries, and number of content pages viewed, we found that more difficult ta sks were associated with longer task completion time, more queries , and more content pages. These patterns are consistent with findings of previous studies. Considering the three section -level factors, i.e., first dwell time, average dwell time, and number of content pages viewed per query, our results show that more difficult tasks were associated with longer first dwell time and longer average dwell time than easier tasks. Dwell time s thus seem to be indicators of difficulty levels of th e tasks. However, the numbers of content pages viewed by users per query did not differ between easy and difficult tasks. This suggests that although users issued more queries in difficult tasks, they did not necessarily view more content pag es per query. Users viewed roughly the same numbers of documents per query in tasks of different difficulty levels . In difficult tasks, they just reformulated queries more often . We also looked at users X  behavioral difference s between two types of tasks (Table 1) . With respect to the task -level factors, open -ended tasks were associated with longer completion time, more queries, and more content page s viewed. These patterns are consistent with findings in previous studies. For the section -level factors, it was found that closed tasks were associated with fewer content pages viewed per query, longer first dwell time, and longer average d well time. It was reasonable to see that users spent longer dwell time on documents in the closed tasks because these tasks required users to look for a specific piece of information in a document and to judge its relevance according to its correctness with respect to the task question . By contrast, in the open -ended tasks, user s could make a judgment o f the overall relevance of the document based on any piece of information on the page. That closed tasks elicited fewer content pages per query was also reasonable considering that the users only needed to look for one fact or piece of information , unlike in the open -ended tasks, wh ere users had to collect as much information as possible . Results show that longer first dwell time (about 29 seconds) or longer average dwell time (about 24 -25 seconds) was associated with both difficult tasks and closed tasks. It is hard to say if the longer first dwell time o n a document and the longer average dwell time were due to user s dealing with a difficult task or a closed task. Hence, it would be difficult to make a prediction that users are having difficulty based solely on dwell time. However, the number of content pages viewed per query can help differentiate task type, and can be used to help determine if the longer dwell time suggests that users are facing more difficult tasks. Firs t dwell time and average dwell time can be useful for system s to instantly assess user behaviors. We found that dwell time measure s alone cannot reliably predict if users are facing difficul t task s. However, t aking into accou nt the number of content pages per query can help make a more correct prediction of task difficulty. Future studies will make use of these findings in system design.
