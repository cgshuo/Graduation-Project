 This poster investigates the use of theoretical benchmarks to describe the matching functions of XML retrieval systems and the properties of specificity and exhaustivity in XML retrieval. Theoretical benchmarks concern the formal rep-resentation of qualitative properties of I Rmodels. To this end, a Situation Theory framework for the meta-evaluation of XML retrieval is presented.

The aim of XML retrieval is to retrieve not only relevant document components, but those at the right level of granu-larity, i.e. document components that specifically answer a query. To evaluate how effective XML retrieval approaches are, it is therefore necessary to consider whether the  X  X ight X  level is correctly identified. In 2004, INEX, the evaluation initiative for XML retrieval, used two four-graded dimen-sions of relevance: (1) exhaustivity reflects to which extent the document component satisfies the information need, and (2) specificity refers to the extent to which all the informa-tion in the document component is about the information need. A scale from 0 to 3 is used to measure how spe-cific or exhaustive a document component is in relation to an information need, where 0 means that the effect is not measurable and 3 means that the component is highly spe-cific/exhaustive. E.g., a (3,3) result designates a highly ex-haustive and specific answer.

Van Rijsbergen [6] suggested, that given the increasing complexity of the retrieval task due to more complex infor-mation units like XML elements, an experimental approach to information retrieval (IR) should be complemented with a theoretical evaluation technique. Therefore, this poster will investigate the use of theoretical benchmarks to describe the matching functions of XML retrieval systems and the prop-erties of specificity and exhaustivity.
Theoretical evaluation can be complementary to an ex-perimental evaluation if it helps to clarify the assumptions of retrieval models and if it can identify the characteristics leading to a particular experimental behaviour. INEX has used various relevance scales; for demonstration purposes we use the INEX 2004 scale [5].

A theoretical evaluation can be done through the use of a meta-theory, as proposed in previous work based on the logical approach to I R[4]. In 1971, Cooper coined the term  X  X ogical relevance X  for an objective view on relevance [3]. Van Rijsbergen and others have expressed the logical relevance in terms of the implication d  X  q [6]. Following Huibers X  formalism and approach [4], we call such an implication be-tween query and document  X  X boutness X . With aboutness, we aim to theoretically capture the benchmarks of an I Rmodel in general and an XML retrieval model in particular.
Theoretical benchmarks [7] concern the formal represen-tation of qualitative properties of I Rmodels. The proper-ties are described in terms of supported logical axioms and postulates. We use Situation Theory (ST), developed by Barwise and Perry [1], as our logic-based model for XML retrieval. ST offers a logic of information rather than truth assignments and is therefore closer to real-world applica-tions. ST is a mathematical theory of meaning and infor-mation with situations as primitives. Situations are partial descriptions of the world and are composed of information items formalised as infons [4]. For I Rmodelling, queries and documents are modelled as situations, while infons represent a model X  X  information items like keywords or phrases.
Theoretical benchmarksneed formalisms, powerful enough to mark the fundamental properties of retrieval models. In this poster we only present the fundamentals of the formal-ism of a ST-based aboutness language for XML retrieval. If we consider XML elements to be XML situations, then S  X  T means that the XML situation S is about T .Inor-der to describe an XML retrieval model, this could express that document component situation S is about the infor-mation need in query T . Likewise S  X  / T symbolises that S is not about T .With we formalise the composition of situations. Preclusion, symbolised by  X  , expresses that information clashes and leads to anti-aboutness, for which the symbol is used.  X  states that two situations are equivalent, e.g. two document components containing the same information.
This section describes how we can apply a theoretical benchmark, based on ST, to show how XML approaches provide exhaustive or specific answers to queries. Firstly, we look at the properties of XML aboutness systems that result in either higher exhaustivity or specificity. Secondly, we describe with our formalism the two dimensions of the XML retrieval relevance assessment: exhaustivity and speci-ficity.

Some logical properties of an XML retrieval model sup-portexhaustivity, while others supportspecificity. Themono-tonicity postulates are an example of logical properties. They claim that aboutness is preserved under composition. E.g. Left Monotonic Union (LMU) states that if situation S is about T ,then S U is also about T .
 In an aboutness model unconditionally supporting LMU, a query situation containing  X  X ouse X  does not only lead to document component situations having  X  X ouse X , but equally valid answers are components with  X  X ouse X  and  X  X arden X . However, the right level of granularity is missed. A naive vector space model based on simple overlap supports both left and right monotonic union [4] and cannot lead to the re-trieval of highly specific answers. Being able to provide spe-cific answers is only possible from models supporting LMU only conditionally, as for example the vector space mod-els with trained parameters or probabilistic models do [7]. Such models regularly achieve the best results at INEX. Yet, models not supporting LMU at all, neglect exhaustivity.
Using our ST-based framework, we can formally repre-sent the two relevance dimensions used in INEX and their scale. In earlier work, Chiaramella [2] demonstrated that to capture the relevance of structured documents, two implica-tions likethose above from Rijsbergen should beused: d  X  q modelling exhaustivity and q  X  d modelling specificity. Ta-ble 1 shows how we can express these implications with our ST framework. D stands for the document component situ-ation, and Q for the query situation. Then, D  X  Q models exhaustivity and Q  X  D models specificity.

So far, we have discussed how a theoretical evaluation could help to understand experimental results for XML re-trieval. We continue by modelling how a user perceives how exhaustive and specific a component is. We argue that a user will assess the relevance of a component according to the information contained in both Q and D . In Table 1, the document component and query situations are divided into sub-situations, with D  X  D 1 ... D n and Q  X  Q 1 ... Q m . Scale 1 states that only some subsituations are about the query but none involves anti-aboutness. With this, we can e.g. formalise what is meant by a marginally exhaustive doc-ument component (1): the topic is only mentioned in pass-ing, leading to very small indications about the document component X  X  relevance. Table 1 shows for scale 1 multiple conclusions demonstrating undecidedness about the compo-nent X  X  relevance. For scale 2 the overall conclusion can be derived that D  X  Q or Q  X  D . For specificity, the topic is a major theme of the document component and Q  X  D can be concluded. Scale 0 indicates that no D i is about the query making the whole document component not about the query. The highest satisfaction is achieved with scale 3. For exhaustivity, all subsituations of the component are about the query, while for specificity all subsituations of the query are about the document component. Looking at com-bined exhaustivity and specificity assessments in Table 1, users focussed on specificity want results like (1,3), (2,3) or (3,3). They want to be able to conclude Q  X  D , but care less about how many document component subsituations are about the query situation. A (3,3) result is achieved if all subsituations of the query are about the document compo-nent situation and vice versa. Therefore, (3,3) describes a perfect match.
A ST-based meta-evaluation of XML retrieval can firstly demonstrate benchmarksof XMLretrieval models that make them appropriate to particular tasks, and secondly formally represent the exhaustivity and specificity of document com-ponents. In the future, we would like to continue our work by elaborating our benchmarks and going into more detail regarding the different INEX metrics. A theoretical evalua-tion could assist in the difficult INEX discussion about the correct metric [5] and help understand better the implica-tions of the two measures of exhaustivity and specificity.
