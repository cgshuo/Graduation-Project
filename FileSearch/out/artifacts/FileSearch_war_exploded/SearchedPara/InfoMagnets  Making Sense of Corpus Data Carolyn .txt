Explorin g large text corpora can be a daunting prospect. This is especi all y the case for behavioral rese archers who have a vested interest in the latent patterns pres ent in text, but are le ss in terested in computational models of text-represent ation (e.g. the vector-sp ace model ) or unsupervised pattern-learning ( e.g. clustering) . Our goal is to provi de this technolo gy to the bro ader co mmunity of learn-ing scientists and other behavioral rese archers who collect and code corpus da ta as an important part of their research. To date none of t he tools that are comm only used in the behavioral res earch co m-munity , such as HyperResea rch, MacShapa, or Nvivo, which are used to support t heir corpus analy sis effor ts, make use of technolo gy m ore ad-vanced than sim plistic wo rd counti ng a pproaches. With InfoMa gnets, we are working t owards bridg-ing t he gap between the text-m ining comm unity and the corpus-based behavioral resear ch commu-nit y. The pur pose of our dem onstration is to make the language technologies co mm unity m ore aware of opport unit ies for applications of language tech-nologies t o support corpu s oriented be havioral re-sear ch. 
InfoMagnet X  X  novelt y is t wo-fold: Firs t, it pro-vides an int uitive visual metaphor that allows the user to get a sense of their data and organize it for easy retrieval later. This is i mportant during the sense makin g stage of c orpus analy sis work just before form al coding scheme develop ment begins. Secondl y, it allows the user to interact with cluster-ing technolog y, and thus influence its b ehavior, in effect introducing hum an knowledge int o the clus-tering process. Because of this give and take be-tween the clustering technolog y and the hum an influence, the tool is able to achieve an organiza-tion of textual units that is not just optimal from an algorithmic stand-point, but also optimal for the user X  X  unique purpose, which non-interactive clus-tering algorithms are not in general capable of achieving. 
Using visual metaphors to convey to the user proximity and relations between documents and automatically generated clusters is not a new tech-nique (Chalmers and Chitson, 1992; Dubin, 1995; Wise et al., 1995; Leuski and Allan, 2000; Ras-mussen and Karypis, 2004) . InfoMagnet X  X  novelty comes from giving the user more control over the ultimate clustering organization. The user is able to incrementally influence the formation and reor-ganization of cluster centroids and immediately see the effect on the text-to-cluster assignment. Thus, the user can explore the corpus in more effective and meaningful ways. 
In what follows, we more concretely elaborate on InfoMagnet X  X  functionality and technical de-tails. We then motivate its usability and usefulness with a real case study. 
Exploring a textual corpus in search of interest-ing topical patterns that correlate with externally observable variables is a non-trivial task. Take as an example the task of characterizing the process by which students and tutors negotiate with one another over a chat interface as they navigate in-structional materials together in an on-line explora-tory learning environment. A sensible approach is to segment all dialogue transcripts into topic-oriented segments and then group the segments by topic similarity. If done manually, this is a chal-lenging task in two respects. First, to segment each dialogue the analyst must rely on their knowledge of the domain to locate where the focus of the dia-logue shifts from one topic to the next. This, of course, requires the analyst to know what to look for and to remain consistent throughout the whole set of dialogues. More importantly, it introduces into the topic analysis a primacy bias. The analyst may miss important dialogue digressions simply because they are not expected based on observa-tions from the first few dialogues viewed in detail. InfoMagnets addresses these issues by offering users a constant bird X  X  eye view of their data. See Figure 1. 
As input, InfoMagnets accepts a corpus of tex-tual documents. As an option to the user, the docu-ments can be automatically fragmented into topically-coherent segments (referred to also as documents from here on), which then become the atomic textual unit 1 . The documents (or topic seg-ments) are automatically clustered into an initial organization that the user then incrementally ad-justs through the interface. Figure 1 shows the ini-tial document-to-topic assignment that InfoMagnets produces as a starting point for the user. The large circles represent InfoMagnets, or topic oriented cluster cen troids, and the smaller circles represent documents. An InfoMagnet can be thought of as a set of words representative of a topic concept. The similarity between the vector representation of the words in a document and that of the words in an InfoMa gnet translate into attrac-tion in the two-dimensional InfoMagnet space. This semantic similarity is computed using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998). Thus, a document appears closest to the InfoMag-net that best represents its topic. 
A document that appears equidistant to two In-foMagnets shares its content equally between the two represented topics. Topics with lots of docu-ments nearby are popular topics. InfoMagnets with only a few documents nearby represent infrequent topics. Should the user decide to remove an In-foMagnet, any document with some level of attrac-tion to that InfoMagnet will animate and reposition itself based on the topics still represented by the remaining InfoMagnets. At all times, the In-foMagnets interface offers the analyst a bird X  X  eye view of the entire corpus as it is being analyzed and organized. 
Given the automatically-generated initial topic representation, the user typically starts by brows-ing the different InfoMagnets and documents. Us-ing a magnifying cross-hair lens, the user can view the contents of a document on the top pane. As noted above, each InfoMagnet represents a topic concept through a collection of words (from the corpus) that convey that concept. Selecting the In-foMagnet displays this list of words on the left pane. The list is shown in descending order of im-portance with respect to that topic. By browsing each InfoMagnet X  X  list of words and browsing nearby documents, the u ser can start recognizing topics repres ented in the InfoMagnet space and can start labeling those InfoMagnets. 
InfoMagnets with onl y a few neighbori ng docum ents can be rem oved. Likewise, InfoMag-nets attractin g too m any topically -unre lated docu-ments can be split into mu ltiple topics. The user can do this se mi-auto matically (by re questing a split, and allowing t he algorithm to determ ine where the best split is) or by m anually sel ecting a set of terms from the InfoMagnet X  s w ord list and creating a n ew InfoMagnet using those words to represent the new InfoMagnet X  s topic. If the user finds words in an InfoMa gne t X  X  word list that lack topical releva nce, the user can re move the m fro m InfoMagnet X  s word list or fro m all the InfoMag-nets X  word lis ts at once. 
Users may also choose to manually assign a seg-ment to a topic by  X  X nappi ng X  that document to an InfoMagnet.  X  X napping X  i s a way of ov erriding the attraction between the document and other In-foMagnets. By  X  X napping X  a docu ment to an In-foMagnet, th e relationship between the  X  X napped X  docum ent an d the associa ted InfoMagnet re mains constant, regardless of an y changes made to the InfoMagnet space subsequently. 
If a user would like to remove the influence of a subset of the corpus fro m the behavior of the tool, the user may select an InfoMagnet and all the docum ents close to it and place the m in the  X  X uar-antine X  area of the interf ace. When placed in the quarantine, as when  X  X na pped X , a document X  s as-signment re mains unchanged. This feature is used to free scre en space for the user. 
If the user opts for seg menting each i nput dis-course and working wit h topic seg ments rather than whole documents, an alternative interface al-lows the user to quickl y br owse through the corpus sequentially (Figure 2). By switching b etween this view and the bird X  s ey e vie w, the user is able to see where e ach s egment fits se quentiall y int o the larger context of the discourse it was extracted fro m. The user can also use the s equential interfa ce for mak-ing m inor adjustm ents to topic seg ment boun daries and topic ass ignm ents where nec ess ary . Once the user is satisfied with the topic representation in the space and the as signments of all documents to those topics, t he tool can autom atically generate an XML file, where all doc uments ar e t agged with their corresponding topic la bels. 
As mentioned previously , InfoMagnets uses L a-tent Semantic Analy sis (LSA) to rel ate documents to InfoMagnets. LSA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to co mpute the se manti c similarity between text spans of arbitra ry size. For a more techn ical overview of LSA, we direct the reader to (Landauer et al., 1998).

The LSA space is constructed using the corpus that the user desires to organize, possibly aug-mented with so me gen eral purpose text (such as newsgroup d ata) to introdu ce m ore domain-general ter m as sociati ons. The para meter s us ed i n building the space are set by the user during pre-processing, so that the s pace is consistent with the se manti c granularity the user is inter ested in capturing. 
Becaus e doc uments (or to pic-seg ments ) tend to cover m ore than one relev ant topic, our clustering approach is based on what are deter mined heuristi-cally to be the most i mportant terms in the corpus, and not o n whole docum ents. This high er granular-ity allows us to more precisely capture the topics discussed in the corpus by not i mposing the as-sumption that documents are about a single topic. First, all terms that occu r less than n times and in less than m docum ents are rem oved from consid-eration 2 . Then, the remaining term s ar e clustered via average-link clustering, using their LSA-based vector representations and using cosine-correlation as a ve ctor si milarity meas ure. Our clustering algo-rithm co mbines top-down clustering (Bisecting K-Means) and bottom -up clustering (Agglom erative Clustering) (Steinbach et al., 2000). This hybrid clustering approach leverages the speed of bisect-ing K-means and the greedy search of agglomera-tive clustering, thus achieving a nice effectiveness versus efficiency balance. 
Cluster centroids (InfoMagnets) and documents (or topic segments) are all treated as bag-of-words. Their vector-space representation is the sum of the LSA vectors of their constituent terms. When the user changes the topic-representation by removing or adding a term to an InfoMagnet, a new LSA vector is obtained by projecting the new bag-of-words onto the LSA space and re-computing the cosine correlation betwee n all documents and the new topic. 
InfoMagnets was designed for easy usability by both computational linguistics and non-technical users. It has been successf ully used by social psy-chologists working on on-line communities re-search as well as learning science researchers studying tutorial dialogue interactions (which we discuss in some detail here). 
Using InfoMagnets, a thermodynamics domain expert constructed a topic analysis of a corpus of human tutoring dialogues collected during class-room study focusing on thermodynamics instruc-tion (Ros X  et al., 2005). Altogether each student X  X  protocol was divided into between 10 and 25 seg-ments such that the entire corpus was divided into approximately 379 topic segments altogether. Us-ing InfoMagnets, the domain expert identified 15 distinct topics such that each student covered be-tween 4 and 11 of these topics either once or mul-tiple times throughout their interaction. 
The topic analysis of the corpus gives us a way of quickly getting a sense of how tutors divided their instructional time between different topics of conversation. Based on this topic analysis of the human-tutoring corpus, the domain expert de-signed 12 dialogues, which were then implemented using a dialogue authoring environment called TuTalk (Gweon et al., 2005). In a recent very suc-cessful classroom evaluation, we observed the in-structional effectiveness of these implemented tutorial dialogue agents, as measured by pre and post tests.
