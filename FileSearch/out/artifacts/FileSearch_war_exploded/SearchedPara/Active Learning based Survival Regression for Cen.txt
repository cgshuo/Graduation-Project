 Time-to-event outcomes based data can be modelled using survival regression methods which can predict these out-comes in different censored data applications in diverse fields such as engineering, economics and healthcare. Predictive models are built by inferring from the censored variable in time-to-event data, which differentiates them from other re-gression methods. Censoring is represented as a binary in-dicator variable and machine learning methods have been tuned to account for the censored attribute. Active learn-ing from censored data using survival regression methods can make the model query a domain expert for the time-to-event label of the sampled instances. This offers higher advantages in the healthcare domain where a domain ex-pert can interactively refine the model with his feedback. With this motivation, we address this problem by providing an active learning based survival model which uses a novel model discriminative gradient based sampling scheme. We evaluate this framework on electronic health records (EHR), publicly available survival and synthetic censored datasets of varying diversity. Experimental evaluation against state of the art survival regression methods indicates the higher discriminative ability of the proposed approach. We also present the sampling results for the proposed approach in an active learning setting which indicate better learning rates in comparison to other sampling strategies.

Time-to-event data is widely noticed in many real world applications ranging from engineering to economics to health-care [3, 28]. In this data, the time is measured until the occurrence of the event of interest. The time measured is the prediction attribute in time-to-event data. The other components of this data include the covariates and a binary censoring indicator variable. Censoring occurs when an ob-servation is incomplete due to some random cause which is independent of the event of interest. The most frequent form of censoring is right censoring where subjects are followed until some time, at which the event has yet to occur, but then the subject takes no further part in the study. Censor-ing differentiates time-to-event data from other commonly observed forms of data.
 a wide range of applications where a domain expert (oracle) can be involved in the model building process. In health-care applications, the survival model can select instances by learning from a small labelled set of instances and then query the expert to receive the time-to-event label before including it in the model. This expert feedback can help in refining the model which is particularly useful for healthcare applications such as predicting 30-day readmission risk [20, 21]. In such applications, the domain expert can integrate domain knowledge into the survival model to build a more robust model.
 lenging because the model must choose an instance from both censored and uncensored set of instances in the dataset and query the expert to obtain the time-to-event label. In general censored data mining tasks, censored instances are either deleted or the missing values are imputed to convert it into an uncensored problem. An important challenge here lies in utilizing the censored instance completely while build-ing the active learning based survival regression model with-out deleting or modifying the instance.
 tuned to predict from censored data. Machine learning meth-ods such as neural networks [25], random forests [15] and support vector machine [13] based approaches have been applied to deal with censored data. These methods in par-ticular can handle non linear relations between the covari-ates in censored data. Survival regression methods such as Cox proportional hazards [8] and Accelerated failure time (AFT) [26] model are also used to build regression models from censored data. above because it estimates the relative risk rather than the absolute risk of occurrence of the event. In the healthcare scenario, this is highly useful for a doctor to compare two pa-tients from the same cohort to identify who is at a relatively higher risk. Cox regression also has a simple formulation which consists of just estimating two quantities (i) the un-specified baseline hazard function and (ii) a linear function of the set of covariates.
 regression (ARC) framework which effectively integrates ac-tive learning and Cox regression using a novel model dis-criminative gradient sampling strategy and robust regular-ization. Regularization helps in providing good generaliz-ability in ARC and the model discriminative gradient sam-pling encourages selecting appropriate instances to be la-belled by the domain expert. ARC is tested on censored elec-tronic health records (EHR), synthetic censored and pub-licly available survival datasets. Experimental results over 10 different datasets indicate that ARC outperforms other competing methods on 8 datasets and attains very compet-itive AUC values. To our knowledge, this is the first work which combines active learning with Cox regression for pre-dicting time-to-event outcomes in the 30-day readmission problem [20, 21] for heart failure. 1.

In this section, we present the related work in the area of using machine learning methods for survival analysis. In the survival analysis framework, Cox regression has garnered significant interest from researchers in the clinical and ma-chine learning communities [7].
Survival analysis is a statistical discipline that deals with censored data and it tries to extract patterns which quan-tify the relation between the covariates and the risks. More specifically it aims at quantitatively evaluating the effects of covariates and predict event times in the cohort from the knowledge of the covariates. The main complications in sur-vival analysis are caused by the statistical noise which is primarily due to censoring .

The failure time for instance i, T i is set to the minimum of O i and C .If O i  X  C i this indicates that the event of interest has occurred within the censoring time. However, if O i is un-known then T i is set to C i and the instance is censored. Censoring is included in the computation of Cox regression using the risk set R i which is calculated using T i where ( T i = min ( O i ,C i )).
 ical problems such as readmission prediction. In this prob-lem, an event is defined as the onset of heart failure readmis-sion within 30 days of discharge from the previous admission. For example, if a patient was not readmitted after discharge from the previous admission different cases can arise. whose follow up details were lost over time or (ii) the pa-tients who were not readmitted within the time period of follow up until the end of the study (which if fixed to 30 in this case). This is commonly called the right censoring setting, which is the most frequently studied censoring phe-nomena in survival analysis.

The proportional hazards (PH) assumption in Cox regression also basically states that different covariates contribute each an independent multi-plicative factor to the primary risk hazard rate. pendent and also independent of time. However, it is easy to incorporate time-dependent covariates also into the Cox regression model. In Cox regression, the goal is to find the most probable parameters  X  =(  X  1 ,..., X  m )andthemost probable base hazard function h 0 ( t ). over the partial log-likelihood function. The base hazard function on the other hand is estimated using Equation (3). This base hazard function is estimated for an arbitrary time t after calculating  X  . During estimation the Cox regression model does not assume knowledge of absolute risk and esti-mates only the relative risk.

This function models the prob-ability of survival for an instance whereas the hazard prob-ability models the probability of occurrence of the event of interest for an instance. Cox regression is one of the most popular survival regression models and its simple formula-tion makes it easier to integrate it with different data mining techniques.
In this section, we explain the proposed Active Regu-larized Cox regression (ARC) framework. In Section 4.1, we explain a simple regularized Cox regression algorithm ( RegCox ) which uses the elastic net regularizer. A scalable coordinate majorization descent (CMD) based algorithm for solving this problem is provided.
 sampling strategy used in active learning is explained. In Section 4.3, the ARC framework which combines active learn-ing and regularized Cox regression using model discrimina-tive gradient based sampling is explained.
Cox regression models have the tendency to overfit the dataset, which limits their generalizability to different sce-narios [30]. Regularization is used to overcome the over-fitting tendency of the models. The corresponding prob-lem can be solved using unconstrained optimization meth-ods such as gradient descent and coordinate descent (CD). alleviate this problem, we present a coordinate majorization descent (CMD) based algorithm for solving RegCox which is more efficient and scalable than the regular CD solver. L (  X  )= n  X  1
L j (  X  )= n is a generic regularized Cox regression framework which can use any standard regularizer such as the LASSO, elastic net and kernel elastic net.

To write this updating formula for  X  j some additional nota-tion is defined using D j in Equation (6).

LASSO-COX [9] can be considered as a special case of the elastic net regularizer for the value of  X  set to 1. sider in RegCox is the kernel elastic net Cox regression (KEN-COX). Kernel elastic net Cox regression supplements EN-COX [10] with a column wise kernel matrix information. A RBF kernel matrix (Ke) is computed over the features (columns) of the dataset, and this information is plugged into the elastic net regularizer. The formulation is provided in Equation (7). In this formulation, we use a notation where X (: ,i )representsthe i th column vector of the matrix X. cedure used for solving RegCox .

In this section, we explain the model discriminative gra-dient based sampling strategy used by RegCox in ARC. In general regression problems, solving for the optimal param-eter  X  which can minimize the empirical error is a widely used search approach. In this approach, the parameters are repeatedly updated according to the negative gradient of the loss L (  X  ) with respect to each training example ( X i ,T The equation for obtaining  X  is provided in Equation (8). In this equation,  X  is called the learning rate. In active learning, model change is estimated after adding a new example X + to the training data with censored status  X  + and time-to-event value T + . The empirical risk on the enlarged training set D + = D  X  ( X + ,T + , X  + ) is defined using Equation (9).
 The goal of our sampling strategy in active learning is then to choose the example that could maximally change the cur-rent model and this selection function can be formulated as However, in practice we do not know the true label (time-to-event) ( T + ) of the sampled data point X + in advance. Therefore, we are not able to estimate the model change directly. Instead the expected change is calculated over all possible K unique time-to-event labels from { T 1 ,T 2 ,...,T to approximate the true change.
 The impact of adding an instance X from the pool to the training data is calculated in Equation (11). The absolute value of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the instance is weighted by the hazard probability h ( T k for that instance. This value is accumulated over all unique time-to-event values to obtain an estimate of the impact of X on the model. Finally, the instance X  X  which can induce the maximum model change over all the instances in the pool is selected and assumed to be the most discriminative instance for active learning. This explains our model discriminative gradient based sampling strategy.
In Algorithm 2, the basic ARC framework is explained. In line 3, the RegCox model is built using the training data and time-to-event values. In lines 4-6, the model is applied to all the instances in the unlabelled pool where Equation (11) is applied. In lines 7-8, the instance which makes the highest impact on the model is selected and the time-to-event la-bel for this instance is requested. Finally, in lines 8-10, the Algorithm 2 ARC Algorithm Require: Training Set Train , Unlabelled pool Pool ,Time-1: p =1 2: repeat 3: Model = RegCox ( Train, X ,T ) 4: for each instance in Pool do 5: Use model discriminative gradient sampling for each 6: end for 8: Query domain expert for label (time-to-event) of X  X  9: Train  X  Train  X  X  X  10: Pool  X  Pool \ X  X  11: p = p +1 12: until p = max training data is updated to build the model at the end of the current active learning round.
 nate majorization descent (CMD) method mentioned earlier is used in RegCox and it is known to converge efficiently [22] which guarantees the convergence of ARC. However, con-vergence rates may vary with the kind of regularizer used among LASSO, EN and KEN. The time complexity of Cox regression is O( mK )where m is the number of columns, K is the number of unique time-to-event values. The complex-ity of ARC can be computed as O( nmK + nK )where n is the number of instances. The additional nK term here is because of the model discriminative gradient sampling step which is applied on the pool of unlabelled instances.
In this section, we present the experimental results ob-tained after applying ARC on various diverse datasets. Sev-eral real and synthetic survival datasets are used along with electronic health records to assess the performance of ARC. The data processing is explained in the experimental setup subsection. We provide different results which assess the goodness of fit, discriminative ability and learning rates re-spectively. The ARC framework is implemented in C++ using the Eigen Matrix library [31]. The code for ARC is available at [29]. This includes the code for ARC and the preprocessed datasets (except the proprietary ones from Henry Ford Health System).
In this section, we demonstrate the performance of ARC on the following datasets.
Survival AUC which is also known as the concordance in-dex is used widely in the field of survival analysis [24, 19]. It can be interpreted as the fraction of all pairs of patients whose predicted survival times are correctly ordered among all patients that can actually be ordered.
 survival analysis lies in the fact that in clinical decision mak-ing the physicians and researchers are often more interested in evaluating the relative risk of a disease between patients with different covariates, than the absolute survival times of these patients.

The indicator function I a&lt;b 1if a&lt;b or 0 otherwise. S ( T | X i ) is estimated using the equations given in Section 3. In Equation (12), num repre-sents the number of comparable pairs.
 rMSE = squared error ( rMSE ). This is computed using the formula given in Equation (12). In this equation, the hazard func-tion h 0 ( T ) is obtained using the equations from Section 3. we test ARC in an academic setting without the involvement of a real domain expert. The instances which are sampled through the model discriminative gradient based sampling scheme in ARC are automatically assigned to their appro-priate time-to-event labels by our program.

ARC (LASSO) represents integrating LASSO-COX with active learning. Similarly ARC (EN) and ARC (KEN) represent integrating EN-COX and KEN-COX with active learning respectively. The performance of these different al-gorithms in ARC is compared to that of LASSO-COX [9], EN-COX [10], Boosting Cox Regression (CoxBoost) [18], Random Survival Forests (RSF) [15] and Boosting on Con-cordance Index (BoostCI) algorithms [16].
 EN-COX algorithms [27]. Fastcox is implemented in R and offers an effective algorithm for obtaining the entire regu-larization path of the EN-COX algorithm. CoxBoost and Random Survival Forests are run using the publicly avail-able CoxBoost and rsf R packages respectively. The BoostCI algorithm was implemented in R based on the pseudo-code provided in this paper [16]. KEN-COX uses an additional  X  parameter in its RBF kernel which is set to 0.3 for all the experiments.
 considered,(ARC) obtains higher concordance index values in comparison to other survival regression algorithms. This better performance of ARC is attributed to the fact that it selects informative instances during the initial active learn-ing rounds. This directly helps in obtaining models with higher discriminative ability. over EHR, survival and synthetic datasets.
The sampling strategies evaluated in ARC in this experi-ment are the following: 1. RAND : Randomly sample instances from the pool 2. Uncertainty based Sampling : Sample those in-3. Model Discriminative Gradient based Sampling : active learning rounds for 8 datasets. Depending on the size of the dataset being considered, we set the sampling size for each round in batch mode active learning. For each dataset, we consider integrating LASSO-COX, EN-COX and KEN-COX in the ARC framework. For plotting the curve for uncertainty based sampling, we used the predicted sur-vival probabilities to determine those instances the model is most uncertain about. For the random setting, instances were chosen randomly at the end of each active learning round. The x-axis represents the number of active learning rounds. The y-axis represents the concordance index (Sur-vival AUC).
 dicate that ARC (KEN) and ARC (EN) obtain significantly better AUC values than other methods, with ARC (LASSO) being marginally better than RAND and UNCERTAINTY. We observe some aberration in the learning curves due to the non-linearity and skewed distribution of EHR data. The learning curves for Breast, PBC and Colon indicate that ARC (KEN) still achieves the highest AUC value with ARC (LASSO) or ARC (EN) being the second best. This suggests that qualitative instances are being sampled from the pool and added to the training data in the active learning rounds. The results over all the datasets also show the effectiveness of ARC based sampling in comparison to uncertainty and random sampling. In this section, we compare the performance of ARC(LASSO), ARC(EN) and ARC(KEN). The root mean square error (rMSE) values for the survival regression models are cal-culated after 20 active learning rounds and the final values are reported. The rMSE is used to assess the goodness of fit obtained by the Cox regression model. It is calculated using Equation (12). The standard deviation values are also provided in Table 4.
 the best fit (lowest rMSE) amongst all the ARC based algo-rithms. We attribute this to the fact that the kernel elastic net is a more robust regularizer in comparison to the elastic net and lasso. It uses additional pairwise feature similar-ity information through the column wise kernel matrix ( Ke ) and supplements the elastic net penalty. This makes it more effective at capturing correlation in the dataset than other competing approaches.

In this paper, we presented an Active Regularized Cox re-gression (ARC) framework which integrates active learning with Cox regression using a novel model discriminative gra-dient based sampling strategy. In healthcare applications such as readmission risk prediction, ARC can identify pa-tient records to be labelled by a domain expert which can help in building survival models with expert feedback. In ARC, the domain expert provides a time-to-event label for the instance sampled by the model. This labelled instance is then added to the training data at the end of each active learning round and the model is updated with the sampled instance.

AFT model is a linear survival regression model which is applicable when the proportional hazards (PH) assumption is violated in certain domains. We would also like to integrate other existing methods such as transfer learning with Cox regression to build transfer learning based survival regression models.
