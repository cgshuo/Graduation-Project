 Information on the Web can be either globally distributed throughout the Web within multi-layer over the infrastructure of Web protocols, or located locally, portal-centralized Web services (i.e., the intelligent service provider) that is in-tegrated to its own cluster of specialized intelligent applications. However, each approach has a serious flaw. We propose the Distributed  X  -PSML (Problem Solver Markup Language) for solving problems in a large-scale distributed Web environment by combining global and local knowledge-data bases in this paper. The Distributed  X  -PSML is an extension of the  X  -PSML that we proposed be-fore for complex adaptive, distributed problem solving, and can be easily used for automatic reasoning on the Web for decision-making and e-business intelli-gence. We also give an example to show how the Distributed  X  -PSML can be used for automatic reasoning on the Web by incorporating global information sources from the Semantic Web with locally operational knowledge-data bases in an enterprise portal.
 struct the Distributed  X  -PSML and the reasoning mechanism of the Distributed  X  -PSML. Section 3 provides experimental results to show usefulness of our ap-proach. Section 4 surveys related work. Finally, Section 5 gives concluding re-marks. We propose the Distributed  X  -PSML for solving problems in a large-scale dis-tributed Web environment by combining global and local knowledge-data bases. 2.1 The Web Structure Based on the Distributed  X  -PSML As elaborated based on [11], distributed problem solving on the Web will provide the following functions:  X  The expressive power and functional support in PSML for complex adaptive,  X  Performing automatic reasoning on the Web by incorporating globally dis- X  Representing and organizing multiple, huge knowledge-data sources for dis- X  Combining multiple reasoning methods in the method efficiently and effec- X  Modeling user behavior and representing/managing it as a personalized when Distributed  X  -PSML is considered, its syntax and semantics will become much more complex than that of the  X  -PSML [11]. In this case, a query described with the Distributed  X  -PSML will consist of two parts: one part is to describe the query, and the other part presents constraints that will be useful to answer the query. To express our idea clearly, we turn to introduce the structure of the nodes on the Web in distributed environment. Each node has an inference engine and a knowledge-base. The knowledge-base consists of three parts: meta-knowledge, constraint knowledge and domain knowledge, respectively. Here meta-knowledge is composed of experience knowledge and heuristic knowledge and is used for classifying the query and dividing the query into sub-queries.
 be organized on the Grid with multi-service levels [2]. In order to achieve a goal by making use of some services-oriented distributed resources, problem solving related techniques are commonly used. After relevant services are identified, the compatible ones can then be composed to form a service flow for subsequent ex-ecution. We here argue that a hierarchy of services is needed to support the cor-responding service flow process. At the lowest layer, the Grid fabric can provide a platform that enables resources sharing in dynamic and distributed virtual organizations. Embracing Web services on Grid has recently been realized as an Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA), which opens up the service ori-ented computing paradigm to be applied in Grid. Every heterogeneous resource is virtualized as network-enabled Grid Services. With the use of Semantic Web technology, Web Services can be described semantically and make service dis-covery and matchmaking based on service semantics and ontologies possible. The semantics used for tagging the services should further be organized to constitute knowledge about services. With the assumption that the service knowledge is distributed on the Web and owned by different agents with different social and trust relationships, the social network connecting the corresponding agents becomes an inevitable layer that can facilitate dynamic knowledge exchange and sharing. 2.2 The Reasoning Process of the Distributed  X  -PSML When a node in the distributed environment receives a query, the node classifies the query or divides the query into sub-queries with its meta-knowledge, solves some of them with its domain knowledge, and assigns unsolved queries to its neighbors with its constraint knowledge. Just like a social network, the connec-tion between two nodes is formed by accumulated experience. The mechanism of assigning sub-queries to the neighbors of a node is similar that of case-based reasoning. Each neighbor handles the sub-queries in the similar way and the process continues until the node solves all received sub-queries. Then it returns the sub-answers recursively. When all the neighbors of the original node return answers of the received sub-queries, it combines them into the answer of the original query and returns it to the user. Each node can use an inference method which can be different from others (e.g. some nodes use exact inference methods, while some others use uncertainty inference). The answer may be incomplete or empty because some sub-queries cannot be transferred to the neighbors of the node according to the constraint knowledge, which means no neighbor can solve the sub-queries or the constraints of the sub-queries and the node can not be satisfied [11]. Experiments in this section show how the Distributed  X  -PSML can be used for automatic reasoning on the Web by incorporating global information sources from the Semantic Web with locally operational knowledge-data bases in an enterprise portal. 3.1 A Camera Ontology for a Camera-Sale Portal We use a sample of camera ontology to demonstrate our approach as shown in Figure 3. In this figure, the plain line denotes that the subclass relation holds between the connected nodes; the dashed line denotes slot of attribute and set of attributes; the circle object denotes a class; and the rectangle denotes an attribute owned by the class. on the Semantic Web. Figure 4 shows the Web browser of this portal. In the camera-sale portal, we use RDF-Schema format for instances and the camera ontology in OWL that builds upon the RDF and RDF Schema, so that XSLT can be employed to transform Web contents information on the Semantic Web (global information sources) [3]. 3.2 Workflow of Transformation Figure 5 shows a workflow of transformation from Web-contents information on the Semantic Web into the Distributed  X  -PSML [12]. As discussed in [11], ontologies represented in OWL can be easily translated to  X  -PSML. The trans-formation process is the XSLT engine for analyzing an input source with ontolo-gies (e.g. XML, RDF, and OWL) and for transforming it into the Distributed  X  -PSML as an output source. The examples of the input and output sources are shown in Figures 6-9, respectively..
 3.3 Inference and Reasoning of the Distributed  X  -PSML in In this subsection, we describe the inference and reasoning process of the Dis-tributed  X  -PSML that are performed by transforming the global Semantic Web information sources and coupling with knowledge-data bases stored in the local machine in advance. Part of the sample knowledge-data base in the local ma-chine is shown in Figure 10. The knowledge-data base stores the information of the company itself and the old information of other companies. problems: we must unify documentary form of the collected information because all manufacturers do not use the same format. Of course, if all manufacturers will use the unified format for contents, it will be easy to solve this problem. Unfortunately, it is difficult to ask for all manufacturers to use the same format. that XML hierarchy is the same, but the used vocabularies may be different. We developed Unification for unifying vocabularies contained in Web contents information.
 reads and analyzes the camera ontology denoted in OWL (see Figure 6) and instances denoted in RDF (see Figure 7). Secondly, Unification calls the XSLT engine and reads the ontology for vocabulary unification (see Figure 8). Finally, the output of Unification is the Distributed  X  -PSML file (see Figure 9) with a unified vocabulary. the Semantic Web by Web information collecting agents. However, Web content information may not be afforded by camera manufacturer. For this reason, we utilized contents information (XML, OWL, the Distributed  X  -PSML) of our own which was drawn upon information of camera manufacturer X  X  Web sites. These will be expected to be afforded by all manufacturers in the future. by using both local and global information sources. It can enumerate products by matching the criteria specified. Figure 11 shows the results with respect to query-answering by using find in PSML.
 3.5)  X  is an assumption about  X  X egapixel is over 3.5 X , that means  X  X numerate cameras which the megapixel is over 3.5 X . When this query is given, the Dis-tributed  X  -PSML reasons with global and local sources, and then gives answers about products that are acceptable. That is, the reasoning is carried out on the camera ontology and instances transformed from the Semantic Web with locally cameras related operational knowledge-data bases.
 (Figure 12). Hence, combining global and local information sources is very im-portant for decision-making based on the Web inference engine. There have been several works addressing the combining OWL with Horn clauses or other logic systems for problem solving and rule markup languages on the Semantic Web. They include SWRL [7], XRML [8], and the W4 project [1], UPML [10], and information retrieval on the Semantic Web documents [4]. RuleML, but its number of predicate arguments was limited to only one or two and also its reasoning mechanism was not considered. In [8], Kang and Lee observed that there exist rules embedded implicitly in Web pages that cannot be processed in XML, and proposed XRML that supports the automatic processing of implicit rules embedded in the hypertexts and helps human X  X  browsing for their comprehension. However, XRML only utilizes global information and does not consider the ontology. The W4 (Well-Founded Semantics for the WWW) project aims at developing Standard Prolog inter-operable tools for supporting distributed, secure, and integrated reasoning activities on the Semantic Web, but it did not also consider the ontology. Compared with the work mentioned above, our research concentrates on the combination of OWL with Horn clauses, and the PSML provides capabilities to represent, transform and manage multiple, huge knowledge-data sources on the Web and the knowledge grid for distributed Web inference and reasoning as well as complex adaptive, distributed problem solving.
 reusable architectures and components for implementing the reasoning part of knowledge based systems. UPML can describe architectures for reasoning of deeper knowledge. One of major differences with our work is concerning with the markup language. UPML utilized a specific markup language, but our research is based on a standard markup language on the Semantic Web, such as OWL, RDF, etc. Hence, our approach can deal with various information sources on the Semantic Web.
 with two layers, the information retrieval layer and the interaction layer, that uses the Semantic Web for improvement in quality. However, our objectives are not only focusing on retrieval, but also for providing knowledge services including decision-making on intelligent enterprise portals. The Distributed  X  -PSML that we proposed is a new method of knowledge repre-sentation for the Semantic Web. The Distributed  X  -PSML can be easily used for inference and reasoning as well as transforming and managing both global and local knowledge-data bases. The Distributed  X  -PSML can perform the function of logic layer for the Semantic Web. The experimental results show that our con-siderations are valid and our preliminary solution works well on the Semantic Web.
 chical structure and combine various reasoning methods in PSML more efficiently and effectively for complex adaptive, distributed problem solving. Furthermore, distributed Web inference engines need to be implemented on the wisdom Web and knowledge grids (include Web service technology) to deal with huge and multiple distributed information sources [5,6,9,13,14].
