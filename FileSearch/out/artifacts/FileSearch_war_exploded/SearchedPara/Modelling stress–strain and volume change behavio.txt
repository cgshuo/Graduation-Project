 1. Introduction
The mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils has been the topic of numerous investigations over the past few decades. Among the notable contributions include the works of Toll (1990) , Alonso et al. (1990) and Wheeler and Sivakumar (1995) within the independent stress state framework, and the contribu-(2003) , Wheeler et al. (2003) , Borja (2004) , Ehlers et al. (2004) and Khalili et al. (2008) based on the effective stress concept. These contributions constitute major steps forward in constitu-tive modelling of unsaturated soils, however many have proven to be incapable of dealing with all complex aspects of unsaturated soils behaviour in a consistent and unified manner. Indeed, there currently exist no constitutive models of unsaturated soils in which a point-by-point matching of test data as observed in the laboratory can be achieved.

In recent years, the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been introduced as an effective alternative to constitutive model-ling of complex materials. ANN is a computer-based modelling technique for computation and knowledge representation inspired by the neural architecture and operation of the human brain. Having been initially developed in early 1940s, ANNs have experienced a considerable resurgence of interest in recent years.
ANN consists of a large number of highly interconnected processing units. Each processing unit (neuron), acting as an idealized neuron in human brain, receives input from the units to which it is connected, computes an activation level, and transmits that activation to other processing units.

A multi-layer perceptron neural network has an input layer, an output layer, and a number of hidden layers connected to each other. Weights are assigned to the connections between these units. The presence of hidden layers allows the network to represent and compute complicated associations between input and output patterns. During training, a forward pass of informa-tion through the network involving simple computations results in the prediction of the output variables of the network. The knowledge stored in the developed network is represented by the set of connection weights. The neural network is trained by appropriately modifying its connection weights through the set of  X  X  X raining cases X  X  until the predicted output variables agree satisfactory with the desired variables. The  X  X  X ack-propagation X  X  term refers to the algorithm by which the observed error in the predicted output variables is used to modify the connection weights. At the end of training, when the error measure of the network is reduced below a user-defined minimum, the training is stopped and the connection weights are locked and recorded.
When a trained ANN is presented with an input pattern, a feed-forward network computation results in an output pattern that is the result of the generalization and synthesis of what it has learned.
 directly from the experimental data, offers a fundamentally different approach to modelling of the material behaviour.
Because of their ability to learn and generalize interactions among many variables, ANNs have the potential to model various aspects of material behaviour. Therefore, ANNs have received consider-able attention in recent years, with a wide range of applications in civil and geotechnical engineering. They are robust in modelling the nonlinear behaviour and dealing with noisy data.
 was proposed by Ellis et al. (1992) and Ghaboussi et al. (1994) .
Encouraged by the attractive features of neural networks, a number of neural network constitutive models (NNCMs) for different geomaterials were developed including Ellis et al. (1995) , Amorosi et al. (1996) , Penumadu and Chameau (1997) , Penumadu and Zhao (1999) , Ghaboussi et al. (1998) , Sidarta and Ghaboussi (1998) ,
Javadi et al. (2003) , Javadi et al. (2009) among others. However, all these contributions have been in the domain of saturated soil and the application of ANN to modelling of unsaturated soil has been very limited ( Habibagahi and Bamdad, 2003 ; Johari and Javadi, 2010 ).
 modelling the behaviour of materials they do have shortcomings.
One of the drawbacks of neural network is that the optimum structure of ANN (e.g., number of inputs, hidden layers, and transfer functions) must be identified a priori. This is usually done through a trial and error procedure. The other major short-coming is the black box nature of ANN model and the fact that the relationship between input and output parameters of the system is described in terms of a weight matrix and biases that are not accessible to the user. In fact, the black box nature and lack of interpretability have prevented ANNs from achieving their full potential in engineering applications.
 shortcomings of ANNs by providing a structured and transparent model representing the behaviour of the system. EPR takes advantage of automatic model construction procedure that avoids the need to preselect the functional form and the number of parameters in the model ( Giustolisi and Savic, 2009 ). In the context of modelling classification, EPR is classified as a symbolic grey box technique, whose aim is identification and construction of clearly structured model expressions from observed data ( Javadi and Rezania, 2009 ; Doglioni and Novel, 2003 ). The approach integrates numerical and symbolic regression to per-form evolutionary polynomial regression. The strategy uses polynomial structures to take advantage of their favourable mathematical properties. EPR uses evolutionary search for expo-nents of polynomial expressions by means of a genetic algorithm (GA) engine. This allows (i) easy computational implementation of the algorithm, (ii) efficient search for an explicit expression, and (iii) improved control of the complexity of the expression generated.
 of unsaturated soils. EPR introduces a new unified, clear and physically plausible framework in which different aspects of soil behaviour can be directly captured from experimental data and represented in the form of mathematical expressions. The devel-oped models are capable of satisfactorily explaining the physics of the problem. The capabilities of the technique are demonstrated by application to a comprehensive set of unsaturated triaxial data for a range of stresses and drainage conditions. 2. Evolutionary polynomial regression
Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR) is a data-driven method based on evolutionary computing, aimed at searching polynomial structures representing a system. A general EPR expression may be presented as: y  X  where y is the estimated vector of output of the process; a parameters; F is a function constructed by the EPR process; X is the the number of terms of the target expression. The general functional employed to select the use ful input vectors from X to be combined. user based on understanding of the physical process. While the selection of feasible structures to be combined is done through an evolutionary process the parameters a j are estimated by the least square method ( Fig. 1 ).

In this technique, the combination of the genetic algorithm to find feasible structures and the least square method to find the appropriate model parameters for those structures implies some advantages. In particular, the GA allows a global exploration of the error surface relevant to specifically defined objective functions. By using such objective functions some criteria can be selected to be satisfied through the search process. These criteria can be set in order to (a) avoid the overfitting of models; (b) push the models towards simpler structures; and (c) avoid unnecessary terms representative of the noise in data. EPR implements avoids over-fitting by penalizing the number of inputs involved in structures (model complexity); controlling the constant values whose term may describe noise when the related constant is close to zero; and controlling the variance of EPR terms with respect to noise variance in data which is estimated by model residuals ( Giustolisi and Savic, 2006 ). A useful feature of EPR is the high level of interactivity between the user and the methodology. The user physical insight can be used to make hypotheses on the elements of the target function and on its structure (Eq. (1)). Selecting an appropriate objective function, assuming pre-selected elements in Eq. (1) based on engineering judgment, and working with dimensional information enable refinement of final models. Detailed explanation of the method can be found in contribution of Giustolisi and Savic (2006 ). 3. Database Results from a set of constant water content triaxial tests on Lateritic gravel reported by Toll (1988 ) were adopted for the analysis. Table 1 indicates the range of basic soil properties. Table 2 shows the initial conditions of soil specimens adopted for this study and also indicates whether the results of a particular test were used for training or testing of the EPR models. This database consists of the results from 23 different unsaturated specimens prepared using static or dynamic compression. How-ever, for the sake of consistency, only 14 specimens prepared with static compression were considered in this investigation. The experimental results (graphs) presented by Toll (1988) were digitized. Digitization resulted in a database including a total of 5153 patterns that were used for training and testing of EPR. 4. Modelling of unsaturated soils using EPR 4.1. Data preparation
Generally in pattern recognition procedures (e.g., neural net-work, fuzzy logic or genetic programming) it is common that the model construction is based on adaptive learning over a number of cases and the performance of the constructed model is then evaluated using an independent validation data set. In evolu-tionary-based modelling, the way in which the data are divided into training and validation sets has a significant effect on the the dataset was divided into several random combinations of training and validation sets until a robust representation of the whole population was achieved for both training and validation was performed on the input and output parameters of the randomly selected training and validation sets. This was to make subsets are as close as possible to the other and the training and testing subsets represent the same statistical population. Of the 14 available data sets (14 tests), 6 are found to have all parameters within the range between the maximum and minimum parameter available for choosing three sets to be used as the testing dataset.
The minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation are calcu-datasets for each case. Among these 20 cases the one in which the standard deviation and mean values were the closest for the training and testing data, was chosen to be used in training and testing stages in the EPR model development process. In this way, the most statistically consistent combination is used for construc-tion and validation of the EPR models (11 tests were used for model construction and 3 tests for model validation). The parameters used in the statistical analysis include the maximum, minimum, mean finally selected combinations are shown in Table 2 . 4.2. EPR procedure
Before starting the evolutionary procedure, a number of constraints can be implemented to control the structure of the models to be constructed, in terms of length of the equations, type of functions used, number of terms, range of exponents, number of generations etc. It can be seen that there is great potential in achieving different models for a particular problem which enables the user to gain additional information ( Javadi and
Rezania, 2009 ). Applying the EPR procedure, the evolutionary process starts from a constant mean of output values. By increas-ing the number of evolutions it gradually picks up the different participating parameters in order to form equations representing the constitutive relationships. Each model is trained using the training data and tested using the testing data. The level of accuracy at each stage is evaluated based on the coefficient of determination ( COD ) i.e., the fitness function as COD  X  1 where Y a is the actual output value; Y p is the EPR predicted value and N is the number of data points on which the COD is computed.
If the model fitness is not acceptable or the other termination criteria (in terms of maximum number of generations and max-imum number of terms) are not satisfied, the current model should go through another evolution in order to obtain a new model.
To examine the efficiency of the proposed EPR approach in capturing the behaviour of unsaturated soils, the database is used listed in Table 1 . 5. EPR models for unsaturated soils: Incremental approach
A typical scheme to train most of the neural network based material models for soils includes an input set providing the network with information relating to the current state units (e.g., current stresses and strains) and then a forward pass through the network yields the prediction of the next expected state of stress or strain relevant to an input strain or stress increment ( Ghaboussi et al., 1998 ). Due to the incremental nature of soil stress X  X train modelling in practical applications, this scheme has been utilized in this research. The EPR models have eight input parameters as summarized in Table 3 .
 and the other parameters, namely; axial strain, net mean stress, tally during the training and testing based on the outputs from the previous increment of the axial strain. The output parameters are deviator stress, suction and volume tric strain corresponding to the end of the incremental step for the three EPR models. set is used for training to develop the models and the other one is used for validation to appraise the generalization capabilities of the trained models.
 models, from the 15 resultant equations for deviator stress, six equations do not include the effect of all contributing parameters.
Among the remaining equations the most appropriate and efficient (3) X (5) represent the increment al EPR models for deviator stress, volume strain, and suction, respectively. s
Fig. 2 shows typical deviator stress-axial strain, volumetric strain-axial strain, and suction-axial strain curves predicted by the (incremental) EPR models in Eqs. (3) X (5) (dashed lines) against the experimental results for a test that was used in training of the models (sample MGU22). ANN simulation results after Habibagahi and Bamdad (2003 ) are also presented.
After training, the performance of the trained EPR models is verified using three sets of validation data which have not been introduced to EPR during training. The purpose of validation is to examine the capabilities of the trained models to generalise the training to conditions that have not been seen by the model during the training phase. Fig. 3 shows predictions made by the developed EPR models against the experimental data which were not previously seen by EPR and were used as validation data (MGU 6). The COD values for the EPR (Eqs. (3) X (5)) and ANN are given in Table 4 .

Comparison of the results and the high COD values for the (incremental) EPR models indicate the excellent performance of these models in capturing the underlying relationships between contributing parameters and response of unsaturated soils and also in generalizing the training to predict the behaviour of the soils under unseen conditions. Results also show that EPR over performs ANN and its results are a closer match to the actual experimental data.
 5.1. Predicting entire stress paths using the EPR models
In this section, the EPR models (Eqs. (3) X (5)) are used to predict the entire stress paths, incrementally, point by point, in (testing) data (MGU6, 8, and 10) are used to evaluate the ability of the incremental EPR models to predict the complete behaviour of unsaturated soil during the entire stress paths. The values of water content and dry density represent the initial conditions of the soil and are constant throughout the test. Other contribut-ing parameters are updated in each incremental step, considering the values from the previous increment and the EPR models outputs in response to an axial strain increment. Fig. 4 illustrates the procedure followed for updating of the input parameters and building the entire stress path for a shearing stage of a triaxial test.

At the start of the shearing stage in a conventional triaxial experiment, the values of all parameters are known. For example in a test on a sample of unsaturated soil, the values of pressure, air pressure, water pressure and volume change at the prescribed increment of axial strain, D e a , the values of q and s i  X  1 are calculated from the EPR models (Eqs. (3) X (5), respectively). For the next increment, the values of ( p u and e v , i are updated as: s  X  s q  X  q  X   X  p u a  X  i  X  X  p u a  X  i  X   X 
In this way the second points on the curves are predicted. The incremental procedure is continued until all the points on the three curves are predicted and the curves are established.

The predicted results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results and the facts that (i) the entire curves have been predicted point by point; (ii) the errors of prediction of the individual points are accumu-complete stress paths with such a good degree of accuracy are testaments to the robustness of the developed EPR framework for modelling of unsaturated soils. 5.2. Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the model response to changes in some of the input parameters. This is done through a basic approach to sensitivity analysis which is to fix all but one input variables and vary the remaining one within the range of its maximum and minimum values. For this purpose a typical specimen MGU6, that was not used in the model con-struction (a testing data set), with basic soil properties given in Table 2 is considered.
 Deviator stress (kPa) Volumetric strain (%) Suction (kPa)
The effect of dry density is examined by applying the models (Eqs. (3) X (5)) to predict the changes in the q : e a , e v curves for three different values of dry density (1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 Mg/m 3 ). The results are shown in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 (a) shows the influence of dry density on stress X  X train behaviour, while other parameters are kept constant. As expected, with an increase in dry density the stress X  X train curve shifts upwards, indicating that a sample with higher density has a higher failure point and also a increasing dry density increases the tendency for dilation of the sample which in turn results in an increase in the suction during constant water content shearing, as correctly predicted by the model. Fig. 8 (b) shows the influence of r d on variation of volumetric strain.

The effect of water content of soil is evaluated by applying the models to predict the changes in the deviator-stress-axial strain, suction-axial strain, and volumetric strain-axial strain curves for three different values of water content (18%, 21% and 24%). Fig. 9 (a) shows the effect of change in water content on the stress X  X train behaviour of unsaturated soil. As expected, increas-ing the water content causes the curve to move downwards indicating that a dryer sample has a higher failure stress and a greater stiffness (elastic modulus). Fig. 9 (c) shows that generally for a soil sample increasing water content decreases soil suction. Fig. 9 (b) shows that, for the soil used in this analysis, effect of water content on volumetric strain is negligible. 6. Discussion and conclusions
A number of models based on the evolutionary polynomial regression have been developed to model various aspects of unsaturated soil behaviour. Incremental relationships are pre-sented. It is shown that the EPR models can capture the under-lying relationships between various parameters directly from experimental triaxial data and predict the unsaturated soil behaviour with a very high precision. The EPR models are also tested using data that were not used in the training stage of EPR model development process; in this way, an unbiased perfor-mance indicator is obtained on the real prediction capability of the models. The results show the excellent ability of the EPR models in generalizing the training to predict the behaviour of unsaturated soils under unseen conditions.

The proposed EPR models generate a transparent and struc-tured representation of the system. One of the main advantages of the EPR approach is that there is no need to assume a priori the form of the relationship between the input and output para-meters. The explicit and transparent structures obtained from the proposed EPR method can allow physical interpretation of the model predictions which gives the user additional insight into the 100 200 300 400 500 600 Deviatoric stress (kPa) -20 -15 -10 10 15 20 Volumetric strain (%) 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Suction (kPa) relationship between input and output parameters.

 predict the complete stress paths in the q : e a , e v : e incrementally and point-by-point. The fact that the errors of prediction of the individual points are accumulated in this approach, and still the EPR models are able to predict the complete stress paths with a very good degree of accuracy is another testament to the robustness of the developed EPR frame-work for modelling of unsaturated soils.
 including It provides a simple and straightforward framework for modelling of all materials. It does not require any arbitrary choice of the constitutive (mathematical) model, yield function, behaviour directly from raw experimental data, it is the shortest route from experimental research (data) to numerical modelling.
Additional advantage of EPR model is that as more data becomes available, the material model can be improved by re-training the EPR.
