 As organizations scale up, their collective knowledge increases, and the potential for serendipitous collaboration between members grows dramatically. However, finding people with the right exper-tise or interests becomes much more difficult. Semi-structured so-cial media, such as blogs, forums, and bookmarking, present a vi-able platform for collaboration X  X f enough people participate, and if shared content is easily findable. Within the trusted confines of an organization, users can trade anonymity for a rich identity that carries information about their role, location, and position in its hierarchy.

This paper describes WaterCooler, a tool that aggregates shared internal social media and cross-references it with an organization X  X  directory. We deployed WaterCooler in a large global enterprise and present the results of a preliminary user study. Despite the lack of complete social networking affordances, we find that Water-Cooler changed users X  perceptions of their workplace, made them feel more connected to each other and the company, and redis-tributed users X  attention outside their own business groups.

The greatest asset of any organization is its people. As any or-ganization grows, its members X  collective expertise and wisdom represent a vast treasure trove of knowledge. However, finding this knowledge becomes much harder, making it difficult to lever-age and exploit. Lew Platt, the former chief executive of Hewlett Figure 1: The WaterCooler front page, highlighting popular content. (All names have been anonymized.) Packard, once famously said,  X  X f HP knew what HP knows, we would be three times as profitable X  [6].

Traditionally, large companies approach this problem with cen-tralized knowledge management processes. This typically takes the form of a knowledge base with an ontology formally defining the format and organization of documents: when enough knowledge is accumulated on a topic, an author might create a white paper or brief. However, it X  X  difficult to solicit information not already in the knowledge base, or to find more ephemeral information such as opinions, news items, or ideas. Such content is dynamic; it X  X  constantly being created and augmented, and so it is challenging to stay updated. Expertise in an organization is largely tacit knowl-edge that is hard to extract [3] and difficult to codify in a knowledge base. As a result, knowledge bases  X  X enerally capture information or data rather than knowledge or expertise  X  [14].
Increasingly, knowledge workers are augmenting searches with queries directed at their office social networks [24]. As a result, finding the right person is often at least as important as finding needed information. Indeed, this observation led Nardi et al . to conclude: The collection of these peripheral contacts or  X  X eak ties X  helps dis-seminate information [11] and could create opportunities for col-laboration.

Unfortunately, people who are not collocated are much less likely to voluntarily collaborate with each other [20]. As a com-pany scales and becomes more globally distributed, its members can easily feel disconnected from each other and from the organi-zation X  X  objectives. And as an organization becomes more com-plex, it becomes harder to know what X  X  going on in geographically or hierarchically distant units.

The proliferation of blogging, wikis, social bookmarking, and social networking tools lower the barriers to and requisite formality of publishing content, making it easy for people to advertise their interests, opinions, knowledge, or needs in a public setting, and to connect with others. Sharing a bookmark with colleagues on delicious.com takes seconds; blog posts can be authored in minutes. A number of large companies are now experimenting with the use of internal social media for employees to communicate with each other behind the firewall (for example, [9, 15, 29]).

As it becomes sufficiently easy for everyone to author content, an attention economy results, and readers X  attention becomes a scarce resource [5]. If thousands of people are posting, reading through every new post becomes intractable. It follows, then, that helping readers direct their attention to valuable content will improve the value they get out their time investment.
The  X  X ong tail X  of interests and expertise [2] of an organization X  X  members can certainly be a huge asset. But the attention economy may break down in enterprise settings, as the audience for niche content is comparatively smaller [30]. How do you encourage peo-ple to invest time sharing what they know? Large companies often create disincentives for employees to share knowledge: pay-for-performance schemes pit workers against each other, formalized channels for knowledge management are too rigid, and there X  X  of-ten little reward for time expended helping others [14].
In any groupware implementation, disparity between work re-quired and perceived benefit may limit participation [12]. While some authors may enjoy the act of writing itself, or having a  X  X oap-box X , most office workers, already under time pressure, need to know their contributions are being read and valued by others. For contributions to truly impact an organization they must find the right audience. Directing the people most likely to benefit from in-formation to specific content will increase the chances that authors will get meaningful feedback from interested readers.
We seek to explore ways to help members of a large organiza-tion find each other and share knowledge and insights. We studied online communities at Hewlett Packard, a large global technology company. These observations informed the design of WaterCooler, an intranet site we made available internally at HP and iteratively refined over the past year. This paper will provide an overview of related work in Section 2 and describe the social collaboration practices at HP in Section 3. Section 4 gives a summary of the it-erative design process behind WaterCooler. In Section 5, we report on users X  reactions and examine how this tool redistributes users X  attention. Finally, in Section 6, we offer implications for social software in large organizations.

While previous systems have tried to connect people by infer-ring expertise automatically or providing explicit social networking connections, this paper focuses on the impacts of surfacing social media contributions from across the organization for users in an at-tempt to promote organizational awareness. This paper X  X  contribu-tion is an exploration of the issue of attention in the enterprise and the description of a prototype that successfully encourages users to explore the organization beyond their workgroup by exposing internal social media contributions.
Internal blogging in corporate environments is receiving a fair amount of recent study. Efimova and Grudin studied blogging at Microsoft and reported a variety of ways bloggers engage with the organization, including sharing passion for their work and showing the  X  X uman side X  of the company [9]. Yardi et al . found that inter-nal blogs at HP seem to be used for social as well as work-related purposes [29]. Moreover, blogs can facilitate a sense of community in a large organization [16].

Kolari et al . modeled commenting behavior on blogs at IBM as a graph and projected these  X  X onversations X  onto the organization chart to measure the  X  X each X  of blog posts [19]. They suggest a variety of metrics for determining a blogger X  X  impact in an organi-zation.

Prior work has also explored the use of social bookmarking in corporate environments [4, 17, 23]. Others have explored people-tagging [10] and blogging [15] in an enterprise context at IBM. However, each of these tools was studied in isolation; here we ex-amine the aggregation of a variety of social media in one site. Ag-gregating these sources is important because it can be done auto-matically at low cost to users. Others have explored feed aggrega-tors that estimate posts X  relevance to see if they warrant interrupting users [26]; we focus on designing a tool for background awarenes s that users could check during natural breaks between tasks.
A comprehensive study by DiMicco et al . found workers at IBM use internal social networking tools to connect with coworkers per-sonally and to advance their career and project objectives [7]. This suggests potential opportunities for organizations that enable their members to easily network.

Prior work has also looked at office email communication net-works as a means for finding people. Adamic and Adar found that in an organization of a few hundred people, the organizational hi-erarchy can be used to effectively locate most people using  X  X mall world X  search strategies [1]. They found the email network more efficient than searching a college social networking service, which lacked the same hierarchical clues.
 A fair amount of research focuses on identifying domain experts. A few systems mine users X  public and private activities to infer their expertise [8, 21] or route inquiries [22]. However, users may not want to advertise all their expertise widely, and they may deal with sensitive information that should not be indexed. Managing privacy settings in these systems may be difficult. For this reason we focus here exclusively on publicly available content.
We began by studying how people at HP collaborate. Employ-ees are scattered across myriad sites and business units, making it virtually impossible to know everything going on in the company. Like many global enterprises, employees often find themselves in collaborations spanning departments, which are not formalized in the organizational hierarchy.

A large number of people at HP are experimenting with  X  X eb 2.0 X  services, having become familiar with public social network-ing, bookmarking, and blogging sites externally. These tools, while valuable to employees for personal use, were inappropriate venues for sharing proprietary company knowledge, since they sit outside Table 1: Participation observed in various social media venues at CompanyX. the corporate firewall and users can inadvertently reveal informa-tion to outsiders. When we began studying HP, there were several nascent internal implementations of these services, some started by volunteers in their spare time: a blog server, a bookmarking server, a forum server, and internal versions of Digg and Wikipedia. Be-tween July 2007 and January 2008, thousands of people have con-tributed to these sites; see Table 1 for a rough breakdown. These tools have a few important properties:
Content is internally public. Everything posted is accessible to
Authors are typically identified. In contrast to Web communities
Content is dynamic. Even though many posts are not time-
We found relatively few people using social bookmarking be-cause HP X  X  internal social bookmarking tool is a research prototype not widely publicized. Relatively few people create wiki pages be-cause our sample only covers company-wide wiki servers (intended to serve a similar purpose as Wikipedia), while an untold number of restricted departmental wikis (intended for small-group collabo-ration) exist.

A common concern as this content proliferated at HP is that it became harder and harder to follow them all, and to know where to find it. A new post is published in one of these venues every four minutes; it X  X  intractable for most people to read every one of them. The traditional  X 20 most recent posts X  view offered by most of these sites makes it easy for some posts to get lost in the noise.
A complementary problem is motivation. Interviews with blog-gers revealed lack of feedback and perceived management suppo rt are the primary obstacles to widespread blogging adoption [30]. Without sufficient attention, it X  X  impossible to receive feedback, which is needed to encourage people to contribute to social media.
Lightweight services used to share bookmarks; these services are similar to delicious.com and digg.com .
Services explicitly used to propose and discuss new business ideas.
To explore these issues and gain insight into how people use these social media at HP, we built a Web service called Water-Cooler. Our first goal was to bring together social media from across the company into one place and cross-reference it with the employee directory. We sought to make it easier for people to stay aware of new posts.
We started by aggregating RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds from social media servers across the company: thirteen at first, currently 99. WaterCooler associates posts with timestamps, author, and inferred keywords. It then extracts employees X  names from the free-text author field and maps them into the company LDAP directory, which provides data on their organization, location, management chain, job function, and contact information. The hi-erarchy and attributes provided in the directory effectively boot-strap a social network, automatically providing ways for users to identify people like them.

The advantages to this approach are twofold. First, it X  X  generic enough to encapsulate any content with a temporal component (publish or modification date), so any server that provides feeds can be integrated. Second, it can be done relatively efficiently, since RSS is a lightweight representation of the content; servers supporting HTTP conditional GET can even report that nothing has changed since the last poll, saving bandwidth. The main disadvan-tage is that traditional Web pages are not indexed.
Because attention is finite, readers must be increasingly selective about what they choose to read and how much time to devote to any individual post. Users employ several strategies to choose what to read, including: 1. Novelty : Many sites, such as blog aggregators, present the 2. Popularity : Many sites, such as digg.com and reddit.com , dis-3. By person : Facebook, FriendFeed, Twitter, and other sites 4. By topic : Sites like Technorati and Google News enable users
We used these strategies to guide the design of WaterCooler. The early design goals were to make it easier for people to stay aware of new activity across multiple venues.

Previously the most common view users had of blog contribu-tions was the most recent posts (method 1). WaterCooler provides filtering mechanisms matching methods 2-4: Figure 2: Posts filtered by business group, highlighting the most active contributors on the right.
The WaterCooler Web site is shown in Figure 1. Posts are in-dexed and made available to users, who can filter them by source, organization (see Figure 2), workgroup, job function, author, or keyword. Users can also search for keywords or people. Each filter or results page can also be subscribed to as an RSS feed, so people can construct their own filters by adding several feeds to a desktop newsreader or widget.

Users can read the first kilobyte of text directly in WaterCooler or their newsreader, and click through to the source for the full text. We found this is a nice balance to give users the first para-graph or two of a post as a preview, while not  X  X tealing X  users from the original sites. The decision to rely on other servers rather than reimplementing a blogging platform, a forum, etc. also let us focus on ways to browse and filter content instead of replicating existing functionality. The system tracks clicks on each article to identify popular items, which are promoted to the front page. This provides a subtle form of recognition for people who share useful content. This combination of novelty and popularity is an effective way of attracting collective attention in a news site [28].

The site also shows the most active authors in the company and for any subset of the organization, providing another way, albeit a crude one, to recognize active contributors. When narrowed down to a particular organization or workgroup however, the rankings become a more meaningful barometer of employees X  engagement with social media. WaterCooler also identifies the most common keywords in use recently and presents them as a sort of zeitgeist. Hot topics of discussion across the company show up in the list from time to time, including major product launches, news of merg-ers, and important industry developments.
We made this first version of WaterCooler available to all users at HP and gathered feedback by inviting users to send email and by conducting informal unstructured interviews with people interested in exploring collaboration and social media.

The first test of our popularity filter came unexpectedly and un-fortunately: soon after announcing WaterCooler, wildfires forced the closure and evacuation of one of HP X  X  large sites in San Diego. Individual bloggers reported on the closure and publicized a hastily-created wiki 24 hours before HP updated its official portal page. People used the wiki in parallel with the standard emergency phone trees to let colleagues know they were OK, and to offer shel-ter to displaced employees. The wiki and blog quickly became a forum for employees worldwide to express their support and offer assistance X  X rom as far away as Bangalore.

Links to the relevant blogs and wiki were automatically pro-moted to the front page of WaterCooler, as users started clicking on them within hours of posting. At one point, seven people per hour were discovering these links through the site and clicking on them, despite the fact that the site was relatively new and had only 600 active users at the time. Since then, other major events such as mergers, quarterly announcements, and internal talks by execu-tives have captured the blogosphere X  X  interest and been automati-cally promoted to the front page, validating our approach of using collective attention to highlight salient content.
While WaterCooler began as a simple RSS aggregator, as we deployed it to users and solicited feedback, we found that people wanted to go beyond existing social media services to network and communicate at HP.
A number of people reported that while a feed of an individ-ual user X  X  activities exposes his or her interests and skills implic-itly, they felt they didn X  X  tell the whole story. These users were requesting ways to explicitly describe their professional and per-sonal interests, projects, skills, and products they support. Even ac-tive users don X  X  necessarily write about all their interests and skills regularly. Meanwhile a few distributed teams spanning multiple business units were expressing a desire to form ad-hoc communi-ties in WaterCooler, to get feeds of their members X  posts. Since these teams were not part of the formal hierarchy, the existing or-ganizational filters weren X  X  enough.

We supported both of these needs by allowing people to tag themselves and each other, expanding WaterCooler X  X  reach to peo-ple who don X  X  publish content in any of HP X  X  social media feeds. Tags provide a method to look for people, an additional filter for oneself. documents, and the basis of users X  public profiles. Users can apply tags to anyone, which are then viewable by everyone internally. Be-cause allowing people to tag coworkers can have unintended social repercussions [10], tags are not anonymous; this provides a deter-rent to potential abuse. Users also retain control over their profiles, and can remove tags they feel are inappropriate or inaccurate. Tags show up in a user X  X  profile; see Figure 3.

One design choice we made in contrast to prior implementations such as [10] was to segment tags into distinct namespaces. Suppose a user tags himself with the word Linux . Is this meant to signify that he is interested in Linux? Skilled at it? Working on a project related to it? We X  X  also seen an earlier prototype at HP where personal hobbies like music got lumped in with professional interests like knowledge management , making it difficult to browse tags. Figure 5: People with a given tag can be browsed by business group, job function, and location.

In WaterCooler, all tags fall into the namespaces hobby , interest , product , project , skill , or team , similar to Yee et al . X  X  orthogonal facets [31]. This helps to define the semantic meaning of a tag, although it occasionally results in confusion. We try to ameliorate this by providing auto-complete for tag entry and tag clouds for people to see common examples in each category; see Figure 4. About 30% of all self-tags (people tagging themselves) come from people clicking an Add this tag to me link from a tag directory page, like the one shown in Figure 5.

Users seem split on the tag namespaces. Some find them unnec-essary, while others are clamoring for a more rigid hierarchy. Some users have tried to impose their own structure on tags, for instance, System Area:Security:Expertise . In the future, we hope to explore employing some combination of semantic hierarchy between tags, as with hierarchical facets [31], and implied relationships between tags, as with Sanderson and Croft X  X  subsumption model [25].
We were also surprised to find some people tagging themselves with people X  X  names. These incidences are isolated and these tags are not reused on other people, which may suggest some people want to use WaterCooler as a social network (tagging themselves with the names of their friends). Others have done the inverse, simulating Twitter X  X  follower relationship by tagging people, e.g. , followed by tim , and using the group of tagged people as a filter.
People tags enabled the creation of virtual teams simply by tag-ging everyone with a team tag. This enabled us to do a pilot study on two teams that didn X  X  exist in the employee directory but reg-ularly collaborated. Both teams consisted of roughly 120 people; Team 1 has people in eleven different business units, collaborat-ing together to target a specific market segment, while Team 2 is a subset of a business unit.

We engaged with members of each team charged with improv-ing intra-team collaboration. While leaders from both teams were enthusiastic, they had different experiences in engaging their mem-bers. About three-quarters of Team 1 X  X  members were concentrate d in two sites, but its leader usually works remotely from her home. As a result, the leader tried to encourage her team to collaborate online as much as possible, but she found some team members at these two sites tended to prefer interacting with each other in per-son; they got comparatively less value out of participating in online discussions.

Members of Team 2 as a whole seemed more enthusiastic; they were about four times as likely (18% vs. 4%) to tag themselves ( p &lt; 0.01). Team 2 is more distributed, across eight different time zones, and no site has more than one-seventh of its members. This may suggest that Team 2 derived more value from collaborating with remote colleagues than did Team 1. This may also be evidenced by their leaders X  requests for a sort of  X  X acebook view X  with all their members X  photos on one page, so members could get to know one another personally (and to encourage people to upload photos).
Kiesler and Cummings propose that effective use of distributed collaboration tools depends on group cohesion [18]. Members of Team 1 report into 15 different business units, while Team 2 is all part of the same unit. This may suggest a greater  X  X ocial distance X  between members of Team 1. Another possible explanation may be that WaterCooler is more useful for teams who are less collocated.
Shortly after launching these case studies we implemented mi-croblogging : a lightweight publishing medium where users simply type a line of text in a box to share their status or thoughts, popu-larized by Twitter and Facebook. Team 1 X  X  leader proposed using it for lightweight brainstorming and ideation ( e.g. ,  X  X hat have you done to improve customer experience lately? X ). Other people use it to share recent project milestones, current activities, or their curren t physical location ( e.g. as they travel, go out to lunch, or leave for the day). One software developer suggested these updates could be used as  X  X synchronous request[s] for help X ; he proposed that with in distributed workgroups they could create  X  X ore team cohesion and lead to faster problem solving X .
Not long after we rolled out microblogging on WaterCooler, de-velopers were reverse-engineering the site X  X  AJAX calls to create their own desktop widgets, making it possible to follow the sta-tus of a select group of  X  X riends X  without opening a browser. We fully documented the API (application programmer interface) to support these efforts and see what end users did with our system X  X  data. A program manager started using people tags to track vari-ous stakeholders in a project he was working on across eight dif-ferent business units, and created a tool using the API to visualize tagged people X  X  connections via the organization chart. Another program manager built a component for SharePoint that queries WaterCooler for posts related to specific IT products in use at the company, made possible by the RSS feeds the site provides.
We have had WaterCooler available internally to all HP employ-ees since July 2007. We present here our findings based on observ-ing a year X  X  worth of user behavior and conducting user surveys. Section 5.1 describes the basic demographics of people who used WaterCooler, and in Section 5.2, we present the results of a user survey intended to evaluate users X  reactions. Section 5.3 presents a quantitative analysis of their reading behavior.
The site currently has about 3,000 active users (visiting the site over the past 30 days). While this represents a minority of HP X  X  employees, adoption has been entirely voluntary, driven largely by word-of-mouth and announcements in a few organizations. Also, the vast majority of the content polled by WaterCooler is in En-glish; roughly two-fifths of employees hail from countries where English is not a predominant language; it is unclear whether lan-guage presents a barrier. There may also be localized social media resources in some countries that we are not aware of X  X or instance Japan has its own Japanese-language blogosphere in the company, which most employees cannot read. Indeed, users are fairly well correlated with the number of contributors to social media in each country ( r  X  0.99; p &lt; 0.001) (according to the sources the system polls).

We don X  X  require users to log into WaterCooler, so we have no reliable way to track all visitors to the site. However, we can look at the 1308 current employees who have logged in for a partial view. Users must log in to tag people, update their status, or up-load a photo. These users come from every business group of the company and 55 different countries.

In each category we examine, we compared the number of users we observed with the number we would expect if all employees were equally likely to use WaterCooler. This allows us to report the most statistically significant high-and low-adoption groups. (In-formation on how many people HP has in each group is company restricted, and thus omitted here.) Table 2: WaterCooler usage rates (relative to all employ-ees) from the three most over-represented ( left ) and under-represented ( right ) job functions. N = 1268 (not all users have a job function on record)
As you can see in Table 2, people who work in engineering or marketing are more likely to use WaterCooler than people in sales, finance, or operations. Perhaps these professions lend themselves better to brainstorming, discussion, and knowledge re-use than the comparatively cut-throat or secretive environments of sales and fi-nance ( p &lt; 0.001). Again, this mirrors participation in social media at the company ( r  X  0.95; p &lt; 0.001).
To gather more data on user attitudes and opinions about Wa-terCooler, we launched a Web-based user survey, consisting of both multiple-choice and free-response questions, and advertised it widely, via the WaterCooler site as well as a blog, link servers, a forum, and mailing lists. We offered participants who took the time to provide free-response comments a chance to win a US$ 10 gift card. We received 174 responses from people in 22 countries. This represents 6% of the users visiting in the past month. Table 3: Survey respondents by date they started using Water-Cooler ( N = 160).

At the time of the survey, a substantial number of new employ-ees were joining HP due to a recent merger. As a result, 29% of re-spondents had just started using WaterCooler within the past month (see Table 3). Four respondents also commented that it was useful to them in learning about the new organization and finding their counterparts from  X  X he other side X . A quarter of users reported visiting the site daily, and 70% visit the site every week; several respondents even reported making it their home page.
In comments, several respondents reported using WaterCooler to find people with interests or expertise in specific technologies or initiatives. A handful mentioned specific examples of people, groups, tools, and forums they discovered. A few cited the rank-ings of active authors in a group or in search results for a topic as indicators of expertise. One user even using suggested them as a tool that managers could use in preparing for performance reviews, a proposal sure to be controversial as such rankings indicate the mere quantity of users X  posts, not necessarily the quality.
Sixty-nine percent of respondents report checking the  X  X ecently popular posts X  feed or section of the home page for new content. When they see new items, 56% of them sometimes or usually click through to read them; 20% do so rarely. Two respondents men-tioned they appreciate being able to see  X  X hat X  X  going on in the company at a glance X  this way.
A major theme that emerged was that people use WaterCooler as a way to orient themselves in the organization, and to learn what other parts of the company are doing. Surprisingly, this sentiment was echoed not only by new employees but also by long-time veter-ans. Nine respondents said that the site helped them to understand what goes on at HP, a daunting task due to its sheer scale. Six reported that seeing what people were up to outside their organi-zation was particularly useful. P6 said,  X  X t X  X  so easy to never look beyond my own department, so WaterCooler helps me expand my horizons. X  P17 remarked:
Others report that it makes the company feel a little smaller and more human. WaterCooler  X  X as brought the world closer X , says P90. One respondent mentioned looking up new people he/she has meetings with, to get to know them a little better and enjoyed seeing photos of people to know what they look like while on a phone conference. P171 remarked:
Sixty-one percent of respondents said WaterCooler changed their perceptions of collaboration at HP. Nine specifically reported feel-ing reaffirmed that the company was committed to supporting col-laboration tools across business groups and embracing  X  X eb 2.0 tools X .
A few respondents felt that reading colleagues X  personal unfil-tered opinions and experiences in a casual setting is extremely valu-able, echoing earlier findings such as [16]. P122 writes:
P103 remarks that this free dialogue is particularly comforting in times of economic uncertainty and corporate restructuring:
While our system X  X  open architecture makes integrating with a variety of intranet social media tools possible, it X  X  also a potential source of confusion for some users. Five people said they were con -fused by the loose confederation of social sites WaterCooler sup-ports. Some were conceiving of it as a read-write interface to each of its sources and so were expecting to be able to author content or write comments from directly within the site. The site merely aggregates this content and points people to the host server to read the full version or leave comments.
 Others commented that the lack of visual consistency between WaterCooler and these linked sites was jarring, while still others disliked the standard company intranet template used on one of them. (Users may also have been reacting to the fact that authors can personalize their blog X  X  template, and so no two blogs look alike.) This arises from the fact that the linked sites are maintained by different teams of volunteers, and that there is not yet coordina-tion among them to maintain a consistent look and feel.
By far the most common limit to WaterCooler X  X  utility respon-dents cited is the low penetration rate across the organization; not having  X  X ritical mass X  is a common barrier to groupware X  X  utility [12]. Fifteen people reported disappointment that not many peo-ple are represented either in the media the system polls or the tags and photos on the site itself. Seventeen felt the site should be more heavily promoted through official channels; as a research proto-type, we decided to delay doing this until we could gather feedback and refine its design.

Thirteen people cited a lack of time as a reason they stopped us-ing WaterCooler or feel they haven X  X  explored it to its full potential. A couple noted that their managers don X  X  seem to value their con-tributions to X X  X  online communities. Indeed, 42% of respondents said they weren X  X  sure their managers were aware of their partic-ipation. This echoes previous findings that lack of management support may inhibit participation in internal blogging [30].
Six people reported hesitating to invest time in WaterCooler because it is not yet officially supported by HP X  X  IT department (again, as a research prototype). A couple of them cited a previous volunteer-driven social networking effort that was shut down when its lead developer left the company. While four respondents said they appreciate the fact that it is internally open-sourced, others are reluctant to rely on a volunteer-supported project. These concerns illustrate the importance of organizational support for collaborative software implementations. A few respondents would likely bristle at being forced to adopt this tool, but knowing that the site would have longevity guaranteed by IT support and seeing it promoted widely as an  X  X fficial X  tool would go a long way to encourage adop-tion.

There is wide variation in adoption rates across workgroups and organizations for both WaterCooler and each of the social media venues it polls, as would be expected given their viral growth and limited official adoption. While the diversity of participation from other business units is widely cited as a strength of the site, it may be that finding people like oneself is crucial in determining whether the site is  X  X or me X . Indeed, many of the most enthusiastic users are part of one or more communities that internally publicized it to its members.

A few people expressed a wish for managers to adopt social me-dia as a way to engage with employees. It X  X  no coincidence that Group C X  X  executive vice president maintains an internal blog and it has more bloggers than Group B, three times its size. One mem-ber of Group B complains that managers view blogging as  X  X  social toy with no relevance to business X . This issue is perhaps beyond the scope of this paper, but we believe that WaterCooler can help to change that perspective.
While a number of users specifically reported that they use Wa-terCooler to explore other parts of their organization (see Section (Self-links and out-links from the author have been removed.) 5.2.2), we wanted to quantify this effect and see if the site actually changes users X  behavior. As a control condition, we looked at how people comment on blogs at the company. HP X  X  internal blog server hosts about 3,000 blogs, each of which has its own home page and RSS feed. WaterCooler is only one of several ways users can find blog posts; about 17% of traffic to the blog server arrives from it. People also discover blog posts through links sent in email or found elsewhere on the intranet.

Taking commenting as a proxy for (and subset of) readership, we compared the network of users commenting on each others X  blogs with the network of users reading each others X  posts through Wa-terCooler. For each network we treat people as nodes. We create a directed edge from user A to user B if and only if A commented on a post by B at least three times (or in WaterCooler X  X  case, if A read at least three posts by B) 3 . This filters out accidental clicks or isolated incidents and leaves behind a reasonable indicator of inten-sional and sustained interest by A in B X  X  content. The samples that remain for both networks cover authors and commenters/clickers from each of the company X  X  ten business groups.

Figure 6(a) shows the network of blog commenting, exogenous to WaterCooler, collected over a 16-month period from September 2007 to January 2009 and covering 1,577 bloggers. The graph has a number of isolated components, such as the teal cluster in the lower left, which is a community of people in a workgroup that sustains a team blog; these people comment mostly on posts by colleagues in their group. Green nodes are people from Group C; as mentioned in Section 5.2.5, Group C has a relatively high adoption rate for blogging. The hub in the cluster of mostly green nodes in the lower-right corner is a  X  X roup C Ambassador X  who maintains a blog used to solicit questions for Group C X  X  executives; she enjoys the highest degree of any blogger, but most of her commenters are not engaged with any other blogs.

As a result, we count at most one click from each user on a document. lected over an 11-month period from February 2008 to January 2009. While this is a subset of attention each author X  X  content may receive, it is a comprehensive sample of how the site directs 645 users X  attention. Thus our focus should be on the nodes with out-bound edges, which correspond to users whose reading behavior we have instrumented. This network clearly has a different struc-ture, with a more predominant and densely-connected giant com-ponent.

The most interesting finding from these graphs lies in how indi-vidual users direct their attention. In the blog commenting network, only 30% of the edges from commenters are to authors outside their own business group. But the WaterCooler readership network, 69% of the edges are. We compared these numbers to the numbers we would expect if we had taken the commenters or WaterCooler read-ers and randomly chosen bloggers or authors for them by taking the weighted average where a g is the number of authors in business group g and number of commenters or people clicking in g .

Table 4 shows WaterCooler clicks are much closer to a propor-tional representation of the authors in each business group than blog comments are. 4 This suggests that the site is having a significant

The blog server provides only novelty as a means for discovering new con-tent on the home page, and many users focus on a few blogs they want to read, whether through bookmarking a blog or subscrib-ing to it directly. We believe that providing the additional filtering mechanisms described in Section 4.1.1 helps redistribute users X  at-tention and makes it easier for them to explore blog content from unfamiliar sources. Indeed, a number of our users report using Wa -terCooler specifically to find new people.
Despite the relatively small scale of this study, we believe tools like this hold promise. The behavior we observed among Water-Cooler users offers benefits to them even if they remain a minority of the company X  X  workforce. In this section we offer some lessons learned from this work and directions for future work.
Some key design implications for enterprise implementations we find from this work include:
WaterCooler was designed and evaluated in a large global cor-porate environment. The team case studies in Section 4.2.2 may suggest that its benefits are greater for more distributed teams and organizations. As such, we hypothesize that our findings may gen-eralize to other similar large, geographically distributed organiza-tions, but perhaps less so to small companies whose employees are more collocated; verifying this falls to future work. The availability of internally public media X  X nd presence of people willing to share their knowledge openly X  X s another key prerequisite for the success of a system like this in an organization. More work is needed to see how these tools fare in the face of restricted material, or with users who are only willing to share their resources with a limited group.
Social media like blogs, wikis, and forums present an opportu-nity for an organization to build a distributed knowledge base and increase employees X  sense of connection to the company X  X  initia-tives and to each other. But while empowering thousands of people to share their thoughts and insights can be powerful, the result-ing cacophony of voices can be difficult for knowledge workers to manage. Attention is an increasingly scarce resource, as is users X  time.

In order for an author X  X  time sharing content to be worthwhile, they need to find an audience. In this paper, we have illustrated how WaterCooler can expose posts that might have otherwise got-ten drowned out by the stream of new content, and use collective filtering to amplify popular and novel posts. Other filters enable people to focus their attention on specific topics, groups, or people.
Other enterprise systems, such as [17] and [8], have focused on automatically determining users X  expertise. We have had moderate success with asking users to self-describe their expertise and skills through people tags, though more work needs to be done to find the right level of semantic structure to support this. We also found that exposing blog and forum posts, rather than bookmarks or person tags in isolation, provided a rich source of tacit knowledge for users to search against.

By integrating with a corporate directory, WaterCooler adds a degree of introspectability to a massive organization, letting peo-ple peer into unfamiliar groups and learn how other parts of a large enterprise function, serving as a sort of  X  X rganization explorer X . While anecdotal evidence suggests these tools may have social ben-efits, such as seeing colleagues X  faces or hobbies, this work has so far not explored explicit social networking of the type seen in sys-tems like Beehive [7]. Even without the most basic affordances of social network sites, such as friend or follower relationships, our site appears to encourage users to delve into content and people beyond their group X  X ore so than a simple internal blog platform. It remains to be seen whether the presence of these tools detracts from this exploration, although the ability to focus on the activities of a user X  X  friends is one of the most compelling uses of Facebook and Twitter.

In practice, concerns about whether these types of sharing are a waste of time will present organizational, managerial, and psycho-logical barriers to people diving in and adopting these practices. In a performance-driven culture, it X  X  hard to measure the impact from sharing insights that benefit a distant part of the organization, or derive return on investment from increased  X  X onnectedness X . Mor e work is needed to understand and measure the impact these con-tributions have on an organization. If employees are able to derive some reward from participating in online communities X  X hether it be social capital, self-satisfaction, recognition for their efforts, or a positive impact on their performance evaluation X  X hey will do so, so long as they perceive the likely benefits outweigh the effort re-quired.
WaterCooler is still running and in active use at HP. It is now an internal open-source project, with volunteer developers from across the company (naturally, each member tagged with team Wa-terCooler ) contributing. We plan to address some of the outstanding concerns raised and suggestions made by users, and work on ways to better manage users X  attention. We also want to see if an inter-nal open-source model is a viable means of building a consistently well-designed collaboration infrastructure. We are also studying the data gathered by our system to see to what extent users influ-ence each other in adopting these collaboration tools and knowl-edge sharing behaviors.

The graphs in Section 5.3 show that many users may have spe-cific authors whose posts they follow, which may suggest the util-ity of a Twitter-like follower network to help individual users fo-cus their attention, or recommender systems using collaborative filtering to recommend authors who may be of interest. However, this poses a risk that such targeting might disrupt the chances of serendipitous discovery and make the WaterCooler readership net-work look more like the blog commenting network. The network structure also might suggest particular influencers or community hubs who might benefit from being introduced to distant parts of the network to improve connectivity. This tension between highly focused content (giving users what they know they want) and ex-posure to new, alien content (giving users content they didn X  X  know about) is worth exploring, and parallels the balance between max-imizing the value of individual users X  time and the global opportu-nity for organizations to facilitate new collaborations. Just as peo-ple are more likely to discover new information and opportunities through their weak ties [11], office workers may be more likely to find valuable content from people they don X  X  know.

Another question these network analyses raise is whether the community structure of participants in enterprise social media might identify  X  X onnectors X  between clusters who bridge the gap between communities in an organization, similar to Guimer X  et al . X  X  analysis of air transportation [13]. Such people could be encour-aged or rewarded for helping connect people, although more study is needed to see to what extent these people facilitate collaboration. Kolari et al . X  X  work is a first step in this direction [19]. We thank the early adopters of WaterCooler for their helpful com-ments and support and our survey participants for their feed-back. We X  X e also grateful to the WaterCooler developer com-munity for their contributions. Finally, we thank Sarita Yardi, Anupriya Ankolekar, Yarun Luon, Scott Golder, Tim Chambers, and Bernardo Huberman for helpful conversations.
