 People search for people with suitable expertis e all of the tim e in their social networks  X  to answ er questions or provide help. Recently , efforts have been m ade to augm ent this searching. However, relatively little is known about the social characteristics of various algorithms that might be useful. In this paper, we exam ine three fam ilies of searching strategies that we believe m ay be useful in expertise location. We do so through a simulation, based on the Enron email data set. (We would be unable to suitably experiment in a real or ganization, thus our need for a simulation.) Our emphasis is not on graph theoretical concerns, but on the social characteristics involved. The goal is to understand the tradeoffs involved in the design of social network based searching engines.

For example, you might need help understanding a warning message from a critical application, and y ou're unable to locate a docum ent explaining the message. Or as another example, y ou might need to understand how to work around a specific rule for ordering equipment. In both of these situations, so meone knows the answer to the question. Finding that person, however, can be difficult. Ideally , we would like to find a person who knows the correct answer to that specific problem. Additionally , we would like to ask only the appropriate person and to find a person who has enough free time to answer the question. In reality , of course, answering que stions is not so easy . People are bus y, they m ay lack the requis ite expertis e to ans wer the ques tion, or they m ay lack the s ocial graces to ans wer well. As a first step, y ou may not know whom to ask. Sy stems that help find others with appropriate expertise are called expertise finders or expertise loca tion engines. These have been McDonald and Ackerman [18] as well as the s tudies in Ackerm an et al. [1] . Newer s ystem s, that us e the s ocial network of an organization to help find people, have also been explored, most notably in Yenta [11] , ReferralWeb [15] , ER [18] , and MARS [30] . These sy stem s attem pt to leverage the social network within an organization to help find the appropriate others, thus reducing expertise finders, as requiring sp ecialized data for expertis e location makes adoption difficult at best. Becaus e each of thes e newer s ocial network bas ed expertis e finders uses social network data (which may be derived in a number of way s), we can now move away from research em phas is on the s ystem s and towards an exam ination of the algorithm s us ed to s earch the s ocial networks . This paper survey s three algorithm s in the open literature; it also adds several additional algorithm s. These new algorithm s, as will be s een, have interes ting s ocial characteris tics . The main contribution of the paper, accordingly , is to exam ine thos e algorithms using a simulation testbe d in order to evaluate them and understand their relative tradeoffs . We believe this work is critical if progress is to be made on finding methods and mechanis ms for expertis e location. The paper proceeds as follows : F irst, we s urvey the related research. Second, we introdu ce our simulation experiments, including the data set we used, the algorithms we evaluated, and the perform ance m eas ures we us ed. Third, we describe our analy ses and findings. At last, we discuss the design implications and future work. In this section, we first review the rich literature about searching for people in s ocial networks . Then we exam ine the computational approaches used for finding people in social networks, when the person is know n in advance and when he is not. The more interesting case for us is the latter, since this is the expertise location problem. world X  experiment. In late 1960s , Milgram and Travers found that subjects could s ucces sfully send a s mall packet (with a nam e, the city , and the profession of the recipient on it) from Nebraska to people in Boston [19] [24] . The subjects did so, even though they had only local knowledge of their acquaintances, by passing the target. Travers and Milgram found the average length of acquaintance chain is roughly six. The result of this experiment indicated that the s ocial network is searchable and that the paths linking people are short, the so-called  X  X ix degrees of separation X . A key question in such an experi ment is how people select the next person to whom to forward the packet or message. Potentially each subject has hundreds of acquaintances, but picks one, which ultim ately leads to a short chain between the sender and the target. Later similar experiments found that geographic proximity and similarity of prof ession to the target person were the most frequently used criteria by subjects [16] [6] [9]. Recently , mathem atical models have been proposed to explain why these simple heuristics are good at forming short paths [17] [26] . These models assume that the social network usually has a structure, in which individuals are grouped together by occupation, location, interest, and so on. As well, these groups are grouped together into bigger groups and so forth. The difference in people X  X  group identities defines their social distance. By choosing individuals who have the shortest social dis tance to the target at each s tep, people can gradually reach the target in a short path with only local information about their own im mediate acquaintances . These studies on the small world pr oblem have led to two lines of com putationally -bas ed approaches that concern s earching for people within social networks. Th e first is an autom atization of the small world approach, where the target is known by name or unique identifier [3] [28] . The s econd is locating a person with some specific expertise or knowledge. We consider the latter. In an expertise location or expert finder problem, a suitable person or set of people is not know n in advance. One must be found by matching people against a list of attributes. A number of expertise location sy stems have been developed. For example, Who Knows [23] found people with appropriate expertise by doing latent seman tic indexing of project reports, Yenta [11] found people by searching email archives in a distributed manner, and Expertis e Recom mender [18] us ed locally meaningful data to recommend sets of potential answerers for queries. Other work is survey ed in Ackerman, Wulf and Pipek[1] . Yu and Singh X  X  referral system [30] is, as far as we know, the only paper that explicitly argues for a specific expertise-finding algorithm . In their experim ent, they use the sim ilarity between a query vector and a neighbor X  X  expertise vector, plus some cons ideration of its his torical referring perform ance, as the criteria for picking the next agent in a referral graph. The simulation results using a scientific co-author ship network suggest that this strategy can help people find experts in such a network. Yu and Singh X  X  algorithm is a useful first step, but their approach has lim itations. There are several issues. First, the query vector and expertis e vector in their e xperiment are manually coded; and each is a com bination of preset topics from a taxonom y. This approach is not practical in real world s cenarios : Ques tions are usually extremely detailed, and people cannot be categorized as one specific ty pe of expert. Second, they had only a rudimentary consideration of the impact of the soc ial network structure on the searching process. Finally , and mo st im portantly for this paper, they did not com pare the perform ance of their algorithm with other possible algorithms; thus, the relative benefits and tradeoffs of their algorithm is unknown. Nonetheless, Yu and Singh X  X  algorithm is an im portant ca ndidate for examination. In addition to Yu and Singh X  X  algorithm, several other algorithms can be adapted to the expertis e location problem . Adam ic et al X  X  best connected search (BCS) algorithm [3] [4], which makes use of the skewed degree distribution of many networks 1 , can als o be used to find experts. By passi ng the query to highly connected nodes first, BCS can spread a query quickly in the network. However, Adamic et al. also found that the BCS algorithm is not alway s efficient in all networks . Nonetheles s, Adam ic et al X  X  algorithm may be valuable in m any cases, and we will also include it in our investigation. Breadth F irst S earch (BF S) [21] , which broadcasts a query to every person in a social network, has the strength of finding the closest expert available. But it can have a high cost both computationally and socially in that many people can be bothered. Thus there are three lines of potential algorithm s in the open literature that need be exam ined. To our knowledge, these algorithms have never been evaluated together nor their tradeoffs and social characteris tics exam ined. Thes e s ocial characteris tics include standard attributes of social networks:  X  Connections among people are not uniformly distributed.  X  The connections between two individuals can have different  X  People in a social network vary in their expertise, status, Thes e social characteris tics could lead to s izeable differences in the way inform ation is trans ferred, affecting the perform ance of the searching algorithms. For instance, weak ties have been found to be important in helping peopl e get new information [12] and adopt innovations [7] . In Dodd et al. X  X  small world experiment, successful searches were also found to be conducted primarily through intermediate to weak strength ties. In such a network, many nodes just have one or several links and a few nodes have many links. efficiency , will guide our outcom e m easures. The following section introduces the outcome measures, but only after introducing the experimental testbed and the examined algorithms. experimental apparatus. Second, we describe the data set we used and its limitations. Third, we introduce our new algorithms along with those previously proposed algorithms. Fourth, we describe the sim ulation process and the data we collected. Finally , we des cribe the evaluation criteria we us ed to com pare thes e algorithms. It may seem odd, at first glance, that we would wish to examine the social cons iderations and tradeoffs of thes e expertis e locating (EL) approaches using simulations instead of field or laboratory experiments. However, simulations appear to be a much more fruitful experimental apparatus or testbed for examining these issues. This is unusual for CS CW investigations, and some explanation is required. Constructing well-controlled labor atory experiments of the size required to effectively test thes e algorithms would at best be extrem ely difficult. On the othe r hand, while it might be possible would be uncontrolled. Alternativ ely , Internet subjects would be required to run special appli cations (e.g. em ail m onitoring software or em ail indexing software); this is extrem ely unlikely . Finally , a real organization (of a s ufficiently large s ize) would provide us with enough users and us e. However, we have been unable to convince any large corpora tion to either provide us with ongoing com munication sy stem s. It is unlikely that we will. Accordingly , we exam ined s imulations as a potential experimental apparatus for our i nvestigations. W e felt that the major problem with using sim ulations was the threat to the validity of our results. Sim ulations are often too artificial. Overly rational agents, a small set of experimental categorie s and of agent behaviors (so as to be tractable), and severe lim itations on methods of choice can This is of course not necessarily true -one can look to the insightful simulations of Hutchens or Axelrod [14] [5] . While socially lim ited, their restricted operationalizations have led to insights about cultural production a nd coordination, respectively . In the following work, we have tried to avoid artificiality in two way s. First, we constructed our simulations using a data set from a real organization rather than using artificially or theoretically constructed data. The Enron em ail data set will be discussed below. We also tried to operationalize our outcomes in a manner that was not overly restrictive. Of cour se, any operationalization in an experimental situation must be restricted, if nothing else to be concrete. Our operationalizations , which will also be discussed below, have im plied lim itations and restrictions. We have tried to account for these limitations both in our discussion and by doing the effect of such restrictions. W e discuss these sensitivity analy ses, and where we were unable to do one, below. The simulation data set is the well known Enron email dataset [8] . After cleaning the data, it contains data from 147 employ ees, mostly senior management of Enron. There are a total of 517,431 messages in the data set. To construct a social network, a sub sample of 32766 messages that were exchanged among thes e 147 employ ees was used to construct a directed graph. As s hown in figure 1, the network is a relative dense internal social ne twork with 147 nodes. The density of the network is 0.096, and the av erage shortest path is 2.498. Figure 2 display s the cumulative out-degree 2 distribution of the network. It is highly skewed with some nodes having high degree in the tail. Figu re 2: Cu mu lative Ou t-Degree Dis trib ution of En ron email Second, using a standard docum ent indexing method [29] , we indexed all the m essages that a pers on s ent or received for each of the other 146 users. The indexed result for a single user is a key word vector, in which a key word is weighted by its term frequency inverse document (messa ge) frequency . These indexes are us ed as inform ation profiles for the us ers . By doing this, we get a testbed with a network structure and information profiles derived from a real organization. There are, however, two possible limitations with this data set. First, the sim ulation network is not the com plete em ail social network of the Enron organization. It consists of the management Here we simply use the number of other users to whom a user had sent emails as his/her out-degree. level subset of that network. Com pared to the com plete organization network (which we cannot obtain), this network is likely to be m ore dense with a sm aller average s hortes t path. This is because general em ploy ees usually have a lower probability than managers of knowing people in other groups. Furthermore, managers may have different info rmation profiles (or expertise) than other employ ees, such as engi neers or clerical personnel. To exam ine whether the data set has different properties than the full social network, we constructe d two new networks by removing edges that were weaker than a threshold and by removing high degree nodes. This gave us social networks with different network characteris tics . W e ran the s ame s imulations on thes e two additional networks as a sensitiv ity analy sis; we discuss the impact on the findings below. Second, using this data set to determine expertise may be problematic. A key word in one X  X  email folder does not necessarily mean that one has expertise concerning that key word. This is a limitation of our operationalization: we are assuming a perfect m atch between the inform ation profiles and expertise. Determining an ontology of exper tise and determ ining where it is located in an organization is a significant, ongoing research problem [2] , and we believe this operationalization is a good surrogate. Furthermore, for transactive knowledge, com munication is likely to be an indicator. Accordingly the information profiles are not only an indicator of this aspect of organizational expertise, they serve as an approximation of the location of other ty pes of organizational expertise. We believe that despite these lim itations, the Enron data set gives us a realistic testbed, reducing the am ount of artificiality in the sim ulation. W e will discuss where its lim itations affect the results below. We evaluated total 8 searching strategies from three fam ilies in this sim ulation; include 3 found in the public literatures and 5 proposed based on related theories. They are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Evaluated Algorithms (* indicates algorithms that w e gather or derive locally from their em ail com munications with peers . There may be additional s trategies, such as using people X  X  pos ition in phy sical s pace or in an organizational hierarchy [3] , but inform ation available in the Enron data set lim its us to the ones exam ined in this paper. In any cas e, the s trategies exam ined here are, we believe, the m ost im portant ones to exam ine first. Details of these algorithm s are: Breadth First Search ( BFS) broadcasts a query to all of one X  X  neighbors instead of picking a neighbor according to a heuristic. It can find the target clos est to the s ource but with extrem ely high bandwidth costs (as in p2p file sharing networks). Random Walk Search ( RWS) randomly chooses one of the current query holder X  X  neighbors to whom to spread the query . RWS will be our baseline to determine whet her other heuristics are  X  X etter X  in spreading a query . Best Connected Search ( BCS) is the algorithm Adam ic et al. us ed. The only difference from their algorithm is that we construct our network as a directed network. Social relations are not symmetrical, and it m ay affect people X  X  inform ation s eeking behavior in a social network. In any case the Enron data set has both outgoing and incoming message s. We use out-degree of connectivity ins tead of both in-degree and out-degree in evaluating one X  X  neighbors. Weak Tie Search ( WTS) is proposed based on Granovetter X  X  weak tie concept as discussed above. There are different way s of measuring relationship strength [22] , he re we simply assume tha t a peer who receives the fewes t m essages from a user is a weak tie and will be chosen as the next one to forward the query to. Strong Tie Search ( STS) is proposed as a comparison with WTS. It picks the neighbor who has received the most messages from the current us er. It m ay be a reas onable s trategy in practice becaus e there is usually lower s ocial cos t when one as ks for help through strong ties. Hamming Distance Search (HDS) and Cosine Similarity Search (CSS ) s trategies are two s tructural dissim ilarity strategies based on definitions of structure equiva lence in social network studies [25] . HDS picks the neighbor who has the most uncommon friends from the current user. The definition of Hamming distance [13] favors the nodes with high out-degree. HDS could be viewed as an improved version of BCS . CCS decreas es the high degree impact by dividing the Hamming distance by the total number of out-degree relations (friends) a neighbor has. Information Scent Search (ISS) is extracted from Yu and Singh X  X  algorithm [30] , leaving aside the sociability learning part. ISS picks the next person who has the highest match score (which we call information scent) between the query and his profile. Our implementation of the algorithm is slightly different from Yu and Singh, since we needed to adapt their algorithm to the Enron data set. (Remember that Yu and Singh used only 19 categories or key words.) We use the automatic generated key words profile ins tead. We manually generated 147 questi ons by picking key words from one or several messages from the sent folder of each of 147 em ail users. Each question has three to five key words that do not include com mon words , such as  X  X i X   X  X he X ,  X  X k X , and  X  X nron X . Thus , we as sumed each ques tion has at leas t one expert available in the network. During each round of the sim ulation, a question and an asker are selected at random. Each searching strategy is executed sim ultaneously at each round. The match between a query and a person is calculated in two ste ps: The criterion of a satisfied m atch is calculated by multiply ing the best match score available, whic h is pre-calculated using a global search, with a s atisfaction factor S (S =0.8 here). The general query propagating process is as follows: Note that in step 2, we assum e that each user has knowledge of his direct neighbors X  knowledge or has access to their profiles. It It could reach a dead end or the Tim e-to-live (TTL) of the query message expires. The TTL is set to infinite in this sim ulation. corresponds to transactive memory [27] . It is also the assumption used by Adam ic et al in their s mall world experim ents . The data we collected during each round of the sim ulation include: asker X  X  inform ation s cent on the query , s teps (people used) to complete a query , number of paths tried (how many tim es a query needed to be res tarted), number of people used, and successful because som e nodes are not reachable from som e other nodes, we record the number of search failures as well. After all rounds (N=30,000) are finished, we summarize overall how many tim es a us er has been queried in each s trategy . We then calculate the out-degree and in-degree of each us er. W e used thes e to analy ze their influence on the perform ance of algorithms. Com pared to searching a file in peer-to-peer file networks or searching for a pers on in a s mall world experiment, searching for expertise in social networks is a far more complex process. It involves many more social inter actions. Speed and computational resource are not the only concerns; psy chological and social costs are very im portant. After a s ocial network based expertise sy stem is adopted into an organization, the searching activities will be embedded into people X  X  daily lives. So, an evaluation should not only consider the computational performance per query , but also needs to cons ider the s ocial cons equences of the s trategies . Based on these considerations and related work, besides analy zing the res ult from a com putational efficiency pers pectives , we com pare the s ocial cos t of the evaluated algorithm s using three meas ures : The number of people used per query is the m eas ure Adam ic et al. used in their simulation [3] . It counts how many nodes (people) proces sed the query during a s earch. It is a meas ure of social cos t per query as well as the s peed of the algorithm . W hen s earching for information in social networks , we usually want to bother as few people as possible. If each used person took one unit of tim e to process a query and the query is propagated sequentially , we want the s earch proces s to be fa st and bother the fewest number of people possible. The depth of query chain measure, in m any cases, is equal to the number of people used per query . It becomes different when there is more than one path used for a query . The depth of query chain counts only the num ber of people involved in the final successful path. In real life, less distance also m eans a high probability of getting response from an expert. Labor distribution measures the overall social cost in an organization related to people X  s expertise seeking activities. Different from the people used per query , it counts how frequently a pers on is used by each s earching s trategy (during an entire sim ulation). In this section, first, we descri be the general computation results. Second, we introduce the general findings related to the social cos t m eas ures . Third, we briefly analy ze the im pact of social sensitivity of the results by exam ining two m odified networks. Table 2 display s the overall success rates of the algorithm s. In the table, there are two categories of query failures . The firs t is when there is no path between the as ker and available experts . All the failures in using BFS belong to this category . The second is when the algorithm cannot find available experts even when there are paths. For expertise location, we are prim arily concerned with this type of failure. (The adjusted rate in the table shows the successful rate of a query presumi ng the first ty pe of failure does not occur.) From the table, we can s ee that thes e algorithm s are reas onably successful. They can all find a qualified expert for most of the queries in this network. (Note with N=30,000, all differences are statistically significant. W e om it p-values from our discussion except where im portant.) 
Algori thm BFS Success Ad justed Figure 3 further shows the percentage of successful queries within a given number of search steps us ing the various strategies. As one can s ee in the figure, for diffe rent search lengths, the rank of these algorithm s changes very little. Although HDS and BCS are a little slower than BFS 5 , they are still very fast and successfully finish more than 60% queries, WTS can find 55%, but RWS and STS can only find about 40% within six steps. Note in regarding the speed of BFS, we use the depth of the search ins tead of the num ber of people used in the query . there is much less differe nce among these strategies. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the number of people used per query using the different algorith ms. As the sy ste m be come s le ss com pletely autom atic, this valu e becom es increas ingly im portant to people X  X  us er experience. M eas ures for thes e values are shown in table 3. Compared to the BFS broadcasting, HDS, BCS, and CSS strategies bother many fewe r people. IS S and W TS are als o clearly better. Figu re 4: Dis trib ution of Nu mb er of People used using various Table 3: Number of People us ed using various strategies In Figurer 4, also note that there are a lot of outliers: Som e queries used a lot of people before finding a desired target. Regarding the worst queries, as shown in Table 3, CSS handles them best and BFS handles them worst. Bas ed on thes e res ults, we can s ee that in this network, HDS, BCS, and CSS clearly have advantages over BFS and RWS regarding the number of people used per query . Also, ISS and WTS are better, but less so. Yu and Singh considered ISS to be very promising, but here we ha ve found it less so than HDS, BCS, and CSS. Considering their performance as shown in Figure 3, HDS , BCS , and CS S could be prom ising algorithm s to replace BF S when the s peed and depth of s earching chain are not the m ost important factors while the numbe r of people being bothered is. The other interesting finding is th at STS is obviously worse than WTS. The im plications of this finding will be discussed later. Figure 5 s hows how the depth of the query is dis tributed for each algorithm. This measures how long a query is in the social network; when designing a sy stem, one would like to minimize these values. Except BFS, which we already knew alway s found the closest target, the result is not very different from measuring the number of people used per query . We checked the number of paths tried for the various algorithms (except BFS) and found that most successful queries are finished using only one path. This indicates that at least in this soci al network, there is little need to successful result. This im plied in our dataset, therefore, the two measures of depth of query pa th and number of people used would have the nearly same value. 
Figur e 5: Distr ibution of de pth of que ry chain using var ious Figure 6 and Table 4 show the labor distribution (i.e., how when using BCS, HDS, and CSS, most people are used less frequently , but some users are us ed extrem ely frequently . This indicates that referring is m ainly loaded on very few members of the network. ISS is a little m ore balanced than these three algorithms, and BFS bothers people much more frequently than the other strategies. W e will furthe r discuss what strategies bother people more in section 4.3.1 
Algori thm BFS
Figur e 6: Distr ibution of a use r X  X  fr eque nc y of be ing use d We briefly looked at how different social characteristics influence the perform ance of thes e algorith ms. Based on the findings from the previous section about social costs, we mainly discuss the im pact of two characteris tics of the s ocial network: us er X  X  out-degree and tie strength. Figure 7 display s correlations between a user X  X  out-degree and frequency of being used using various strategies. 
Figu re 7: Correlation betw een a u ser X  X  freq uency of b eing Surpris ingly , out-degree is im portant even when the algorithm s are not explicitly designed with this in mind. This echoes findings regarding the importance of position in networks and node centrality in organizations (e.g., Bu rt [7] ). W e can see that when HDS and BCS are used, the relati on looks close to exponential. People used most frequently are those highly connected people. This is not a surprise, since this is how thes e two algorithm s are defined. More importantly , we check ed the s ocial s tatus of thos e frequently used people and found that the CEO, CIO, and the president of the company are central nodes (or social network hubs). This strongly suggests that if a similar algorithm and system are not totally autom atic, they will not be practical in this organization. CSS is designed to decrease the impact of people X  X  still uses a lot of highl y connected users. As well, there is an interm ediate correlation when using RW S. This indicates that random wa lk is actually not random. As Newman [20] pointed out, nodes with high in-degrees have a high probability of being picked by other nodes in a random walk in a network. We found that there is a correlation between a user X  X  in-degree and out-degree in our network, thus explaining the result here. The cas e of BF S is simila r to RWS. People with high in-degrees also have a high chance being searched during the whole simulation process. An interesting finding is that there seem s som e correlation even when IIS is used. The adjusted r-square is 0.31, p&lt;.001. This indicates that the IIS strategy is not independent from the network structure. For ins tance, people have m ore s ocial connections m ay have more diverse knowledge. This relationship is worth further investigating in the future. There is no clear correlation when W TS and S TS are us ed. As described in previous findi ngs , W TS seem s m ore effective than STS. It s preads a query fas ter and bothers fewer people. To explore the reas on for this difference, we vis ualized the distribution of these two types of ties into two network views, as shown in F igure 8. F rom thes e two views , we can s ee that weak ties are evenly distributed but strong ties form several local strategy usually makes local loops when forwarding the messages. From this point of view, we can see that strong ties are not useful for seeking new information. Howe ver, we noted the m otivational advantages of using strong ties. Any algorithms using strong ties, or thresholds for interpersonal a ssociation, m ay need to cons ider disjoint subgraphs. The other interesting question is: since the different strengths of im pact to other inform ation s earching algorithms? We further discuss this issue in section 4.4.1. As we discussed earlier, the av ailability of high degree nodes and weak ties are im portant for s earching algorithm s we evaluated in this paper. However, different ne tworks will have different degree distributions: the Enron data se t only pres ents a s ingle cas e and it is a very dense social network. Ev en within other social networks, the availability of weak ties is not stable and changes frequently [12] . To evaluate how these algorithm s will accom modate to changes of density and tie strengt h, we carried out two sensitivity analy ses using modified networks . The first redefined weak ties and the other removed users with vary ing out-degrees. We first modified the network by removing ties that had less than 5 messages 6 . The result network is the one shown in Figure 8b (density =0.041, average shortest path=3.435). We then ran the sam e sim ulation on this modified network with the s ame settings . Becaus e of the changed cut point (or thres hold for weak ties), note that the operationalization of  X  X eak X  tie here is not the sam e as in the previous sim ulation. Table 5 shows the successful rate of this sim ulation. As can be seen, compared to original network, about 23% more queries cannot be finished because the network becam e less connected. More interes tingly , as can be s een from the adjus ted rate, there is a clear perform ance drop for RW S, W TS, STS, and IS S. This indicates that RW S, W TS, STS, and ISS are sensitive to weak ties and related network structure changes while BCS, HDS, and CSS are less so.

F igure 9 s hows the changes of average path length of successful queries in the modified network. Com pared to little change in BFS strategy , the changes in HDS, CS S, and BCS are noticeable. We also tried other thresholds for  X  X uts X . A threshold of 5 was selected because it changed the network enough but still kept the network roughly connected. It is also close to the cut point that Adam ic et al. us ed in their s imulation. 
Figure 9: Comparison of average path le ngth of suc cessful Above all, results in this modifi ed network suggest that weak ties are really important informati on channels. They should not be simply ignored in designing social network based sy stems or in doing email based social network analy sis. For the second sensitivity analy sis, we m odified the original network by removing the 10 users who had the highest out-the original sim ulation. In this m odified network, the average shortest path length becam e 2.754 and density becam e 0.076. we find that the perform ances of BCS , HDS , and CS S are not affected at all. Actually , their relative perform ances got better with regard to the adjusted success rates.

This suggests their sensitivity to those highly connected nodes. As well, the performance rank of these algorithms did not change.

A good example is the ISS strategy : While its design does not consider the effect of weak ties (as in Yu and Singh), the removal of weak ties changes its performance cons iderably . Searching within s ocial networks has gained more theoretical support over the last decade with a better understanding of network dy namics and structur e. However, com pared to approaches automatizing the small world problem, we know relatively little about searching for expertise in social networks Searching for expertise is not only affected by the graph characteris tics of the network, s uch as the degree distribution, but interactions and expertise. A human social network is not simply a graph s tructure, it als o includes different s ocial characteris tics . We used a simulation on an organization X  X  email data set, com pared three fam ilies of searching strategies that utilize both graph and s ocial characteris tics of the derived social network, and then explored the algorithm s X  tradeoffs and social characteris tics .
