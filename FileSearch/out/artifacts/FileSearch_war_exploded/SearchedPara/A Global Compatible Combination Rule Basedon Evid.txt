 Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (D-S theory) [2, 17], rapidly gained an exten-sive applications interest for modeling and reasoning with uncertain/incomplete information. When multiple pieces of evidence are collected from difference dis-tinct information sources, it is necessary to combine them to get an overall result. The most famous rule of combination, called Dempster combination rule has been widely used to combine evidences from multiple independent sources. In spite of it, many questions have arisen about the validity and the consistency of this rule when combining high conflicting evidences [1, 13, 26]. This limits the use of Dempster combination rule in applications. In the literatures, many researchers analyze the cause of the counterintuitive behaviors for applying Dempster com-bination rule and proposed some methods to modify Dempster combination rule to counteract the drawbacks [3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 11, 12, 14 X 16, 18, 21, 23 X 25]. an unsatisfactory property: the total true of low support states for the evidence combination. Usually these rules are shown to have a few good behaviors for particular combinations. However, without developing some basic principles that are satisfied by their rules, such rules are usually ad hoc in that they lack any real justification. As pointed out in [22], the pragmatic fact  X  X ur rule works fine X  is of course not a real justification, at most a necessary condition. Moreover, by setting some basic principles for the combination rules, we find that most of the existing models are more or less unsatisfied some of the principles. (More details will be discussed in the related work section.) that should be followed by a fusion process that combines individual distinct and totally reliable evidences. Then after giving a concept of complete conflict , we will construct a global compatible combination rule for D-S theory based on the distance of evidence defined in [10] and the Dempster combination rule[2, 17]. Accordingly, we will reveal some insightful properties of our combination rule. Finally, we will illustrate our method with a numeral example.
 in the following aspects. (i) We analyze general principles for an appropriate combination rule in a reliable information fusion system. It gives a cornerstone to build up a generic axiomatic framework for the integration of heterogeneous information fusion based on D-S theory. (ii) We introduce a global compatible combination rule to combine the overall mass function and solve the Zadehs counterexample. (iii) We show our combination rule can handle different intuitive cases that other rules can not.
 concepts in Dempster-Shafer theory. Section 3 discusses some principles govern the evidence combination processes. Section 4 introduces a global compatible combination rule that obeys the principles to combine evidences. Sections 5 pro-vides a case study to illustrate the use of our proposed combination rule. Section 6 discuss the accommodation of our combination rule for the basic principles. Section 7 discusses the related work. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper with future work. Definition 1 [17] Let  X  be a set of exhaustive and mutually exclusive elements, called a frame of discernment (or simple a frame). Then a body of evidence about the following conditions: Here, the mass m ( A ) ( A  X   X  ) represents how strongly the evidence supports A. And the elements of 2  X  that have a nonzero mass value are called focal elements . combine evidence from multiple sources by using Dempster combination rule . Definition 2 (Dempster combination rule) Let m 1 and m 2 be two mass functions over a frame of discernment  X  . Then Dempster combination function m 12 = m 1 L m 2 is given by: confidence degrees from multiple independent sources in many applications, such as information fusion, pattern recognition, and decision making [20]. But it has been criticized and debated upon some of its drawbacks of counterintuitive com-bination results [1, 13, 26]. The most famous one is Zadeh X  X  counterexample. Example 1 (Zadeh X  X  counterexample) Let m 1 and m 2 be two mass func-tions defined on a frame of discernment  X  = { a,b,c } with the value: m 1 ( { a } ) = 0 . 99 , m 1 ( { b } ) = 0 . 01 and m 2 ( { c } ) = 0 . 99 , m 2 ( { b } ) = 0 . 01 . The application of Dempster combination rule on such two highly conflicting mass functions produces a combination mass function with m 12 ( b ) = 1. So the b option, hardly supported by each body of evidence, turns out to be fully sup-ported after the combination of the two mass functions. And such result is highly violated our intuition about the evidence fusion.
 functions that is proposed in [10] as follows: Definition 3 Let m i and m j be any two mass functions over a frame of dis-cernment  X  . The distance between m i and m j , denoted as d ( m i ,m j ) , is given by: where  X  X  X  m is a vector representation of mass function m ,  X  X  X  m T is the transpose of vector  X  X  X  m , and D = is a ( 2  X   X  2  X  )-dimensional matrix whose element are D ( A,B ) = | A  X  B | | A  X  B | such that A  X   X  and B  X   X  are the names of columns and rows respectively.
 Importantly, for any mass functions m , we have that d ( m,m ) = 0. The evidential distance can effectively indicate the overall influence of different subsets and mass values. Therefore it can better characterize the evidential discrepancy. Finally, based on the definition of distance, the similarity measure Sim i,j between the mass function m i and m j is defined as In order to hold commonalities for the information fusion process based on D-S theory and develop adequate combination rule, in this section, we propose some reasonable principles for the evidence combination. These principles aim for revealing commonalities for general information fusion processes in D-S theory, that specific, appropriate combination rule should satisfy. (i) Neutral Element Commitment : The total ignorance evidence should (ii) Plurality Opinion Support : In general, if a body of evidence is sup-(iii) Zadeh X  X  Counterexample Solved : The new combination rule should be (iv) Convergence toward Certainty : The combination process will produce (v) Invariance of Iterated Indifference Evidence : The combination result (vi) Weak Specialization : Any focal element of the combination mass func-(vii) Local Computation Available : Combining a set of mass functions in evidence will not give us any information about the true state. Therefor, the total ignorance evidence should work as a neutral element that will not enhance or reduce our belief. Formally, for any mass function m 1 over a frame  X  and a mass function m 2 (  X  ) = 1, we have m 1 m 2 = m 1 .
 or sum up individual evidences into a combined conclusion that accommodate the opinions of all related evidences as much as possible. In other words, a set of state that is hardly supported by majority bodies of evidence will not turn out to be a highly support state set in the combination conclusion, while a set of state that is highly supported by relative majority bodies of evidence will not turn out to be a low support state set in the combination conclusion.
 nation rule is acceptable or not. Considering the wise applications of Dempster combination rule, there is not reason for us to accept a new rule that can not solve the main drawback (i.e., Zadeh X  X  Counterexample in Example 1) of Demp-ster combination rule.
 mass value of a  X  X rue X  state should become bigger and bigger when more and more correct evidences are collected. In some extent, such principle can be for-mally defined as follows: let m 1 be a mass function over a frame  X  that satisfies the property:  X  A  X   X   X | A | = 1 such that m ( A )  X  m ( X ) for all X  X   X  , be the combination operator, and m n 1 means combining the mass function m 1 with the combination operator n times, (i.e., m 2 1 = m 1 m 1 , m 3 1 = m 1 m 1 m 1 , ... ). Then, we have m n 1 ( A ) &gt; m n  X  1 1 ( A ).
 theory with evidence combination in D-S theory. That is, if all evidences are obtained by the principle of indifference over a same frame of discernment, the combination result of such evidences should infer the same conclusion as each evidences. Formally, for the sixth principle, we have: let  X  = { s 1 ,...,s n } be a frame, and m 1 ( s i ) = m 2 ( s i ) = 1 /n ( i = 1 ,...,n ) be two mass functions over the frame  X  . Then we have m 1 m 2 = m 1 .
 increases. That is, the combination result should give us more precise information about the question of consideration than the evidences themselves. And the meaning of precise will be judge by the specific of the body of evidence. In [19], they require if a body of evidence is supporting A ( A  X   X  ), then after we get new evidence, m ( A ) must be reallocated to more specific subset of A ( X  X asses flow down X ). And such transfer of masses is called a specialization. Although the concept of specialization indeed catches the essence of precise information, it does satisfy the fifth principle about convergence toward certainty. Since the combination result is a reallocation of mass value to more specific subset, for a mass function that m ( A ) = 0 . 8, m ( B ) = 0 . 2 ( A,B  X   X   X  A  X  B =  X  ), no matter how many evidences with the same mass function are collected, the combination result will not assign a higher value for element A than 0 . 8. So, we think such concept of specialization is too strong to handle the combination of conflict mass functions. Thus, we propose a weak version of specialization that: the focal elements of the combination result are the more specific subsets of the union set of all focal elements for all evidences.

 nation rule in cases where many multivariate belief functions are given (hun-dreds or thousands). It requires the combination rule to satisfy the properties of commutativity and associativity. That is, given a combination operator , for any mass function m 1 , m 2 , and m 3 , we have m 1 m 2 = m 2 m 1 and ( m 1 m 2 ) m 3 = m 1 ( m 2 m 3 ). The basic principles for the combination rule in D-s theory, proposed in the previous section, is a set of constraints for the information fusion frameworks. It can be instantiated in different ways. We discuss one global compatible evidence combination rule in this section that satisfies these principles.
 some extent, the process of evidence combination in fact is a reallocation of mass value of the evidences into the more special subset of their focal elements. As a result, in case of two mass functions, such idea of combination in fact is a proportional conflict value redistribution. Unfortunately, as pointed out by [7, 22], if the combination process is based on the pairwise comparison as Dempster combination rule does, it will violate the property of associative and hence violate the principle of local computation available. At the same time, we find that the cause of the counterintuitive behaviors in Dempster combination rule is the complete conflict of some mass functions. Here, complete conflict means that for two mass functions, there exists a focal element of a mass function, such that the intersection of it and any focal element of another mass function is a empty set. In other words, since for two bodies of evidence, one claims that some states are possible while one claims that such states are impossible, a complete conflict judgement is caused for them. As a result, since we cannot distinguish which claim is true, we prefer to remain such conflict elements by the weights of them in all collected evidences. And the definition of a complete conflict set can be formally defined as follows: Definition 5 For a mass functions set M = { m k } ( k = 1 ,...,n ) over a frame  X  , let F k be the focal elements set of a mass function m k . Then C M  X  2  X  is a complete conflict set about the mass function set M if and only if for any A  X  C M , we have Here, by Equation (1), we can infer that the combination mass value for any subset of each A  X  C M is zero by applying Dempster combination rule. In other words, it means no matter how high of the mass value m i ( A ) and how many mass functions in M considered A as a focal element, if such subset A is complete conflict (i.e., A  X  C M ), the combination result of Dempster combination rule will still rule it and its more special subsets out to the set of the possible state. And we think these is the reason that causes the counterintuitive behaviors. process as a two-stages information fusion. In the first stage, we combination all collected evidences by the Dempster combination rule. After that, we go into the second stage. In this stage, we will redistribute the combination mass value based on the weight value of the complete conflict elements obtained by the concept of evidence distance [10]. Since the redistribution process is after the combination of all related evidences and such process remains the conflict elements, we call such combination rule as a global compatible combination rule .
 formal definition of the weight value of each subset of the frame for combination value redistribution inspired by the method in [25].
 Definition 6 For a set of mass functions M = { m k } ( k = 1 ,...,n ) over a frame  X  , let Sim i,j be the similarity measure between any two mass functions m i and m j , where m i ,m j  X  M . Then the weight value of a subset A  X   X  over defined by: mass function m i compared with all other mass functions belongs to M . So, in some extent, it shows the support degree of the body of evidence revealed by m i in the evidences set M . That is, the higher value of similar of the mass function m i with other mass functions in M . Therefore, it means more mass functions in M support the claim of mass function m i about the mass value distribution. Hence, by bility of a mass function m i over a set of evidence M . Here, the credibility degree shows the relative importance of the collected evidence. Finally, by combining the credibility of each mass function and the support degree of any subset A  X   X  in each mass function m i  X  M (i.e., m i ( A )), we can obtain the weight value os each subset A  X   X  over all related mass function. Here,  X  M ( A ) means that after considering the credibility of each mass function as well as the support degree of A in each mass function, we can give a composite evaluation about the weight of a set A  X   X  supported by all collected evidence in M . Finally, by Definition 1, we can obtain  X  M (  X  ) = 0 and by Definition 3 and Equation (3), we have P A  X   X  after considering all collected mass functions, in some extent, it supports our claim that the counterintuitive behaviors is caused by the complete conflict mass function) has some support degrees should not be assigned zero in the combination result without any weak specialization.
 Dempster combination mass value. Formally, we can define our global compatible evidence combination rule as follows: Definition 7 For a mass functions set M = { m k } ( k = 1 ,...,n ) over a frame  X  , let L M be the value of combining all mass function in M by the Dempster combination rule,  X  M ( A ) be the weight value of a subset A  X   X  over M , and C
M be the complete conflict set of M . Then the mass function m M that results from the application of global compatible combination rule for a mass functions set M is given by: where  X  M is the compatible redistribution value defined as 1 and m M (  X  ) = 0. In other words, the function defined in Definition 7 indeed satisfy the requirement of mass function in Definition 1. And Equation (5) means that in case of complete conflict exists, the Dempster combination result will discount based on the complete conflict set weight  X  and the mass value of the complete conflict subset will be redistributed based on the weight value the number of elements in a set A to redistribute the mass value. Finally, the intuition of this definition is that in the combination process, we will remain the complete conflicts judgement and update the partial consistent judgements of the related evidences to more special judgements based on the supporting weights of them. Therefore, for the combination result, it includes two parts: the value of partial consistent judgement and the global compatible mass value of conflicting judgement. In this section, a fictitious example is illustrated to show the use of the proposed combination rule. In a multiple sensors target recognition system, suppose the system has collected five bodies of evidence M = { m 1 ,m 2 , m 3 ,m 4 ,m 5 } from five different sensors and the set of possible targets are  X  = { a,b,c } . And the mass functions that represented such evidences can be shown as follows: First, by Equation (1), we have 5 and obtain that C M = {{ a }} . 1 Since the complete conflict set is not an empty set, we need to considering the redistribution of the combination result by the weight value of each subset of the frame. Hence, the similarity measure of any two difference mass functions can be obtained by Equations (2) and (3) as follows:  X  In this section, we will show that our new combination rule satisfies the principles that we proposed in the previous section.

 parts, one obtained by the discounting Dempster combination rule, one obtained by the weight values defined in Definition 6. Then, by Definitions 2 and 6, we can find the our rule satisfies this principle directly. reserve the properties of commutativity and associativity after the two-stages combination process, we must notice that the computation complexity of our combination rule is heavily determined by the first stage, which satisfies the property of commutativity and associativity. Moreover, in case that the complete conflicts set is empty such desirable properties are preserved in the proposed method. So, in some extent, we partial satisfies the seventh principle. In general, there are three major types of viewpoints on the modification of Dempster combination rule to solve Zadeh X  X  counterexample.
 validity of the combination rule, especially the way to deal with conflicting mass assignments. It relates to two issues about Dempster combination rule. (a) How to assign the conflicting mass assignments: Yager [24] suggested the conflicting mass assignments should assign to the universal set of the frame of discernment. And several types of proportional conflict redistribution rules based on different criterions were reviewed in [18]. Lefevre et al. [11] made a unified model to handle conflict evidence by a weighting factors to determine how conflicting masses are to be distributed among the subsets of the frame of discernment. However, as pointed out by [7, 22], such operators is not associative. Since associativity means that the order under which the combination is performed is irrelevant, without such property means the method can not be used in a framework of local computations. (b) Whether it is reasonable to apply conjunctive rule as Dempster combination rule for information fusion. Therefore, a combination rule which is based on the disjunctive rule is proposed by Dubois and Prade in [5]. However, the disjunctive rule is not associative. In [18], an extended frame for evidence theory called Dezert-Smarandache theory (DSmT) was proposed to solve the high conflicting problem, but the computation complexity is heavier, and when under the condition of low conflicting, the result inferior to Dempster-Shafer theory [3].
 the questionable evidence reliability caused by any disturbance or the maintain condition of the information sources. Some methods construct the discounting mass function to the original evidences were proposed [6, 17, 21]. It including the classical discounting mass function and discounting by convex combination of sources. However, these methods have the following limits: (a) it requires an additional parameter to solve the problem; and (b) it does not indeed solve the criticism of Dempster combination rule, since we still want to make the informa-tion fusion in case that both evidence are full reliability. Murphy [14] averaged the conflict evidence and then combines the averaged evidence itself several times by the Dempster combination rule. Deng [25] implemented a similar combina-tion method as Murphy based on weighted average of evidences. However, such methods will cause another counterintuitive behavior, since the original mass function will change when combining with a total ignorance mass function in these methods. Therefore, they violate the first principle.
 that the frame of discernment is exhaustive. However, in some real-world ap-plications, sometimes the system is in open world where our knowledge is not completed. Therefore, Smet proposed a modified method [21, 23] assigns the con-flicting mass assignments to empty set with the assumption that the true state might not be any of the alternatives listed in the frame of discernment (i.e., an open world assumption). And Deng [3] extended D-S theory to a more gener-al form with such an open world assumption. Unfortunately, such open world assumption has some drawbacks as well: (a) it still does not give a reasonable solution for the information fusion in case that the decision maker assures the frame of discernment is exhaustive; (b) the idea to assign all conflicting mass assignments to the unknown state sometimes violates our intuition. For example, if we have two distinct and totally reliable sources providing two mass functions m mass functions will assigns to the empty set as 0 . 8. In other words, such model violates the fifth principle. In this paper, we introduced the basic principles to handle the evidences combi-nation in D-S theory and proposed a global compatible combination rule based on evidential distance and the concept of complete conflict to instantiate such principles. We also give a numerical example to illustrate the use of the pro-posed combination rule. Our next step of work is to build up a general axiom framework for the evidence combination process and test such framework with some information fusion data, such as intelligence surveillance system data.
