The explosion of the web has made search an integral part of our daily lives. We search for almost any conceiv-able topic. Web search engines have made search easily ap-proachable to almost everyone. Yet, for information profes-sionals it is more important than ever before to know  X  X ow search works X  in order to be more effective in their work. Search Engines or Information Retrieval (IR) Systems of-ten appear to searchers as  X  X lack boxes. X  There is some sort of magic that happens between typing some keywords in a query box and getting back results. This approach con-tributes to the development of inadequate conceptual mod-els of search.

The IR-Toolbox[2] is an experiential teaching tool for learn-ing the processes of information retrieval systems. Through hands on interaction, the IR-Toolbox helps students develop their conceptual model of search engines by exploring, vi-sualizing, and understanding IR processes and algorithms without needing to program. In a iterative fashion, the IR-Toolbox presents the following processing steps: 1. Document analysis (e.g., tokenizers [letter, white-space, 2. Indexing (e.g., ability to browse the inverted file and 3. Searching (e.g., ability to enter queries and select weigh-4. Evaluation (e.g., evaluate results using the TREC eval-The IR-Toolbox uses Lucene as its underlining search en-gine. Lucene is an open-source, full-text search engine li-brary written in Java and is supported by the Apache Soft-ware Foundation[1]. Students can interact with the IR-Toolbox at different levels of complexity on individual or group exercises that help them understand the different IR processes and build a more detailed conceptual model of search engines. Though the IR-Toolbox is designed for the non-technical students, those students with programming interests can access Lucene X  X  code and get a more technical view of the system.
