 In recent years, Web services standard s and technology are getting popular, especially among researche rs, practitioners, and developers. Web services is a general framework that expedites the sharing of heterogeneous data and soft-ware resources dispersed on the Internet [1]. The standard-based resource shar-ing and platform-neutral characteristics of Web services have motivated many organizations to apply the technology in diverse areas, such as supply chain man-agement, virtual enterprise, homeland def ense, e-government, and e-business [1]. Consequently, there are high demands for supporting Web services in various IT-solutions. Business Process Management System(BPMS) is one of such solutions to be deployed in Web services environm ent. In this paper, we introduce Web-Vine BPMS solution meeting such require ments. Major features and components of WebVince BPMS are explained in terms of their goals and functions.
The origin of WebVine is a Workflow Management System(WfMS), which handles diverse forms of business processes. WfMS is a backbone for integrating human resources and software or system services that participate in a business process. For more efficient control and monitoring of the integration of appli-catons and services, WebVine adopts a Hub-and-Spoke scheme. But WebVine accomplishes a much more sophisticated way of integration by supporting and adopting Web services technologies.

Besides, WebVine facilitates construction of ontologies for organizing pro-grammable resources. Applications, ser vices, and processes can be organized by applying ontology technology and the constructed ontologies can be used in designing new processes [4]. By incorporating ontologies, WebVine realizes a semi-automatic process modeling, in which WebVine recommends connectable precedent or successive services when a des igner highlights a service in a process. As stated earlier, WebVine is unique in the sense that it supports semi-automatic process modeling by incorporating ontology technology, and it is equipped with a variety of special functions to improve the reusability of applications and services in a specific domain area. Though WebVine has several unique features, WebVine are not missing general features and functions as BPMS. In the following, we describe some other noticeable features of WebVine:  X  WebVine supports all hardware platforms on which Java Virtual Ma- X  WebVine supports various system architectures. According to situations,  X  WebVine provides facilities for specifying exceptions that would be raised  X  WebVine supports relaxed transaction management by providing a rollback Fig. 1 shows four major components of WebVine suite; Business Process Modeling Tool(BPMT), BPMS engine, e-Business Application Integration(eAI) Framework, and Dynamic Service Coordinator(DSC). WebVine BPMT provides graphic user interfaces for the design of business processes and BPMS Engine enacts the designed business process. WebVine BPMS engine also manages a lifecycle of a process from the creation to the end of the process. WebVine eAI Framework expands a coverage of BPM Engine into B2Bi area beyond enterprise boundary [3]. As we have explained earlier, the WebVine DSC enables users to construct ontologies for organizing programmable resources and supports dy-namic service coordinations. 3.1 WebVine BPMT WebVine BPMT provides fucntions and facilities for modeling business pro-cesses. The following is brief descriptions on the functions:  X  Assign a participant. The participant is not necessarily to be a human re- X  Specify transitions that link between steps. A transition may either be un- X  Specify the type of a step. WebVine has five different types of step; route  X  Support a check-in/chech-out and provide a version control mechanism for
Several functions are derived from above basic functions. Exporting and importing process models are derived functions. Especially WebVine BPMT supports diverse business process specifications standards. WPDL/XPDL, BPEL4WS, WSDL, and ebXML are the standards supported by WebVine BPMT. 3.2 WebVine BPMS Engine and WebVine eAI Framework WebVine BPMS engine is a core module in providing Workflow Enactment Ser-vice in WfMC Reference Model. A designed process on WebVine BPMT is ac-tually enacted by WebVine BPMS engine. Besides, for the manage of process instances, BPMS engine has many internal functions. An interface layer is pre-pared for the access of the functions, and the rest components of WebVine access or call the functions through the interface layer.

WebVine eAI Framework is another core software infrastructure that enables companies to take flexible and extensible approach for interoperations among enterprise applications, such as ERP, CRM, SCM, and SAP etc. WebVine eAI Framework supports the sharing of heterogeneous data and software resources across organizational boundaries. 3.3 WebVine DSC WebVine DSC facilitates the construction of ontologies for organizing pro-grammable resources base d on Semantic Web. According to users X  purpose and domain knowledge, diverse forms of ontologies can be constructed and organized. The constructed ontologies are fed back into DSC for more powerful usages such as designing new processes. By incorporating ontologies, BPMT, BPMS engine and DSC realizes a semi-automatic pro cess modeling and reconfiguration for an active process. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between WebVine DSC and other WebVine components. In this paper, we have introduced WebVine Suite. In summary, WebVine Suite is a BPMS solution on Web services standards and technology. Many functions and services of WebVine can be deployed in the form of Web services. WeVine provides facilities to coordinate services which are distinguished from those of other conventional BPM solutions. DSC, which supports dynamic composition of Web services, and semi-automatic pro cess modeling are the examples of such unique features.

In future, we are planning to apply WebVine Suite in developing complex applications that accessing remote services in real fields. Mobile e-health appli-cation development using WebVine Suite is one of our current activities.
