 In this pap er we pro vide a summary of the workshop on The-ory and Practice of Temp oral Data Mining held in conjunc-tion with ACM SIGKDD 2006, on August 20st in Philadel-phia, Pennsylv ania, USA. We rep ort in detail about the re-searc h issues addressed in the talks at the workshop. Man y real-w orld applications deal with huge amoun ts of temp oral data. Examples include alarms/ev ents and per-formance measuremen ts generated by distributed computer systems and by telecomm unication net works, the web serv er logs, online transaction logs, nancial data, work o w pro cess logs, and sensor data collected from sensor net works. Con-ventionally , temp oral data is classi ed to either categorical event streams or numerical time series and both types have been intensiv ely studied in data mining and statistics. How-ever, sev eral previously less emphasized asp ects of temp oral data have pro ven their imp ortance in emerging applications and posed sev eral challenges calling for more researc h. In addition, the applications of temp oral data analysis, suc h as web services, information navigation, system managemen t, adaptiv e work o w managemen t, program beha vior analy-sis, securit y managemen t and bioinformatics, are enjo ying a gro wing amoun t of atten tion. This workshop aims to gather researc hers and practitioners to tackle these challenges and attempts to study the common tasks that need to be ad-dressed in practical applications.
 The setting of traditional temp oral data analysis is to apply one algorithm on a static, regular and relativ ely small tem-poral data set. Man y practitioners found existing analysis metho ds inadequate for their real-w orld data. Man y strug-gle to transform the data in order to apply existing metho ds or even to reduce the original problems to better studied ones; either ways induce in more prepro cessing e ort, more arti cial parameters and less interpretable results. We be-liev e these new asp ects of temp oral data deserv e theories and algorithms of their own. Some of these new asp ects are: Driv en by the new asp ects of temp oral data, sev eral funda-men tal problems need to be revisited. Just to name a few of them: Prediction , Corr elation , Regression , Benchmark-ing , Perio dic Pattern Mining , Temp oral Asso ciation Finding Causality Analysis , Sequential Event Patterns , Thr eshold se-lection Frequency Analysis , and Anomaly Dete ction . We wish to re-establish the platform for exc hanging ideas in the eld of temp oral data mining by organizing workshops. We have successfully organized two temp oral data mining workshops in 2004 and 2005 with IEEE International Con-ference on Data Mining (ICDM). To con tinue this tradition of fostering interactions among researc hers sharing the same interest, we organized the KDD 2006 workshop on The ory and Practic e of Temp oral Data Mining (TPTDM 2006) . In particular, the workshop aims to bring together researc hers from both industry and academia with div erse bac kgrounds: data mining, mac hine learning, database, statistical analy-sis, and application kno wledge to foster interactions, to pro-pose new ideas, to iden tify promising technologies, to create a forum for discussing recen t adv ances, to better understand the practical challenges in applications, and to inspire new researc h directions.
 The program of the workshop included an invited talk by Prof. Jian Pei from Simon Fraser Univ ersit y and six re-searc h pap er presen tations. The on-line pro ceedings of the workshop is available at http://temp oraldatamining.com/TDM-2006.h tml. In his invited talk titled \Mining Temp oral Orders from Event Sequences", Jian Pei (Simon Fraser Univ ersit y) dis-cussed the problem of nding partial order of events. He ask ed two questions: i) How to mine ordering information? and ii) How to represen t ordering information succinctly? He answ ered the rst question by a two-step algorithm. Step 1 of the algorithm is to nd all non-trivial closed sequen tial patterns, and step 2 is to ensem ble frequen t closed partial orders using closed sequen tial patterns. He addressed the second question by using the Frecpo Framework whic h rep-resen ts a partial order uniquely as the set of edges in its transitiv e reduction. All edges in a set can be sorted in the alphab etical order or any global order. The Frecp o Frame-work has the follo wing adv antages 1. Mining in transitiv e reduction to avoid substan tial space 2. Directly extracting frequen t closed partial orders in 3. Aggressiv ely and progressiv ely pruning futile branc hes In summary , Pei concluded that mining frequen t ordering information from sequences is interesting with man y appli-cations; Mining frequen t closed partial orders is also a chal-lenging mo deling problem. The metho d presen ted is an ad-equate solution to the problem. The talk is join t work with H. Wang, J. Liu, K. Wang, J. Wang, and P. S. Yu. Nan Jiang and Le Gruen wald (Univ ersit y of Oklahoma) pre-sen ted their work on online data stream mining. Comparing to the more studied problem of mining frequen t closed item-sets whic h are mainly intended for traditional transaction databases and thus do not tak e data stream characteristics into consideration. They prop osed a novel approac h for min-ing closed frequen t itemsets over data streams. It computes and main tains closed itemsets online and incremen tally and can output the curren t closed frequen t itemsets in real time based on users speci ed thresholds. Exp erimen tal results sho w that the prop osed metho d is both time and space e-cien t with good scalabilit y.
 The follo wing talk was by Fabian Morc hen from Siemens Corp orate Researc h. Allen's 13 relations has been the de facto represen tation of temp oral interv als. Morc hen pointed out sev eral dra wbac ks of the mo del including i) not robust against noise, ii) ambiguous for similar patterns, and iii) require length y descriptions for the relationship among mul-tiple interv als. Morc hen prop osed an alternativ e represen ta-tion TSKR (Time Series Kno wledge Represen tation) using Chor ds , a notion borro wed from music theory . TSKR is not robust and unam biguous, exp erimen ts sho ws it is very terse for describing relationship among multiple interv als. Tamraparni Dasu, Deb orah F. Swayne and David Poole (AT&amp;T Labs Researc h) presen ted their work on group-ing multiv ariate time series. Muc h work has been done on time series clustering. The goal of this pap er is very spe-ci c: grouping massiv e multiv ariate time series. A metho d-ology con taining prepro cessing, nonparametric summaries, and clustering is discussed. The performance of the algo-rithm is particularly impressiv e.
 Wolfgang Jank, Galit Shm ueli, Shanshan Wang (Univ ersit y of Maryland) deliv ered a talk drew the most atten tion ti-tled Dynamic, Realtime Forecasting of Online Auctions via Functional Models . The study is to predict the 7th day -nal auction price on eBa y by observing the bidding history on the rst 6 days, then applying functional data analy-sis. The mean absolute percen tage error of the prop osed dynamic mo del is about 5% (with a standard deviation of 12%) at the auction-end, in comparison to 40%using exp o-nen tial smo othing (standard deviation of 19%). Most au-diences have since been busy using the metho d to mak e a killing on eBa y.
 The last talk by Jan Ramon (Dept. of Computer Science, K.U.Leuv en) describ ed his work on applying temp oral data mining in the health-care Industry . He discussed sev eral issues and possible approac hes for predicting evolution of critically ill patien ts. The goal of the study is to better plan and allo cate medical resources to meet patien ts' need.
