 1. Introduction
Many real-world engineering planning and management pro-blems lie within a class of wicked problems ( Rittel and Webber, 1973 ), which are de fi ned as social and cultural problems that challenge solution due to incomplete data, the presence of diverse stakeholders and perspectives, large economic burdens associated with implementing a solution, and interconnections with other social and cultural problems. The objectives of a wicked problem are typically incomplete, contradictory, and changing. This is because wicked problems involve stakeholders with a diverse set of perspectives based on, for example, environmental, economic, Some objectives are not formulated de fi nitively; instead, these goals are evaluated through subjective judgments and cannot be represented mathematically as part of an optimization model ( Liebman, 1976 ). Objectives may change and evolve in the decision-making process as stakeholders interact with a set of design options and re fi ne their preferences. The design and management of civil engineering infrastructure, such as urban water supply systems, wastewater services, and transportation networks, are wicked pro-blems due to the large number of inve sted stakeholders, including a community of consumers that is served by these infrastructure systems.

To address the con fl icting nature of multiple objectives pre-sented in wicked problems, decision-making can be aided through identifying a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, which provides the ability to explore the trade-off among con fl icting interests ( Steuer, 1986 ; Weise et al., 2009 ). Many multi-objective approaches have been developed to ef fi ciently identify a set of non-dominated solutions using classical mathematical formulations and heuristic search techniques, including evolutionary algorithms (e.g., Zitzler and Thiele, 1998 , 1999 ; Deb et al., 2002 ; Chiong, 2012 ). These techniques, however, use narrow de fi nitions of Pareto-optimality, which can provide only a limited solution approach for public sector and social value problems, as mathematically optimal solutions may specify impractical decisions and ignore important sociopolitical issues. Multi-objective optimization approaches can be readily applied for the solution of problems that have goals that are modeled mathematically and known at the initial formulation of the problem, but these methods may be limited in their application to and solution of wicked problems.

A new methodology is developed here to address both the presence of con fl icting goals and goals that are not mathematically modeled in engineering problems. A new multi-objective evolu-tionary algorithm, the Multi-objective Niching Co-evolutionary
Algorithm (MNCA), is developed and demonstrated here. MNCA is based on the Modeling to Generate Alternatives approach ( Brill and
Downey, 1979 ; Brill et al., 1990 ), which provides an optimization model for generating alternative solutions to yield new insight and options for wicked problems. MNCA is designed to fi nd diverse options for multi-objective management problems by identifying distinctly different alternative sets of non-dominated solutions.
Alternative sets are located in a different region of decision space and have similar performance in achieving Pareto-optimality.
In contrast to existing multi-objective optimization algorithms that identify a single set of Pareto-optimal solutions, MNCA can be applied for gaining insight to the solution of wicked problems;
MNCA is designed to identify distinct sets of solutions in order to provide new information about the fl exibility of decision options in areas of interest within the trade-off curve. This solution approach can be used to assist managers in selecting decisions and gaining insight about solution characteristics.
 mework, Evolutionary Algorithm to Generate Alternatives (EAGA) ( Zechman and Ranjithan, 2004 , 2007 ), which identi fi es an array of alternative solutions for single-objective problems using a set of subpopulations. MNCA uses subpopulations to converge simulta-neously to several sets of solutions that approximate the Pareto front, and these sets are maximally different in decision space from other subpopulations of solutions. MNCA is demonstrated here to identify alternate sets of non-dominated solutions for a suite of real-valued test problems. 2. Problem formulation to generate distinct sets of non-dominated solutions Maximize Z i  X  f i  X  X  X  : i  X  1 , ... , M  X  1  X 
Subject to g j  X  X  X   X  b j : j  X  1 , ... , C  X  2  X  variables, and M is the number of objectives. Similarly, g is the number of constraints. Solution of a multi-objective problem identi fi es a set of non-dominated solutions, where solutions are de fi ned as non-dominated if no solution exists that is better with respect to all objectives; one objective cannot be improved without loss of quality in one or more objectives. A set of non-dominated solutions should be identi fi ed that lies on or close to a true Pareto front, and solutions should be distributed uniformly across the
Pareto front to provide coverage of representative solutions. For example, Fig. 1 (a) shows a non-dominated front for a simplistic multi-objective problem and the corresponding location of solu-tions in decision space.

A set of studies have explored a secondary problem formula-tion for multi-objective problems that emphasizes diversity in decision space for a set of non-dominated solutions ( Toffolo and Benini, 2003 ; Deb and Tiwari, 2005 ; Ulrich et al., 2010 ; Shir and
Beck, 2009 ). The motivation for the problem formulation is that a decision-maker may be interested in not only high diversity of solutions in the objective space, but also high diversity of solutions in the search space, or decision space ( Deb and Tiwari, 2005 ).
An additional objective may be included in the problem statement to maximize a metric that represents diversity in decision space. For example, Shir and Beck (2009) created a metric based on the decision space distance between all pairs of solutions in a non-dominated set. The decision space diversity is an average of the distances between pairs of non-dominated solutions and can be maximized in identi fi cation of a diverse set of non-dominated solutions. Fig. 1 (b) shows a set of solutions that are non-dominated and located in diverse regions of the decision solutions are found in more dissimilar regions of the decision space and represent a set of options that could be selected by a decision-maker.

A new problem statement is posed here for multi-modal multi-objective wicked problems. This problem statement is based on the Modeling to Generate Alternatives approach, which was developed to identify a set of solutions that perform well for a single modeled objective and provide a set of diverse solution
X
F characteristics ( Brill and Downey, 1979 ). The Modeling to Generate Alternatives paradigm allows a small amount of degradation in modeled objectives to afford fl exibility in identifying solutions. Solutions are sought that are different in design decisions, with the expectation that they may perform well for unmodeled objectives. To create a Modeling to Generate Alternatives model, the formulation of an optimization model can be modi fi ed to search directly for maximally different solutions while maintain-ing a targeted fi tness value on original objective functions, which will ensure that solutions are acceptable with respect to the modeled objectives while the difference among alternative solu-tions is maximized.

The Modeling to Generate Alternatives approach is extended for a multi-objective context here to identify distinct sets of non-dominated solutions . Distinct sets of non-dominated solutions are de fi ned here as multiple sets of non-dominated solutions in which pairs of solutions from different non-dominated sets are located in similar regions of the Pareto front and have maximally different values for decision variables. Consider two distinct sets of non-dominated solutions that approximate a Pareto front, as shown in that could be identi fi ed by a multi-objective optimization algo-rithm. An alternative set of non-dominated solutions ( d 1 d ) achieves a similar level of Pareto-optimality compared to the fi rst set of solutions. Paired solutions from the two non-dominated sets, for example, c 1 and d 1 , have similar values for objective functions and are located in similar regions of the objective space; however, these solutions are located in different regions of the decision space.

The generation of distinct sets of non-dominated solutions (as shown in Fig. 1 (c)) can provide more valuable insight for wicked problems than enhancing diversity within one set of non-dominated solutions (as shown in Fig. 1 (b)). Consider, for example, solutions b 2 and b 3 that represent the type of solutions that are sought by a diversity-enhancing multi-objective search. The solu-tions b 2 and b 3 have different decision characteristics with respect to both X 1 and X 2 , but they satisfy the con fl icting goals F different degrees. A decision-maker who would consider these two solutions cannot separate the difference in design decisions from the impacts on the system performance. A distinct set of non-dominated solutions, however, can provide more insight for decision-making. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 (c), two diverse options can be considered for each region of the Pareto front. Solutions c and d 1 satisfy goals F 1 and F 2 to the same degree, and provide distinctly different options in the decision space, representing the range of design decisions that could be implemented. Pairs of solutions can be further analyzed to evaluate the degree of fl exibility in decision-making within regions of the trade-off curve. Solutions c 2 and d 2 are closer in decision space than other pairs (for maker will fi nd limited fl exibility in selecting design decisions when exploring the compromise portion of the trade-off curve.
To identify distinct sets of non-dominated solutions, the Modeling to Generate Alternatives formulation is extended and presented here for a multi-objective optimization problem. Let the optimization model represented in Eq. (1) be solved to identify a set of non-dominated solutions, X n , with corresponding objective values of Z For one solution X n k and a corresponding vector of objective values Z an alternative nearly Pareto-optimal solution ( X )canbeidenti that is maximally different from X n k by solving the following model: Maximize Diff  X  d  X  X , X n k  X  X  3  X  Subject to f i  X  X  X   X  T  X  Z n k , i  X  ; i  X  1 , ... , M  X  4  X  where Diff is a difference function based on d  X  X , X n k sents a distance measure between two solutions X and X n k calculated, for example, as a Euclidean distance between the decision vectors. T is a target that is speci fi ed in relation to the vector of fi tness values, Z n k . T represents an allowable relaxation, such as 90% of the objective function values. To identify a complete alternative set of non-dominated solutions, Eqs. (3) and (4) can be solved for each of the solutions in the non-dominated set of solutions X n . 3. Evolutionary algorithms for enhancing diversity in multi-objective optimization
A few evolutionary algorithm-based methodologies have been developed to enhance diversity in the decision space for multi-objective optimization problems. These methods do not identify distinct sets of non-dominated solutions, but seek diversity in the decision space among one set of solutions and can provide a comparison for the new method, MNCA.

Conventional multi-objective approaches identify a single set of non-dominated solutions. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) use evolutionary search mechanisms that are designed to improve coverage of the complete Pareto front by preferring solutions that increase the uniform spread of the population in the objective space and dominate other solutions. Operators for standard MOEA techniques do not apply explicit pressure to improve the diversity of the population in decision space or to search for solutions that are maximally different. Diversity-enhancing MOEAs improve genetic diversity by allowing solutions in different niches to evolve separately or by maximizing the decision space that is covered by a set of non-dominated solutions. The Genetic Diversity Evolutionary Algorithm (GDEA) ( Toffolo and
Benini, 2003 ) and the Omni-Optimizer ( Deb and Tiwari, 2005 ) measure and select solutions based on both non-dominance and a diversity metric; both algorithms evaluate diversity as the distance in decision space between pairs of solutions within a single population. DBSCAN-based Multi-objective Niching creates niches by clustering solutions based on their similarities in decision space and identi fi es non-dominated solutions within each niche ( Kramer and Danielsiek, 2010 ). The Diversity Integrating Hypervolume-based Search Algorithm (DIVA) ( Ulrich et al., 2010 ) prefers solu-tions with high values for a new metric that represents the contribution of an individual solution to both the hypervolume and diversity of the population. NSGA-II-Agg is a variant of the
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) ( Deb et al., 2002 ) and uses an aggregated metric for the crowding distance to include the distance to nearest neighbors in both decision space and objective space ( Shir and Beck, 2009 ).

The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy Niching technique (Niching-CMA) was compared to conventional MOEAs and diversity-enhancing MOEAs and out-performed four algo-rithms, including the Covariance Matrix Adaptation for Multi-objective Optimization (CMA-MO), NSGA-II, NSGA-II-Agg, and
Omni-Opt in identifying diverse sets of non-dominated solutions for a set of test problems ( Shir and Beck, 2009 ). Niching-CMA groups solutions into niches based on their proximity in both objective space and decision space, and the best solutions in each niche are selected using crowding distance and non-dominated sorting. Niching-CMA provides a comparison benchmark for
MNCA to diversity-enhancing MOEAs because it out-performed other diversity-enhancing MOEAs. 4. Multi-objective niching co-evolutionary algorithm (MNCA)
Mathematical programming procedures have been developed to solve the Modeling to Generate Alternatives model for single-objective 1982 ; Pan and Kao, 2009 ). Evolutionary computation-based approaches for generating alternatives have been developed that recombine similar solutions ( Loughlin et al., 2001 ), execute a genetic algorithm iteratively ( Harrell and Ranjithan, 2003 ), and use multiple subpopulations to evolve to different solutions ( Zechman and
Ranjithan, 2005 ; Drake and Zechman, 2011 ). These approaches were designed for single objective problems and have not been extended for a multi-objective search.

Generate Alternatives formulation within an evolutionary computation-based multi-objective framework and is described as Algorithm 1 . The search uses subpopulations, where each subpopulation converges to a distinct set of non-dominated solutions. Each subpopulation is designated as primary or second-ary. The primary subpopulation executes NSGA-II to identify a non-dominated set that serves as a reference for the secondary subpopulations. The secondary subpopulations seek to identify non-dominated fronts that are different from the primary sub-population and from fronts in other secondary subpopulations.
New operators are de fi ned below to evolve distinct sets of non-dominated solutions in secondary subpopulations.

Algorithm 1. Multi-objective Niching Co-evolutionary Algorithm ( MNCA ).
 4.1. Creating clusters and niches into K clusters using the k -means clustering algorithm ( MacQueen, 1967 ), based on proximity in objective space, which is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two vectors of objective function values. Niches are formed as groups of solutions that share both the same cluster and subpopulation. 4.2. Calculating the inter-niche distance
A solution in a secondary subpopulation is assigned a value for the inter-niche distance, d in , to represent the decision space distance to niches that are in the same cluster as the solution, but in different subpopulations. The location of a niche is repre-sented in decision space using the niche centroid, C pk , which is de fi ned as the average of decision vectors for the solutions in the niche pk , or solutions in subpopulation p that fall in cluster k . For the i th solution X ipk in subpopulation p and cluster k , d the minimum of a vector of distances, DIS ipk :
DIS ipk  X  f d  X  X ipk , C jk  X   X  j  X  p , j  X  1 , ... , subs g X  5  X  where subs is the total number of subpopulations. The function d  X  X ipk , C jk  X  is the rectilinear distance in decision space between its shared cluster are empty, the inter-niche distances for solutions in that niche are set to a maximum value, which is the radius of the decision space ( R ,de fi ned in Eq. (8) ). 4.3. Relaxing Pareto-optimality
To relax the de fi nition of Pareto-optimality as shown in Eq. (4) , a target front is created based on the primary subpopulation. The set of non-dominated solutions from the primary subpopulation is identi fi ed and copied into an array. The objective function values of each solution are relaxed by the target value, T :
Z  X   X  f Z  X  i  X  T  X  Z i  X  WP i  X  X  WP i j Z i  X  Z , WP i  X  WP where Z  X  is the target front, which is an array of target values that will replace the right-hand side of Eq. (3) . WP  X f WP 1 , is a vector of worst points, corresponding to the worst value that each objective can take.

Each solution in a secondary subpopulation is labeled  X  feasible if it dominates any solution on the target front, and infeasible solutions within each secondary subpopulation are sorted into fronts ( Fig. 2 (a)). The crowding distance, cd , is calculated for each infeasible solution with respect to the nearest solutions in the objective space, using the same de fi nition for crowding distance given for NSGA-II ( Fig. 2 (b)). Feasible solutions are not separated each feasible solution. The modi fi ed crowding distance measures the distance in objective space to the nearest feasible solutions ( Fig. 2 (c)). The modi fi ed crowding distance is needed because the conventional crowding distance, cd , can be used only for a set of non-dominated solutions, and some solutions in the group of feasible solutions are dominated by other feasible solutions. The value for cd is calculated as the distance from one solution to the nearest M solutions, and cd m is calculated as the distance from one solution to the nearest 2 M solutions (where M is the number of objectives).

A new binary tournament selection is developed to select solu-tions for survival from the combination of parents and children within each secondary subpopulation. Tournament rules enforce that for solutions from the same region of objective space (within the same niche), solutions that are more different from other subpopula-tions, based on d in ,survive.Acomparisonbetweendecisionspace distances is not meaningful for solutions located in different niches, however. This is because in any fi tness landscape, some regions of the trade-off curve have a high degree of multi-modality (many different alternative solutions), while other regions have a low degree of multi-modality. Therefore, when solutions in different niches com-pete, the selection operator applies pressure to improve the coverage across the Pareto front throug h selecting higher values for cd for infeasible solutions and higher values for cd m for feasible solutions. The selection operator is described as Algorithm 2 .

Test functions Seven multi-objective test functions are used to compare MNCA and diversity-enhancing MOEAs and are listed in Table 1 .
Test functions are not truly wicked problems, because all problem characteristics, data, and objectives are known for these problems.
The test functions that are included here were chosen because of their problem characteristics, which pose dif fi culties for solution algorithms and mimic some characteristics that are found in wicked problems. The Two-on-One and Deb99 functions have deceptive Pareto fronts, which may lead solution algorithms away from globally Pareto-optimal solutions to identify sub-optimal sets of non-dominated solutions. The Omni and Lam X  Superspheres functions are multi-modal, with many equally good Pareto fronts, and Deb00 and POL functions have discontinuities in their Pareto fronts. The ZDT4 function has many sub-optimal Pareto fronts.
Wicked problems may have many sub-optimal Pareto fronts, and identifying sub-optimal fronts, in addition to a mathematically optimal front, may provide important insight for selecting deci-sions when un-modeled objectives are considered. The test func-tions are described in detail as follows.

The Two-on-One function is a bi-modal test function that was designed to provide a map of non-unique non-dominated solu-tions in a decision space ( Preuss et al., 2006 ). The Two-on-One function represents a bimodal landscape composed of a fourth-degree polynomial with two optima and a second-degree sphere function. Two regions in decision space map to alternate Pareto fronts, located around the line x 1  X  x 2 . The global and local optimal
Pareto fronts are located in the fi rst and third quadrants of the decision space, respectively. problem, where the fi tness landscape includes both a globally optimal Pareto front that is dif fi cult to identify and a locally optimal Pareto front that is at the base of a wide valley and can be identi fi ed easily. It is a two-dimensional decision space; the local Pareto front is along the line x 2  X  0.6, and the global Pareto front is along the line x 2  X  0.2.

For each solution in the Pareto front, there are a fi nite number of solutions in decision space that are located in equidistant parallel line-segments. consists of two disconnected portions, and provides a dif case for identifying both portions of the Pareto front. discontinuous and periodic Pareto front.

Metrics for algorithm evaluation 6.1. Decision space diversity decision space, based on the distance between all pairs of individuals in a population. In a population of size pop , there are pop  X  pop  X  1  X  = 2 unique distances between all pairs of individuals.
The decision space diversity is an average of the distances between pairs of solutions and is normalized by the diameter of the decision space, R . The metric diversity is the sum of the Euclidean distances between pairs of solutions: diversity  X  1 R pop  X  pop  X  1  X   X  the i th and j th solutions in a subpopulation. The equation for R is given as
R  X  where x i , max and x i , min are the maximum and minimum values that a decision variable x i can take, respectively, and N is the number of decision variables in a solution X . To calculate the diversity value for a set of subpopulations, all solutions in subpopulations are combined as one population. For evaluating a set of subs sub-populations generated by MNCA, there are  X  subs pop  X  subs pop  X  1  X  X  = 2 pairs of solutions. 6.2. Paired solution diversity mance of an algorithm to create distinct sets of non-dominated solutions, or fi nd solutions that are distant in decision space though similar in objective space. The paired solution diversity, diversity ps , is calculated by pairing a solution in a subpopulation with the solution in a second subpopulation that is nearest in objective space. The Euclidean distance in decision space is calculated for the pair. The diversity ps for a set of subpopulations is calculated as diversity ps  X  1 pop subs  X  subs  X  1  X   X  subs
G  X  X p , X q  X  X   X  where X n q is the closest solution in subpopulation q to the solution
X , measured by the Euclidean distance in objective space. The two solutions measured in decision space. 6.3. Hypervolume
In comparing sets of non-dominated solutions, both the con-vergence toward a true Pareto front and the distribution of solutions along the optimal Pareto front should be evaluated.
The hypervolume ( Zitzler and Thiele, 1999 , Bader and Zitler ) can be used as an indicator to measure the quality of a non-dominated set of solutions and is strictly monotonic with regard to Pareto dominance. The hypervolume represents the size of the space covered by the set, with respect to a worst point, which is at the intersection of the worst values that each objective function can take. 7. Experiments MNCA is compared to two algorithms, Niching-CMA and
Subpopulation-MOEA, which is a variant of MNCA. For Subpopula-tion-MOEA, a set of subpopulations are initialized, and the primary subpopulation executes an NSGA-II search, similar to MNCA.
In secondary subpopulations, the inter-niche distance is calculated for individuals and included as an additional objective. NSGA-II is executed to identify an approximation of the Pareto front that explores the con fl icts among the original set of objectives in addition to the inter-niche distance (see Algorithm 3 ). Comparison of Subpopulation-MOEA with MNCA provides a mechanism to isolate and evaluate the effects of using the target front within
MNCA to relax the criteria for Pareto-optimality in the secondary subpopulations. Niching-CMA provides representative perfor-mance for a leading diversity-enhancing MOEA.

In total, seven test functions (listed in Table 1 ) are used to compare the algorithms. Shir and Beck (2009) use three of these test functions for exploring the performance of Niching-CMA, and includes the EBN function, which is not included here. For the EBN function, all solutions are ef fi cient, or located on the Pareto front.
Preliminary trials applied MNCA to solve the EBN function. These trials revealed that this function does not provide a challenging test and does not generate new insight about MNCA beyond what is demonstrated here.

MNCA and Subpopulation-MOEA execute 50,000 function eva-luations for each execution, using the settings shown in Table 2 .
For Niching-CMA, parameter values for the number of niches, the size of the niches, and the number of generations are set to ensure that the algorithm uses 50,000 fi tness evaluations. As the perfor-mance of Niching-CMA is sensitive to parameter settings, a series of preliminary tests identi fi ed the number of niches and niche size for each test function that would maximize diversity and minimize the number of inferior solutions in the fi nal population ( Table 3 ).
The three algorithms were executed for each test function for 30 random trials. The average and standard deviation for the hypervo-lume, total diversity, and paired solution diversity over the 30 trials are reported for each algorithm and test function ( Tables 4 difference in performance among the algorithms was tested using the null hypothesis for a 95% con fi dence interval. The value for H reported in Table 4 for Subpopulation-MOEA and MNCA to compare the hypervolume values of these a lgorithms to the hypervolume values found by Niching-CMA. The diversity is also tested using a null hypothesis test, comparing Subpopulation-MOEA and MNCA to
Niching-CMA ( Table 5 ). The paired solution diversity, diversity tested to compare MNCA results with Subpopulation-MOEA ( Table 6 ). 7.1. Two-on-One function the search and convergence of MNCA, using two subpopulations.
The convergence of the subpopulations for a representative MNCA trial ( Fig. 3 ) shows that up until Generation 250, solutions from both Subpopulations 1 and 2 are located in the same region of the decision space, close to the global Pareto front. During the early stages of the search, Subpopulation 2 searches for solutions that dominate the target front. Once non-dominated solutions are identi fi ed, the selection operator favors more distant solutions.
By Generation 500, almost all solutions of the secondary sub-population are fl agged as feasible, and solutions are selected based on higher crowding and inter-niche distances. At this generation, the secondary subpopulation migrates to the locally optimal region in the fi rst quadrant of the decision space. In subsequent generations, the solutions in both subpopulations are re fi better approximate the global and local Pareto fronts.

Fig. 4 demonstrates these dynamics through the convergence of the hypervolume for Subpopulations 1 and 2 (upper chart) and diversity ps for Subpopulation 2 (lower chart). Subpopulation 1 quickly reaches the globally optimal Pareto front, with a hypervolume value of approximately 174, and maintains this value throughout the remaining generations. In early generations, Subpopulation 2 main-tains a low value for diversity ps and values for the hypervolume that correspond to a population of solut ions that are mostly feasible, or within 95% of the objective values of the non-dominated set of solutions in Subpopulation 1. At approximately Generation 500, the diversity ps increases from 0.2 to 2.8, when the secondary subpopula-tion migrates to the locally optimal Pareto front.

Fig. 5 shows the fi nal decision space (upper row) and objective space (lower row) of Two-on-One for the three algorithms. The primary subpopulations of Subpopulation-MOEA and MNCA produce similar non-dominated sets, as both algorithms use NSGA-II in the primary subpopulation. The MNCA Subpopulation 2 has a hypervo-lume value at 95% of the hypervolume for Subpopulation 1, which corresponds to the target value of 95% that is used to generate the target front. MNCA and Subpopulation-MOEA produce similar values
Gen # Subpopulation 1 Hyper volume Paired Solution Diversity for diversity , higher than the average value for Niching-CMA. The population of Niching-CMA does not spread out to the corners of the decision space ( Fig. 5 ). In addition, MNCA yields a higher diversity than Subpopulation-MOEA ( Table 6 ).

One advantage of a set of Pareto approximations as identi by MNCA over one diverse set of solutions is its use in decision-making. MNCA isolates solutions that map to the globally Pareto-optimal region within the primary subpopulation and those map to the locally Pareto-optimal region in the secondary subpopula-tion. Five clusters are shown in Fig. 5 , distinguished by different shapes. A decision-maker who is interested in exploring one region of the Pareto front has a clear set of options at hand. For example, visual inspection of the areas of the decision space covered by the diamond clusters  X   X   X  in Subpopulations 1 and 2 reveals that very different decisions can be made while achiev-ing similar values for the two objectives. Alternatively, when inspecting the location of the box clusters  X   X   X  , a decision-maker can observe that there is only a small range of fl exibility in these decisions, as the box clusters for both subpopulations are located near the origin in decision space. 7.2. Deb99 function
Representative populations as identi fi ed by the three algo-rithms are shown for the Deb99 function ( Fig. 6 ). Due to the deception of the Deb99 function, Niching-CMA does not fi nd any solution on the global Pareto front (at x 2  X  0.2), and instead, almost all the Niching-CMA solutions are located near the locally optimal
Pareto front (at x 2  X  0.6). Subpopulation-MOEA and MNCA identify the solutions on the global Pareto front in the fi rst subpopulations.
The secondary subpopulation of Subpopulation-MOEA identi fi solutions located in both the deceptive region and the globally optimal region. This subpopulation identi fi es solutions that are Decision Space 
Objective Space Decision Space 
Objective Space located most distantly from the fi rst subpopulation, but within the inferior region of the Pareto front. The secondary MNCA subpo-pulation is concentrated solely along the secondary Pareto front subpopulation are within 90% of the optimal Pareto approximation and are maximally different from solutions in the primary sub-population. The use of the target front within MNCA gives the user control on how much degradation is allowed in Pareto-optimality when searching for alternative solutions. 7.3. Omni function decision space is shown as two of the six decision variables.
Niching-CMA fi nds eight niches of solutions spread over the decision space, and only a few solutions are signi fi cantly domi-nated by other solutions. Subpopulation-MOEA identi fi es solutions in three niches, one niche in the fi rst subpopulation and two in the secondary subpopulation. MNCA identi fi es two distinct niches of solutions located in different r egions of the decision space. The solutions identi fi ed in the secondary subpopulation of Subpopulation-
MOEA cover a wider spread across the Pareto front, compared to the secondary subpopulation of MNCA.
 solutions are spread out throughout the decision space ( Table 5 ), and Subpopulation-MOEA identi fi es more diverse pairs of solu-tions than MNCA, measured through diversity ps ( Table 6 ). For this problem, there is little con fl ict between maximizing distance to the primary subpopulation and the original objectives, and as a result, Subpopulation-MOEA maximizes the distance among niches while fi nding solutions that are nearly non-dominated with respect to the original objectives. This is the only test problem where MNCA did not fi nd the highest value for diversity ( Table 6 ). Due to the highly multi-modal nature of the problem, the location of the cluster centroids changes regularly throughout the search and causes inef fi ciencies in MNCA convergence. The relaxation of Pareto-optimality in the secondary MNCA subpopu-lation does not aid the search in identifying diverse solutions, because there are a large number of solutions that are equally
Pareto-optimal. 7.4. Lam X  superspheres function
The results for the Lam X  Superspheres function reinforce and demonstrate the difference among behaviors of the three algo-rithms ( Fig. 8 ). In general, Niching-CMA identi fi es one Pareto front approximation, with solutions located in very different areas of the decision space, and MNCA identi fi es Pareto front approximations located in two distinct regions of the decision space. While
Niching-CMA solutions range across almost the entire space (0  X  x 1  X  1 : 55 and 1  X  x 2  X  5), the MNCA solutions are distributed only along the line x 2  X  2 : 8 for Subpopulation 1 and x 2  X  5 for Subpopu-lation 2. For Subpopulation-MOEA, Subpopulation 1 converges to
Pareto front approximation with solutions located on the line x  X  5, while the secondary subpopulation, like Niching-CMA, covers a wider range of decision space.

The diversity ps identi fi ed by MNCA is twice as large as that found by Subpopulation-MOEA ( Table 6 ). Any pair of solutions identi
MNCA possesses diverse values for x 2 . Subpopulation-MOEA, how-ever, explores the trade-off between decision space difference values and optimization of the original objectives. For each cluster of solutions, there is a range of relaxation in the objective space, with some solutions located on the non-dominated front identi fi
Subpopulation 1 and some in the inferior region. Similarly, there is a spread of solutions across the decision space, where some solutions survive because they perform well for the original objectives, but have a low value for decision space diversity, and others that lie in the non-inferior region are more diverse in decision space. For some pairs identi fi ed by Subpopulations 1 and 2 of Subpopulation-MOEA, the two solutions lie close in decision space, which lowers the value for the paired solution diversity. MNCA does not explore the trade-off between the original objectives and diversity. Instead MNCA uses the target front to focus on solutions that are nearly Pareto-optimal. 7.5. POL function
The results for the POL function demonstrate the in fl uence of relaxing the de fi nition for Pareto-optimality in the MNCA approach to better characterize solutions in a secondary non-dominated set ( Fig. 9 ). The global and local front are easily distinguished between the MNCA Subpopulations 1 and 2 for both the upper and lower regions of the true Pareto front. The secondary non-inferior set Decision Space 
Objective Space identi fi ed by Subpopulation-MOEA identi fi es solutions that are strongly dominated by the primary non-inferior set. The secondary non-inferior set identi fi ed by MNCA is much more controlled, how-ever, as it more closely follows the true Pareto front. 7.6. Deb00 function For the Deb00 function, the fi rst subpopulations of MNCA and Subpopulation-MOEA identify a n ear approximation to the true Pareto front ( Fig. 10 ). The secondary non-inferior set identi Subpopulation-MOEA covers a wider range of the decision space, but includes solutions that are dominated strongly by the true Pareto front. Niching-CMA identi fi es diverse solutions that are closer to the true Pareto front than Subpopulation-MOEA, but does not uniformly characterize the Pareto front. MNCA, on the other hand, identi closer approximation of the Pareto front and, in Subpopulation 2, identi fi es diverse solutions that closely follow the true Pareto front. 7.7. ZDT4 function
Results for the ZDT4 function demonstrate results that are similar to the POL and Deb00 function. While the solutions in the secondary subpopulation of MNCA cover a smaller portion of the decision space when compared to Subpopulation-MOEA, they more closely follow the true Pareto front and are only weakly dominated by the true Pareto front. If a decision-maker would like to explore a larger set of options, the target value can be further relaxed, and MNCA can be re-applied to identify non-dominated sets that cover more of the decision. MNCA gives the user control over how much degradation is allowed in secondary sets of non-dominated solutions. Solutions identi fi ed by Niching-CMA Decision Space 
Objective Space are limited in their diversity in decision space and do not fully characterize the Pareto front. 8. Sensitivity of algorithmic parameters user. The number of subpopulations and the target value are dependent on the preferences of the user, and adjusting these parameters can yield information about the problem solution and help guide the decision-making process. The performance of the algorithm is sensitive to these parameters and to the number of clusters, and the following sections explore the performance of
MNCA under different settings. 8.1. Number of clusters varying numbers of clusters, while keeping the settings shown in
Table 2 for other parameters. Thirty random trials were executed for each setting, and values for the hypervolume and paired solution diversity are reported in Fig. 12 .
 trade-off in increasing the number of clusters, as the hypervolume increases and the paired solution diversity loses quality. This is because when there are more clusters, there is a smaller probability that two solutions selected to compete in the tournament selection are located in the same cluster, and more solutions are selected based on the crowding distance, instead of the inter-niche distance. This increases the hypervolume of secondary subpopulations, but decreases the pressure to fi nd solutions that are diverse in the decision space. Setting the number of clusters at two, however, two-objective test problems, and further research can explore the number of clusters that would be required for problems with a higher number of objectives. 8.2. Number of subpopulations by the user based on the number of distinct sets of non-dominated solutions that the user wants to consider in analysis and decision-making. Using the settings de fi ned in Table 2 , MNCA was executed for an increasing number of subpopulations, and Fig. 13 shows the results of this experiment. Changing the number of subpopula-tions has a small effect on the value of the hypervolume in secondary subpopulations and does not impact the hypervolume to the same degree as changing the number of clusters.

The paired solution diversity is more sensitive to the number of subpopulations, as the value decreases with additional subpopula-tions. Instead of indicating algorithmic ef fi ciency that should be gained by adjusting this parameter, this information can be useful for decision-makers to identify the amount of multi-modality in the fi tness landscape. The paired solution diversity decreases signi cantly for Two-on-One and Deb99 when the number of subpopula-tions increases to three, beca use the Two-on-One and Deb99 functions have only two optimal regions. When a third subpopula-tion is added to the search, this subpopulation must be located in proximity of either the fi rst or second subpopulation. For the Omni function, the addition of more subpopulations does little to decrease the paired solution diversity, which indicates a high degree of multi-modality present in the problem. The Lam X  Superspheres function also has many niches of Pareto-op timal solutions and shows little decrease in diversity for three to fi ve subpopulations.
The POL, Deb00, and ZDT4 test functions are not multi-modal functions, but were created for multi-objective algorithms. Therefore, increasing the number of subpopu lations for these problems does not increase the paired solution diversity. Instead, for POL and Deb00 functions, the paired solution decreases sharply after two subpopula-tions. For the ZDT4, which has eve n less multi-modality (seen in
Fig. 11 ), two subpopulations are located very proximal in decision space and have a consistently low value for paired solutions diversity for an increasing number of subpopulations. 8.3. Target value
The Deb99 and Two-on-One functions are used to assess the sets for these two functions include solutions that are dominated by the globally optimal Pareto front. As a result of this type of landscape, solutions are sensitive to the value selected for the target value. The results show an increase in the value of the 0 2 4 0 0.5 4 6 8 0.5 1 1 2 3 0 0.5 1 0 0.5 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.1 0.2 0.5 0.25 0.5 hypervolume of secondary subpopulations as the target value increases. This is due to a tighter de fi nition of Pareto-optimality that is enforced through a higher target value.

There is, however, a trade-off between the increasing perfor-manceinthehypervolumeandthepairedsolutiondiversity.Asthe targetvalueincreases,thevalueforthepairedsolutiondiversity decreases, and there is an increase in the variation of the paired solution diversity across the trials. For lower target values, a higher area of exploration is allowed in the decision space. As the target values increase, the search area is more constrained, and the diversity in decision space decreases as solu tions that contribute to higher diversity become infeasible and cannot survive. At a target value of 97%fortheTwo-on-Onefunction,thediversityreducesdramatically. No feasible solutions remain in the fi rst quadrant of the decision space, and the secondary subpopulation moves to the third quadrant, close to the primary subpopulation. Similarly, for the Deb99 function, at a target value of 95%, solutions that are part of the locally optimal non-dominated set (at x 2  X  0 : 6) are infeasible, and the secondary subpopulation must move to solutio ns located in the globally optimal non-dominated set. Exploring the setting for the target value provides a decision-maker with an understanding about the degree of degradation that is required in the original objectives to provide increased fl exibility in decisions. 9. Discussion and conclusions
The results presented here demonstrate the development of a new algorithm, MNCA, to identify alternative Pareto approxima-tion sets. MNCA is designed using a relaxed de fi nition of Pareto-optimality, which allows more fl exibility in decision vector values when identifying alternative sets of non-dominated solutions.
MNCA uses a set of subpopulations to fi nd distinct sets of non-dominated solutions and is imple mented through the development of a new inter-niche distance and selection scheme for secondary subpopulations. MNCA is compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm, Niching-CMA, for enhancing diversity for multi-objective problems. Using an established diversity metric, Niching-CMA performs better than the new algorithm, MNCA, in some cases. The goals of Niching-CMA, however, are to identify a diverse set of solutions to represent one Pareto front approximation, while the goals of MNCA are to identify distinct sets of non-dominated solutions with differences between solutions de fi ned based on the proximity in objective space. Therefore, MNCA does not identify diversity within one population of solutions, as Niching-CMA does. MNCA maximizes values for a new diversity metric, diversity ps , that better represents the goals of the new algorithm.

MNCA is compared to Subpopulation-MOEA, which, like MNCA, uses a set of subpopulations. Subpopulation-MOEA includes the inter-niche distance as an additional objective in the multi-objective problem, but does not use the new secondary subpopu-lation selection. The selection operator allows dominated solutions to survive so long as they perform relatively well with respect to an expected Pareto front. Using a target on Pareto-optimality within MNCA better explores decision space, and each set of non-dominated solutions as identi fi ed by one subpopulation is as diverse as possible from other subpopulations. In addition, using a target value provides the user with control over how much degradation is allowed in Pareto-optimality. Without the inclusion of the selection operator, Subpopulation-MOEA identi fi es solutions that are spread throughout both the decision space and objective space in the secondary subpopulation.

An additional bene fi t of using diversity-enhancing algorithms is that the quality of a set of non-dominated solutions may be improved while searching for diverse solutions. For deceptive problems, such as the Deb99 function shown here, MNCA regularly identi fi es the globally optimal Pareto approximation set, while conventional MOEAs converge to a locally optimal Pareto approx-imation ( Deb, 1999 ). In several of the thirty trials executed for
MNCA, solutions on the optimal Pareto front are identi fi secondary subpopulation where diversity is maximized. The same behavior is not observed for all test functions explored in this work.

Development of MNCA has introduced new algorithmic para-meters that should be set by a user, including the number of subpopulations and a target value. Unlike parameters such as neighborhood or niche distances, these parameters can easily be set by a decision-maker, based on his or her preferences. In addition, through exploring the values for these parameters, a decision-maker will gain new insights about the problem and fl exibility of selecting decisions. The number of clusters must be set for using the k -means clustering method within MNCA. Other clustering methods could easily be adopted in the MNCA frame-work. Currently available clustering methods use parameters that can be explored adaptively, such as the DBSCAN method, which can be explored to further reduce the burden of setting parameters for MNCA. Niching-CMA uses a neighborhood parameter that requires extensive tuning to fi nd optimal performance of the algorithm. For MNCA, setting the number of clusters can impact the fi nal results, and a range of 3  X  4 clusters resulted in the best performance for the test problems explored here. Application to more test and realistic problems may reduce the uncertainty associated with setting the number of clusters.

The multi-objective engine used for the MNCA implementation is NSGA-II. A hypervolume-based MOEA ( Dorn, 2001 ) was also tested for improving the algorithmic performance, but did not show any gains in performance and increased computation time considerably. The framework has a modular design, and future research can explore other MOEAs as multi-objective engines within the primary subpopulation to determine if gains in perfor-mance can be found.

The performance of the MNCA secondary subpopulations is highly dependent on the performance of the primary subpopulation. The target front evolves as the primary subpopulation converges to an approximation of the global optimal Pareto front. As de fi solution in the secondary subpopul ation survives if it dominates the target front, and solutions that are on the extreme ends of a Pareto front approximation are lost. Alternatively, feasibility can be rede-fi ned so that a solution is fl agged feasible if it is not dominated by a solution on the target front. This mechanism can increase the hypervolume in the secondary subpopulation.

MNCA is designed to address the needs of decision-makers in solving wicked problems by provided alternative solutions in diverse regions of a Pareto front. On-going work is applying MNCA to solve realistic engineering problems and to aid in public sector decision-making problems.
