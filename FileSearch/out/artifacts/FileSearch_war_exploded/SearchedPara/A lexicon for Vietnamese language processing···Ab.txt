However, most of those works were carried out for occidental languages (roughly corresponding to the Indo-European family) and lose much of their validity when applied to other language families. Thus, there clearly exists today a need to develop tools and resources for those other languages. in an increasing number of applications, and their comparability in a multilingual framework. This paper focuses on the case of Vietnamese.

Only very recently have Vietnamese researchers begun to be involved in the domain of NLP. As there does not exist any published work in formal linguistics nor any recognizable standard for Vietnamese word definition and word categories, the fundamental tasks for automatic Vietnamese language processing, such as POS necessary linguistic resources have to be built from scratch by each research team is a real obstacle to the development of Vietnamese language processing.
The aim of our project is therefore to build a common linguistic database that is freely and easily exploitable for the automatic processing of Vietnamese. In this paper, we present our work on creating a Vietnamese lexicon for NLP applications. We emphasize the standardization aspect of the lexicon representation. We especially propose an extensible set of Vietnamese syntactic descriptions that can be used for tagset definition and morphosyntactic analysis. These descriptors are established in such a way as to be a reference set proposal for Vietnamese in the context of ISO subcommittee TC 37/SC 4 (Language Resource Management).
We begin with an overview of the specificities of the Vietnamese language and of the context of our research (Sect. 2 ). We then present the lexicon model (Sect. 3 ) in Sect. 5 our ongoing work to build an extended lexicon in which each lexical entry is enriched with more elaborate syntactic information. 2 Overview of Vietnamese language resources for NLP In this section, we first present some general characteristics of the Vietnamese language. We then introduce the current status of language resources construction for Vietnamese language processing. 2.1 Characteristics of Vietnamese The following basic characteristics of Vietnamese are adopted from Cao ( 2000 ) and H  X  u et al. ( 1998 ). 2.1.1 Language family Vietnamese is classified in the VietMuong group of the Mon-Khmer branch, that belongs to the Austro-Asiatic language family. Vietnamese is also known to have a similarity with languages in the Tai family. The Vietnamese vocabulary features a large amount of Sino-Vietnamese words. Moreover, by being in contact with the French language, Vietnamese was enriched not only in vocabulary but also in syntax by the calque (or loan translation) of French grammar. 2.1.2 Language type Vietnamese is an isolating language, which is characterized by the following specificities:  X  it is a monosyllabic language;  X  its word forms never change, contrary to occidental languages that make use of  X  hence, all grammatical relations are manifested by word order and function 2.1.3 Vocabulary syllable with respect to phonology, a morpheme with respect to morpho-syntax, and a word with respect to sentence constituent creation. For convenience, we call these  X  X ie  X   X  ng X  syllables. The Vietnamese vocabulary contains:  X  simple words, which are monosyllabic;  X  reduplicated words composed by phonetic reduplication (e.g., tr a  X   X  ng = white  X  compound words composed by semantic coordination (e.g., qu a  X  ` n = trousers ,  X  compound words composed by semantic subordination (e.g., xe = vehicle ,  X  a  X  some compound words whose syllable combination is no longer recognizable 2.1.4 Grammar The issue of syntactic category classification for Vietnamese is still in debate 1999 ;U  X  ban KHXHVN 1983 ). That lack of consensus is due to the unclear limit between the grammatical roles of many words as well as the very frequent phenomenon of syntactic category mutation, by which a verb may for example be a set of eight parts of speech proposed by the Vietnam Committee of Social Science (U  X  ban KHXHVN 1983 ). We discuss precisely of these parts of speech in Sect. 4 .
As for other isolating languages, the most important syntactic information source in Vietnamese is word order. The basic word order is Subject X  X erb X  X bject. There are only prepositions but no post-positions. In a noun phrase the main noun precedes the adjectives and the genitive follows the governing noun.

The other syntactic means are function words, reduplication, and, in the case of spoken language, intonation.
 From the point of view of functional grammar, the syntactic structure of Vietnamese follows a topic-comment structure. It belongs to the class of topic-prominent languages as described by Li and Thompson ( 1976 ). In those languages, topics are coded in the surface structure and they tend to control co-referentiality means This tree, its leaves are big, so I dont like it ); the topic-oriented  X  X ouble I name be Nam, born in Hanoi , which means My name is Nam, I was born in Hanoi ), while such subject-oriented constructions as the passive and  X  X ummy X  subject sentences are rare or non-existent (e.g., There is a cat in the garden should garden ). 2.2 Building language resources for Vietnamese processing While research in machine translation in Vietnam started in the late 1980s (Dien and Kiem 2005 ), other works in the domain of NLP for Vietnamese are still very sparse. Moreover, linguists in Vietnam are not yet involved in computational linguistics. Dien et al. (Dien et al. 2001 ;DienandKiem 2003 ;Dienetal. 2003 )mainlyworkon English X  X ietnamese translation. Concerning the processing of Vietnamese, the authors published some papers on word segmentation, POS tagging for English X  X ietnamese resources for Vietnamese and standard word classifications, the authors make use of available word categories in print dictionaries, and also project English tags onto Vietnamese words. However, the developed tools and resources are not shared in the public research, which makes it difficult to evaluate their actual relevance.
Some other groups working on Vietnamese text processing focus their research on technical aspects and frequently meet the problem of lacking language resources such as lexicon and annotated corpora.
In 2001, we participated in the first national research project for Vietnamese language processing ( X  X esearch and development of technology for speech recog-nition, synthesis and language processing of Vietnamese X , Vietnam Sciences and Technologies Program KC 01-03). In (Nguyen et al. 2003 ), we present our work on the POS tagging of Vietnamese corpora. Starting from a standardization point of view, we tagged lexicon and corpus are distributed on the website of LORIA. 1 We now present the lexicon that we built in collaboration with the Vietnam Lexicography Centre (Vietlex), thanks to the grant of the KC 01-03 project. 3 Lexicon model build a lexicon that can be shared for public research, we pay much attention to resource standardization.

There have recently been many efforts to establish common formats and frameworks in the domain of NLP, in order to maximize the reusability of data, tools, and linguistic resources. In particular, the ISO subcommittee TC 37/SC 4, launched in 2002, aims at preparing various standards by specifying principles and methods for creating, coding, processing and managing language resources, such as written corpora, lexical corpora, speech corpora, dictionary compilations and classification schemes. Among several subjects, the LMF ( Lexical Markup Framework ) project is dedicated to lexicon representation.

In this section, we first present the structure of the print dictionary upon which our lexicon is based, and then introduce the LMF-based model of our NLP lexicon. 3.1 Vietnamese print dictionary Vietlex owns the electronic version of the dictionary, in MS Word format. It contains 39,924 entry words, each of which may have several related meanings. Each of those numbered meanings is associated with a POS, an optional usage or domain note, a definition, and examples of use. For example, the morpheme  X  X e  X  u X  corresponds to two entries in the dictionary, as shown in Fig. 1 .
 To facilitate the management of this resource, we convert the dictionary into XML format, by using the guidelines for print dictionary encoding proposed by the proposed by the TEI for dictionary encoding, we have defined a specialized DTD for the representation of the information contained in the Vietlex Centre Vietnamese dictionary. The data for each entry are automatically extracted based on the typographic indications in the original document. Since our focus is currently mainly on orthography and syntactic categories, the markup scheme remains very simple. The encoding of elements such as examples of use shall be further sophisticated in the future.

Figure 2 shows the XML representation of the information presented in the previous example for the morpheme  X  X e  X  u X .

We now introduce the LMF project and our LMF-based lexicon representation model. 3.2 LMF-based lexicon representation model 3.2.1 LNF (Lexical mark-up framework) LMF (ISO 24613 2006 ) is an abstract meta-model providing a framework for the development of NLP-oriented lexicons. Its aim is to define a generic standard for the representation of lexical data, to facilitate their exchange and management. Its I
The approach chosen in LMF for the description of lexical entries is to systematically link syntactic behaviour and semantic description of the meaning of by Saussures work, according to which a word is defined by a signifier/signified pair, corresponding to a morphological/semantic description.

The LMF model proposes to develop a lexical database potentially gathering several lexicons, each of which is composed of a kernel around which are built lexical extensions corresponding to morphological, syntactic, semantic and inter-linguistic information, as presented on Fig. 3 . For instance, the extension for NLP syntax is represented in the diagram shown on Fig. 4 .

In accordance with the general principles of ISO/TC 37/SC 4 (Ide and Romary 2001 , 2003 ), that information is described using elementary data categories defined in the central DCR ( Data Category Registry ) of TC 37. The development process of a LMF-conformant lexicon is presented on Fig. 5 . 3.2.2 A LMF-based lexicon model for Vietnamese Our lexicon is organized as follows:  X  each word form corresponds to a single lexical entry;  X  the senses of each lexical entry are organized following the sense hierarchy in  X  with each sense is associated the corresponding definitions, examples, gram-
This structure permits us to easily extract all information contained in the print dictionary we have presented. The information that we do not have concerns more precise grammatical descriptions of each word-meaning pair. As the first application of our lexicon is for the task of POS tagging, we need to provide the syntactic informations in such a way that lexicon users can learn the possible tags of each word. We propose to use the model discussed hereafter.
 3.3 The two-layer model of lexical descriptions One of the sources of inspiration of TC 37/SC 4 is the M ULTEXT ( Multilingual Text Tools and Corpora ) project (Ide and Ve  X  ronis 1994 ). It has developed a morphosyntactic model for the harmonization of multilingual corpus tagging as well as the comparability of tagged corpora. It puts emphasis on the fact that in a multilingual context, identical phenomena should be encoded in a similar way to extraction, etc.). One principle of the model is to separate lexical descriptions, which are generally stable, from corpus tags. For lexical descriptions, the model uses two layers, the kernel layer and the private layer, as described below.
The kernel layer contains the morpho-syntactic categories common to most languages. The M ULTEXT model for Western European languages consists of the following categories: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Pronoun, Article/Determiner, Adverb, Adposition, Conjunction, Numeral, Interjection, Unique Membership Class, Resid-ual, Punctuation (Ide and Ve  X  ronis 1994 ; Erjavec et al. 1998 ).

The private layer contains additional information that is specific to a given value couples for each category described in the kernel layer. For instance, the English noun category is specified by three attributes: Type, Number and Gender, to which the following values can be assigned: common or proper (for Type), singular or plural (for Number), masculine or feminine or neuter (for Gender). Note that an text-processing tasks.

Possessing these fine descriptions, one can create a tagset, up to specific applications, by defining a mathematical map from the lexical description space to the corpus tag space, while maintaining the comparability of the tagsets. In the next section, we present our lexical specifications proposal, which fits the M
ULTEXT scheme, for Vietnamese language, by building upon work published in (Nguyen et al. 2003 ). The lexical resources built in the framework of the KC 01-03 project are freely accessible 2 for research purposes, and all contributions are welcome. 4 Syntactic category descriptions As we all know, linguistic theories first developed descriptions of Indo-European languages, which are inflecting languages where morphological variations strongly reflect the syntactic roles of each word. The distinction between categories like noun, verb, adjective, etc. in the kernel layer of M ULTEXT is relatively clear. Meanwhile, with respect to analytic languages like Vietnamese, the syntactic category classification is far from perfect due to the absence of any morphological information. Many discussions are still going on about that matter amongst the linguistic community. In order to build a descriptor set comparable with the M
ULTEXT model, we start in (Nguyen et al. 2003 ) with the classification presented by the Vietnam Committee of Social Science (U  X  ban KHXHVN 1983 ), which is taken into account in the Vietnamese dictionary (Hoa ` ng 2002 ). By analyzing eight categories found in the literature (noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, adjunct, conjunction, modal particle, interjection), we have tried to align them with those employed in the kernel layer of M ULTEXT . Then, following the M ULTEXT principle, each category is characterized by attribute-value couples in the private layer.
Our task is to develop the above work by improving and detailing the description of each layer and constructing a lexicon in which every entry is encoded with these been led in parallel with research concerning the development of tools for the 2006 ), thus ensuring that the chosen categories do have practical applicability to actual Vietnamese text data. 4.1 Kernel layer The Vietnamese alphabet is an extension of the Latin one. The notions of punctuation and abbreviation for Vietnamese are the same as for English, and we keep for them the descriptions proposed by the M ULTEXT project. Therefore in this section we only discuss the syntactic categories of words in the vocabulary: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Pronoun, Article/Determiner, Adverb, Adposition, Conjunction, Numeral, Interjection, Modal Particle, Unique Membership Class, Residual. Only the modal particle class is added in comparison with M ULTEXT . Although classifier words play an important role in Vietnamese, like in most Asian languages, their use and morphology are very similar to nouns. That is why we do not define a specific  X  X lassifier X  POS, but address them in the private layer.

For each category we give a definition and some characteristics (grammatical roles) with illustrating examples if necessary. The characterization of words in the 4.1.1 Nouns The Noun category contains words or groups of words used to designate a person, place, thing or concept (e.g., ng  X   X  i = person ; xe  X  a roles that a Vietnamese noun (or noun phrase) can play are: grammatical subject in a sentence; predicate in a sentence when preceded by the copula verb la ` (to be); complement of a verb or an adjective; adjunct; adverbial modifier. 4.1.2 Verbs laugh ). In Vietnamese, a verb (or verb phrase) can play the following grammatical roles: predicate in a sentence; sometimes grammatical subject; restrictive adjunct t a  X  . step into ). 4.1.3 Adjectives xinh  X  e Vietnamese can be: predicate in a sentence (without a preceding copula verb); sometimes grammatical subject; restrictive modifier of a noun or a verb (e.g., clearly ). 4.1.4 Pronouns The pronoun class contains words used in place of a noun that is determined in the grammatical role of the word it replaces. 4.1.5 Determiners/Articles These are the grammatical words used to identify a nouns definite or indefinite (2) m .  X  t (one, i.e.,  X  X  X  article) (3) c a  X  c (definite pluralizer).
These determiners are often categorized as numeral or even as noun in print dictionaries. They can also be described in the literature as a subcategory of numerals (Nguye  X   X  n 1998 ), while analyzing the structure of the noun phrase. 4.1.6 Adverbs past tense indicator; m a  X  im a  X  i = forever ). 4.1.7 Adpositions a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause functioning as a noun phrase, and (2) form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.
 4.1.8 Conjunctions A conjunction is a word that syntactically links words or larger constituents, and many works and print dictionaries, the prepositions (adpositions) and conjunctions constitute the conjunction (or linking word) category probably because some words of the linking word category. 4.1.9 Numerals Numerals are assigned to the Noun class by some authors, but the morpho-syntactic distinction between these words and other nouns is clear enough to separate them into a new class. 4.1.10 Interjections words function alone and have no syntactic relation with other words in the sentence. 4.1.11 Modal particles This category contains words added to a sentence in order to express the speakers feelings (intensification, surprise, doubt, joy, etc.). Modal particles can create added to the end of a sentence with the meaning of  X  X snt it X  or  X  X oesnt it X ; nh e  X  added to the end of a sentence makes that sentence imperative. 4.1.12 Non-autonomous elements This category corresponds to the Unique Membership Class of the M ULTEXT model. The unique value is applied to categories with a unique or very small membership, and which are  X  X nassigned X  to any of the standard POS categories. In Vietnamese these are some lexical elements, often come from Chinese, and never stand-alone, independent entries in print dictionaries. 4.1.13 Residuals The residual value is assigned to classes of text-words that lie outside the traditionally accepted range of grammatical classes, although they occur quite commonly in many texts and very commonly in some. That is for example the case of foreign words, or mathematical formulae.
 In the next subsection, we concentrate on the descriptions, specific for Vietnamese and represented by attribute-value couples, of the most important categories: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Pronoun, Determiner/Article, Adverb, Adposi-tion, Conjunction, Numeral, Interjection, and Modal Particle. 4.2 Private layer The choice of attributes for each category of the kernel layer is made by taking into account the ability of a word to combine with others in various sentence constituents. This consideration, together with the absence of morphological information in Vietnamese, leads us to define attributes that are closer to semantic information than is usually the case in the private layers for occidental languages, whether explicitly, using a  X  X eaning X  attribute, or indirectly, when specifying the subcategorization frame of verbs. We list below the defined attributes with their values between square brackets. For each attribute value, we provide, when possible, an English word representative of the concept. When no English word is relevant, an explanation is given after the list of values. 4.2.1 Nouns (N)  X  Countability [countable (seed), partially countable, non-countable (rice)] X   X  Unit [classifier, natural (handful), conventional (meter), collective (herd), 4.2.2 Verbs (V)  X  Transitivity [intransitive, transitive, any].  X  Grade [gradable, non-gradable] X  X  gradable verb can be used with an adverb of  X  Frame [copula (be), modal (can), passive (undergo), existence (remain), transfor-4.2.3 Adjectives (A)  X  Type [qualitative (nice), quantitative (high)] X  X  quantitative adjective can have  X  Grade [gradable (good), non-gradable (absolute)] X  X f. the Grade attribute of 4.2.4 Pronouns (P)  X  Type [personal (he), pronominal (myself), indefinite (one), time (that moment),  X  Person [first, second, third].  X  Number [singular, plural]. 4.2.5 Determiners/Articles (D)  X  Type [definite, indefinite].  X  Number [singular, plural]. 4.2.6 Numerals (M)  X  Type [cardinal (four), approximate ( dozen), fractional (quarter), ordinal 4.2.7 Adverbs (R)  X  Position [pre, post, undefined]. 4.2.8 Adpositions (S) 4.2.9 Conjunctions (C)  X  Position [initial, non-initial] X  X ecessary in case of discontinuous conjunc-4.2.10 Interjections (I)  X  Type [exclamation, onomatopoeia]. 4.2.11 Modal Particles (T)  X  Type [global, local] X  X eflects the scope of a particle: whole sentence or one  X  Meaning [opinion, strengthening, exclamation, interrogation, call, imperative] X  4.3 Data examples Making use of the descriptors presented above, we have built a lexicon in which with layer, performed manually by the linguists of the Vietnam Lexicography Centre, based its grammatical category and its description for various meanings, with examples. With respect to the kernel layer, we first automatically get the eight categories recorded there, and then manually process with the categories that should be revised, and XML format. We choose for the time being a simple XML scheme that represents explicitly the feature structure corresponding to the private layer.
Here are some entries illustrating the data encoded in XML format. Due to the already mentioned copyright restrictions, the given example, as well as the publicly available lexical database, do not feature word definitions and examples, although that information has been used to find the values of the various attributes. That is why the presented data is, as of now, incomplete with respect to the LMF specification, since it cannot include the  X  Sense  X  structure.

Example 1. The word ch y in three uses: (1) run in the horse runs , (2) run in run ultra-violet rays , (3) good in the sale is very good
Example 2. The syllable ho a  X  has the same role as the suffix ize (e.g., in industrialize ) in English. 5 Ongoing work: building a syntactic lexicon As the NLP community in Vietnam grows rapidly, the needs for linguistic resources are more and more apparent. In this context, we have obtained a large agreement amongst different research groups in Vietnam to submit a new national project called VLSP ( Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing ).

The VLSP project has just started in August 2006. 3 The objective of this project is to create various essential language resources and tools for Vietnamese text and speech processing. The construction of a morpho-syntactic and syntactic lexicon is obviously one of the important tasks of the project.

As shown in Sect. 3.2 , a lexicon model having the lexical extension for the syntax associates with each sense of an entry its syntactic behaviour information. That information gathers the descriptions of possible subcategorization frame sets.
For that task, two complementary approaches will be followed: the first one is to record the basic construction sets described in Vietnamese grammar documents. Based on the existing lexicon presented in the previous sections, we can automatize the process of linking the basic subcategorization frame sets to each lexical entry. For example, with the  X  X rame X  attribute of a verb, we are able to link that verb to the corresponding subcategorization frame set that is common to other verbs having the same Frame value. The second approach is to learn other construction sets from corpora. For this task, we are also developing tools for corpus annotation. Moreover, all the resources by the NLP community, for research purpose. We finally intend to complement the lexicon with new meaning descriptions independent of the copyrighted material we have relied on so far, in order to develop a fully LMF-conformant publicly available lexicon.

Another direction for future works concerns the integration of our proposal for lexicon attributes into ISO standards. Indeed, the isolating, non-flexional nature of Vietnamese has led us to define specific attributes to specify word roles, more semantic than what is commonly used for western languages. Hence most of the attributes that we propose to use are absent from the current ISO 12620 Data Category Registry (DCR). In the next step, we intend to work in cooperation with specialists of other isolating languages to propose a consensual set of values for integration in the DCR. 6 Conclusion We have presented our proposal for a reference set of Vietnamese lexical descriptors by following the standardization activities of the ISO subcommittee TC 37/SC 4. These descriptors are expressed, for the time being, in a two-layer model comparable with the M ULTEXT model, which is developed for various European languages. In the kernel layer, we have added the modal particle category that contains modal words appearing frequently in Vietnamese. The other categories remain the same. In the private layer, where specific features of Vietnamese are recorded, we proposed various attributes that are syntactically important for this analytic language in which morphology is not present to help us analyze syntactic structures. With the help of the Vietnam Lexicography Centre, we applied all these descriptions to a lexicon that contains all the entries (about 40,000) of the Vietnamese dictionary (Hoa ` ng 2002 ). These resources are represented in a common format that ensures their extensibility and is widely adopted by the international research community, with the purpose of sharing them with all the researchers in the domain of NLP. This base can help us define tagsets for various applications using morpho-syntactically annotated corpora. We expect that the ongoing project in order to build a syntactic lexicon will be fruitful with the contribution of the NLP community.
