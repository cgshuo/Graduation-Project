 Opinion retrieval is a document retrieving and ranking process. A relevant document must be relevant to the query and contain opinions toward the query. Opinion polarity classification is an extension of opinion retrieval. It classifies the retrieved document as positive, negative or mixed, according to the overall polarity of the query relevant opinions in the document. This paper (1) proposes several new techniques that help improve the effectiveness of an existing opinion retrieval system; (2) presents a novel two-stage model to solve the opinion polarity classification problem. In this model, every query relevant opinionated sentence in a document retrieved by our opinion retrieval system is classified as positive or negative respectively by a SVM classifier. Then a second classifier determines the overall opinion polarity of the document. Experimental results show that both the opinion retrieval system with the proposed opinion retrieval techniques and the polarity classification model outperformed the best reported systems respectively.

In opinion retrieval, a relevant document must be relevant to the query and contain opinions about the query. Significant improvement of the opinion retrieval effectiveness has been reported [8]. As a rather new research area, analyzing and incorporating more methods into the existing model to achieve higher retrieval effectiveness is of high interest. After the opinion retrieval, it is natural to consider the positive and the negative polarities of the query related opinions in the retrieved documents. The  X  X olarity classification X  task of TREC 2007 blog track [4] defines that a document has a positive (negative) label if the query related opinions in this document are positive (negative). The document receives a mixed polarity label if it contains both positive and negative relevant opinions. Assigning the opinion polarity label at the document level is as important as doing it at the sentence level, as it gives a user an overview of the opinion orientation of a document. The use does not need to go to the fine detail if not interested to the opinion orientation. This paper focuses on two objectives. First, it improves the opinion retrieval effectiveness of a strong baseline system [8] by studying the methods such as removing part-of-speeches restriction, using more opinionated features, accurately determine query-related opinions, adding spam filter, and utilizing the abbreviations of query concepts. The second objective is to present a two-stage model to solve the opinion polarity classification problem. The proposed model contains two components. (1) A sentence-level opinion classifier classifies a query related opinionated sentence as either positive or negative. (2) A document-level opinion classifier takes the output of the first classifier as input, and assigns a positive, negative or mixed opinion polarity label to the whole document. Zhang et al. proposed an opinion retrieval model that combines factural retrieval and opinion identification [8]. Mei et al. proposed a topic sentiment mixture model to model the facts and the opinions in blogs [9]. To identify and classify the subjective, Esuli and Sebastiani [1] classified the orientation of a term based on its dictionary glosses. Whitelaw et al. [6] used  X  X ppraisal groups X  features for sentiment classification. In the document-level opinion classification, Pang and Lee [5] classified movie reviews into multiple categories. Ku et al. [2] summarized blogs by their major topics and the related opinions. The opinion retrieval model in [8] is used as the baseline. This model has (1) A topic retrieval component. (2) An opinion detection component. (3) A ranking component. The details can be found in [8]. In this paper, we propose the following methods to improve the opinion retrieval effectiveness of the baseline. (1) Do not apply part-of-speech restriction in feature selection (2) Obtain more subjective features from the positive and (3) Refine the NEAR operator by allowing phrase sea rching in (4) Add spam filters to remove documents with long sentences (5) Add an  X  X n-document-abbreviation-recognition X  m ethod to The sentence-level opinion polarity classifier is s imilar to the subjective/objective sentence classifier of [8]. Bu t now the SVM classifier is trained by the positive and negative features obtained from positive and negative review training data. Gi ven a retrieved document from the opinion retrieval system, this cl assifier assigns each query relevant opinionated sentence in this do cument a positive/negative label and a score. Based on the sentence-level opinion orientation inf ormation, the document-level opinion classifier labels the whole document as positive (or negative), if it only contains positiv e (or negative) query relevant opinions, or mixed if both sufficien t positive and negative opinions are found. This classifier utiliz es a set of sentence-level features, and is implemented as a de cision tree classifier. Given a document d , the features are (1) The number of the positive relevant sentences i n d . (2) The number of the negative relevant sentences i n d . (3) The sum of the classification scores of the sen tences in d that (4) The sum of the classification scores of the sen tences in d that (5) Average score of classified positive relevant s entences in d . (6) Average score of classified negative relevant s entences in d . (7) The ratio of the number of the classified posit ive relevant (8) The ratio of the sum of the scores of the class ified positive This experiment takes the opinion retrieval system in [8] as the baseline. The five proposed techniques are incorpor ated into the baseline one by one. This results in six system con figurations. Each configuration is tested by TREC 2006 [3] and 2 007 [4] title-only blog queries respectively on the TREC Blog dat a set [3]. The results are shown in Table 1 in terms of MAP score. This experiment takes the system of [7] as the base line, as it reported the highest classification R-accuracy scor e on TREC 2007 blog queries [4]. To test our model, the TREC 2006 data is used to train the classifier in order to test the T REC 2007 data, and vice versa. The baseline system does not requir e classifier training. The R-accuracy scores of the baseline and the proposed model on 2006 and 2007 blog queries are shown in Ta ble 2. Table 1. MAP scores of different system configurat ions on (1) Baseline 0.2837 0.4086 (2) (1) + No POS restriction 0.2880 0.4130 (3) (2) + More subjective features 0.2888 0.4164 (4) (3) + Refined NEAR operation 0.2925 0.4280 (5) (4) + Removing spam 0.2987 0.4344 (6) (5) + Using abbreviations 0.3009 0.4425 (6) vs. (1), MAP increases 6.06% 8.30% Table 2. The R-Accuracy scores of the proposed mode l and the This paper presents several techniques that improve the retrieval effectiveness of an opinion retrieval system. It al so proposes a two-stage opinion polarity classification model. Bo th the improved opinion retrieval system and the polarity classification model outperformed the state-of-art systems respect ively on the same data sets. In the future, we plan to study the spam detection techniques to further improve the retrieval effecti veness. This research is supported in part by NSF grant IIS -0738652 and NSF grant IIS-0738727.
