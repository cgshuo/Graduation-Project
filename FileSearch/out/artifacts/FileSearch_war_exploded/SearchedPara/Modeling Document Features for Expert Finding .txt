 We argue that expert finding is sensitive to multiple document features in an organization, and therefore, can benefit from the incorporation of these document features. We propose a unified language model, which integrates multiple document features, namely, multiple levels of asso ciations, PageRank, indegree, internal document structure, a nd URL length. Our experiments on two TREC Enterprise Track collections, i.e., the W3C and CSIRO datasets, demonstrate that the na tures of the two organizational finding for CSIRO and knowledgeable person finding for W3C, influence the effectiveness of different document features. Our work provides insights into which document features work for certain types of expert finding tasks, and helps design expert finding strategies that are effective for different scenarios. H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: H3.1 Content analysis and Indexing; H.3.3 Informa tion Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Experimentation, Measurement, Performance Expert finding, language models, enterprise search attracted lots of attention as evidenced by organization of expert search tasks in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) [1, 5, 7]. by Balog et al [2] for expert fi nding. Petkova and Croft [6] further improved the approach by propos ing a proximity-based document representation for incorporating sequential information. sufficiently considered the effect of document features. In this paper, we propose a unified la nguage modeling approach for taking into account the following document features in expert finding. acknowledgement section of a paper. document retrieval [4]. We will study their effect in expert finding. study their effect in expert finding. occurrences of an expert and topi c terms is an indicator of the expert X  X  relevance to the topic. We will study the effect of multiple levels of associations, a nd their integration with internal document structure in expert finding. Our models are instances of document-centric generative language modeling approaches to rank experts. Formally, given a set D of documents d , a query topic q , and a set C of candidates, the aim is to rank candidates based on the probability p ( c|q )= p(c,q)/p(q) . approach by representing the joint p(c,q) as a weighted average of the document models. that it is uniform for all documents. However, we argue that the estimation of p(d) based on multiple features of d such as its URL performance of expert finding. Assuming PageRank, indegree, and URL length are independent features, we estimate p(d) as functions proposed by Craswell et al [4] for PageRank, URL length, and indegree, respectively. We have and w , a and k are parameters for the sigm transformation. for each document d such that propose using a mixture of components to represent each document. By focusing on the effect of anchor text, we get anchor text part is weighted by (1- X  c )  X  a ,  X  t +  X  maximum likelihood estimate of the term t given the background model, weighted with  X  c . model p(c) to ensure there are no zero probabilities as where p(c) is the probability of candidate c .

We assume that small windows often lead to more probable associations, and large windows result in nosier associations, and weight smaller windows higher than larger ones. different sizes, we estimate p(c|d,q) as where p(w) is the probability for each of the window-based co-occurrence models. document, we combine the internal document structure information with the window-based co-occurrence model. Given a number of text windows where c co-occurs with q as { w estimate p(c|q,d,w) as follows where Given a number of occurrences of c in w i as {c estimated by combining internal document structure as author section of a technical paper. Based on our experiments the TR EC2006 expert search collection on the W3C dataset and TREC2007 expert Search collection on the CSIRO dataset, we have the following findings. of our best MAPs on the two TREC datasets that are both better than previous language model base d approaches [1] and those of the best automatic two-stage model runs in the TREC2006 and TREC2007 expert search tasks [1,7], respectively, even without using techniques such as query processing and query expansion. association discovery should be su fficiently large, e.g., above 100 terms, for both collections. where very few experts per topic are defined, while expert finding on the W3C dataset is a knowledgeable person search where medium sized window should be used for key contact search since these key contact associations with the topic are more focused within medium range, and larg e windows introduce more noise than useful information. Associations of knowledgeable person windows, therefore, large wi ndow sizes should be used. contacts often appear in authoritative documents which attract weight of anchor text leads to better performance than a pure document content based approach for large window sizes. However, anchor texts are le ss effective for knowledgeable person search since many experts may not appear in authoritative documents. which is also the case in document retrieval [4]. Due to the strong correlations between PageRank/indegree and document authority, for all knowledgeable person search. signifying its importance in expert finding on structurally rich datasets. Internal structures and indegree are complementary in expert finding since they describe different aspects of documents.

In order to develop generic expe rt finding approaches applicable to different scenarios, we have demonstrated that it is important and beneficial to study the effect of multiple document features. We proposed a novel approach of integrating document features systematic investigation of the effects of document features in expert finding on two TREC test collections. and its relationships with doc ument features, and effective multiple window combination met hod.
