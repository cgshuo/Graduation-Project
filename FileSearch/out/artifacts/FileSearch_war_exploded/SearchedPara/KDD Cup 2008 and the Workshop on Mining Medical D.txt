 In this report we summarize the KDD Cup 2008 task, which addressed a problem of early breast cancer detection. We describe the data and the challenges, the results and sum-marize the algorithms used by the winning teams. We also summarize the workshop on Mining Medical Data held in conjunction with SIGKDD on August 24, 2008 in Las Ve-gas, NV that brought together researchers working on var-ious aspects of applying machine learning and data mining to challenging tasks in medical and health care domains. KDD CUP 2008 The KDD Cup 2008 was held between May and July 2008. The focus of KDD Cup 2008 was early breast cancer detec-tion from mammogram images using computer-aided detec-tion (CAD). The focus of the challenge was the identification of malignant mass lesions in X-ray images of the breast. In addition to being a life-saving task, early breast-cancer diagnosis from mammograms poses several theoretical chal-lenges to the data mining and machine learning communi-ties. The dataset is highly imbalanced X  X n average only about 5 out of every 1000 asym ptomatic women undergoing routine annual screening have breast cancer. Since breast cancer is typically diagnosed using four images (Mediolateral Oblique and Cranio-Caudal views of each breast), CAD al-gorithms can utilize informati on from multiple images views simultaneously, but they have to figure out how to correlate information across these images. The measures of accuracy relevant for this problem are quite different from the usual 0  X  1 loss that is minimized in the machine learning liter-ature. The data is not independently and identically dis-tributed (iid). The cost of acquiring medical images limits the amount of available training data, so transfer learning and other domain adaptation techniques become crucial to successful design of CAD systems. Hand-engineered sys-tems are extremely labor intensive to develop, and the run time of CAD systems has to be low so architectures like the Viola-Jones cascade are very attractive.
 In order to focus attention on some specific issues within a limited timeframe, the KDD Cup presented two challenges. The first challenge was to maximize area under the Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristics (FROC) curve in the clinically significant region of 0 . 2  X  0 . 3 False posi-tives per image. This task ensures that the proposed CAD systems maximize their sensitivity of cancer detection while maintaining a false positive rate that user-surveys have de-termined to be acceptable to radiologists. The second chal-lenge was to reduce the workload for a radiologist by prepar-ing lists of potentially cancerous patients for further review while ensuring that no patient with a malignancy is missed. We are grateful to Siemens Medical Solutions USA for gener-ously providing data features and the labels. After learning from a training set, the participants were asked to provide results for a held out test dataset for which they were not provided ground truth labels. We received over 200 submis-sions for each challenge, and two teams were declared joint winners: the IBM Predictive Modeling Group, and National Taiwan University.
 Workshop on Mining Medical Data In addition to KDD Cup 2008 we solicited submissions for Workshop on Mining Medical Data, held in conjunction with SIGKDD 2008 on August 24, 2008. The goal of the work-shop was to bring together researchers to discuss challenges that arise in mining medical data, as well as discuss direc-tions for future research. We received over 20 high quality submissions out of which we selected 4 papers for presenta-tion at the workshop. We first describe the KDD Cup 2008 challenge, and then summarize the results received, introduce the winners and summarize the strategies used by the winning teams. Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women today (after lung cancer) and is the most common cancer among women, ex-cept for skin cancers. About 1 . 3 million women are expected to be diagnosed annually with breast cancer worldwide, and about 465,000 will die from the disease. In the United States alone, in 2007 an estimated 240,510 women were expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,460 women are expected to have died from breast cancer [1]. Screening refers to the task of looking for cancer in asymp-tomatic people i.e., before a person has any symptoms of the disease. Cancer screening can help find cancer at an early stage. When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it is often easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun to spread. The good news is that breast cancer death rates have been dropping steadily since 1990, both because of earlier detection via screening and better treatments.
 The most common breast cancer screening test is a mam-mogram. A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast. The ability of a mammogram to find breast cancer may depend on the size of the tumor, the density of the breast tissue, and the skill of the radiologist. The mammogram is considered the standard of care for most asymptomatic women. For instance, in the US , insurance companies routinely reim-burse for an annual screening mammography examination, for all asymptomatic women over the age of 40. These ex-ams are credited with reducing the breast cancer death rate by approximately 30% since 1990.
 However, the reading of screening mammograms is challeng-ing. Findings on a screening mammogram leading to further recall are identified in approximately 5%-10% of patients, even though breast cancer is ultimately confirmed in only three to ten cases in every 1,000 women screened. Perhaps even more importantly, there is compelling evidence that many breast cancers detected at screening mammography are, in retrospect, visible on the previously obtained mam-mograms but have been missed by the interpreting radiolo-gist in the prior year. There are several reasons for this: The complex radiographic structure of breast tissue, particularly in dense breasts; the subtle nature of many mammographic characteristics of early breast cancer; human oversight; poor quality films and even fatigue or distraction are all reasons why cancer is not detected by mammography.
 To overcome the known limitations of human observers, sec-ond (i.e. double) reading of screening mammograms by an-other radiologist has been implemented at many sites. Stud-ies indicate a potential 4%-15% increase in the number of cancers detected with double reading. In a radiology prac-tice that performs 10,000 screening examinations per year, generally between 30-100 cancers per year will be detected. Thus, double reading in this practice could contribute to the diagnosis of 1-15 additional cancers per year. However, this approach results in a doubling of the radiologist-effort so it is not financially viable. Rapid and continuing advances in computer technology, as well as the ready adaptation of radiology images to digital formats, have increased the interest in computer prompting to enable the attending radiologist to act as his or her own second reader. One very promising adaptation of computer-prompting technology is computer-aided detection (CAD) in screening mammography. Current CAD systems demon-strate a high rate of detecting cancerous features on mam-mograms, but further improvements in both sensitivity and specificity would lead to tremendous benefits both in terms of lives saved each year, and in terms of reduction n the workload of radiologists. For the last 8-10 years, US in-surance companies have begun to provide additional reim-bursement to mammographers who run CAD algorithms on the mammograms in other words, physicians are now re-imbursed for running a machine learning algorithm to help them better detect cancer.
 In an almost universal paradigm, the CAD problem is ad-dressed by a 4 stage system: 1. candidate generation which identifies suspicious un-2. feature extraction which computes descriptive features 3. classification which differentiates candidates that are 4. visual presentation of CAD findings to the radiologist In this KDD Cup, we focus on stage 3, learning the classifier to differentiate malignant cancers from other candidates. A breast cancer screen typically consists of 4 x-ray images; 2 images of each breast from different directions (these views are called MLO and CC). Thus, most (but not all) patients would have MLO and CC images of both their breasts, giv-ing a total of 4 images per patient. For the purposes of the KDD Cup, each image is represented by several candidates (see stage 1 above). For each candidate, we provided the im-age ID and the patient ID, ( x,y ) location, several features, and a class label indicating whether or not it is malignant. We provide features computed from several standard image processing algorithms 117 in all but due to confidentiality reasons we were unable to provide some additional propri-etary features. The labels indicated whether a candidate was malignant or benign (based on either a radiologists in-terpretation or a biopsy or both). Note that several candi-dates could correspond to the same lesion. Thus, we also provided a unique lesion-ID for the malignant lesions in the training data. The lesion-ID information was not included in the test data. The classification algorithm has to auto-matically learn how to correlate suspicious regions across the images for test patients.
 Training Data: To support this KDD Cup challenge, training information was provided for a set of 118 malignant patients (patients with at least one malignant mass lesion). We also included data from 1594 normal patients where all candidates are pre-sumed to be benign. The training set consisted of a total of 102,294 candidate ROIs, each described by 117 features, but only an extremely small fraction of these 102,294 candidates was actually malignant. where all candidates are presumed to be benign. The training set consisted of a total of 102,294 candidate ROIs, each described by 117 features, but only an extremely small fraction of these 102,294 candidates was ac-tually malignant.
 Test Data: Data from over 1000 patients was provided without any in-formation about labels. We conducted two different yet closely related challenges based on this data. On the test data, the participants were asked to return scores for each candidate lesion (for challenge 1) and a score for each test patient (for challenge 2). The rate of prevalence of malignant patients in a screening environment is extremely low (on average only around 5-10 patients out of 1000 screening patients have breast cancer). Therefore, in the first challenge, the participating entries were judged in terms of the area under the FROC curve [2] in the clinically relevant region 0.2-0.3 False positives per image. To support this, the participants have to assign a confidence score for every candidate of the test set that in-dicates the confidence of their classifier that the candidate is malignant. A high score of corresponds to absolute con-fidence that the candidate region is malignant, and a low score indicates absolute confidence that the candidate re-gion is benign. In the second challenge, our aim is to reduce the workload for radiologists, by asking them to only read a subset of cases that the algorithm deems at least somewhat unclear or sus-picious. Thus our second challenge is evaluated in terms of the fraction of patients who are labeled as completely nor-mal (not requiring radiologist review of images) such that the CAD algorithms have a 100% sensitivity of the malig-nant patients. CAD systems which failed to have a 100% sensitivity were disqualified from the challenge. To support this challenge, the participants had to indicate whether each patient should be reviewed by a radiologist, or not. The obvious method of classification is to try to build clas-sifiers that simply label each candidate independently. We also provided several ideas for the participants to potentially improve their algorithms.
 Leverage two views of the same breast: Almost always, a cancerous lesion is visible in both views (MLO, CC) of the breast radiologists routinely try to correlate the two views while diagnosing the patient. In rare cases, however, some lesions may only be visible in one view, especially in certain areas of the breast. However, negative candidates may either be present in one view (e.g., for image artifacts) or in both views (e.g., if generated by the presence of benign cyst). Unfortunately, since each view is a 2D image obtained from an orthogonal direction, it is not possible to perfectly reg-ister (i.e., correlate the locations across) the X-ray images using simple algorithms, e.g., using affine transformations. However, some of a lesions features are typically preserved across the two views; particularly, the distance of a lesion from the nipple, and perhaps some of the features themselves relating to size of the lesion, texture, etc. Thus the first idea that may be useful for this challenge is to develop algorithms that simultaneously classify candidates from a pair of images from the same breast. These algorithms could try to exploit correlations in classification decisions for the same region of a breast. To support this, training and testing data sets in-cluded features that identify the ( x,y ) location of the nipple as well as the ( x,y ) location of the candidate. Various researchers have combined multiple views of a mam-mogram to improve detection accuracy [14; 12; 10; 8; 7; 3; 5; 4; 6; 11].
 Class Imbalance: Participants will be able to leverage ideas from classifier design under extreme class imbalance (the vast majority of the regions are normal, and only a small fraction of the regions are actually malignant), and feature selection (a large number of features are proposed and sev-eral of them may not be very useful for the task). The preva-lence rate (malignant patients as a fraction of all patients) may differ between the training and testing sets. Exploit correlations within an image: Participants may de-velop novel algorithms for exploiting potential correlations between the diagnoses of suspicious regions within a single image (e.g. if they are spatially adjacent) [13; 9]. Optimize AUC only in narrow FP range: It may be useful to develop training algorithms to maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC) in a clinically relevant false positive (FP) range, a problem that has not been adequately addressed in the machine learning/data-mining current literature. Around 700 groups registered for the Challenge and down-loaded training and test data. Overall, we received very high quality submissions and results, comparable with several commercially available MammoCAD systems. For Chal-lenge 1 we received around 240 submissions out of which 3 submissions obtained area-under-curve score of over &gt; 0  X  in other words they had an average sensitivity of over 90% for the clinically relevant FP range of 0.2-0.3 average false positives per image. Further, 66 submissions obtained AUC in the range of (0.08, 0.09), and 94 submissions obtained AUC in the range of (0.07, 0.08).
 We received around 200 submissions for Challenge 2. This was a much more difficult challenge and out of these sub-missions, 22 submissions actually qualified by obtaining the necessary 100% sensitivity; however some submissions have achieved this by classifying all candidates as positive and thus failed to help radiologists. Out of the qualifying teams, 1 team obtained specificity of over 60% (IBM Predictive Modeling Group). 2 teams achieved specificity 10%. Out of other submissions, 6 teams achieved sensitivity of over 90% with specificity of over 60% (however they did not qualify as they did not achieve the needed perfect sensitivity). Two teams were able to achieve consistently high scores for both challenges and their results were very close. Both of these teams were well ahead of their competitors. One of the teams discovered a statistical correlation between the a subset of the patient ID range and malignancy of the patient. To our knowledge, this was the only team which was able to detect and take advantage of such correlation. Since using patient ID to predict cancer is unrealistic in real life, in order to be fair to all submissions, we declared 2 winning teams. The winning teams were Predictive Modeling Group, IBM Research that consisted of Claudia Perlich, Prem Melville, Grzegorz Swirszcz, Yan Liu, Saharon Rosset and Richard Lawrence; and National Taiwan University whose members were Hung-Yi Lo, Chun-Min Chang, Tsung-Hsien Chiang, Cho-Yi Hsiao, Anta Huang, Tsung-Ting Kuo, Wei-Chi Lai, Ming-Han Yang, Jung-Jung Yeh, Chun-Chao Yen and Shou-De Lin.
 The two winning teams are publishing a detailed report of their approaches in this issue. The workshop on Mining Medical Data invited the submis-sion of papers related to mining medical data. We also en-couraged winners of the KDD Cup 2008 to submit papers to this workshop describing their entry. However, the workshop was broader in scope, and we also welcomed other submis-sions related to the mining of medical data from structured sources such as structured databases and from unstructured data sources such as medical images, textual notes, etc. We particularly invited papers describing systems that are able to combine all available patient information whether from structured sources or from unstructured sources, to support medical decision making.
 All submitted papers were evaluated by the workshop pro-gram committee based on scientific merits and novelty as perceived by the committee. Accepted papers were pre-sented on August 24, 2008 and appeared in the workshop proceedings.
 We received over 20 submissions out of which 4 papers were accepted to be presented at the workshop. Although we received several additional submissions of a high quality, due to time constraints on our half day workshop we were unable to accept several intriguing and exciting papers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the display of brain structures with high resolution. To fully exploit the potential of this imagining modality, data mining meth-ods are required to reveal subtle differences in brain struc-ture caused by disorders such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early stage Alzheimers disease (AD). The paper by Christian Bhm, Annahita Oswald, Claudia Plant and Bianca Wackersreuther discussed a data mining framework which combined elements from feature selection, clustering, classification to provides a concise visualization of affected areas in the brain. The paper by Ola Caster, Niklas Norn, David Madigan and Andrew Bate demonstrated the first use of shrinkage logis-tic regression as a pattern discovery method for the interna-tional adverse drug reaction surveillance conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO). This novel method is compared to bivariate pattern discovery, the standard ap-proach for detecting adverse drug reactions. The authors results showed that their approach can eliminate false posi-tives and false negatives by using information from other co-variates. It was impressive to see that their approach could have detected drug safety issues earlier than the standard approach (as validated on retrospective data). However, ac-knowledge that their approach cannot completely replace bivariate methods, for two reasons: it fails to identify some established drug safety concerns; and there is a loss of trans-parency which makes the model difficult to interpret for hu-mans. They suggest that their method should be used in parallel with the existing method to detect adverse drug re-actions. Understanding anatomical structure and automatically find-ing and extracting features is a challenging research prob-lem. Chandan Reddy and Fahima Bhuyan discuss a prin-cipled boosting based framework that accomplishes this for biomedical image retrieval. Instead of hand-designing fea-tures based on domain knowledge, an adaptive boosting al-gorithm is employed to automatically identify features and create models for different categories of biomedical images. Experimental results on different biomedical image cate-gories show the robustness and accuracy of the proposed system. Using some standard performance metrics, the pa-per also provides some insights about the complexity of these image categories. The cost of health care, especially for chronic disease treat-ment, is quickly becoming unmanageable. This crisis has motivated the drive towards preventive medicine, where the primary concern is recognizing disease risk and taking action at the earliest signs. Darcy Davis, Nitesh Chawla, Nicholas Blumm, Nicholas Christakis and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi ad-dress this fascinating topic with novel solutions in their pa-per. Universal testing is neither time nor cost efficient. The authors propose CARE, a Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine, which relies only a patients medi-cal history using ICD-9-CM codes in order to predict future diseases risks. CARE combines collaborative filtering meth-ods with clustering to predict each patients greatest disease risks based on their own medical history and that of simi-lar patients. The authors also describe an Iterative version, ICARE, which incorporates ensemble concepts for improved performance. The authors present experimental results on a large Medicare dataset, demonstrating that CARE and ICARE perform well at capturing future disease risks. The KDD Cup 2008 and Workshop on Mining Medical Data website is available at www.kddcup2008.com . The website contains training and test features and labels for the training data; code for evaluation of FROC curve and proceedings to the KDD Cup 2008 and Workshop on Mining Medical Data. The 2008 KDD Cup was an exciting competition that ad-dressed an important and interesting problem with data from a real-world medical application. A large number of teams participated in the challenge, and both winning ap-proaches developed novel theoretical approaches. Overall, the competition was quite strong and we had a number of truly excellent submissions that were comparable to com-mercially available CAD systems in terms of their diagnos-tic accuracy. It is clear from the quality of results that all of the competitors contributed a great amount of effort and creativity into the competition, and we thank them for their efforts.
 The Workshop on Mining Medical Data was a successful event that brought together researchers in Data Mining who address important problems in medical domain (such as MRI image analysis and predictive modeling of diseases). At this event the KDD Cup winners also presented their results and algorithms. The workshop was attended by over 70 peo-ple and many of whom were actively involved in discussions. The discussions were interesti ng and often quite passionate, and suggested a number of interesting and important direc-tions for future work. We hope that this workshop will spur continued research into the many challenges that need to be addressed by medical decision support systems.
