 We demonstrate the ReaSoN portal, consisting of interactive web-based tools for visualizing, exploring, querying, and in-tegrating academic social networks. We describe how these networks are automatically extracted from bibliographic and citation databases, discuss notions of visibility in such net-works which enable a rich set of social network analysis, and demonstrate our novel tools for the visualization and explo-ration of social networks.

Social network analysis aims at uncovering and under-standing the underlying structures that simultaneously re-flect and influence the activities, opinions, and perceptions of a community engaged in a common activity. Since the early days of the field, networks are represented as graphs whose nodes correspond to the social actors and whose edges denote relations between such actors. The field has gained in activity with the maturity of computational machinery to handle large-scale graphs, and, more recently, the auto-mated gathering of social data from various aspects of our lives [5].

One particularly interesting community of practice, whose members relate to each other through a variety of relations thus creating a complex social network, is that of academic researchers. Academic social networks have already been the subject of some study with respect to the patterns of co-authorship relations, the relationship between collabora-tive research and, most notably, the productivity and the choice of topics of researchers. Nevertheless, the area re-mains rich with interesting questions. For instance, under-standing the interplay between quantitative and qualitative notions of performance. Two examples would be compar-ing the productivity (say, number of publications) of a re-searcher with her visibility (the importance of those citing her work), and comparing the strength of a researcher X  X  so-cial relations (number of coauthors for instance) with her impact (the influence that her work may have on her field).
We demonstrate ReaSoN: a comprehensive set of tools for extracting, visualizing and exploring academic networks to help answer such questions. The networks we explore are derived from bibliographic and citation data, using state-of-the-art techniques for the integration and cleansing of bib-liographic data.
ReaSoN is aninteractive web portal offering tools for the navigation and exploration of social networks and an intu-itive query interface for querying such networks. ReaSoN in-corporates several metrics of network visibility , which are in-grained in the visualization tools X  X hus allowing for effective social network analysis. The current implementation of Rea-SoN is online at http://hypatia.cs.ualberta.ca/reason . The Database. In its current form, the publications in Rea-SoN are those in the intersection of the ACM Digital Library (DL) and the DBLP database. As for citations, we use those provided by the DL and DBLP, and we also extract new ones by matching citation strings against the publications in our database. We consider all citation strings in the DL and we also extract citations from Google X  X  Scholar service for database venues which are not as well covered in the DL (e.g, IEEE publications). All metadata available from the DL and from DBLP are kept in ReaSoN. In total, our system has 485,267 pub lications; 379, 188 unique autho rs; 1,301,365 citations; 3,793 venues (among which 2,355 are conference series and 623 are journals); and 1,865 organizations (among which 1,153 are affiliated with a university).

We build on state-of-the-art duplicate detection meth-ods [1] to produce our database. Modifications were nec-essary for performance reasons (current techniques were not scalable enough for the amount of data we have), as well as for accuracy reasons (e.g., to account for publications with many  X  X opies X  such as keynotes in more than one con-ference). As for accuracy, we achieve 96% precision (i.e., papers correctly matched) and 88% recall (i.e., papers that should be matched). We also extract metadata about nodes, such as the affiliation history of authors, achieving and 91% precision and 86% recall for this task.

From the database above we build the following networks: We performed standard statistical tests (e.g., analysis of degree-distribution) on all networks we create. As expected, they all conform with the standard of social networks [2]. Network Visibility. There are many ways of measuring rep-utation or importance in a social network [7]. In ReaSoN, we use network visibility as a proxy for importance [3]. This metric, introduced by Katz [4] in 1953, is in effect an el-egant generalization of PageRank [6]. Unlike in a random walk, our notion of visibility is inherently biased : e.g., the visibility of a paper depends on the accumulated visibility of the venue of that paper over the years, which, in turn, is re-inforced by visibility of the papers accepted at the venue. Naturally, visibility is a primary feature in ReaSoN: e.g., we use it to rank answers to queries and to determine the nodes to prioritize when exploring the network.
 Analysis. ReaSoN provides several standard  X  X go-centric X  visualizations for each kind of social actor: i.e., pages that show a summary of all that is known about individual actors. For instance, the ego-centric visualization of an author pro-vides that author X  X  homepage and affiliation history (which is inferred from metadata in their publications). We anno-tate each affiliation with their corresponding geographical data: country, state/province an city, allowing some inter-esting visualizations. We also show various h-index scores [8] (calculated based on the current year), as well as a tag cloud of the keywords from the author X  X  papers. One novel visu-alizations we provide is a summary of the author X  X  connec-tions, consisting of pie-charts illustrating the most impor-tant coauthors and venues, as well as the most productive years and the publications with highest visibility. Finally, ReaSoN also provides the evolution of the author X  X  visibil-ity over time from different perspectives (e.g., disregarding nepotistic citations).

ReaSoN also offers  X  X ocio-centric X  analysis tools allowing for comparing the visibility of papers, venues, and research topics in many different ways. For instance, one can find the evolution in visibility of the top-k papers from a given venue, which is invaluable in determining impact and could be useful in giving  X  X est of time X  awards to most influential authors or papers. Similarly, one can compare the accumu-lated visibility of different venues X  X hich would be particu-larly helpful in determining inexperienced authors in where to submit their work. Finally, ReaSoN also allows the visual-ization of the popularity of research topics over time as well as geographically, which allows the identification of trends, both globally and within specific venues.
 Querying and Exploring. ReaSoN offers an interactive in-terface for browsing the network allowing the switch from/to the ego-centric views of actors for further exploration. The tool is customizable allowing the hiding of different kinds of nodes and edges on demand. Moreover, ReaSoN has an interface for user-defined exploratory queries, whose results are visualized using the same rich interactive tools used for the static-predefined analysis discussed above. Our query engine allows for the seamless integration of data from mul-tiple social networks (e.g., we have plugins for dbbedia and facebook), thus opening up the possibility of analyzing aca-demic social networks in personalized ways (e.g., focusing on the work of one X  X  own acquaintances).
Many Digital Libraries and related services exist today to facilitate the storage and search of bibliographic and cita-tion databases (e.g., the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, DBLP, CiteSeer, Google Scholar, Microsoft X  X  Libra, etc.). Other online services provide rankings of venues, most no-tably journals (e.g., ISI X  X  impact factor, eigenfactor.org , etc.). Other kinds of tools are beginning to flourish, aimed at helping researchers and educators engage in their commu-nity by creating and maintaining portals (e.g., Purdue Uni-versity X  X  HubZero 1 ). Unlike these tools, ReaSoN is aimed at uncovering (i.e., exploring and visualizing) the complex relations underlying research activities which are latent in such bibliographic and citation databases. In doing so, Rea-SoN contributes to the understanding as well as fostering of the social networks underlying academic research. Our work in ReaSoN is ongoing. We are expanding the portal with means of extracting other relations (namely: service to the community through editorial and program commit-tee participation, and supervisory relationships), automated ways of continuous gathering of information, and integration with more bibliographic data from other sources.

The demonstration will cover all aspects of the ReaSoN project, focusing on the novel visualization and exploration tools, as well as our social network querying interface (whose details we omit due space restrictions).
