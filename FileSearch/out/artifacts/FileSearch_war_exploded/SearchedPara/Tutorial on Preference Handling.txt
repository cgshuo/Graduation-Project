 I.2 [ Artificial Intelligence ]: Miscellaneous; H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval-Information Filtering; H.3.4 [ Information Technology and Systems Appli-cations ]: Decision Support; G.m [ Mathematics of Computing ]: Miscellaneous preferences, utility theory, decision-making under uncertainty, rep-resentation languages, preference elicitation, preference aggrega-tion, preference learning, argumentation This tutorial, addressed to researchers and practitioners in the area of recommendation systems, reviews the foundations of decision theory and utility theory, focusing on methods for representing, learning and reasoning with preferences. Recent advances on han-dling preferences will also be discussed, with a focus on preference learning, preference aggregation and preferences in argumentation. Finally, we will show how these techniques can be used in a prac-tice in recommender systems.
The tutorial aims at introducing the general field that deals with techniques for representing, learning and reasoning with prefer-ences. While the community of Recommender Systems have re-cently done extensive work in techniques for providing user rec-ommendations in different settings, preferences have been formally studied since several decades (the community that studies prefer-ences from a formal algorithmic point of view is now often called algorithmic decision theory ).

Preferences are a basic concept for several research fields such as economics, decision theory, game theory, artificial intelligence, classification, data bases, etc.; preferences constitute a key con-cept for the development of recommender systems since they rep-resent the elementary information upon which recommendations are constructed. The tutorial will introduce both the formalisms
