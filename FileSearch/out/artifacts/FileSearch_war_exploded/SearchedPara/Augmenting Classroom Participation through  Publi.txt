 An emerging trend in classroom technology research is the use of computer mediated communication (CMC) tools in classrooms to encourage students X  in-class participa tion. As part of this research thread, we have been investigating the potential of public digital backchannels for building feelings of community among students in university courses. We designed, deployed and evaluated such a tool in a 15-week field study of two undergraduate classes. We found students found using public backchannel during the class is of little distraction, that teachers X  attention to the content posted on the channel influence students X  tendency to use tools of this kind. Further, we found that the relevance of the content shared is predictive of students X  use of ClasCommons in the classroom; these feelings in turn are related to students X  perceptions of self-efficacy, collective efficacy and course-specific social support. We also analyzed the content posted in the public backchannel and considered the benefits and drawbacks of the public digital from both students X  and teachers X  perspectives. We conclude with suggestions for improving the desi gn and deployment of course-related backchannels. H5.3. Group and Organization Interfaces: Web-based interaction. Design, Experimentation. Backchannel, sense of community, public display. In many college classrooms, stude nts are passive spectators. The professor arrives and gives a lect ure; students learn individually by listening and taking notes. This model of teaching in classes is called the transmittal model whereby students learn by passively receiving knowledge from the teacher. However, according to social-constructivist theories of learning, knowledge cannot be simply pulled from textbooks or  X  X oured X  from teachers X  heads to students X  heads. Instead knowledge is constructed by engaging individual learners to actively apply prior knowledge when mak-ing sense of new information, allowing the new content to be further elaborated as knowledge embedded in their minds. Under this theoretical perspective, th e knowledge construction process is influenced by the surrounding community in which a learner op-erates (i.e., her social context). In contrast to the transmittal model in which students are passive information recipients, the social constructivist model places students at the center of the learning process  X  they operate as active learners[1, 2]. Currently, active learning has been recommended as one of the seven principles for good practices in undergraduate education[3]. Many active learning techniques have focused on participation in a range of in-class activities like discussion, writing and talking. Class discussion (incl uding discussion, deba te, questioning, ex-plaining, etc.) is often noted as a common and effective strategy for promoting active learning[3]. However, there is evidence that the typical university classroom setting includes obstacles for maximum effectiveness of active learning techniques like class-wide discussions. For example, it is common to find in university classes that (a) vocal students consume most of the scarce in-class discussion time; (b) the teacher acts as a  X  X age on the stage, X  con-trolling everything going on in the class; (c) some students may have negative feelings if they are called on by surprise; and (d) some students suppress their question until the end of the class. In this paper, we present a design and empirical evaluation of a public digital backchannel discu ssion tool  X  ClassCommons  X  to encourage students X  participation and examine students X  sense of community over an extended period of time. The term  X  X ackchannel X  is used to describe a non-primary com-munication channel between sp eakers and listeners, through which feedback is given from listeners to speakers in unintrusive ways to show interest, attention and other reactions [4]. Examples of face-to-face backchannels are body language like eyebrow raising or brief requests for clar ification (e.g.,  X  X hat? X ) or con-firmation (e.g.,  X  X ight. X ). Resear ch has shown that backchannels are important for maintaining communication efficiency[5]. In classrooms, students can use backchannels to interact with the teacher in an efficient and unintrusive manner. For example stu-dents use backchannels when they nod their heads to show that they understand a topic being discussed or they shake their heads to indicate that they do not understand it, and the teacher may adjust his or her lecture based on such feedback. However as the size of audience increases, backcha nnels are harder to establish and the communication between the speaker and the audience loses quality. It is hard for a speaker to perceive multiple simulta-neous feedbacks from different liste ners; visual signals are quick-ly lost in a crowd [6]. As a result, speakers tend to focus only on a few audience members and their individual backchannels. In situ-ations with a large audience (e.g., a large lecture class), it is common that just a few individuals engage actively in backchan-nel communications with the speaker. In studies of computer-mediated communication, the concept of backchannel has been expanded to denote an online chat that runs in parallel to other communication activities. For example, while the instructor is giving lecture in the front, students may be using a backchannel to talk to each other at the same time using IM or an online chat room. Yardi reported an analysis of such chat logs and found evidence that the backchannel discussion supported peer-to-peer learning[7]. More generally, researchers and e ducators have explored a range of technology interventions that might facilitate interaction be-tween the teachers and students in classrooms. While there are multiple researches on using backchannel to support audience participation in conferences[8], in this review, we only focus on related work in classroom setti ngs. For instance, classroom re-sponse systems allow the teacher to present multiple choice or true/false questions; students can then respond to these with spe-cialized handheld  X  X oting X  devices, perhaps resulting in a public display of aggregated results [9-11]. While such systems can in-crease class participation, they have drawbacks. First, they need special hardware, typically purchased by or provided for each student. Second, the teacher-student interaction is very structured and limited. The instructor cannot obtain a rich understanding of what students are thinking. Third, interactions occur only at the teacher X  X  initiative. While a touted benefit of using these systems is to support students who are too shy to speak up in class, it is still the teacher who initiates the interaction. Students continue to be relatively passive actors who react to teacher-initiated issues. Other text-based classroom technologies offer students an oppor-tunity to engage in richer inter actions with the instructor. Active Class uses PDAs for classroom communication: students can post text questions to the teacher during lectures, using a handheld device. A teaching assistant (TA) may respond to these questions during class, or the teacher may choose to address some questions. When this system was used in undergraduate computer sciences classes, the researchers found that it helped teachers get timely feedback from the students, ove rcame student apprehension in large classes, and enabled multiple students to ask questions at the same time[12]. Classroom Presenter extended the concept of a backchannel by allowing students to annotate a slide being discussed by the teacher; the resulting notes are publicly displayed in the class-room. A trial of this system found that it increased class participa-tion in classes from multiple disciplines [13, 14]. The Harvard Live Question Tool allows stude nts to submit answers to ques-tions that are raised by the teacher; the answers are displayed publicly in the class. No formal evaluations have been conducted to study the impact of this tool, although it has been recommend-ed by Educause as an effective way to encourage students X  partic-ipation and students-teacher interaction[15]. Fragmented Social Mirrors (FSM) [6] is another tool that was investigated as a public backchannel in classrooms. Students can post messages during the lecture; they can also indicate whether the message is a question, or if they simply want the instructor to slow down. The message is project ed on a separate screen in the classroom. The system was tested in 6 class sessions (3 of them used FSM and the other 3 did not use FSM) and found that FSM encouraged students X  initiatives in classrooms. The studies cited above have eval uated the effects of classroom backchannels, but only for a limite d period of time (usually 1-2 class periods), leaving longer te rm impacts unknown. Also, it is not yet clear what factors may influence students X  willingness to adopt such tools in their classe s. Thirdly, although researchers have discussed the advantages of using public backchannels in classrooms, less attention has been paid to the potential problems with such technology. This study ai ms to fill these gaps in this field of research. The current re search benefits from a long term implementation and deployment of a classroom public backchan-nel tool in two classes. We seek to find the answers to questions including the factors influencing st udents X  adoption of this kind of tool, its long term impact on students X  sense of community, and the benefits and drawbacks of tools of this kind in classrooms. The design of ClassCommons is drawn from a general design concept wherein people are offered a common interaction space to interact with one another virtually while in a shared physical envi-ronment. Thus the design requirements for ClassCommons are relatively simple: accept input from students, present students X  submitted content in a controlled fa shion, and manage the display of this input. The ClassCommons system accomplishes this with three basic components; there is a client device (any device with web browsing capability can be used, e.g., web-enabled mobile phones, laptops), a server and a large public display. The goals of ClassCommons are similar to the impromptu back-channel activity studied by Yardi [7], but the tool differs in the following respect: the backchannel discussion is public, whereas in the Yardi study students simply talked to each other without any teacher involvement. In fact, ClassCommons emphasizes the public nature of the chat by integrating a large display visible to all. Previous studies of ClassCo mmons found that students used ClassCommons to socialize with peers, make suggestions for course changes, share informa tion, and seek help, facilitating feelings of community[16, 17]. The system used in this study is an improved version of the earlier prototype. Usability bugs (e.g., display readability) were addressed and new features were added, including: a) options to post emoticons, videos and photos; b) a liking function; c) threaded interaction; and d) public anonymity and private accountability (PAPA). Fu rther, the previous studies were short term study and it was only evaluated in 2 class periods, leaving the long term impact unknown. Any device with access to the Internet can be a client. To contrib-ute, students log in to a posting we bsite (Figure 1) with their uni-versity account and credentials. St udents can post text messages, images and Youtube videos from the client interface. Students can choose to post with their real name or enter an alias when posting. The messages students post are shown on the public display in the front of the classroom. Students can reply to messages already posted on the client interface and can  X  X ike X  individual messages The number after Like on Figure 2 indicates how many students have liked that message. The messages are displayed in real time on the public display, viewable to all the students as well as the teacher in the classroom. In the current version, messages ar e displayed in a  X  X irst In First Out X  (FIFO) fashion, namely the messages posted earlier are dis-played first. The most recent message appears at the top the pub-lic display with a red new icon in the front. Whenever a new mes-sage is posted, older message s will be pushed downward. If a video or image is posted, a thumbnail of the video/image will be displayed at the right side of the display. The instructor can then decide whether to play the video or not in the class. Figure 2 shows the layout of the public display. Public Anonymity and Pr ivate Accountability (PAPA) : The system implements a policy know n as public anonymity and pri-vate accountability (PAPA). Students can choose whether to use their real name or enter an alias when posting a message. Howev-er if a student uses an alias, th e teacher can still discover the iden-tity of the sender. This was implemented because findings from a previous study[17] indicated that students who are shy are con-cerned about having their real na me displayed on the public dis-play. But on the other hand, complete anonymity could lead to more mischief. The PAPA feature allows students to choose pub-lic anonymity with respect to their classmates but still be held accountable by their teacher. ClassCommons was used in 2 classes for 15 weeks in the fall 2011 semester, from Aug.29 th to Dec. 9 th , in a large university in Northeast America. One class was about project management (PM) and had 67 students, with 16 females and 51 males. PM met twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays for 75 minutes each time. The teacher for PM was a senior instructor teaching this course for the third time. The second class was about human computer interaction (HCI) and had 50 students, with 7 fema les and 43 males. HCI met three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for 50 minutes each time. The instructor of this course was a junior in-structor teaching HCI for the first time. Students in both classes were juniors and seniors, and 4 males and 1 female were members of both cl asses. Both classes are required courses in the undergraduate curri culum. Students were offered up to two extra credit points for participating in the study; this offer was made at the start of the semester when they were invited to complete a background survey. The amount of extra credit they received was determined by their level of participation (the num-ber of messages posted) . Students were not required to participate in the research study to gain access to ClassCommons. We chose these courses as testbeds for ClassCommons for two reasons. One is that both courses are mid-to large-size classes where  X  X eelings of disconnectedness are common among stu-dents X  [18]. Thus we hoped that building a sense of community within students would improve th e quality of students X  education-al experience. The second reason was more pragmatic  X  these two courses were taught in classroom s where every student has a lap-top to use during the class, making it possible for every student to interact with ClassCommons if/when desired. Figure 3 shows the setup of ClassC ommons in the 2 classes. The larger public display on the left is used by the teacher to project lecture slides; the second smalle r public display on the right con-tains the content posted through ClassCommons. The public dis-play was 5 X  (width) x 6 X  (height); pilot testing ensured that the font size used was legible from every location in the class. The instructors chose to use different policies regarding the use of ClassCommons in their classes. The PM instructor allowed no posting of entertaining messages or any message unrelated to class content; in contrast the HC I instructor had no constraints and welcomed any content. This difference in usage protocol had consequences for how students used ClassCommons during the semester and we will report this in the result section. We used multiple methods for data collection, including a pre-survey (before using ClassCommons), a mid-survey (about half way through the semester) and a post-survey (at the end of the semester). We also archived the ClassCommons usage logs, con-ducted a small set of interviews and recorded informal observa-tions. In the pre-survey, we collected a set of background charac-teristics for participating students as well as initial values for per-ceived sense of community. We us ed the subsequent surveys to assess potential changes in sense of community as well as to ex-amine students X  perceptions about the system and about their course efficacy as individuals and as a class. We now describe the measures in more detail. Pre-survey. Before ClassCommons wa s introduced, students were invited to complete a background survey. They were offered extra credit at this point for agreeing to serve as research participants (all students were able to use ClassCommons regardless of their participation in the evaluation process). We gathered information about participants X  interests in in teracting with the instructor and other students and their experiences with using social media tools like Facebook, Twitter and online discussion forums were gath-ered. We used 7-point Likert scales from prior research to meas-ure personal variables, including Extroversion , classroom anxie-ty ( CAnxiety ) and public speaking apprehension ( PApprehen-sion ) [19-21]. Because we were particularly interested in how ClassCommons might affect students X  feelings of connectedness with one another, we measured sense of community at multiple points including prior to ClassCommons use ( PreSOC ). For this construct we adapted an existing scale of seventeen items [21, 22]. Example items were:  X  X  feel that I am enc ouraged to ask questions in this class X ;  X  X  feel that I belong when I am in this class X ;  X  X  have a say about what goes on in this class X ; and  X  X  feel connected to the class X , covering the four dimensions of sense of community, namely fulfillment of learning need, membership, influence and shared emotional connection[22]. We assessed scale reliability with Cronbach X  X  alpha coefficient, which was 0.88 for the PreSOC data. According to[23], a value of over 0.5 is acceptable for a scale intended to measure a single psychological construct. Mid-survey. At the beginning of the seventh week, students were invited to complete another survey, where we again measured sense of community ( MidSOC ). We included other measures in this survey as well but for lack of space do not report further analysis of these data. Post-survey. At the end of the fifteenth week, students were invit-ed to complete another online survey. Once more we assessed sense of community ( PostSOC ). We probed reactions to the messa ges that had been posted: the relevance of the content ( Content Relevance ); the extent to which the student feels s/he can learn something new from the messages ( Learn New Information ); and general interest ( Inter-est ). These three judgments were made on a 7-point scale from 1: not at all to 7: very much. We also asked students to which degree they felt that ClassCommons was a distraction in the classroom ( Distraction ). This judgment was made on a 5-point scale from 1: Not distracting at all, to 5: very distracting. Finally, we used two open-ended questions to probe st udents X  general feelings about ClassCommons, namely what they liked most about and least about it. The post-survey also asked students to report how much attention they felt their instructor had paid to the messages posted on ClassCommons during the semester ( Teacher Attention; from 1: none to 5: very much). At this poi nt, we also gathered self-reports about Use of ClassCommons . We did this with three 5-point Likert scale items scale (Cronb ach X  X  alpha= 0.74). The questions were  X  X ow often did you glance at the public display for ClassCommons in the class? X ;  X  X ow often did you check the ClassCommons system on your own workstation in the class? X  (1: Never, 5: Very often) and  X  X ow many messages did you read? X  (1: I did not read any of them, 5: I read every comment). To investigate relationships be tween ClassCommons and class performance we assessed students X  feelings of efficacy in the class, both for themselves and as a collective. Self-efficacy is the belief that one is capable of performing in a certain manner to attain a certain set of goals[24]; it is a strong predictor of people X  X  actual performance[25]. In this case we developed four 7-point Likert scales to assess self-efficacy in the context of the classes the students were taking (Cronbach X  X  alpha= 0.73). Example items were:  X  X  can have an impact on class discussions, even though I am only one member in a relatively large group of stu-dents. X ;  X  X ven though I may have tr ouble at first, I can master the concepts that come up in this course X . Collective-efficacy is similar to self-efficacy but refers to beliefs about joint endeavors and joint outcomes[26]. It was measured using six 7-point Likert scales that we designed for this study (Cronbach X  X  alpha= 0.90). Exam ple items were:  X  X UR CLASS can ensure that all members' ideas are cons idered, even if one idea does not seem to fit X ;  X  X UR CLASS can ensure that everybody gets a chance to contribute to discussions, even though we are not all comfortable speaking up X . Finally, we included a measure of Social support to investigate how students X  class-specific social networks might relate to the other variables being a ssessed. Social support is defined as feeling that one is cared for by and has assistance available from other people and that one is part of a supportive social network. Stu-dents X  feeling of social support was measured using six 7-point Likert scales developed for this purpose (Cronbach X  X  alpha= 0.81). Example items were:  X  X f I wanted to do some extra studying for a quiz, I would have a hard time fi nding someone to study with me X ;  X  X f I wanted to form a small readi ng group to study for this class, I could easily find others to join me X . Log data. All the messages students pos ted to the public display were logged on the server. Log da ta include the messages, the images, the videos and the Likes students voted. Interviews . At the end of the semester, 10 semi-structured inter-views were conducted to understand students X  and teachers X  (the instructors and the TAs) feelings about using ClassCommons. Six students, two instructors and tw o TAs were interviewed. The interviews lasted from 20 to 30 minutes. Five of the students were in both classes; one was enrolled in HCI only. We selected the dual-enrolled students because they could pro-vide us a rich understanding of possible differences between the two classes, including whether a nd how such differences might have influenced their use of Cl assCommons. In addition, these 5 students used ClassCommons to different extents. Some posted more than 50 messages while othe rs posted fewer than 10. The sixth student was selected from HCI because he used the system frequently and in many different ways. During the student interviews, we asked about motivations for using ClassCommons, perceptions of benefits and drawbacks of ClassCommons, and the differences if any that they perceived between PM and HCI (except for the sixth student); we also asked for suggestions about how to improve ClassCommons. In the interviews with the instructors a nd TAs, we asked about perceived benefits and drawbacks of ClassCommons. On-site observation. Observations were carried out during the class. One researcher was in the classroom observing students X  use of this system during the whole semester. We gathered a variety of data, much of it obtained through sur-veys. In some cases we repeated scales from one survey to the next. In presenting our findings, we first give an overview of measures from the pre-survey and post-survey that form the basis of the multivariate analysis reported later; we also summarize the ClassCommons usage data. We th en provide a more detailed dis-cussion of differences between the PM and HCI class, exploratory regression analyses of ClassCommons use, and a content analysis of the messages contri buted by students. ClassCommons was used in both classes from for 15 weeks. The first class session was used for familiarization with ClassCom-mons, so messages posted on that day are not included. Students rated their use of social network sites like Facebook, micro-blogging like Twitter and online forums (1: never use, 2: few times a year, 3: few times a month, 4: few times a week, 5: everyday, 6: several times a day). Most students used social net-work sites (SNS) like Facebook often, with 76.3% of the students in PM class and 88.5% of the st udents in HCI class reporting that they use Facebook at least once a day. In contrast, micro-blogging is not as popular, with only about 20% of the students using a tool like Twitter every day (PM: 20.4%, HCI: 22.9%). Reported use of online forums was even more rare. Table 1 summarizes variables measured in the pre-survey that were used in the analysis reported in Section 6.3. As the means suggest, students reported being m oderately interested in having interactions with the teacher and other students (a bit higher than the neutral point of 3.0 on a 5 point scale). With respect to the personal variables, the mean values suggest that these students are somewhat extroverted (just above the mid-point of the 7-point scale), not particularly anxious about being in the classroom, and a bit apprehensive about public speaking. The two classes do not differ on these variables. Variable Class Mean (S.D.) Interest interacting with teachers PM 3.69(0.73) Interest interacting with students PM 3.75(0.65) Extroversion (index of 7 items) PM 4.72 (0.44) Class anxiety (index of 20 items) PM 3.26 (0.43) 
Public speaking apprehension (in-dex of 6 items) Table 2 summarizes students X  sel f-report of ClassCommons use, gathered at the end of the semester in the post-survey. The first three items in the table refer to students X  ratings of the content they have been viewing on the public display over the semester (i.e., did they like using it, is the content relevant, and can they learn new things from the posts). In general these ratings were in the positive direction (collapsing across classes, each rating is significantly greater than the neutral value of 4.0, p&lt;.001). At the same time, we can begin to see some possible differences between the two classes, with the HCI class reporting a higher value for Interest in ClassCommons than th e PM class (t(92)=2.06, p&lt;.05). A similar difference emerges in the judgments concerning how much attention the instructor paid to the system (t(91)=4.0, p&lt;.001). Although we have no other measures of teacher in-volvement in ClassCommons, it seems that at least from the stu-dent perspective there is a difference across classes. The informal notes taken by the first author while in class were also consistent with this impression. Variable Class Mean (S.D.) Interest* PM 4.89 (1.16) Content Relevance PM 4.66 (1.14) Learn New Information PM 4.98 (1.09) Teacher Attention** PM 2.94 (1.0) 
Use of ClassCommons (index of 3 items) Students did not find using ClassC ommons in the class was dis-tracting (collapsing across classes, each rating is significantly greater than the mid -point value of 3.0, t(92)= -8.87, p&lt;.001). On the 5 point scale, students felt th at using ClassCommons was of little distraction to them. We also asked more directly fo r ClassCommons use reports. As explained earlier, the index in the table combines students X  esti-mated frequency (on a 5-point scale) of glancing at the public display, checking in on the system using their own machine, and reading messages. The average value is greater than the mid-point of 3.0 (t(92)=3.6, p&lt;.001), but while there is a trend for these self-reports to be higher for the HCI class than the PM class, this dif-ference falls sort of significance (t (91)=1.67, p&lt;.10). Nonetheless, in combination with the contrasts of liking and teacher attention, these data suggest that system use and acceptance varied across the two classes. We will return to this point later. Table 3 summarizes psychological variables measured in the third survey. A scan of the means sugge sts that perceptions of social support from other students, and both self-and collect-efficacy are moderately high but that they do not vary across classes. Variable Class Mean (S.D.) Social Support (index of 6 items) PM 5.41 (1.08) Self-efficacy (index of 4 items) PM 5.57 (0.75) Collective-efficacy (index of 6 items) PM 5.48 (0.86) Finally, ClassCommons usage logs provided good evidence of participation, though again this appears to vary across classes. In PM, 47.8% of the students (32 of 67) in PM posted messages in the system at least once, while 84% of the students (42 out of 50) in HCI did so; a chi square test of these frequencies confirms that 641 messages were posted and 254 Likes were voted. Table 4 shows the detailed use of ClassCommons. Note that the teaching assistant in both classes contribut ed messages, generally in re-sponse to questions. Again the cla sses differed in this, with the TA contributing almost 20% of th e messages for PM but just over 5% for HCI. 
Class Participation Messages HCI 84.0% 557 (527/30) 159 716 Recall that ClassCommons supports posting of photos and videos in addition to text. Across both cl asses, 76 images were posted, but video content was not common in students X  postings; only five video clips were posted, and all of these were in HCI. Table 5 shows the details of the dist ribution of multi-media posts. Class Photos Videos Sum Students in both classe s made heavy use of the PAPA option (us-ing an anonymous handle when pos ting), but use of this feature was more common in HCI than PM. In the HCI class, 77.9% of the messages were posted under an alias and in the PM class, 60.7% of the messages were posted under an alias (  X  2 (1,N=592) = 10.00, p&lt;.05, only messages posted by students were included in this analysis). That is, students in HCI class tended to post using an alias more often than students in PM. In general, students enjoyed usi ng ClassCommons and the majori-ty of students in both classes w ould like to use ClassCommons in other classes. In the post-survey , we asked whether they would like to use ClassCommons in future classes. 88.68% of the re-spondents (47 out of 53) in PM and 92.68% of the respondents (38 out of 41) in HCI indicated that they would like to do so. One pervasive result concerning Cl assCommons use is its differ-ential impact on the two different classes: students in the HCI class used the system more and used it in more ways; they also reported that they liked it more and that their instructor paid more attention to the messages being displayed. To better understand why these differences may have emerged, we interviewed stu-dents, teachers and TAs for opinions about these differences. The fact that five of our interview ees had been in both classes was particularly useful in probing for explanations. In reviewing their comments, three themes emerged: the nature of the course topic, the amount of attention the teacher paid to the content posted on ClassCommons, and the instructors X  teaching style. The richness of the course material and the difficulty of the sub-ject played an important role. Compared to the PM class, students in the HCI class found the course ma terial to be more interesting and therefore more likely to evoke backchannel comments. For example, S1 (Student1) said  X  X  think PM, the subj ect is pretty dry. It is not interesting, and then human computer interaction (HCI) is a lot more interesting, a lot more fun. There is a lot more hu-man touch to that class X  . The TA for PM commented  X  X t might be the material of PM is pretty straightforward. You just store the knowledge and learn. Maybe if you have a math class or some-thing, where you have to apply what you learn to solve problems, students might use it more (to ask questions). X  A second factor was the attention the teacher paid to the messages on ClassCommons. We reported earlier the survey finding that students in HCI reported that their instructor paid greater attention to the backchannel than those in PM. In the interviews, students opined that their instructor X  X  acknowledgement of ClassCommons messages encouraged them to use it more. S5 mentioned that  X  X  think it (the message) is more acknowledged in HCI. The profes-sor kind of actually looked up at the public display. The questions are usually acknowledged, read and answered....(In PM class), he did not really look up at the display much  X  . S4 said that  X  X he fact that the professor acknowledges th e display encourages student to use the display. They acknowle dge the posts on ClassCommons, they address the questions on ClassCommons, and it makes it more useful, more popular X  . This combination of survey and interview data emphasizes the critical role of teacher attention in adoption and use of technologies like ClassCommons. Finally, students are more likely to use ClassCommons in classes whose instructor adopts a more personal approach to teaching. For example, S2 said that  X  (instructor of HCI) is very personal the way he teaches it. Whereas PM is much more of a big class, I found that it was more impersonal.  X  S4 commented that  X  X n PM, the instructor seems stricter.  X  The PM teacher was quite senior relative to the HCI teacher and this may have influenced their teaching style and students X  subsequent reaction to and motivation to engage with them via the back channel. In general, though, the backchannel is intended for relatively informal exchange, so it would make sense that professors who exhibit a more informal teaching style might encourage more participation. To gain insights into how ClassC ommons affected students X  class-room experiences, we carried out a series of exploratory multiple regression procedures. Given the scarcity of past related work, our goal in this was not to formulate and test hypotheses but rather to build conceptual models of inter-re lated factors that might be used to guide future research. To in crease the power of our analysis, we used the combined data from the two classes in all regressions. Because many of the predictor variables are correlated, we used stepwise regression; in this approach multiple dependent variables are used to predict a single outcome variable, and are added to the model only when they account for variance not already accounted for by other variables[27]. Several student characteristics were assessed a nd regressed on their starting Sense of Community (PreSOC). For example we expected that students X  Classr oom Anxiety might negatively im-pact their starting Sense of Community, whereas Extroversion would show a positive relation. As expected, the regression model for PreSOC revealed a significant positive relation of Extrover-sion (p&lt;.05) and a negative relati on of Class Anxiety (p&lt;.01); no other student variables provided e xplanatory power in the model, which accounted for 39.5% of the variance. A number of variables might influence students X  use of ClassCommons. In Section 6.2 we discussed some of the differ-ences between classes that seemed to play a role in this, but we also wanted to explore student va riables, both in terms of their personal characteristics and their beliefs about the usefulness or interest of the ClassCommons system. For instance one would expect that students who believe ClassCommons provides rele-vant content would find themselves using it more. To investigate this we regressed the variable s from the first model (PreSOC, Extroversion, and Class Anxiety) and the four system ratings (Interest, Content Relevance, L earn New Information, Distrac-tion, see Table 2) on the ClassCommons use index. The resulting model accounted for 36.5% of the variance and included positive relations of Interest (p&lt;.01), Content Relevance (p&lt;.05) and PreSoc (p&lt;.05). The third regression model consid ered the possible impact of ClassCommons use on Sense of Community. The system was designed to enhance students X  fee lings of community, so we ex-pected a positive relation between use and felt community. To examine this possibility, we regressed the variables from the pre-vious model (Interest, Content Re levance, PreSOC and PostUse) on PostSOC (in this model PreSOC is serving as a covariate, i.e. to control for individual tendenc ies in SOC). The resulting model accounted for 28.4% of the variance in PreSOC and included positive effects for PreSOC (p&lt;.001) and PostUse (p&lt;.05). Figure 4. Path diagram relatin g ClassCommons use to SOC Figure 4 combines the results of the three regression analyses in a path diagram. In the diagram the arrows show which measures served as independent variables in each model; the numbers on the arcs report the standardized beta or regression coefficient for each predictor. The model summarizes the three overlapping models: 1) classroom anxiety a nd extroversion predict PreSOC; 2)PreSOC, content relevance, and student interest predict use of ClassCommons. However, persona l variables like extroversion, classroom anxiety or public speaking apprehension do not predict their use of ClassCommons; they may have an influence but it is indirect through their relationship with PreSOC. Finally, students X  PostSOC is pred icted by their PreSOC and their use of ClassCommons. While we acknowledge that these models are based on correlations only, this pattern of results is consistent with our expectation that use of use of ClassCommons can help students feel more sense of community. As a secondary analysis, we also wanted to explore the broader impacts that are associated with students X  sense of community. In particular, we were interested in whether and how sense of com-munity is related to students X  self-efficacy, social support and collective efficacy in the classroom. We expected that high sense of community will be positively related to students X  self-efficacy, social support and collective efficacy in the classroom. Our data confirmed this. We found that PostSOC is significantly correlated with self-efficacy (r=0.58, p&lt;.001), collective-efficacy (r= 0.60, p&lt;.001) and social s upport (r = 0.60, p&lt;.001). As above, we cannot argue for a causal interpretation. Given the large de-gree of collinearity in our data, fu rther studies will be needed to tease apart these overlapping constructs. Students X  sense of community changed differently in the two classes. Table 6 reports student s X  sense of community in both classes along the semester. A one-way within subjects ANOVA was conducted to compare the effect of time on students X  sense of community in each class. In PM, there is a significant effect of period (F (2,46) = 24.55, p &lt; .001) . Bonferroni post hoc tests re-vealed significant differences in the scores for PreSOC and Mid-SOC (p&lt;.001) and for PreSOC and PostSOC (p&lt;.001). However there was no increase from MidSOC and PreSOC: Students X  sense of community increased in the first seven weeks, but stayed at the same level until the end of the semester. For the HCI class, there was no significant effect of time at all (F (2, 23) = 2.69, p = .089). Relative to the PM class, students X  sense of community started out at a high value and stayed there. One possible contributing factor for the higher initial SOC is that the size of the HCI class was smaller than PM; perhaps the smaller size helps students to feel more coherent. PM 4.41(0.61) 4.86(0.68) 5.0(0.75) HCI 4.82(0.70) 5.00(0.72) 4.79(0.75) Based on our data, we speculate that sense of community may have an asymptotic growth trajectory in university courses. More specifically, we propose that a value of around 5.0 (on a 7-point scale) may be an asymptotic valu e for this construct in this con-text, that is when the community in question is a group of students who happen to be taking a course t ogether. Note that in Table 6, the initial SOC value for the PM class is the only one that is not close to this value of 5.0. Wh ile individual students may experi-ence more or less sense of community in a classroom, it may be that few of them would ever feel a sense of community intensely enough to assign scale values of 6 or 7. This does not mean that the construct is not valuable fo r assessing feelings of  X  X onnected-ness X , but it may be useful to explore an alternative to the conven-tional SOC scale, perhaps one that is customized for the learning communities one could expect to emerge in a 15-week class. To understand how students X  have used ClassCommons, we ana-lyzed the messages posted in each class. We used a card-sorting technique to categorize the messages. Each message was read, and assigned a descriptive label. The messages were then clus-tered into similar groups. We cl ustered the messages into nine types: social, questions, TA res ponse, report problems, logistics, comments, share info, counter spam and random messages. Ex-amples of each category can be found in Table 7. Social messages refers to the small talk that usually happened at the beginning or end of class. For example, students might post a message to greet one another, or to talk about the sports and news going on campus or around the world. Questions are messages that contain questions about the course. TA responses are the messages posted by the TAs, answering students X  questions or making announcements. Report problems are messages posted to report the problems that students found in the class. Logistics are messages to deal with logistical issues in the class, for example locating team members. Comments are the messages posted by students during the lecture, commenting on the things Table 7. Examples of the messages by type that the teacher just talked about. Share info message are ones that were posted by students who meant to share information to the whole class. Messages of this kind usually contain a URL link to some webpage from the Internet. Counter spam messages were ones that were intended to st op other students from posting ran-dom messages. Random messages are ones that were posted dur-ing the lecture, and have nothing to do with the class. The differ-ences between comments and share info messages are that share info messages are ones that have new information, while the comments are just messages posted by students in response to the lecture, without obvious new information inside. Given the other differences betw een the two classes, it was not surprising to see differences in th e types of messages posted; this can be seen in Figure 5. Student s in PM made more focused use of the tool than students in HCI; they tended to use it to ask ques-tions, report problems or for class logistics. And because students posted such questions, the TA posted more (responses) in PM than in HCI. Students in HCI often used the tool to make com-ments, and share information. Th ere were also more random mes-sages in HCI than in PM. To understand the tradeoffs of using ClassCommons, we asked students what they liked the most and the least about ClassCom-mons in the mid and post surveys. We also asked students and the teachers and the TAs similar questions during the interviews. These qualitative data helped us gain deeper insights into the benefits and drawbacks with using ClassCommons, from both the students X  perspective and the teachers X . Students felt that the benefits are that a) they can easily ask questions and get quick responses from the TA. For examples, students mentioned that  X  X hat I liked best is that at any time I can post a question and get a timely response from a TA X ;  X  X t makes asking questions in lectures feasible without disrupting the flow of class. Often times I will not want to interrupt the profes-sor, and hold off on asking my question, only to later forget what my question at the time was X  ;  X  X  like the fact that I'm able to in-teract with others and the instructor without yelling across the room. X  b) they can interact with other students and provide peer support and learn new information from each other. For example, students said that  X  X t's a great way to interact with other students during class times without being disruptive to the teach-er. You can ask quick questions to other people and get a timely response X ;  X  X  like the ability to post a question and have it an-swered immediately by my pee rs who have the extremely unique perspective of being in the exact same position in the course X ;  X  X he technology and idea of it is pretty cool. I do learn things about the class from looking at the message board X  , and c) it makes the class experience fun.  X  X t was interesting to see what the other students were thinking X  ;  X  X t is a fun and more forward approach to learning X  . Students X  only perceived downside with using ClassCommons is that the alias feature encourages people to post irrelevant content which is distracting to the class.  X  X he first few weeks, the messag-es almost always consisted of di stracting and/or vulgar content, probably because submissions we re anonymous. If real names were used, ClassCommons might work better in classes X ;  X  X lias encourage distracting comments X  and  X  X eople like to be anony-mous in order to post stupid comments and things that don't mat-ter, this can get annoying. X  From the teacher X  X  perspective, the instructors felt that ClassCommons is a social media service that is more relevant to the class than Facebook. The instructor of HCI commented that  X  X uring the class, many students spend a lot of time on Face-book, which is irrelevant to the cl ass. I would rather like students to spend that time on ClassCommons, which is more relevant to the class than Facebook. We can use ClassCommons to replace Facebook in classes. X  For the instructor of PM, he felt that the public display seems to make the class more coherent. He said that  X  X  think this class as a whole, seems to be somehow more coherent than before. It made a community of interest around that system and that community of interest might help them. It gave them all a common thing to focus on. X  The concerns the teacher had with ClassCommons were the ano-nymity issue and the possibility of causing embarrassments for other students. For the anonymity issue, the teachers voiced a concern similar to the students. For the embarrassment issue, the instructor of HCI mentioned that  X  X ometimes I will ask students to make presentations about their group project in the class. I remembered that one time when a student was presenting, he made some mistakes and some stude nts pointed that out directly on ClassCommons. I felt that this could embarrass the student who is presenting X . Finally, in the post survey and the interviews we asked students and the teachers for their opinions about how to improve ClassCommons. Students X  feedback focused on two aspects: they wanted the instructors to impr ove how they use ClassCommons; and they had some detailed sugge stions about improving the sys-tem. Among these two, students fe lt that addressing the first as-pect is more urgent than the system enhancements. Students commented that they wanted the instructor to improve the way that they used the system. More specifically, they sug-gested that the instructor should pay more attention to the mes-sages posted on ClassCommons, inst ead of just leaving it for stu-dents to interact with other student s. For example, S1 said that  X  X he only thing I would say is to pay attention to it more... and answer the question more quickl y or like pause every 30 minutes to look at it X  . S5 commented that:  X  X  think if they can look at it, acknowledge the comments and answe r any questions that is up there would help. Mostly, just acknowledging is the important part. X  S6 also suggested that  X  X eacher could ask questions, stu-dents respond and the teacher ack nowledge them. That would be something that would be beneficial. I think it is a good way to promote engagement and excitement X  . As to more detailed system leve l improvements, it is suggested that a) there should a discrete way to notify the professor when new messages are posted. S4 sugge sted that  X  X aybe there was a discrete way that the professor could be notified that something has been posted. Most of the time, the professor is lecturing, walking around the classroom, not really paying attention to the classroom display, until the end. X  b) it would be useful if users can highlight important questions on the display. For example, the instructor of PM suggested:  X  X lease highlight the important ques-tions on the display so that I can easily identify them and address them accordingly X  . These comments reinforce our earlier discussion of the important role teachers X  attention plays in encouraging students X  use of the system. Students wanted the instructor to know their concerns and wanted to get the instructor X  X  attention. Our study of ClassCommons can be judged a success, given that 90% of the students would like to use ClassCommons in future classes. We feel that three of th e most important lessons we have learned from this experiences are th at a) teacher X  X  role is critical in influencing students X  adoption of this tool and beyond that, the degree to which students would use this tool; b) content relevance is more important than just participation because simply trying to promote higher participation may backfire; and c) teachers need to encourage students to post using their real names. The teacher X  X  involvement with the tool seems to have an im-portant influence on students X  willingness to use a public back-channel. The ability of a teacher to participate in a backchannel is very much influenced by what other activities are ongoing (e.g., lecturing, group supervision). Thus it may be that modifications in class pedagogy are needed to enhance the effectiveness of public backchannels in classrooms. The original idea of ClassCommons was to provide a public back-channel for students to raise questions and receive timely feed-back from the teacher or other students. Although students can certainly learn some content from ot her students, they seem to be more eager to get responses fro m the teacher than from other students. This could be because teachers X  responses are more authentic and teacher can provide more expert information. How-ever, the way the teachers conduct their classes does not meet students X  needs. In both classes, the teachers spent considerable time lecturing, such that they were not able to pay much attention to the things on the public display. Although these instructors had TAs available to monitor the public backchannel and answer questions, still the students wanted to get more acknowledge-ments from the teacher. It is unlik ely that a teacher would be will-ing to make radical changes in how he or she conducts a class. However, it might be that even so me very simple changes in prac-tices could better integrate the backchannel with other class activ-ities. For example one of the students suggested  X  X ause every 30 minutes to look at it X  . Other possibilities are to provide mecha-nisms for the students (or the TA) to gain the attention of the teacher, somewhat analogous to raising one X  X  hand. It is also interesting to think about the tradeoffs in teacher versus student attention. In a sense the public backchannel should be a  X  X reeing X  technology, enabling students to have their own interac-tion in parallel with whatever the teacher is doing. Although in this study we found an important effect of teacher attention, it would also be interesting to e xperiment with mechanisms for increasing students X  responsiveness to each other. In fact the issue of anonymity may interact with student responsiveness  X  by using one X  X  real name, one takes a pub lic stand on a question or com-ment, and in time this may im prove community and responsibil-ity. Content relevance was seen to be more important than simple participation. In these two classes, the teachers set different poli-cies regarding how the students we re expected to use ClassCom-mons. The instructor of PM did not allow students to post irrele-vant contents while the instructor of HCI did not set such policy and any contents were welcome. Th is led to huge difference in the participation rate. A lot more messages were posted in HCI and much more percentage of the students posted in HCI than PM. However, the regression analyses suggested that content rele-vance played an important role in predicting use of ClassCom-mons and indirectly influenci ng sense of community in class-rooms. If the public backchannel is solely left for students to post anything, it may backfire because  X  this can get annoying  X . The 15 week field study provided us an opportunity to investigate the long term impact of public backchannel tools on students X  sense of community in classrooms. It is encouraging that 90% of students were interested in using it in future classes. Based on the survey data, we modeled the Cl assCommons usage pattern and found that content quality and students X  interests were important factors that influence students X  use of ClassCommons. Further, the use of ClassCommons is positiv ely related to students X  sense of community. The content analysis revealed how students have used the tool during the semester and the qualitative interview and students X  answers to the open-ended questions enriched our un-derstandings about the benefits and drawback of using public backchannel in classrooms.
