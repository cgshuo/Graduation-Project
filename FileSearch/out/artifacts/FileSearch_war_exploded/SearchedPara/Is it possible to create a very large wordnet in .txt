 Abstract Wordnets are large-scale lexical databases of related words and con-cepts, useful for language-aware software applications. They have recently been built for many languages by using various approaches. The Finnish wordnet, FinnWordNet (FiWN), was created by translating the more than 200,000 word senses in the English Princeton WordNet (PWN) 3.0 in 100 days. To ensure quality, they were translated by professional translators. The direct translation approach was based on the assumption that most synsets in PWN represent language-independent real-world concepts. Thus also the semantic relations between synsets were assumed mostly language-independent, so the structure of PWN could be reused as well. This approach allowed the creation of an extensive Finnish wordnet directly aligned with PWN and also provided us with a translation relation and thus a bilingual wordnet usable as a dictionary. In this paper, we address several concerns raised with regard to our approach, many of them for the first time. We evaluate the craftsmanship of the translators by checking the spelling and translation quality, the viability of the approach by assessing the synonym quality both on the lexeme and concept level, as language-technological task. We discovered no new problems compared with those already known in PWN. As a whole, the paper contributes to the scientific discourse on what it takes to create a very large wordnet. As a side-effect of the evaluation, we extended FiWN to contain 208,645 word senses in 120,449 synsets, effectively making version 2.0 of FiWN currently the largest wordnet in the world by these statistics.
 Keywords Wordnet Bilingual lexicon Quality assessment Knowledge representation Word-sense disambiguation 1 Introduction FinnWordNet (FiWN) is a wordnet for Finnish that conforms to the framework presented in Fellbaum ( 1998 ) and Vossen ( 1998 ). The synset structure of FiWN corresponds closely to that of the English Princeton WordNet (PWN), version 3.0. FiWN is open source. 1
A classic wordnet consists of synsets, or sets of partial synonyms whose shared meaning is described and exemplified by a gloss, a common part of speech and a hyperonym. Synsets in a wordnet are arranged in hierarchical partial orderings according to semantic relations such as hyponymy/hyperonymy. Together, the gloss, part of speech and hyperonym fix the meaning of a word and constrain the possible translations of a word in a given synset.

The Finnish group opted for translating PWN 3.0 synsets (word senses) wholesale into Finnish by professional translators, because the translation process could be controlled with regard to quality, coverage, cost and speed of translation. All the more than 200,000 word senses were translated, including multi-word phrases but excluding some proper names. The translation process, outlined and discussed by Linde  X  n and Carlson ( 2010 ), was diligent, and the quality was on a par with PWN.
 The direct translation approach was based on the assumption that most synsets in PWN represent language-independent real-world concepts. Thus also the semantic relations between synsets are assumed to be mostly independent of the language, so the structure of PWN can be reused as well. This approach made it possible to create an extensive Finnish wordnet directly aligned with PWN. The direct translation of PWN word senses from English into Finnish also provided us with a translation relation and thus a bilingual wordnet that can also be used as a bilingual dictionary.
Version 2.0 of FiWN, released in October 2012, is based on the evaluation results of the original version 1.0 and a few intermediate versions. FiWN 2.0 contains 120,449 synsets, 208,645 word senses, 142,078 unique word literals and 244,742 translation relations. As of version 2.0, FiWN has also been extended beyond being a translation of PWN by adding new synsets as hyponyms of existing synsets (without glosses and English translations). The new synsets correspond to senses of common Finnish compound words whose final part is in the hypernym synset, as suggested by Pa  X  a  X  kko  X  and Linde  X  n( 2012 ).

The number of modified items after the evaluation process is shown in Table 1 .A total of 18,898 (16.1 %) of the 117,659 original synsets were affected. Some of the additions and corrections were based on suggestions received from users of FiWN.
Table 2 shows the total number of synsets, word senses and other items in FiWN 2.0, compared with the original version 1.0 and with PWN versions 3.0 and 3.1. After having been the second largest wordnet in the world after PWN, with version 2.0, FiWN is now effectively the largest one by the number of synsets and word senses. PWN still wins in the number of unique words and lexical relations.
An effort to build wordnets for the Nordic and Baltic languages is also in progress, see Pedersen et al. ( 2012 ). The builders of these wordnets have applied different compilation strategies: The Danish, Icelandic and Swedish wordnets are being developed via monolingual dictionaries and corpora and subsequently linked to PWN. In contrast, the Finnish and Norwegian wordnets have been created by first translating PWN and the Danish wordnet, DanNet, respectively, and then adapting the result as necessary. The two approaches are called the merge model and the expand model, respectively, in Vossen ( 1998 ). The Estonian wordnet was built as part of the EuroWordNet project (Vossen 1998 ) and by translating the base concepts from English as a first basis for monolingual extension. The wordnets are displayed in the WordTies browser (Pedersen et al. 2013 ), which currently includes the Danish, Finnish, Swedish and Estonian wordnets, which have been linked to Princeton Core WordNet, thereby providing a linked coverage of almost 5,000 core synsets. The aim is to test the perspective of a multilingual linking of the Nordic and Baltic wordnets and via the linking to perform a tentative comparison and validation of the wordnets along the measures of taxonomical structure, coverage, granularity and completeness.

From a lexicographic point of view, our translation approach was considered impossible and unable to result in anything useful, whereas our main concern was that it would be a waste of several decades of lexicographic work to rebuild the concept relations from scratch monolingually. After the translation process was finished, we therefore set out to test the quality of FiWN in various ways. The present evaluation of FiWN covers various aspects of the craftsmanship of the translators, the viability of the translation approach and the usefulness of the result. 2 Related work Wordnets for many other languages have used some variation of the expand model, briefly overview some approaches taken.

Translation candidates for synsets or word senses are typically obtained automatically or semi-automatically from machine-readable bilingual dictionaries, aligned parallel corpora or other resources. Bilingual dictionaries can be used in both directions, such as in the Spanish wordnet (Atserias et al. 2000 ). For the Slovene (SloWNet) and French (WOLF) wordnets, Fis  X  er and Sagot ( 2008 ) used a sentence-aligned multi-lingual parallel corpus (JRC-Acquis), which was then word-aligned. Typically, PWN synsets are translated to the target language, but at least the Korean wordnet (Lee et al. 2004 ) and partly the Thai wordnet (Thoongsup et al. 2009 ) were constructed by mapping words of the target language to PWN synsets.
Together with a bilingual dictionaries, other wordnets aligned with PWN can be used in finding correct translations for a PWN word sense. EuroWordNet wordnets (Vossen 1998 ) were used in constructing the Japanese wordnet (Bond et al. 2008 ), and BalkaNet wordnets (Tufis  X  et al. 2004 ) in constructing Slovene (SloWNet) and French (WOLF) wordnets (Fis  X  er and Sagot 2008 ). Typically the confidence in the dictionary translation is the higher the more wordnets give rise to the same translation.
Except for wordnets aligned with PWN, other resources typically have no PWN sense information. Thus, mapping the translation of a word that is polysemous in PWN to the correct PWN synset requires heuristics of some kind, possibly involving PWN synset glosses or definitions in target-language monolingual dictionaries. For example, the Italian MultiWordNet (Pianta et al. 2002 ) used four heuristics based on generic probability, back-translation, gloss matching and synset intersection. In constructing the Macedonian wordnet (Saveski and Trajkovski 2010 ), the most probable synsets for translations were chosen by translating PWN glosses into Macedonian with Google Translate and by using Google Similarity Distance (Cilibrasi and Vita  X  nyi 2007 ) to choose among the candidates.

The precision of the result (the confidence of the translations) may vary from as low as 20 % to over 90 %, depending on the resources and heuristics used. To ensure decent quality, the resulting wordnet requires manual verification and correction. Further work is often proposed for adapting and extending the result to better reflect the target language.

Monosemous words, which tend not to be in the core vocabulary, can typically be translated with simpler methods and possibly greater precision. For example, the French WOLF (Sagot and Fis  X  er 2008 ) used bilingual dictionaries constructed from Wikipedia, other wiki resources and the Eurovoc multilingual thesaurus.

Because the dictionaries used in translation do not cover all the words in PWN, the resulting wordnets correspond only to a subset of PWN, many in the range of 10,000 X  60,000 synsets. 2 The whole PWN structure may be used but with empty synsets where no translations were found, such as in the French WOLF (Sagot and Fis  X  er 2008 ).
To our knowledge, FinnWordNet is unique in that all the PWN word senses were manually translated by subcontracted professional translators. This approach resulted in broad coverage and high quality from the beginning, and the number of corrections made later during the evaluation was relatively small. 3 Evaluation of craftsmanship To evaluate the craftsmanship of the translators, we looked at possible spelling errors and part-of-speech mismatches as a first indicator of how carefully the work had been carried out. The translation quality also needed to be evaluated. 3.1 Evaluation of spelling and preserving part of speech To evaluate the spelling and the part of speech, we first ran the words in FiWN through a Finnish morphological analyzer. Unrecognized words were further inspected, and their spelling was corrected or they were added to the morphological analyzer. Next, we checked that each word in FiWN had the expected base form and part of speech. Words with a mismatch with the expectation were manually corrected. We corrected 1,487 words on the first stage and 3,217 on the second one; in total 4,704 (3.6 %) of the original 130,412 words.

A factor contributing to the part-of-speech mismatches probably was that the synsets were listed alphabetically, all parts of speech together. Most words in PWN are nouns, and since English often does not distinguish the base form of a verb from a noun, a translator quickly going down the list may have overlooked an occasional shift in the desired part of speech. In hindsight, one solution would have been better mark-up, e.g., color-coding the source word according to its part of speech.
Not all words in the synsets were translatable by equivalent terms. This was foreseen by allowing the translators to use standardized comments to indicate how the translation relates to the original. A total of 3,230 translations (1.4 % of all the 228,597 translation relations) were marked broader than (hyperonym of) the original, 165 (0.1 %) narrower (hyponym), 2,471 (1.0 %) approximate (near-synonym), 4,099 (1.8 %) unconfirmed, 1,065 (0.5 %) as having an idiomatic part-of-speech difference, and 527 (0.2 %) had been given a free-form comment.
The translators all worked on separate sections, so no inter-annotator agreement was measured. For other translation quality controls, see Linde  X  n and Carlson ( 2010 ). 3.2 Synonym translation quality In order to evaluate the translation quality, we extracted translation pairs from Wikipedia and Wiktionary (Linde  X  n et al. 2012 ; Niemi et al. 2012 ). The potentially relevant translation pairs had an English word in PWN with a Finnish translation in Wikipedia or Wiktionary. Wikipedia provided 25,062 translation pair candidates and Wiktionary 58,110, even though the latter is a less extensive resource. These candidates were manually inspected to find translations to be added to FiWN or to replace existing translations. In evaluating the quality of the manual translation work, we only considered the replacements. The number of translations that should replace ones existing in FiWN was 104 (0.4 % of 25,062) from Wikipedia and 171 (0.3 % of 58,110) from Wiktionary. From the small number of words to be replaced, we can conclude that the translation quality of FiWN from PWN is high, i.e. there were few direct errors. 4 Evaluation of viability of approach With the help of a well-intended critique from Martola ( 2011 ), we evaluated the viability of the translation approach by investigating the synonym quality both on the concept and the lexeme level as well as some structural differences and potentially missing culture-specific words. 4.1 Concept quality The quality of concept linking was evaluated by two independent evaluators who manually rated 1,000 synsets linked to Finnish from Swedish and Danish via Core WordNet. The task was not only to evaluate the Finnish linking to Core WordNet, but more importantly to evaluate if the translations using Core WordNet as a pivot had been understood in the same way in the three languages and therefore conveyed the same meaning in the other languages as well. This also evaluates the general approach of using English synsets as a basis for translation and synsets in other languages. From a Finnish perspective, almost all (993/1,000) the links to Danish and Swedish via Core WordNet are of good quality (rated as 3 on a scale of 1 X 3) for both the Finnish-Danish and Finnish-Swedish translations. Some synsets, whose concept linking as a whole was considered good, still got suggestions for further improvement by adding or removing individual words. The remaining 7 words were rated as 2. 4.2 Synonym set quality For evaluating the quality of the synonym sets, we collected user feedback through a crowdsourcing procedure where the users were asked to rate (on a scale of 1 X 5) the quality of synonyms presented to them in the FiWN Web search interface with the context of an English gloss, part of speech and hyperonym. The ratings did not directly affect the data; instead, synonyms receiving poor grades were manually examined and corrected where appropriate.
 Users submitted 1,237 synonym quality ratings between December 2010 and October 2012, when the evaluation form was available. 3 The majority of the evaluations were positive: the users gave 758 (61.3 %) good grades (4 or 5), more was 3.6. 4.3 Structural differences Since FiWN is translated from PWN, they do not differ structurally from each other, except for some derivational links, removed between lexemes with no derivational relationship in Finnish (Niemi and Linde  X  n 2012 , 2443). It is a future task to add new such links between Finnish words with an obvious derivational relationship.
Already in their initial work, Linde  X  n and Carlson ( 2010 ) pointed out some of the translation mismatches due to differing semantic fields in the languages, but many of them were dealt with through to the fine-grained structure of PWN.

Sometimes the translation has resulted in the same word being included in a synset and its hyperonym synset, effectively stating that a word is its own hyperonym. Sometimes this is required when a word has a specific meaning as well as a collective one, but in other cases it may be due to translating synsets individually, without regard of the translations of related synsets. A future task is to go through the lexicon and to decide on the right level of abstraction for each of these words. 4.4 Culture-specific words To evaluate the number of missing Finnish culture-specific words in FiWN, we took all the Finnish words from a text corpus of approx. 170 million words that were equally frequent 4 as the words already in FiWN. Among the 6,388 words missing from FiWN and not found in Wiktionary, we looked more closely at a sample of 200 words and found that only a small portion of it was culture-specific.
 The culture-specific words in our sample included words for inhabitants of Finnish towns (e.g. helsinkil X inen ,  X  X nhabitant of Helsinki X ), Finnish institutions (e.g. l X  X ninhallitus , a former governing body of a Finnish province) and traditional Finnish dishes (e.g. m X mmi , an Easter-time dessert). Based on the sample, we estimated that 309  X  187 relatively frequent culture-specific words are missing from FiWN. Adding them would increase the number of words by 0.2  X  0.1 % NLP applications in particular.

Rarer words may or may not be more culture-specific, e.g., old agricultural vocabulary. The importance of them depends on the intended use of the resource. 5 Usefulness of FinnWordNet 5.1 Coverage evaluation We tested the coverage of FiWN on a large text corpus of Finnish newspaper text. The words in FiWN 2.0 cover 57.3 % of the all words in the running text, up from 54.5 % in version 1.0. If we only count nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs and exclude proper names, the coverage is 82.4 % of running text, up from 78.4 % in version 1.0.

We also evaluated the coverage of FiWN 2.0 senses by manually disambiguating a sample corpus of 846 words of text, annotated with FiWN senses. The sample contained 579 occurrences of words in FiWN. Of these, 97 (16.8 %) had no appropriate meaning in context. This indicates that FiWN 2.0 covers approximately 57 % (482/846) of the meanings of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in running text. 5.2 Applicability in an NLP task To see if FiWN would be useful for distinguishing between word senses, we took the UKB software, which uses a wordnet (or similar) to perform word-sense disambiguation and word-sense tagging of running text (Agirre and Soroa 2009 ).
In addition, we took the small coverage test corpus of 846 words with the manually FiWN-annotated 579 words. The manual annotation was done indepen-dently by two linguists. Initially, they disagreed on 10 % of the cases but after comparing notes, they reached a common conclusion. This was used as the gold standard. The words in the gold standard corpus had 12.1 different senses on the average whereas the FiWN words in a newspaper text have 11.7.

Preliminary results show that using the personalized PageRank method with a sentence context in UKB with FiWN gives a disambiguation result of 57.0 % for the first suggestion. The top two suggestions give 70.3 % and the top three 81.4 %. This should be compared with the baseline of 23 % assuming an equal distribution for all the word senses. The results are also on a par with those of Agirre and Soroa ( 2009 ) for English using UKB with PWN.

Since we have a bilingual wordnet, we can use data in which English words serve as a disambiguation context, e.g., parallel corpora if we consider the aligned translation. The 846-word gold standard text was chosen so that an aligned English translation was available. If the aligned English sentence is also considered as part of the context, the disambiguation result rises to 63 % for the first suggestion. 6 Discussion Our main motivation for creating FiWN by translation was the considerable saving in construction time. 5 Due to the objections by lexicographers regarding the viability of the translation approach, see Martola ( 2011 ), a sizable effort has now also gone into evaluating FiWN from as many angles as possible to see whether the lexicographic concerns are real or merely objections that one could raise against any new lexicon.
 We supervised the craftsmanship of the translators already during the creation of FiWN, see Linde  X  n and Carlson ( 2010 ). To further verify the basic quality, we looked at potential typos in Finnish as well as part-of-speech mismatches between translated synsets. We found no major problems and corrected the few remaining ones.

A greater effort went into evaluating the viability of our approach by studying the synonym and translation quality both on the lexeme and the concept level as well as the lexical coverage and some structural differences. Again, we discovered no major problems but the effort provided us with valuable data for further extending FiWN. The missing culture-specific words were few and of low frequency. Rare words are by definition unlikely to be a major problem.

Depending on the lexicographic perspective and tradition, lower and more course-grained lexical structure for the synonym hierarchy could perhaps be preferable. In addition, the adjectives could benefit from a treatment more similar to other words. This updating effort is under way in PWN, and a similar effort will then be used in FiWN. Also, the verbs could benefit from a more grammatically motivated restructuring of the hierarchy with regard to transitivity both in Finnish and English.

Initially, we also confirmed the usefulness of FiWN for humans as a large-scale bilingual dictionary, see Muhonen and Linde  X  n( 2011 ). To confirm its usefulness for machines, we also needed to evaluate FiWN in a language-technology application. We used the all-words unsupervised word-sense disambiguation task for this purpose and found that the performance was on a par with similar experiments using PWN.
 Further work will be carried out to take advantage of the bilingual aspect of FiWN in word-sense disambiguation. This will be pursued in order to provide FinnTreeBank, the Finnish parse bank, with word-sense annotation, as it has parallel data in all the languages of the European Union. Another interesting application experiment left for further work would be to use FiWN for bilingual corpus alignment. 7 Conclusion The overall conclusion is that it is possible to create a wordnet for a new language in 100 days, as we discovered no hidden problems compared with those already known in PWN. As a side-effect of the evaluation, we were able to extend FiWN to contain a total of 208,645 word senses in 120,449 synsets, i.e. after having been the world X  X  second largest wordnet, it is now effectively the largest according to these statistics. In addition, we found a promising avenue of further research using FiWN for bilingual word-sense annotation.

A total of 3,230 translations (1.4 % of all the 228,597 translation relations) were marked broader than (hyperonym of) the original, 165 (0.1 %) narrower (hyponym), 2,471 (1.0 %) approximate (near-synonym), 4,099 (1.8 %) unconfirmed, 1,065 (0.5 %) as having an idiomatic part-of-speech difference, and 527 (0.2 %) had been given a free-form comment.
The translators all worked on separate sections, so no inter-annotator agreement was measured. For other translation quality controls, see Linde  X  n and Carlson ( 2010 ). 3.2 Synonym translation quality In order to evaluate the translation quality, we extracted translation pairs from Wikipedia and Wiktionary (Linde  X  n et al. 2012 ; Niemi et al. 2012 ). The potentially relevant translation pairs had an English word in PWN with a Finnish translation in Wikipedia or Wiktionary. Wikipedia provided 25,062 translation pair candidates and Wiktionary 58,110, even though the latter is a less extensive resource. These candidates were manually inspected to find translations to be added to FiWN or to replace existing translations. In evaluating the quality of the manual translation work, we only considered the replacements. The number of translations that should replace ones existing in FiWN was 104 (0.4 % of 25,062) from Wikipedia and 171 (0.3 % of 58,110) from Wiktionary. From the small number of words to be replaced, we can conclude that the translation quality of FiWN from PWN is high, i.e. there were few direct errors. 4 Evaluation of viability of approach With the help of a well-intended critique from Martola ( 2011 ), we evaluated the viability of the translation approach by investigating the synonym quality both on the concept and the lexeme level as well as some structural differences and potentially missing culture-specific words. 4.1 Concept quality The quality of concept linking was evaluated by two independent evaluators who manually rated 1,000 synsets linked to Finnish from Swedish and Danish via Core WordNet. The task was not only to evaluate the Finnish linking to Core WordNet, but more importantly to evaluate if the translations using Core WordNet as a pivot had been understood in the same way in the three languages and therefore conveyed the same meaning in the other languages as well. This also evaluates the general approach of using English synsets as a basis for translation and synsets in other languages. From a Finnish perspective, almost all (993/1,000) the links to Danish and Swedish via Core WordNet are of good quality (rated as 3 on a scale of 1 X 3) for both the Finnish-Danish and Finnish-Swedish translations. Some synsets, whose concept linking as a whole was considered good, still got suggestions for further improvement by adding or removing individual words. The remaining 7 words were rated as 2. 4.2 Synonym set quality For evaluating the quality of the synonym sets, we collected user feedback through a crowdsourcing procedure where the users were asked to rate (on a scale of 1 X 5) the quality of synonyms presented to them in the FiWN Web search interface with the context of an English gloss, part of speech and hyperonym. The ratings did not directly affect the data; instead, synonyms receiving poor grades were manually examined and corrected where appropriate.
 Users submitted 1,237 synonym quality ratings between December 2010 and October 2012, when the evaluation form was available. 3 The majority of the evaluations were positive: the users gave 758 (61.3 %) good grades (4 or 5), more was 3.6. 4.3 Structural differences Since FiWN is translated from PWN, they do not differ structurally from each other, except for some derivational links, removed between lexemes with no derivational relationship in Finnish (Niemi and Linde  X  n 2012 , 2443). It is a future task to add new such links between Finnish words with an obvious derivational relationship.
Already in their initial work, Linde  X  n and Carlson ( 2010 ) pointed out some of the translation mismatches due to differing semantic fields in the languages, but many of them were dealt with through to the fine-grained structure of PWN.

Sometimes the translation has resulted in the same word being included in a synset and its hyperonym synset, effectively stating that a word is its own hyperonym. Sometimes this is required when a word has a specific meaning as well as a collective one, but in other cases it may be due to translating synsets individually, without regard of the translations of related synsets. A future task is to go through the lexicon and to decide on the right level of abstraction for each of these words. 4.4 Culture-specific words To evaluate the number of missing Finnish culture-specific words in FiWN, we took all the Finnish words from a text corpus of approx. 170 million words that were equally frequent 4 as the words already in FiWN. Among the 6,388 words missing from FiWN and not found in Wiktionary, we looked more closely at a sample of 200 words and found that only a small portion of it was culture-specific.
 The culture-specific words in our sample included words for inhabitants of Finnish towns (e.g. helsinkil X inen ,  X  X nhabitant of Helsinki X ), Finnish institutions (e.g. l X  X ninhallitus , a former governing body of a Finnish province) and traditional Finnish dishes (e.g. m X mmi , an Easter-time dessert). Based on the sample, we estimated that 309  X  187 relatively frequent culture-specific words are missing from FiWN. Adding them would increase the number of words by 0.2  X  0.1 % NLP applications in particular.

Rarer words may or may not be more culture-specific, e.g., old agricultural vocabulary. The importance of them depends on the intended use of the resource. 5 Usefulness of FinnWordNet 5.1 Coverage evaluation We tested the coverage of FiWN on a large text corpus of Finnish newspaper text. The words in FiWN 2.0 cover 57.3 % of the all words in the running text, up from 54.5 % in version 1.0. If we only count nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs and exclude proper names, the coverage is 82.4 % of running text, up from 78.4 % in version 1.0.

We also evaluated the coverage of FiWN 2.0 senses by manually disambiguating a sample corpus of 846 words of text, annotated with FiWN senses. The sample contained 579 occurrences of words in FiWN. Of these, 97 (16.8 %) had no appropriate meaning in context. This indicates that FiWN 2.0 covers approximately 57 % (482/846) of the meanings of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in running text. 5.2 Applicability in an NLP task To see if FiWN would be useful for distinguishing between word senses, we took the UKB software, which uses a wordnet (or similar) to perform word-sense disambiguation and word-sense tagging of running text (Agirre and Soroa 2009 ).
In addition, we took the small coverage test corpus of 846 words with the manually FiWN-annotated 579 words. The manual annotation was done indepen-dently by two linguists. Initially, they disagreed on 10 % of the cases but after comparing notes, they reached a common conclusion. This was used as the gold standard. The words in the gold standard corpus had 12.1 different senses on the average whereas the FiWN words in a newspaper text have 11.7.

Preliminary results show that using the personalized PageRank method with a sentence context in UKB with FiWN gives a disambiguation result of 57.0 % for the first suggestion. The top two suggestions give 70.3 % and the top three 81.4 %. This should be compared with the baseline of 23 % assuming an equal distribution for all the word senses. The results are also on a par with those of Agirre and Soroa ( 2009 ) for English using UKB with PWN.

Since we have a bilingual wordnet, we can use data in which English words serve as a disambiguation context, e.g., parallel corpora if we consider the aligned translation. The 846-word gold standard text was chosen so that an aligned English translation was available. If the aligned English sentence is also considered as part of the context, the disambiguation result rises to 63 % for the first suggestion. 6 Discussion Our main motivation for creating FiWN by translation was the considerable saving in construction time. 5 Due to the objections by lexicographers regarding the viability of the translation approach, see Martola ( 2011 ), a sizable effort has now also gone into evaluating FiWN from as many angles as possible to see whether the lexicographic concerns are real or merely objections that one could raise against any new lexicon.
 We supervised the craftsmanship of the translators already during the creation of FiWN, see Linde  X  n and Carlson ( 2010 ). To further verify the basic quality, we looked at potential typos in Finnish as well as part-of-speech mismatches between translated synsets. We found no major problems and corrected the few remaining ones.

A greater effort went into evaluating the viability of our approach by studying the synonym and translation quality both on the lexeme and the concept level as well as the lexical coverage and some structural differences. Again, we discovered no major problems but the effort provided us with valuable data for further extending FiWN. The missing culture-specific words were few and of low frequency. Rare words are by definition unlikely to be a major problem.

Depending on the lexicographic perspective and tradition, lower and more course-grained lexical structure for the synonym hierarchy could perhaps be preferable. In addition, the adjectives could benefit from a treatment more similar to other words. This updating effort is under way in PWN, and a similar effort will then be used in FiWN. Also, the verbs could benefit from a more grammatically motivated restructuring of the hierarchy with regard to transitivity both in Finnish and English.

Initially, we also confirmed the usefulness of FiWN for humans as a large-scale bilingual dictionary, see Muhonen and Linde  X  n( 2011 ). To confirm its usefulness for machines, we also needed to evaluate FiWN in a language-technology application. We used the all-words unsupervised word-sense disambiguation task for this purpose and found that the performance was on a par with similar experiments using PWN.
 Further work will be carried out to take advantage of the bilingual aspect of FiWN in word-sense disambiguation. This will be pursued in order to provide FinnTreeBank, the Finnish parse bank, with word-sense annotation, as it has parallel data in all the languages of the European Union. Another interesting application experiment left for further work would be to use FiWN for bilingual corpus alignment. 7 Conclusion The overall conclusion is that it is possible to create a wordnet for a new language in 100 days, as we discovered no hidden problems compared with those already known in PWN. As a side-effect of the evaluation, we were able to extend FiWN to contain a total of 208,645 word senses in 120,449 synsets, i.e. after having been the world X  X  second largest wordnet, it is now effectively the largest according to these statistics. In addition, we found a promising avenue of further research using FiWN for bilingual word-sense annotation.
