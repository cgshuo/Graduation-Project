 The organizers of ACM Sixth In ternational Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO 12) are happy announce that the sixth DTMBIO will be held in conjunction with CIKM, one of the largest data management conferences. The major interests of DTMBIO are on the state-of-the-art applications of data and text mining on biomedical research problems. DTMBIO 12 will be a forum of discussing and exchanging informatics related techniques and problems in the context of biomedical research.
 J.3 [ Life and Medical Sciences ]: Medical information systems Experimentation, Security effective use of the enormous amount of electronic biomedical data in order to better understand and explain complex biological systems. The biomedical data repos itories include data in a wide variety of forms, including genom ic sequences, gene expression profiles, proteomics, metabolomic s, epigenomics, microbiomics, electronics medical records, literature information, and so on. The ability to automatically and effectively extract, integrate, understand and make use of in formation embedded in such heterogeneous -structured and unstructured -data remains a challenging task. The aim of the 2012 workshop has been to bring together researchers in the areas of data and text mining and computational biology, who are interested in integrating and analyzing heterogeneous, structured and unstructured data. world. The selection process wa s highly competitive. Each paper went through a rigorous double-blinded peer review by at least 3 members of the Program Committee. Based on the referee reports, the papers have been ranked according to their original contribution, and the program committee accepted 8 full papers and 5 short papers that cover a variety of topics, including novel information extraction techniques, biological network mining, and application to large biomedical data. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Professor Kwan Su Yi at KAIST. We hope that these proceedings w ill serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers who are interested in applying Text Mining to Medical Informatics. and text mining techniques in c linical settings. [1] presents a method of Lexicon-free and context-free drug names identification using Hidden Markov Models and Pointwise Mutual Information. The proposed technique utilizes known drug names to train the hidden Markov models. For further filtering, it is utilizing mutual information with internet search results. It also presents performance evaluati on results for their proposed techniques. [2] describes a novel application of SSVM and rich features to the task of clinical NER, and compares it to the state of the art in the context of the I2 B2 2010 challenge. The data consist of audiograms, data about the pa tient and notes in text form provided by technicians. [3] proposes a logistic regression supervised machine learning m odel that uses training data identified by an unsupervised m achine learning system based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to automatically identify analysis of a machine learning application for automated discovery of feeding patterns recorded in the EMR. [5] proposes the NLP method to extract dosage information from prescriptions by using rules on dependency parses. text mining for biological data. [6] proposes a method finding protein structure by intelligently incorporating existing index structures. [7] presents a method to predict protein complexes from protein-protein interaction networks by using topological characteristics. [8] presents a method to identify tag SNPs collaborative filtering. [9] proposes an algorithm that predicts the unknown E3-substrate relations from known E3-substrate network, using 3 biological features -sequence similarity, PPI, co-localization. [10] presents a method for identifying casual SNPs of complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). [11] proposes a new method for drug repositioning from a large amount of multi-level biomedical interaction networks by employing typed network motif (TNM) by developing a Typed Network Motif Comparison Algorithm (TNMCA) and applying it to a public database, Compara tive Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), to validate their method. [12] introduces a new  X  X er-pair X  basis evaluation method for PPI extraction from biomedical literature. [13] proposes a simulation platform for analyzing multi-compound effects, which may be applicable to the identification of effective combination of drugs for a specific or complex diseases. organized in conjunction with CIKM in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. We invite researcher s and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds such as computer science, information system, information science, bioinforma tics, medical informatics, and medical sciences. The main objec tive of the workshop will be to strengthen the cooperation within the growing community in medical data and text mining research, allowing lively exchange of ideas and foster new collaborations.
