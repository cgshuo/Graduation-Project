 Micro-blogging is a new form of social communication that encourages users to share information about anything they are seeing or doing, the motivation facilitated by the ability to post brief text messages through a variety of devices. Twitter , the most popular micro-blogging tool, is exhibiting rapid growth [3]: up to 11% of online Americans are using Twitter by December 2008, compared to 6% in May 2008.
Due to its nature, micro-blogosphere has unique features: (i) It is a source of extremely up-to-date information about what is happening in the world; (ii) It captures the wisdom of millions of people and covers a broad range of domains.
These features make micro-blogosphere more than a pop-ular medium of social communication: we believe that it has additionally become a valuable source of extremely up-to-date news on virtually any subject of user interest.
Making use of micro-blogosphere in this new role we meet the following challenges: (A) Since any given subject is gen-erally mentioned in the micro-blogging stream on the con-tinuous basis, a method is needed for locating periods of news on this subject. (B) Additionally, even for such peri-ods, stream filtering is required for removing noise and for extracting messages that best describe the news.

To address these challenges we make and exploit the fol-lowing observations: (A) For an arbitrary subject, events that catch user interest gain distinguishably more attention than the average mentioning of the subject resulting in mes-sage activity bursts for it. (B) Most of the messages in an activity burst describe common event in close variations X  either rephrased or  X  X etweeted X  between the users.
We demonstrate TweetSieve X  X  system that allows obtain-ing news on any given subject by sifting the Twitter stream. Our work is related to frequecy-based analysis applied to blogs [1], but higher latency and lower coverage in blogs makes the analysis less effective than in case of micro-blogs.
In TweetSieve demo, the user is able to express the sub-ject of her interest by an arbitrary search string. The system shows the period of events occuring for the subject and out-puts tweets that best describe each of the events. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the system for  X  X emantic search X  as a sample subject.
 The underlying process consists of two steps:
Identifying activity bursts. Counting the messages matching the search string in the stream over time, the fre-
