 The main objective of the workshop is to bring together re-searchers who are interested in applications of topic models and improving their output. Our goal is to create a broad platform for researchers to share ideas that could improve the usability and interpretation of topic models. We expect this will promote topic model applications in other research areas, making their use more effective.

Topic modelling is a popular tool for modelling document collections and has seen applications in a variety of domains, from medical science to digital humanities. Topic models provide an effective means of extracting topics from large document collections and have the advantage that they re-quire no supervision or document labels. While topic models can be trained automatically, judicious processing of their output is often required in applications where human users interact directly with the topics generated by a model. For example, the raw output from topic models can be difficult to interpret and consequently labels (manually assigned or automatically generated) are often added to increase read-ability; visualisation of the relationship between documents and topics is not intuitively obvious and its design requires thoughtful consideration. In addition, topics can contain unrelated words which may make the navigation of the doc-ument collection difficult; a typical approach to tackle this is to filter out low quality topics by computing topic coher-ence. This workshop aims to bring together a wide range of
