A semantic Kripke structure over domain  X  is a quad K X h S ( S a  X   X  X  (rigid individual names).

Given the TBox  X  , each local interpretation I ( s ) associates an atomic concept A each atomic role r  X   X  with a set of pairs r Is  X  X   X   X  Is  X  X   X  Is from  X  which are satisfied in that state based on the individuals enumerated in designated in a state, it will not change its name over time. Note that the rigid concept assumption The rationality behind this is illustrated by example 2.

The processed shrimp may be frozen if the delivery does not occur immediately ( p delivered ( f  X  d ). The corresponding Kripke structure K X h r data in each state represents the domain of interpretation for that particular state. For instance and reject, where the first one is an instance of the PH concept, and the second one an instance of the CM concept. Two observations follow: Firstly, note that the concepts PH and CM are not rigid ( PH of each successor state s  X  , given by  X  Is  X  X   X  Is  X   X  X  , where s is the ancestor of s The syntax of NTL  X  ALC is defined by the following grammar.

HACCP compliance checking Algorithm 1 details the steps above. The input consists of the ontology standard, the ontology  X   X  X  formalizing the business domain and the ontology
Usually, the normative system  X  represents the internal quality control, while the f formalized in the NTL the external auditor. The output represents the set of business steps where the formula f is breached.
In the first step, the Kripke structure is generated from the workflow description. Thus, for each individual i processing step, a state in the Kripke structure is generated. The set S For labeling each state, the algorithm considers all individuals in the current domain of interpretation individual i , the state s is labeled with all the concepts C in the quality standard T instance. Next, the internal control eliminates the transition ( s , s the concept A is satisfied in s , while B is satisfied in s

The norm  X  For shrimps from international sources a certification should attest that they do not contain any sulfites by  X  satisfying this norm based on the subsumption Sulfites  X  Preservatives with the following subsumption.

We have introduced the NTL  X  ALC logic aiming at checking norm compliance in business processes. Combining domain provides therefore a generic framework to close the gap between abstract norms and concrete business processes. importing new ones, the framework can be applied to various normative systems. particular process should comply with.
