Nowadays, due to the increasing user requirements of ef-ficient and personalized services, a perfect travel plan is ur-gently needed. However, at present it is hard for people to make a personalized traveling plan. Most of them follow other people X  X  general travel trajectory. So only after finish-ing their travel, do they know which scene is their favorite, which is not, and what is the perfect order of visits.
In this research we propose a novel spatio-temporal se-quence (STS) searching, which mainly includes two steps. Firstly, we propose a novel method to detect tourist fea-tures of every scene, and its difference in different seasons. Secondly, combined with personal profile and scene features, a set of interesting scenes will be chosen and each scene has a specific weight for each user. The goal of our research is to provide the traveler with the STS, which passes through as many chosen scenes as possible with the maximum weight and the minimum distance within his travel time.

However, the STS searching has not been addressed be-fore. Zheng et al. [1] recorded GPS tracks of 107 users to determine the interestingness of tourist scenes. The authors of [2] also focused on mining similar traveling sequences from multiple users X  GPS logs. None of these approaches consid-ers scene features, user X  X  profile and temporal information.
We propose a method based on topic model to detect scene features, and provide two approximate algorithms to mine STS: a local optimization algorithm and a global optimiza-tion algorithm. System evaluations have been conducted and the performance results show the efficiency.
