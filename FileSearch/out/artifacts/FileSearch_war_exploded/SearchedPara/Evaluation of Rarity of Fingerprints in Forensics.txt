 In many forensic domains it is necessary to characterize the degree to which a given piece of ev-idence is unique. For instance in the case of DNA a probabilit y statement is made after a match has been confirmed between the evidence and the known, that th e chance that a randomly selected person would have the same DNA pattern is 1 in 24,000,000 whic h is a description of rarity of similarity between the evidence and the known and the rarity of the known. This paper explores that a high degree of similarity is present between the evide nce and the known [2]. continues to be a difficult problem and has never been solved. This paper describes a systematic approach for the computation of the rarity of fingerprints in a robust and reliable manner. is proposed to model the distribution of minutiae as well as t he dependencies between them. To Section 5. Some examples of evaluation of rarity are given in Section 6. The most popular approaches proposed for core point detecti on is the Poincare Index (PI) which is developed by [7, 8, 9]. Another commonly used method [10] i s a sine map based method that there X  X  no way to detect them by above computational vision b ased approaches. We proposes a core point prediction approach that turns this problem into a regression problem. predictive distribution.
 Suppose we have a training set D of N fingerprints, D = { ( g applied. The regression model with Gaussian noise is given b y Gaussian distribution, so that the Gaussian likelihood for core point is given by covariance function k ( g , g  X  ) so that variables, parameterized by  X  where the hyperparameters  X  observation ( G, y ) , where G = ( g is given by where where K is the Gram matrix whose elements are given by k ( g them are defined as G = { g  X  Thus the core point of the fingerprint is given by where g  X  obtained, given by Note that the minutia features mentioned in following secti ons have been aligned first. of minutiae and the dependency relationship between them.
 Minutiae are the most commonly used features for representi ng fingerprints. They correspond to represented as x = ( s, X  ) where s = ( x contains N minutiae. The sequence starts with the minutia x point. Each remaining minutia x mean of the location coordinates of all the previous minutia e x fingerprint can be represented by a minutia sequence X = ( x the dependence between x dependence is taken into account, this is a good trade-off be tween model accuracy and computa-tional complexity.
