 The assessment of learners X  language abilities is a significant part in language learning. In conven-tional assessment, the problem of limited teach-er availability has become increasingly serious with the population increase of language learn-ers. Fortunately, with the development of com-puter techniques and machine learning techniques (natural language processing and automatic speech recognition), Computer-Assisted Language Learn-ing (CALL) systems help people to learn language by themselves.

One form of CALL is evaluating the speech of the learner. Efforts in speech assessment usually fo-cus on the integrality, fluency, pronunciation, and prosody (Cucchiarini et al., 2000; Neumeyer et al., 2000; Maier et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010) of the speech, which are highly predictable like the exam form of the read-aloud text passage. Another form of CALL is textual assessment. This work is also named AES. Efforts in this area usually focus on the content, arrangement and language usage (Landauer et al., 2003; Ishioka and Kameda, 2004; Kakkonen et al., 2005; Attali and Burstein, 2006; Burstein et al., 2010; Persing et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2010; At-tali, 2011; Yannakoudakis et al., 2011) of the text written by the learner under a certain form of exam-ination.
 In this paper, our evaluation objects are the oral English picture compositions in English as a Sec-ond Language (ESL) examination. This examina-tion requires students to talk about four successive pictures with at least five sentences in one minute, and the beginning sentence is given. This examina-tion form combines both of the two forms described above. Therefore, we need two steps in the scoring task. The first step is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), in which we get the speech scoring features as well as the textual transcriptions of the speech-es. Then, the second step could grade the text-free transcription in an (conventional) AES system. The present work is mainly about the AES system un-der the certain situation as the examination grading criterion is more concerned about the integrated con-tent of the speech (the reason will be given in sub-section 3.1).

There are many features and techniques which are very powerful in conventional AES systems, but applying them in this task will cause two differen-t problems as the scoring objects are the ASR out-put results. The first problem is that the inevitable recognition errors of the ASR will affect the perfor-mance of the feature extractions and scoring system. The second problem is caused by the special charac-teristic of the ASR result. As all these methods are designed under the normal AES situation that they are not suitable for the characteristic.

The impact of the first problem can be reduced by either perfecting the results of the ASR system or building the AES system which is not sensitive to the ASR errors. Improving the performance of the ASR is not what we concern about, so building an error insensitive AES system is what we care about in this paper. This makes many conventional features no longer useful in the AES system, such as spelling errors, punctuation errors and even grammar errors.
The second problem is caused by applying the bag-of-words (BOW) techniques to score the ASR transcription. The BOW are very useful in measur-ing the content features and are usually robust even if there are some errors in the scoring transcription. However, the robustness would not exist anymore because of the characteristic of the ASR result. It is known that better performance of ASR (reduce the word error rate in ASR) usually requires a strong constrain Language Model (LM). It means that more meaningless parts of the oral speeches would be rec-ognized as the words quite related to the topic con-tent. These words will usually be the key words in the BOW methods, which will lead to a great distur-brance for the methods. Therefore, the conventional BOW methods are no longer appropriate because of the characteristic of the ASR result.

To tackle the two problems described above, we apply the FST (Mohri, 2004). As the evaluating ob-jects are from an oral English picture composition examination, it has two important features that make the FST algorithm quite suitable.  X  Picture composition examinations require stu- X  The sentences for describing the same picture
FST is designed to describe a structure mapping two different types of information sequences. It is very useful in expressing the sequences and the hi-erarchy in picture composition. Therefore, we build a FST-based model to extract features related to the transcription assessment in this paper. As the FST-based model is similar to the BOW metrics, it is also an error insensitive model. In this way, the impact of the first problem could be reduced. The FST model is very powerful in delivering the sequence informa-tion that a meaningless sequence of words related to the topic content will get low score under the mod-el. Therefore, it works well concerning the second problem. In a word, the FST model can not only be insensitive to the recognition error in the ASR sys-tem, but also remedy the weakness of BOW methods in ASR result scoring.

In the remainder of the paper, the related work of conventional AES methods is addressed in section 2. The details of the speech corpus and the examination grading criterion are introduced in section 3. The FST model and its improved method are proposed in section 4. The experiments and the results are presented in section 5. The final section presents the conclusion and future work. Conventional AES systems usually exploit textual features to assess the quality of writing mainly in three different facets: the content facet, the arrange-ment facet and the language usage facet. In the con-tent facet, many existing BOW techniques have been applied, such as the content vector analysis (Attal-i and Burstein, 2006; Attali, 2011) and the LSA to reduce the dimension of content vector (Landauer et al., 2003; Ishioka and Kameda, 2004; Kakkonen et al., 2005; Peng et al., 2010). In arrangement facet, Burstein et al. (2010) modeled the coherence in s-tudent essays, while Persing et al. (2010) modeled the organization. In language usage facet, grammar, spelling and punctuation are common features in as-sessment of the writing competence (Landauer et al., 2003; Attali and Burstein, 2006), and so does the di-versity of words and clauses (Lonsdale and Strong-Krause, 2003; Ishioka and Kameda, 2004). Besides the textual features, many methods are also proposed to evaluate the quality. The cosine similarity is one of the most common used similarity measures (Lan-dauer et al., 2003; Ishioka and Kameda, 2004; Attali and Burstein, 2006; Attali, 2011). Also, the regres-sion or the classification method is a good choice for scoring (Rudner and Liang, 2002; Peng et al., 2010). The rank preference techniques show excellent per-formance in grading essays (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011). Chen et al. (2010) proposed an unsupervised approach to AES.

As our work concerns more about the content in-tegrity, we applied the LSA-SVR approach (Peng et al., 2010) as the contrast experiment, which is very effective and robust. In the LSA-SVR method, each essay transcription is represented by a latent seman-tic space vector, which is regarded as the features in the SVR model. The LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) considers the relations between the dimensions in conventional vector space model (VSM) (Salton et al., 1975), and it can order the importance of each di-mension in the Latent Semantic Space (LSS). There-fore, it is useful in reducing the dimensions of the vector by truncate the high dimensions. The sup-port vector machine can be performed for the func-tion estimation (Smola and Sch  X  olkopf, 2004). The LSA-SVR method takes the LSS vector as the fea-ture vector, and applies the SVR for the training da-ta to obtain the SVR model. Each test transcription represented by the LSS vector can be scored by the model. As characteristics of the data determine the effec-tiveness of our methods, the details of it will be in-troduced first. Our experimental data is acquired in an oral English examination for ESL students. Three classes of students participated in the exam and 417 valid speeches are obtained in the examination. As the paper mainly focuses on scoring the text tran-scriptions, we have two ways to obtain them. One is manually typing the text transcriptions which we regarded as the Correct Recognition Result (CRR) transcription, and another is the ASR result which we named ASR transcription. We use the HTK (Y-oung et al., 2006), which stands for the state of art in speech recognition, to build the ASR system.
To better reveal the differences of the methods X  performance, all the experiments will be done in both transcriptions. A better understanding of the difference in the CRR transcription and the ASR transcription from the low score to the high score is shown in Table 2, where WER is the word error rate and MR is the match rate which is the words X  correct rate. 3.1 Criterion of Grading According to the Grading Criterion of the exami-nation, the score of the examination ranges from 0 to 20, and the grading score is divided into 7 levels with 3 points X  interval for each level. The criterion mainly concerns about two facets of the speech: the acoustic level and the content integrity. The details of the criterion are shown in Table 1. The criterion indicates that the integrity is the most important part in rating the speech. The acoustic level only work-s well in excellent speeches (Huang et al., 2010). Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on the integrity of content. The acoustic level as well as other levels such as grammar errors is ignored. Because the cri-terion is almost based on the content, our methods obtain good performance although we ignore some features. 3.2 Human Score Correlation and Distribution Each speech in our experiments was scored by three raters. Therefore, we have three scores for each speech. The final expert score is the average of these three scores. The correlations between human s-cores are shown in Table 3.

R1, R2, and R3 stand for the three raters, and ES is the final expert score. The Open Correlation (OC) is the correlation between human rater scores and the final scores, which are not related to the human scores themselves (average of the other two scores).
As most students are supposed to pass the ex-amination, the expert scores are mostly distributed above 12 points, as shown in Figure 1. In the range of the pass score, the distribution is close to normal distribution, while in the range of failed score except 0, the distribution is close to uniform distribution. The approach used in this paper is to build a standard FST for the current examination topic. However, the annotation of the corpus is necessary before the building. After the annotation and the building, the features are extracted based on the FST. The auto-mated machine score is computed from the features at last. Therefore, subsection 4.1 will show the cor-pus annotation, subsection 4.2 will introduce how to build the standard FST of the current topic, and sub-sections 4.3 and 4.4 will discuss how to extract the features, at last, an improved method is proposed in subsection 4.5. 4.1 Corpus Annotation The definitions of the sequences and hierarchy in the corpus will be given before we apply the FST algorithm. According to the characteristics of the picture composition examination, each composition can be held as an orderly combination of the senses of pictures. The senses of pictures are called sense-groups here. We define a sense-group as one sen-tence either describing the same one or two pictures or elaborating on the same pictures. The descrip-tion sentence is labeled with a tag  X  X  X (main sense of the picture) and the elaboration one is labeled with  X  X  X (subordinate sense of the picture). The first giv-en sentence in the examination is labeled with 0m and the other describing sentences for the 1 to 4 pic-tures are labeled with 1m to 4m, while the elabo-ration ones for the 4 pictures are labeled with 1s to 4s. Therefore, each sentence in the composition is labeled as a sense-group. For the entire 417 CRR transcriptions, we manually labeled 274 transcrip-tions whose scores are higher than 15 points. We gained 8 types of labels from the manually labeled results. They are 0m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 34m (one sen-tence describes both of the third and the fourth pic-tures), 4m, 2s and 4s. Other labels were discarded for the number of their appearance is very low. The distribution of sentences with each label is shown in Figure 2. There are 1679 sentences in the 274 CRR transcriptions and 1667 are labeled in the eight sym-bols. 4.2 FST Building In this paper, we build three types of FST to extract scoring features with the help of openFST tool (Al-lauzen et al., 2007). The first is the sense-group F-ST, the second is the words to each sense-group FST and the last is the words to all the sense-groups FST. They are shown in Figure 3.

The definition of the sense-group has been giv-en in subsection 4.1. The sense-group FST can de-scribe all the possible proper sense-group sequences of the current picture composition topic. It is also an acceptor trained from the labeled corpus. We use manually labeled corpus, which are the sequences of sense-groups of the CRR transcriptions with ex-pert scores higher than 15 points, to build the sense-group FST. In the process, each CRR transcription sense-group sequence is a simple sense-group FST. Later, we unite these sense-group FSTs to get the final FST which considers every situation of sense-group sequences in the train corpus. Also, we use the operation of  X  X eterminize X  and  X  X inimize X  in openFST to optimize the final sense-group FST that its states have no same input label and is a smallest FST.
 The second type is the words to sense-group F-ST. It determines what word sequence input will re-sult in what sense-group output. With the help of these FSTs, we can find out how students use lan-guage to describe a certain sense-group, or in other words, a certain sense-group is usually constructed with what kind of word sequence. All the differ-ent sentences with their sense-group labels are tak-en from the train corpus. We regard each sentence as a simple words to sense-group FST, and then u-nite these FSTs which have the same sense-group la-bel. The final union FSTs can transform proper word sequence into the right sense-group. Like building the sense-group FST, the optimization operations of  X  X eterminize X  and  X  X inimize X  are also done for the FSTs.
 The last type of FST is a words to sense-groups FST. We can also treat it as a words FSA, because any word sequence accepted by the words to sense-groups FST is considered to be an integrated com-position. Meanwhile, it can transform the word se-quence into the sense-group label sequence which is very useful in extracting the scoring features (de-tails will be presented in subsection 4.4). The F-ST is built from the other two types of FST that we made before. We compute the composition of all the words to each sense-group FSTs (the second type) and the sense-group FST (the first type) with the op-erations of  X  X ompose X  in openFST. Then, the com-position result is the words to sense-groups FST, the third type of FST in this paper. 4.3 Search for the Best Path in FST Now we have successfully built the words to sense-groups FST, the third type described above. Just like the similarity methods mentioned in section 2 can score essays from a have-been-scored similar essay, we need to find the best path, which is closest to the to-be-scored transcription, in the FST. Here, we apply the edit distance to measure how best the path is. This means the best path is the word sequence path in the FST which has the smallest edit distance compared with the to-be-scored transcription X  X  word sequences .

Here, we modify the Wagner-Fischer algorithm (Wagner and Fischer, 1974), which is a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm, to quest the best path in the FST. A simple example is illustrated in Figure 4. The best path can be described as EDcost is the edit distance from the transcription to the paths which start at state 0 and end at the end state. The DP process can be described by equation (3): The minEDcost(j) is the accumulated minimum ed-it distance from state 0 to state j, and the cost(i,j) is the cost of insertion, deletion or substitution from s-tate j to state i. The equation means the minED of state i can be computed by the accumulated minED-cost of state j in the phase p. The state j belongs to the have-been-calculated state set { X 0 ,. . . , X p  X  1 phase p. In phrase p, we compute the best path and its edit distance from the transcription for all the to-be-calculated states which is the X p shown in Fig-ure 4. After computing all the phrases, the best path and its edit distances of the end states are obtained. Then the final best path is the one with the smallest edit distance. 4.4 Feature Extraction After building the FST and finding the best path for the to-be-scored transcription, we can extrac-t some effective features from the path information and the transcription. Inspired by the similarity s-coring measures, our proposed features represent the similarity between the best path X  X  word sequence and the to-be-scored transcription.

The features used for the scoring model are as fol-lows:  X  The Edit Distance (ED):  X  The Normalized Edit Distance(NED):  X  The Match Number(MN):  X  The Match Rate(MR):  X  The Continuous Match Value(CMV):  X  The Length(L):  X  The Sense-group Scoring Feature(SSF): 4.5 Extend the FST model with the similarity Because the FST is trained from the limited corpus, it does not contain all the possible situations prop-er for the current composition topic. To complete the current FST model, we add the similarity of syn-onym to extend the FST model so that it can handle more situations.

The extension of the FST model is mainly reflect-ed in calculation of the edit distance of the best path. The previous edit distance, in equation (2), refers to the Levenshtein distance in which the insertion-s, deletions and substitutions have equal cost, but in the edit distance in this section, the cost of substi-tutions is less than that of insertions and deletion-s. Here, we assume that the cost of substitutions is based on the similarity of the two words. Then with the help of different cost of substitutions, each word edge is extended to some of its synonym word edges under the cost of similarity. The new edit distance is calculated by equation (7) as follows: where, sim is the similarity of two words.

We used the Wordnet::Similarity software pack-age (Pedersen et al., 2004) to calculate the similarity between every two words at first. However, the per-formance X  X  reduction of the AES system indicates that the similarity is not good enough to extend the FST model. Therefore, we seek for human help to accurate the similarity calculation. We manual-ly checked the similarity, and deleted some improp-er similarity. Thus the final similarity applied in our experiment is the Wordnet::Similarity software com-puting result after the manual check. In this section, the proposed features and our FST methods will be evaluated on the corpus we men-tioned above. The contrasting approach, the LSA-SVR approach, will also be presented. 5.1 Data Setup The experiment corpus consists of 417 speeches. With the help of manual typing and the ASR system, 417 CRR transcriptions and 417 ASR transcriptions are obtained from the speeches after preprocessing which includes the capitalization processing and the stemming processing. We divide them into 3 sets by the same distribution of their scores. Therefore, there are totally 6 sets, and each of them has 139 of the transcriptions. The FST building only uses the CRR transcriptions whose expert scores are higher than 15 points. While treating one set (one CRR set) as the FST building train set, we get the ED, NED, MN, MR, CMV features and the SMR vectors for the other two sets(could be either CRR sets or ASR sets). Then, the SSF is obtained by another set as the SVR train set and the last set as the test set. The parameters of the SVR are trained through the grid search from the whole data sets (ASR or CRR set-s) by cross-validation. Therefore, except the length feature, the other six features of each set can be ex-tracted from the FST model.

Also, we presented the result of using LSA-SVR approach as a contrast experiment to show the im-provement of our FST model in scoring oral English picture composition.

To quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the methods, the Pearson correlation between the expert scores and the automated results is adopted as the performance measure. 5.2 Correlation of Features The correlations between the seven features and the final expert scores are shown in Tables 4 and 5 on the three sets.

The MN and CMV are very good features, while the NED is not. This is mainly due to the nature of the examination. When scoring the speech, human raters concern more about how much valid informa-tion it contains and irrelevant contents are not taken for penalty. Therefore, the match features are more reasonable than the edit distance features. This im-pact is similar to the result displayed by the ASR output performance in Table 2 in section 3, where the WER has significant difference from the low s-core speeches to the high score ones while the MR does not, and the MR is much better than the WER.
As the length feature is a strong correlation fea-ture in CRR transcription, the MR feature, which is normalized by the length, is strongly affected. How-ever, with the impact declining in the ASR transcrip-tion, the MR feature performs very well. This also explains the reason of different correlations of ED and NED in CRR transcription.

The SSF is entirely based on the FST model, so the impact of the length feature is very low. The decline of it in different transcriptions is mainly be-cause of the ASR error. 5.3 Performance of the FST Model For each test transcription, it has 12 dimensions of F-ST features. The ED, NED, MN, MR and CMV fea-tures have two dimensions of each as trained from two different FST building sets. The SSF needs t-wo train sets as there are two train models: one is for the FST building model and another is for the SVR model. As different sets for different models, it also has two dimension features. We use the linear regression to combine these 12 features to the final automated score. The linear regression parameter-s were trained from all the data by cross-validation. After the weight of each feature and the linear bias are gained, we calculate the automated score of each transcription by the FST features. The performance of our FST model is shown in Table 6. Compared with it, the performance of the LSA-SVR algorithm, the baseline in our paper, is also shown. As a usual best feature for AES, the length shows its outstand-ing performance in CRR transcription. However, it fails in the ASR transcription.

As we have predicted above, the BOW algorith-m (the LSA-SVR) performance declines drastically in the ASR transcription, which also happens to the length feature. By contrast, the decline of the per-formance of our FST method is acceptable consid-ering the impact of recognition errors in the ASR system. This means the FST model is an error in-sensitive model that is very appropriate for the task. 5.4 Improvement of FST by Adding the The improved FST extends the original FST model by considering the word similarity in substitution-s. In the extension, the similarities of the synonyms describe the invisible (extended) part of the FST, so it should be very accurate for the substitutions cost. Therefore, we added manual intervention to the sim-ilarity result calculated by the wordnet::similarity software packet.

After we added the similarity of synonym to ex-tend the FST model, the performance of the new model increased stably in the CRR transcription. However, the increase is not significant in the AS-R transcription (shown in Table 7). We believe it is because the superiority of the improved model is dis-guised by the ASR error. In other words, the impact of ASR error under the FST model is more signifi-cant than the improvement of the FST model. The performance correlation of our FST model in the CRR transcription is about 0.9 which is very close to the human raters X  (shown in Table 3). Even though the performance correlation in the ASR transcription declines compared with that in the CRR transcrip-tion, the FST methods still perform very well under the current recognition errors of the ARS system. The aforementioned experiments indicate three points. First, the BOW algorithm has its own weak-ness. In regular text essay scoring, the BOW algo-rithm can have excellent performance. However, in certain situations, such as towards ASR transcription of oral English speech, its weakness of sequence ne-glect will be magnified, leading to drastic decline of performance. Second, the introduced FST model is suitable in our task. It is an error insensitive mod-el under the task of automated oral English picture composition scoring. Also, it considers the sequence and the hierarchy information. As we expected, the performance of the FST model is more outstanding than that of the BOW metrics in CRR transcription, and the decline of performance is acceptable in AS-R transcription scoring. Third, adding the similarity of synonyms to extend the FST model improves the system performance. The extension can complete the FST model, and achieve better performance in the CRR transcription.

The future work may focus on three facets. First, as the extension of the FST model is a preliminary study, there is much work that can be done, such as calculating the similarity more accurately without manual intervention, or finding a balance between the original FST model and the extended one to im-prove the performance in ASR transcription. Sec-ond, as the task is speech evaluation, considering the acoustic features may give more information to the automated scoring system. Therefore, the features at the acoustic level could be introduced to com-plete the scoring model. Third, the decline of the performance in ASR transcription is derived from the recognition error of ASR system. Therefore, im-proving the performance of the ASR system or mak-ing full use of the N-best lists may give more accu-rate transcription for the AES system.
