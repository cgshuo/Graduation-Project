 A shortcoming of current approaches for music recommen-dation is that they consider user-specific characteristics only on a very simple level, typically as some kind of interaction between users and items when employing collaborative filter-ing. To alleviate this issue, we propose several user features that model aspects of the user X  X  music listening behavior: diversity, mainstreaminess, and novelty of the user X  X  music taste. To validate the proposed features, we conduct a com-prehensive evaluation of a variety of music recommendation approaches (stand-alone and hybrids) on a collection of al-most 200 million listening events gathered from Last.fm . We report first results and highlight cases where our diversity, mainstreaminess, and novelty features can be beneficially integrated into music recommender systems.

Music recommendation has become a popular research and business topic over the past few years [3, 10]. While the importance of incorporating user characteristics and contex-tual aspects into recommender systems has been acknowl-edged many times, among others in [12, 14, 1], work that looks into this matter in the domain of music recommenda-tion is still scarce.

Baltrunas et al. [2] focus on music recommendation in cars, taking into account traffic, road, driver, and weather conditions. Cheng and Shen [4] propose a music recom-mender that exploits location, listening history, music de-scriptors, and music popularity trends. Wang et al. [13] propose a mobile music recommender that predicts user ac-tivity from time, acceleration, and ambient noise, and se-lects music from a set of tracks that have been labeled in advance by the user to fit a certain activity. A similar ap-proach is taken by Park et al. [8] who learn emotional states from weather, light level, and temporal data, and again rec-ommend music by matching with pre-labeled tracks. These works concentrate on factors other than the previous music listening behavior when modeling the user, ignoring the po-tential usefulness of decent features that describe aspects of the listeners X  music consumption. 1
We already investigated in [11] a variety of user demo-graphics to filter results of different music recommendation algorithms. We found significant improvements when tai-loring music recommendations to users of similar age, living in the same country (in particular, for the US and Russia), and enjoying either folk, blues, or jazz music. In the work at hand, we develop more elaborate listening-specific user attributes and center our recommendation models around these. We further investigate a content-based recommender and a variety of hybrids and provide detailed results.
In the remainder of the paper we first present the em-ployed music recommendation approaches (Section 2). We then introduce the proposed user characteristics (Section 3), before detailing the used dataset and experimental setup, and discussing the results (Section 4). Conclusions and pos-sible extensions round off this paper (Section 5).
We investigate stand-alone approaches as well as hybrids, which are detailed in the following. Each user u has a listen-ing profile L u which contains all items listened to  X  artists in our case. Furthermore, u is assigned a normalized play-count vector ~p u containing the number of listening events over all items I in the corpus. This vector is normalized so that its Euclidean norm equals 1. For the content-based approaches, each item i is assigned a TF  X  IDF vector ~w which we construct by (i) gathering all Last.fm tags and tag weights of i , (ii) treating the tags of i as a document and the corresponding tag weights as term frequencies, (iii) filtering tags that occur for less than 100 items (i.e. &lt; 0 . 01% of all
We do not consider as decent features the result of feeding the listening histories of users into a collaborative filtering approach, which has been done before of course. artists in the corpus), and (iv) computing the ltc variant [6] of TF  X  IDF based on the described vector space model.
PB: A popularity-based recommender that returns the N items listened to most frequently by the entirety of users in the dataset, irrespective of time.

CF: A user-based collaborative filtering approach that recommends N items listened to by u  X  X  nearest neighbors in terms of listening histories; neighbors are identified by computing the Inner product between ~p u and ~p v  X  v  X  V , where V is the set of all users excluding u . 2
IB: A content-based (instance-based) approach that iden-tifies for each training item in L u its nearest neighbors via maximizing cosine similarity between ~w i and ~w j  X  j  X  J , where J is the set of all items excluding i .

LB: An extension to CF in that we consider as nearest neighbors of u only users that are located in the same coun-try as u . Although this seems to be only a rough description of user location, LB turned out to frequently improve per-formance when integrating such a location component in a hybrid approach.

RB: A baseline that randomly picks users and recom-mends N artists they listened to.

For CF , IB , and LB , we investigate two aggregation func-tions to fuse the recommendations contributed by the near-est neighbors, 3 in case they are overlapping: arithmetic mean or maximum between the similarity scores of each item that is recommended by more than 1 neighbor.
Leaving aside RB , we create hybrid systems that inte-grate combinations of PB , CF , IB , and LB . Fusing the re-sults of all recommenders involved in such a hybrid system is performed by rank aggregation applying Borda counts [5] on the similarity scores of items recommended by each in-volved approach. 4 This fusion technique has already proven successful for multimodal music recommendation [7]. In to-tal, we investigate the following 14 approaches, again, focus-ing on algorithmic combinations that performed superior in preliminary experiments:
In the following, we define the proposed listening-centric user features, we base our experiments on. We also indi-cate how we split the users in the dataset according to their feature values.
We define diversity of a user X  X  music taste in two ways: based on how often the user listens to each track in her
As a matter of fact, we omit from ~p ( u ) the items that occur in the test set.
In case of CF and LB , nearest neighbors refer to users; in case of IB , they refer to items.
We also investigated maximum, mean, sum, and product, but Borda outperformed these in the majority of cases in preliminary experiments. collection on average and based on the distinct number of genre tags in a user X  X  listening profile. The former variant is computed as D P C u = P u / | L u | where P u denotes the total number of playcounts of u and L u refers to the set of unique items u listened to. We create two user sets US_D_PC_[l|h] by splitting users at their median D P C value of 2 . 93 into showing low or high taste diversity, respectively. To com-pute diversity based on the second definition, we first in-dex all Last.fm tags assigned to the items in L u through a dictionary of almost 2 , 000 genres fetched from Freebase . This naturally results in a set of unique genre tags G u that describes u  X  X  music taste. Diversity is then simply com-puted as D genres u = | G u | . Users are split into 3 categories US_D_genres_[l|m|h] , the borders between them being de-fined at thirds of accumulated D genres values.
We also describe users in terms of the degree to which they prefer music items that are currently popular or rather ig-nore such trends. We hence coin the term  X  X ainstreaminess X  and define the respective user feature as follows. We first define the  X  X ainstream X  as a distribution of relative item frequencies among the global set of listening events. To this end, a global playcount vector ~p is defined analogously to ~p in Section 2, but on the overall set of listening events and normalized by the sum P of all listening events. The main-streaminess M u of a user u then relates the user playcounts to these global playcounts: M u = P p P up i is the frequency user u listens to each item p i in vec-tor ~p , P u and P p i is the total playcount of user u and item p i , respectively. To account for temporal dynamics in the mainstream and measure to which extent users fol-low current trends, we introduce a time window which we set to 6 months in our experiments. 5 Considering only listening events within the current window t naturally ex-tends the definition of M u to M ut of user u in time win-dow t . Shifting t along the temporally ordered listening events of user u and computing the arithmetic mean over all M ut values yields again a scalar value describing u  X  X  main-streaminess. For our experiments, users are categorized into 3 classes for each definition (global and 6-month-average): US_M_global_[l|m|h] and US_M_avg_6m_[l|m|h] ; the bor-ders between them are again defined at thirds of accumu-lated mainstreaminess values.
This feature models the inclination of user u to listen to unknown music. Splitting u  X  X  listening history into time slots of again 6 months, we calculate the percentage of new items listened to, i.e. items appearing for the first time in u  X  X  listening history. The novelty N ut of u  X  X  listening events where L ut is the entirety of items u listened to in time win-dow t , including duplicates, and l /  X  L ux  X  x &lt; t denotes all listening events not listened to by u at any time before t . Averaging over all time slots user u was active in, we obtain u  X  X  overall novelty score N u . We again investigate user sets
Preliminary analyses of the data evidenced that a time window of 6 months represents a good trade-off between computational complexity and stability, still incorporating important music trends. categorized at accumulated thirds into low, medium, and high novelty: US_N_avg_6m_[l|m|h] .
To investigate if tailoring music recommendations to lis-teners within a certain group according to our diversity, mainstreaminess, and novelty definitions improves recom-mendation results, we perform the following experiments.
The used dataset covers 191 , 108 , 462 listening events by 16 , 429 active Last.fm users, who listened to 9 , 163 , 123 unique tracks from 2 , 372 , 601 unique albums by 1 , 140 , 014 unique artists. The average number of listening events per user is 11 , 603  X  7 , 130. We investigate 14 recommendation meth-ods (7 stand-alone and 7 hybrids, cf. Section 2) and 14 user categories (cf. Section 3). For each combination of recom-mendation approach and user category, we perform 5-fold cross-validation on a per-user basis. To this end, we split the entire listening history of each user into a training set containing 80% unique artists and a test set containing the remaining 20%, and perform five experiments, iterating over all five permutations.
We compute average precision, recall, and F1-score as per-formance measures, where we compute the arithmetic mean over all users. We obtain precision at different recall levels by varying the number of recommended artists between 1 and 1000. Note that the highest achievable recall for PB and CF is roughly 39%, because of the frequent case that some artists are listened to by only a single user, are hence never correctly recommended. In the following tables, we show for all user categories the best performing approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. 6 Tables 1 and 2 show the results for the two diversity definitions, Tables 3 and 4, respectively, for the global and 6-month-average of the mainstreaminess definition, and Table 5 for the novelty using a 6-month-window. Statistically significant results, identified by employing the Mann-Whitney U test for equal means of samples [9], are marked with asterisks. For com-parative reasons, Table 6 shows the performance measures for all approaches and the entire user set. Comparing the results over all user sets and methods, we make the following observations: Results for all approaches are available on request.

We proposed three computational features that describe a user X  X  music taste: diversity, mainstreaminess, and nov-elty. We performed first experiments investigating to which Table 3: Results for user categories US_M_global .

 extent music recommendations can be tailored when cate-gorizing users according to these features. Comparative ex-periments on a variety of stand-alone and hybrid recommen-dation algorithms identified several algorithms that should be preferred when addressing certain user groups. Summa-rizing our findings, we conclude that hybrid methods gener-ally outperform stand-alone recommenders, irrespective of user group. For users with high mainstreaminess, a popu-larity component is particularly important, ideally coupled with location-based filtering. Content-based recommenders should not be used as stand-alone, but recommendations benefit when they are integrated with collaborative filtering or popularity recommenders.

While most results may not seem too surprising, the pre-sented experiments serve as a good starting point for further investigations on tailoring music recommendations accord-ing to user characteristics. We noticed that the used dataset is biased towards frequent users of Last.fm . We will thus as-sess if results generalize to less active listeners. In addition, we plan to directly integrate diversity, mainstreaminess, and novelty as user factors into matrix factorization algorithms.
