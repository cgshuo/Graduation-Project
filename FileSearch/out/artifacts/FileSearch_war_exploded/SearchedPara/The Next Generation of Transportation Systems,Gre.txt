Controling Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for mini-mizing the impact on the environment is one of the ma-jor challenges in front of the human civilization. Although future concentrations, damages and costs are unknown, it is widely recognized that major emissions reduction efforts are needed. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol promoted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aimed at fighting global warming. The main goal is  X  X tabi-lization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic in-terference with the climate system X  [9]. According to the International Energy Agency [1], energy efficient in build-ings, industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world X  X  energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help con-trolling global emissions of greenhouse gases. The report [1] describes a series of scenarios showing how key energy tech-nologies can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the green-house gas which is most responsible for climate change.
Of the four primary GHG under scrutiny, carbon dioxide (CO2), and the need to lower carbon emissions in general, is of paramount concern. It is estimated that transportation activities are responsible for approximately 25% to 30% of total U.S. GHG emissions, with the on-highway commer-cial truck market accounting for over 45% of transportation GHG. However, the transportation sector emissions remain almost entirely unaddressed with respect to GHG and CO2 reduction.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provided guidelines for calculating carbon emission offer es-timations only for certain common types of fuels; even the
A growing amount of literature and commercial applica-tions are emerging to address the challenges of the trans-portation systems and emissions reductions. Several papers [8, 3, 7] dealing with the vehicle health data mining problems are emerging.

The US National Science Foundation and European Re-search Council are actively promoting research on  X  X he sus-tainable management of both the man-made and the natu-ral environment and its resources. X  . To this end, increased knowledge on the interaction between the climate, the bio-sphere, ecosystems and human activities is sought and new environmentally-friendly technologies, tools and services need to be developed. NSF recently supported the Next Gen-eration Data Mining Summit 1 that explored many of the relevant issues.

For example, the Green Cars is an initiative involving research on a broad range of technologies and smart energy infrastructures essential to achieve a breakthrough in the use of renewable and non-polluting energy sources, safety and traffic fluidity. The project MERGE (Mobile Energy Resources for Grids of Electricity) will prepare the Euro-pean electrical system for the massification of electric ve-hicles. The aim is to find solutions that will minimize the need to strengthen to electric grid infrastructures and power systems, and thus avoid extra costs that would have to be borne by the users of the electric vehicles. This is the largest research project of the 7 th EU Framework Programme. Advanced data stream mining systems such as InfoSphere Streams from IBM [5] are finding applications in this domain [4]. Wireless emissions monitoring standards for cars are emerging. NASA is developing advanced Integratd Vehicle Health Monitoring (IVHM) program for supporting research and other resources 2 .

Commercial systems are also being developed. Examples include the MineFleet system [6] from Agnik, that recently received the 2010 Frost &amp; Sullivan North American Enabling Technology of the Year Award in the area of commercial telematics. MineFleet is a decision support system that of-fers a powerful onboard data stream mining software for modeling, benchmarking, and monitoring of vehicle health, emissions, driver behavior, fuel-consumption, and fleet char-acteristics. It is an autonomous onboard distributed data stream mining platform. It continuously monitor data gen-erated from vehicle sensors, analyzes the data streams (man-ufacturer enhanced parameters, generic parameters, and fault-codes), and generates the predictive models, reports, and alerts.
Understanding the effects of greenhouse emissions requires advanced data analysis techniques for fully exploitation of remotely sensed data. Reducing the carbon footprints of buildings, vehicles, and airplanes would require continuous monitoring of sensors and detecting deviation from desired behavior.

Designing the next generation of transportation network becomes particularly challenging in the context of increasing demand for energy supplies and reducing greenhouse emis-sions. www.kd2u.org/NGDM09/ https://c3.ndc.nasa.gov/dl/
In order to address various challenges and make real-world impact in deployment, data mining models need to work seamlessly with systems, such as data stream systems (In-fosphere Streams [5], etc), in order to receive real-time data for training, model tuning as well asl real-time scoring and prediction. In the same time, it is important to understand the different roles between data mining and traditional phys-ical science that are more hypothesis-testing and simulation-based.
The panel will discuss the technologies of future, that might be available in the next 5 years. The main issue of next generation transportation systems are the environ-mental impacts. Data mining might play a relevant role in efficient adaptive cars and infrastructures by optimizing re-sources in real-time and at any-time. Overall, we need to develop and explore technology for a sustainable world.
