 Today X  X  globally networked society places great demand on the sharing of in-formation. However, the use of data containing personal information has to be restricted in order to protect individual privacy. To ensure the anonymity of the entities to which the sensitive data undergoing public or semipublic release refer, data holders often remove or encrypt exp licit identifiers such as names, medical care card numbers(MCN) and addresses. Th e process is called de-identifying the data.

However, such a de-identification procedure does not guarantee the privacy of individuals in the data. Released information often contains other data, such as race, date of birth, gender and Zip code, which can be linked to publicly available information to re-identify respondents and to infer information that was not intended for release. Sweeney reported that 87 percent of the population of the United States can be uniquely identified by the combinations of attributes: gender, date of birth, and 5-digit zip code [11].

Besides de-identification, an alternative approach is to restrict the release of information in some way. In this paper, we focus on the strategy of k -anonymity, which was first proposed by Samarati and Sweeney [10]. A microdata table satisfies k -anonymity if every record in the t able is identical to at least ( k  X  1) other records with respect to the set of quasi-identifier attributes. 1 Such a data set is called k -anonymous. As a result, an individual is indistinguishable from at least ( k  X  1) individuals in a k -anonymous data set.

Among the techniques proposed for providing anonymity in the release of microdata, the k -anonymity proposal focuses on two techniques in particular: generalization and suppression, which unlike other existing techniques, such as de-identification, preserve the truthfulness of the information. Generalization consists in substituting the values of a given attribute with more general values. We use  X  to denote the more general value. Fo r instance, we coul d generalize two different Zip code 4350 and 4373 to 435  X  . The other technique, referred to as data suppression, removes the part (cell suppression) or entire value (attribute suppression) of attributes from the microdata table. Note that suppressing an attribute to reach k -anonymity can equivalently b e modeled via a generalization of all the attribute values to  X  . 2
To illustrate the concept, consider the data in Table 1, which exemplifies medical data to be released after de-ide ntification. This table does not contain personal identification attributes, such as name, address, and medical care card number(MCN). However, values of other r eleased attributes, such as age, gender and Zip may appear in some external table jointly with the individual identity, and can therefore allow tracking. For instance, age, gender and Zip can be linked within Table 3 to reveal Name, Address, and City. In Table 1, for example, the first record is unique in these three attributes, and this combination, if unique in the external world as well, uniquely identifies the corresponding tuple as pertaining to  X  X ee, 10 Collard Court, Toowoomba X , thus revealing that he has reported Hypertension.

To avoid breaching privacy, Table 1 can be modified to Table 2. In Table 2, age is grouped into intervals, and Zips are clustered into large areas (the symbol  X  denotes any digit). A (tuple) record in the quasi-identifier is identical to at least three other records in Table 2, and therefore, no individual is identifiable.
A k -anonymous table protects individual privacy in the sense that, even if an adversary has access to all the quasi-ide ntifier attributes of all the individuals represented in the table, he would not be able to track down an individual X  X  record further than a set of at least k records. Thus, releasing a k -anonymous table prevents definitive record linkages with publicly available databases and keeps each individual hidden in a crowd of k  X  1otherpeople.

In recent years, numerous algorithms h ave been proposed for implementing k -anonymity via generalization and suppression. Samarati [9] presents an algo-rithm that exploits a binary search on the domain generalization hierarchy to find minimal k -anonymous table. We r ecently improve his algorithm by integrat-ing the hash-based technique [12]. Bayardo and Agrawal [3] presents an optimal algorithm that starts from a fully generalized table and specializes the dataset in a minimal k -anonymous table, exploiting ad hoc pruning techniques. LeFevre, DeWitt and Ramakrishnan [7] describes an algorithm that uses a bottom-up technique and a priori computation. Fung, Wang and Yu [4] present a top-down heuristic to make a table to be released k -anonymous. The approach applies to both continuous and categorical attributes. As far as k -anonymity problem is concerned, fewer theoretical results were obtained. The exceptions are Meyer-son and Williams [8] and Aggarwal e t al. [1,2] proved the optimal k -anonymity is
NP -hard (based on the number of cells and number of attributes that are generalized and suppressed) and describe approximation algorithms for optimal k -anonymity. In Section 3, we introduce two new variants of the k -anonymity problem, namely, the Restricted k -anonymity problem and Restricted k -anonymity problem on at-tribute and we discusses the connection between Restricted k -anonymity problem and general k -anonymity problem which stresses the significance of investigating this new class anonymity problem.

Our first contribution is the NP -hardness proof the Restricted k -anonymity problem and the Restricted k -anonymity problem on attribute ,andarepresented in Section 4 and 5. The theoretical results for Restricted k -anonymity problem also provide an alternative NP -hardness proof of general k -anonymity problem, which imply the main results obtained in [1,2,8].
The second contribution is presented in Section 6. Through a graphical repre-sentation of the microdata table, we develop a polynomial time algorithm for the Restricted 2-anonymity problem . Considering the connection between Restricted k -anonymity problem and general k -anonymity problem, we could develop an-other efficient algorithm for general k -anonymity problem as well. We will include this application part in a separate paper. Finally, conclusions and future work are given in Section 7. We consider degree-m tuples in the private database to be m -dimensional vec-tors v i ,drawnfrom m ,where is a (finite) alphabet of possible values for attributes(columns). Thus, the private databases under consideration are for-mally represented as subsets V  X  m .Let  X  be a symbol that is not in . Definition 1. Let t be a map from V to (  X  X  X  X  ) m . We say that t is a sup-{ v [ j ] ,  X  X  . 3 Intuitively speaking, a suppressor defines some kind of anonymous vector t ( v )= v in an anonymous set V  X  (  X  X  X  X  ) m . The coordinates of V are identical to the coordinates of V , except some may be suppressed by  X  . Consider following Now, we can extend the definition of a suppressor t to a set of vectors V . Here, we regard t ( V ) as a multiset 4 , when two or more vectors in V map to the same suppressed vector. (i.e. v = v  X  V , but t ( v )= t ( v )). Following, we define k -anonymity. Definition 2. Let t be a suppressor on the set V = { v 1 ,v 2 ,  X  X  X  ,v n } X  m . Then t ( V ) is k -anonymous if and only if for all v i  X  V ,thereexists k  X  1 indices i In other words, when a suppressor makes the database k -anonymous, it means that every anonymous vector is a m ember of a multiset of (at least) k identi-cal vectors. For example, t he left dataset in Fig.1 becomes 3-anonymous after suppressing by t .
 Restricted k -anonymity problem. Given V  X  m (where = { 0 , 1 } )such that the number of zeroes in each attribute (column) is exactly k ; Is there a sup-pressor t , such that t ( V )is k -anonymous and suppresses the minimum number of vector coordinates? EXAMPLE : The left dataset in Fig.2 is an instance of general 3-anonymity problem and the right dataset is an instance of Restricted 3-anonymity problem .
Another version of the Restricted k -anonymity problem is where we choose whether or not to suppress various attributes from the database. We say that attribute(column) j is suppressed by t if for all v  X  V , v [ j ]=  X  . Formally, we define the Restricted k -anonymity problem on attribute as follows: Restricted k -anonymity problem on attribute. Given V  X  m (where k ; Is there a suppressor t , such that t ( V )is k -anonymous and suppresses the minimum number of attributes (columns)?
The reason why we introduce the definition of Restricted k -anonymity problem is its close connection with general k -anonymity problem. Given an instance of general k -anonymity problem, we could construct an instance of the Restricted k -anonymity problem (take Fig.2 as an example, by adding three vectors v 4 ,v 5 ,v 6 , we can make the left dataset an instance of the Restricted 3-anonymity problem ), which could provide an alternative approach to solve the general k -anonymity problem. Currently, we are working on developing algorithms to find solutions of the restricted problem and with some post-processing, the solution can be a good solution for the general problem. In this section, we prove that the Restricted k -anonymity problem is NP -hard for k  X  3. First, recall the Restricted 3-anonymity problem .
 Restricted 3-anonymity problem :Given V = { v 1 ,v 2 ,  X  X  X  ,v n } X  m (where = { 0 , 1 } ) such that the number of zeroes in each attribute (column) is 3, and l  X  N : Is there a suppressor t , such that t ( V ) is 3-anonymous, and the total number of suppressed vector coordinates in t ( V )isatmost l ? Theorem 3. The Restricted 3-anonymity problem is NP -hard.
 Proof. The reduction is from Exact cover by 3-sets (X3C) [5]: Given a finite set X with | X | =3 q and a collection C of 3-element subsets of X ,does C contain an exact cover for X ; that is, a sub collection C  X  C such that every element of X occurs in exactly one member of C ?
Let X =( x 1 ,x 2 ,  X  X  X  ,x 3 q )and C =( C 1 ,C 2 ,  X  X  X  ,C m ), where | C i | =3for i =1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,m . We construct a database V as follows. For each x i , define an m -dimensional vector v i  X  m :
Set V =( v 1 ,v 2 ,  X  X  X  ,v 3 q ), l =3 q ( m  X  1), and the number of zeroes in each at-tribute(column) is 3 because of | C j | =3.Then V is an instance of the Restricted 3-anonymity problem .

Assume t is the optimal suppressor on V (i.e. suppresses the minimum num-ber of vector coordinates and maintains 3-anonymity). We claim that the total number of coordinates suppressed by t is at most 3 q ( m  X  1) if and only if there is an X3C in C .

Sufficiency. Suppose that there is an X3C C  X  C .For i =1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,n ,let j ( i ) be such that C j ( i ) is the unique set in C that contains x i . Define a suppressor t by: suppressor on V .
 and each element has identical anonymous vectors; i.e. t ( v i )= t ( v i )= t ( v i ). exactly one non- X  coordinate, the number of  X   X  X  is exactly 3 q ( m  X  1). Therefore the optimal 3-anonymous solution has at most 3 q ( m  X  1)  X   X  X  in its vectors.
Necessity: Suppose that t suppresses at most 3 q ( m  X  1) coordinates and there does not exist X3C . We draw a contradiction as follows. Consider any 3-anonymous solution t for V .First,weanswerthequestion:canthereexista vector with two non- X   X  X  in its anonymous form? Suppose that v i is such a vec-tor. Since t ( V ) is 3-anonymous, there must exist two other vectors v i and v i , Since the non- X  coordinates have the same values as in the original v i vectors, we must have v i , v i and v i identical in two different coordinates, j and j .By construction, any two vectors in V can match only in coordinates where they are in the two different sets, C j and C j of C . However, this means two different sets are identical in C , which is not possible. So for any feasible 3-anonymous suppressor t for V , every vector v i  X  V has at most one non- X  coordinate in its 3-anonymous form t ( v i ). Hence at least 3 q ( m  X  1) coordinates in t ( V )are suppressed.

Therefore, if we have a t ( V )withatmost3 q ( m  X  1) suppressed coordinates, it must be that every vector in t ( V ) has exactly one non- X  coordinate. Given this fact, we can construct an X3C C for C in the following way. For each value 0 (otherwise there can be no identical vectors). If this corresponds to the coordinate j ,weaddtheset C j toacover C . Clearly we produce a collection of sets such that each element in X is in at least one set. Since there are 3 identical vectors for every vector v  X  V (including v ), it follows that there are at most q sets in C . Since we need at least q sets to cover every element, there must be exactly q sets in C ,whichisexactlyan X3C . This contradicts our assumption, so it follows that there is an X3C in C if and only if the optimal 3-anonymous solution has at most 3 q ( m  X  1)  X   X  X .
 Corollary 4. The Restricted k -anonymity problem is NP -hard for k  X  3 . Corollary 5. The k -anonymity problem is NP -hard for k  X  3 .
 Corollary 5 was first obtained by Meyerson and Williams [8]. In this section, we consider the situation whether or not to suppress various attributes from the database and we prove it is hard as well.
 where each v i represents an element in X . Assume t suppresses the least number of attributes and is defined as in Theorem 3.
 Theorem 6. The Restricted 3-anonymity problem on attribute is NP -hard. Proof. (proof sketch) We claim that there exists a suppressor that suppresses at most m  X  q attributes and maintains 3-anonymous if and only if C has an X3C .If C has an X3C , then by suppressing those m  X  q attributes not in the cover, each remaining attributes has 3 vectors that has the same value, which is 3-anonymous. Conversely, if we have a suppressor t as above, then for every j , since the anonymous table is 3-anonymous and the number of zeroes is 3, is not suppressed, then there exists 3 vectors with the same value under this attribute. Since the two attributes i and j are not suppressed in a 3-anonymous table if and only if C i  X  C j =  X  ,atleast m  X  q attributes must be suppressed in any 3-anonymous table. Therefore, if we obtain a t ( V )withatmost m  X  q suppressed attributes, it must be that exactly m  X  q attributes are suppressed in a 3-anonymous table. Then we can obtain an X3C as in Theorem 3.
 Corollary 7. The Restricted k -anonymity problem on attribute is NP -hard for k  X  3 .
 Corollary 8. The k -anonymity problem on attribute is NP -hard for k  X  3 . Corollary 8 implies the result obtained by Aggarwal et al .[1,2]. In this section, we present a gr aphic representation of the Restricted 2-anonymity problem , which produces a polynomial time algorithm with running time in O ( n 2 m ). First, recall the Restricted 2-anonymity problem :
The transformation is made from the perfect matching problem in a simple graph. We include its definition here for completeness.
 Perfect matching problem :Givenagraph G =( U, E )with | U | = n and | E | = m , is there a subset S  X  E of n/ 2 edges such that each vertex of U is contained in exactly one edge of S ?
Without loss of generality, assume that no two columns in the dataset have the same values. (If not, we could simplify the dataset by deleting the repeated one, which has no effect on the anonymity process) Also assume that V = { v
Let U =( v 1 ,v 2 ,  X  X  X  ,v n )and E = { e ik ( j ) } where for each j =1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,m , e ik =( v i ( j ) ,v k ( j )) with v i ( j )= v k ( j )=0accordingtotheassumption.Then we get the simple graph G =( U, E )with | U | = n and | E | = m .(SeeFig.3as an example.) On the contrary, if we have the simple graph G =( U, E )with follows: For each v i , define an m -dimensional vector v i  X  m as v i [ j ]=0if v i  X  e j ; Otherwise, v i [ j ]=1;Set V = { v 1 ,v 2 ,  X  X  X  ,v n } . Then because the graph G is simple, obviously, the number of zeroes in each attribute (column) is 2, which is an instance of the Restricted 2 -anonymity problem .
 Theorem 9. Given an instance of the Restricted 2-anonymity problem, the opti-mal Restricted 2-anonymous solution has at most n ( m  X  1)  X   X  X  suppressed by t if and only if there is a perfect matching in the corresponding constructed graph G . Proof. The proof is similar to Theorem 3, we omit it here due to the page limit. Corollary 10. The Restricted 2-anonymity problem can be solved in polynomial time.
 Running Time. The running time of Algorithm 1 depends on Step 2, which canbesolvedin O ( n 2 m ) [6]. Since the transformation could be done in at most O ( n 2 ), the algorithm time complexity for Restricted 2-anonymity problem is in O ( n 2 m ). Also, since the graph can be speci fied by its vertex adjacency matrix A , which could be described by at most nm bits of input, so the space (memory) complexity of the algorithm is O ( nm ). Note that if we find out all the perfect matchings M in G , then we could find all the possible 2-anonymous tables. EXAMPLE : We use Fig.4 as an example to illustrate how Algorithm 1 works. Our objective is to make the left dataset in Fig.4 2-anonymous. The left graph in Fig.3 is the graphic representation of the dataset in Fig.4. In that graph, we 1, all the 2-anonymous tables are shown in Fig.4. In this paper, we introduce two new variants of the k -anonymity problem, namely, the Restricted k -anonymity problem and Restricted k -anonymity problem on attribute . We prove that both problems are NP -hard for k  X  3. The results imply the main results obtained by Meyerson and Williams. We have also de-veloped a polynomial time algorithm for the Restricted 2-anonymity problem by giving a graphical representation of the microdata table.
Our future work is to develop applicable algorithms for general k -anonymity problem based on the theoretical results obtained in this paper. More specifi-cally, it involves developing a new efficien t exact algorithm and providing better approximate algorithm scheme for general k -anonymity problem based on the connection and transf ormation between the Restricted k -anonymity problem and general k -anonymity problem.
