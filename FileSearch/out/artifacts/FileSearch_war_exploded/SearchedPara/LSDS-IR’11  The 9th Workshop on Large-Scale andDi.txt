 The growth of the Web and user bases lead to important per-formance problems for large-scale Web search engines. The LSDS-IR  X 11 workshop focuses on research contributions re-lated to the scalability and efficiency of distributed informa-tion retrieval (IR) systems. The workshop also encourages contributions that propose different ways of leveraging di-versity and multiplicity of resources available in distributed systems. More specifically, we are interested in novel appli-cations, models, and architectures that deal with efficiency and scalability of distributed IR systems.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Search pro-cess; H.3.4 [ Systems and Software ]: Distributed systems Algorithms, Performance Distributed search, information retrieval, scalability LSDS-IR  X 11 continues the efforts of past workshops: P2PIR (collocated with SIGIR  X 05, CIKM  X 06,  X 07), HDIR (collocated with SIGIR  X 08), and LSDS-IR (collocated with SIGIR  X 07,  X 09,  X 10 and with CIKM  X 08). The workshop aims to combine the efforts from past events and to redefine the directions for future research in distributed IR. It brings to-gether both experienced and young researchers in the field, focusing on scalability issues and novel applications. It also attracts contributions from related communities, such as dis-tributed computing, P2P, cloud computing, and web search.
The topics that are of interest to the workshop include:
This year we added three new topics to our workshop, for which we were pleased to accept position papers, pre-sentations of preliminary results or breakthrough ideas. We introduced the following special themes:
This year we accepted six papers out of nine submissions.

We are very glad to have K. Selcuk Candan and Aristides Gionis as the keynote speakers of this year.
 K. Selcuk Candan is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Science Engineering at the Arizona State Univer-sity and is leading the EmitLab research group. He joined the department in August 1997, after receiving his Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland at College Park. Prof. Candan X  X  primary research interest is in the area of management of non-traditional, het-erogeneous, and imprecise (such as multimedia, web, and scientific) data. His various research projects in this do-main are funded by diverse sources, including the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, Mellon Foun-dation, and DES/RSA (Rehabilitation Services Administra-tion). He has published over 140 articles and many book chapters. He has also authored 9 patents. Recently, he co-authored a book titled  X  X ata Management for Multimedia Retrieval X  for the Cambridge University Press and co-edited  X  X ew Frontiers in Information and Software as Services: Ser-vice and Application Design Challenges in the Cloud X  for Springer. Prof. Candan is an editorial board member of the Very Large Databases (VLDB) journal and the Journal of Multimedia. He has served in the organization and program committees of various conferences. In 2006, he served as an organization committee member for SIGMOD X 06, the flag-ship database conference of the ACM and one of the best conferences in the area of management of data. In 2008, he served as a PC Chair for another leading, flagship confer-ence of the ACM, this time focusing on multimedia research (MM X 08). He also served in the review board of the Pro-ceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB). In 2010, he was a program co-chair for ACM CIVR X 10 conference and a program group leader for ACM SIGMOD X 10. In 2011, he is serving as a general co-chair for the ACM MM X 11 conference and is in the executive committee of ACM SIGMM. In 2012, he will serve as a general co-chair for ACM SIGMOD X 12. In 2012, he will also serve in the organizing committees of ACM MM X 12 and VLDB X 12.
 Aristides Gionis is a senior researcher in Yahoo! Research, Barcelona. He received his Ph.D from the Computer Science Department of Stanford University in 2003, and between 2003 and 2006 he has been a senior researcher at the Ba-sic Research Unit of Helsinki Institute of Information Tech-nology, Finland. His research interests include data min-ing, web mining, and algorithmic data analysis. Aristides is currently serving as an associate editor in the journal of Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS). He served as PC co-chair of ECML PKDD 2010. His recent program committee memberships include WWW 2011, ICDM 2011, VLDB 2011, SIGMOD 2012, PODS 2012, and being senior PC in ECML PKDD 2012, KDD 2011, and ICDE 2012. We thank all the authors who submitted a paper to LSDS-IR 2011, the CIKM 2011 workshop chair (Craig Macdonald), the invited speakers, and the reviewers who helped us in selecting the interesting papers presented this year. Also, we would like to thank Yahoo! for covering the expenses of Aristides Gionis.
