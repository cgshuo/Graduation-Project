 Clustering aims at grouping objects into cluste rs so that objects in a cluster are similar actual clustering phenomenon. They first ask themselves how many clusters are proper to reveal the actual clustering phenomenon [1]. Generally, the number of clusters is decided based on various cluster validity indexes through a trial-and-error and data-dependent problem. Besides, the initial cluster centers are regarded as results. Typically, random initial-center generation is the most common method. However, it tends to lead the clustering result converge to a local optimum. 
We propose a Clustering-Oriented Star Coordinate Translation (COSCT) method method [2], COSCT is further enhanced in many aspects. SCT is a data visualization coordinate plane. By observing the visualizing result displayed in the plane, users can Fig. 1 shows the translation result of SCT that maps objects from a nine-dimensional space into a star-coordinate plane. For each recognized cluster, moreover, the points close to its cluster center are also discerned roughly, so that the location of the cluster center in original multi-dimensional space is inferred from the locations of these near points in the original space. However, it is still hard for users to manipulate SCT since adjustments for the rotation angle and length of each coordinate axis could be time-consuming and tedious. Only when the lengths and rotation angles are adjusted well as shown in Fig. 1, the visualizing result in the plane just reveals a meaningful clustering phenomenon. 
Therefore, the purpose of COSCT is to make the star-coordinate plane show real clustering phenomenon without human manipulation. That is, the constructed plane will be clustering-oriented. Different to SCT, COSCT involves two new procedures: feature weighting and coordinate arrangement. In the feature weighting procedure, a weight measure that evaluates the importance of each feature to evaluated weight of each feature represents the unit length of its corresponding coordinate axis so as to solve the length adjustment problem. In the coordinate problem systematically, and is solved by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) coordinate plane constructed by COSCT. Therefore, users can be more confident of deciding the number of clusters and initial cluster centers by observing the plane, so that it makes clustering algorithms yield good clustering results successfully. 2.1 Feature Weighting Procedure f scales of all M features. In this paper, a weight measure that evaluates the importance of each f m to clustering is developed from the dissimilarities of all pairs of objects in f
We use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [4] to infer  X  so that (3): EM is stopped at the iteration t , the estimate  X  ( t ) serves as the optimal  X  . 
Each of the N m n diss values in f m can be decomposed as two components. One is the  X  X ntra-cluster X  dissimilarity with a relative small value, which means the two objects could be in the same cluster. Another is the  X  X nter-cluster X  dissimilarity with a relative large value, which means the two objects should be in different clusters. Further, the length of each coordinate axis can be represented by its corresponding feature weight, so that the length adjustment problem occurred in SCT can be solved. 2.2 Coordinate Arrangement Procedure two axes on the cluster-displaying quality is first analyzed systematically. Then, it is modeled as the coordinate arrangement optimization problem and solved by PSO. 2.2.1 Influence of the Included Angle of Two Coordinate Axes on the Cluster  X   X  the Cartesian coordinate system. Therefore, the included angle of SC m and SC n can be where we observe the following situations that can enhance the cluster-displaying quality: y shown as 45o in Fig. 2(b), the two clusters are separated more distinctly. y shown as 135 o in Fig. 3(c), the two clusters are separated more distinctly. y angle, shown as Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c), it is unable to enhance the cluster-displaying quality. According to the above analysis, the adju stment for the rotation angles between SC m and SC n for optimizing the cluster-displaying quality of the visualizing result can be modeled as an optimization problem: simultaneously. In addition, the M corresponding feature weights are also considered. That is, the coordinate arrangement of all coordinate axes for optimizing the cluster-displaying quality of the visualizing result can be modeled as: 2.2.2 Using the PSO Algorithm for Optimizing the Coordinate Arrangement In the coordinate arrangement procedure, we adopt the particle swarm optimization PSO, all particles in a swarm are evolved by cooperation and competition among  X  10 o for m =1,2,..., M . The fitness of p r , termed as fitness ( p r ), is defined as: p , that generate the individual maximum fitness when p is taken into Eq. (13). Similarly, the swarm G also maintains the optimal M overall iterations. That is, we can obtain the global maximum fitness among all updated using Eq. (14). The ratio for the self-cognition and social interaction parts, c 1 addition, each new new rm v obtained by Eq. (14) must obey the restriction of Eq. (15) to also replaced by p r . PSO will stop when reaching the maximum number of iterations N rotation angles of the M coordinate axes. The pseudo-code of PSO is shown as Fig. 5. new =  X   X   X  +  X   X   X  + =  X   X   X   X  (14) 2.3 Star Coordinate Translation Procedure dimensional space into 2D points in the star -coordinate plane. When considering the feature weights (i.e. the unit lengths of coordinate axes), the point position of a object x where fw ( f m ) is the feature weight of f m in F , and  X  m is the rotation angle of SC m associated with f m . Fig. 6 shows an example of translating an object from a five-dimensional space into a point in the plane. Through COSCT, all I objects are translated as 2D points, which makes users observe clearly whether any clustering phenomenon of these points displays in the star-coordinate plane. 3.1 Determining the Cluster Numbers whether determining the number of clusters and initial cluster centers through COSCT are reliable. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) [6] and Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) [7], two common data dimension reduction methods, serve as the comparisons The number of particles R is set as 100 and the maximum number of iterations N iter is set as 200 in COSCT for all experiments. cancer dataset. In each result, obviously, a small and dense cluster is easily observed while a large cluster grouped from other distributed points. No matter which methods are used, the two clusters can be clearly identified. Then, the cluster-displaying results using the three methods for the Iris dataset are shown in Fig. 8. With PCA and MDS, the identified number of clusters is two by observing Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b). Although outputted by COSTC reveals the number of clusters could be set as 2 or 3, depending COSCT can provide more information for determining the number of clusters, which can be recognized most clearly using COSCT, shown in Fig. 9(c), since the discrimination among clusters are the most obvious. It means determining the number of clusters through the proposed COSCT method is reliable. 3.2 Determining the Initial Cluster Centers After recognizing all clusters in the star-coordinate plane, the possible location of each cluster center in the plane can be roughly identified using the sense of sight. For each cluster, we draw a circle around the middle of the cluster to include a number of points. That is, the points within the circle can be considered as neighbors with the cluster center. Fig. 10 shows the neighbor identification result for the three identified cluster centers in Fig. 9(c) using three blue circles. Hence, the location of a cluster 0center in the original multi-dimensional space is obtained by averaging the locations of these within-circle objects in the original multi-dimensional space. The COSCT method is presented to determine the number of clusters and initial error validation process. No clustering algorithm is employed in the parameterization effectiveness of COSCT is superior to PCA and MDS through our demonstrations. 
The reliability of knowledge discovery can be affected by data oriented, knowledge oriented, and algorithm oriented factors [8]. By observing the cluster-displaying result including the number of clusters and initial cluster centers, is conducted in this paper. whether a clustering algorithm is appropriate. It will be useful for users to manage the algorithm oriented factors for achieving more reliable clustering results.
