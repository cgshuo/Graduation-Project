 This research falls in the area of enhancing the quality of tag-based item recommendation systems. It aims to achieve this by employing a multi-dimensional user profile approach and by analyzing the semantic aspects of tags . Tag-based recommender systems have two characteristics that need to be carefully studied in order to build a reliable system. Firstly, the multi-dimensional correlation, called as tag assignment &lt;user, item, tag&gt; , should be appropriately modelled in order to create the user profiles [ 1]. Se condly, the semantics behind the tags should be considered properly as the flexibility with their design can cause semantic problems such as synonymy and polysemy [ 2]. This research proposes to address the se two challenges for building a tag-based item recommendation system by employing tensor modeling as the multi-dimensional user profile approach, and the topic model as the semantic analysis approach. The first objective is to optimize the tensor model reconstruction and to improve the model performance in generating quality re c-ommendation. A novel Tensor-based Recommendation using Probabilistic Ranking (TRPR) method [3 ] has been developed . Results show this method to be scalable for large datasets and outperforming the benchmarking methods in terms of accuracy. The memory efficient loop implements the -mode block-striped (matrix) product for tensor reconstruction as an approximation of the initial tensor. The probabilistic ranking calculates the probabi l-ity of users to select candidate items using their tag preference list based on the entries generated from the reconstructed tensor . * The second objective is to analyse the tag semantics and utilize the outcome in build ing the tensor model . This research proposes to investigate the problem using topic model approach to keep the tags nature as the  X  X ocial vocabulary X  [4]. For the tag assignment data, topics can be generated from the occurrences of tags given for an item. However there is only limited amount of tags avail a-ble to represent items as collection of topics, since an item might
