 Presented in this special issue of DKE are the extended manuscripts of five best papers from the 17th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA), 2012. DASFAA is an annual international database conference, located in the Asia-Pacific region, which showcases the state-of-the-art R&amp;D activities in database systems and their applications. DASFAA 2012 attracted 159 submissions, and through a rigorous review process, 44 regular papers and 8 short papers had been accepted for presentation. Among these, eight of the best papers were recommended and have undergone a second round of blind peer review, resulting for some of them in substantial further revision and improvement. We have selected five of them and present the final results here.

The first paper, Ding et al.,  X  ComMapReduce: An Improvement of MapReduce with Lightweight Communication Mechanisms, presents a new version of MapReduce framework, called ComMapReduce, which uses lightweight communication mechanisms in supporting applications handling large amounts of data. Importantly, this improvement does not damage the main features of MapReduce including availability and scalability. Three basic communication strategies and two optimized communication strategies are proposed for improved information sharing and process efficiency.

Leonardia et al. in  X  Stars on Steroids: Fast Evaluation of Multi-source Star Twig Queries in Path Materialization-based XML Databases  X  introduce a novel technique for fast evaluation of multi-source star twig queries in a path materialization-based RDBMS. The purpose of multi-source star twig queries (i.e. star query) is to join multiple input XML documents integrating data from different sources. The proposed techniques transform a star query into a list of SQL subqueries that reduces the materialized information of underlying XML subtrees as intermediate results. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches such as MONETDB and XQuery for multiple queries.

Mai et al. in  X  Bichromatic Buckets: An Effective Technique to Improve the Accuracy of Histograms for Geographic Data Points propose a novel technique to enhance the accuracy of existing histograms for geographical data points. The idea is to bipartition each histogram bucket so that the density within each partition is as close to uniformity as possible, thereby enabling more accurate selectivity estimation. Two algorithms are proposed for finding optimal bipartition. The proposed scheme can be integrated with existing histogram methods, namely, MinSkew and STHist. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the accuracy of existing geographical histograms.

Trieu Minh Nhut Le et al. in  X  Top-k best probability queries and semantics ranking properties on probabilistic databases an interesting problem about the semantics of top-k query answers in probabilistic databases. Specifically, they propose efficient and effective approaches to answer top-k best probability queries by selecting the probabilistic tuples which have not only the best top-k scores but also the best top-k probabilities. In addition, they add properties for ranking queries on uncertain data. An extensive experimental study shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art approaches.

Lastly, Yuan et al. in  X  Semi-Edge Anonymity: Graph Publication When the Protection Algorithm is Available to publish a privacy preserving graph and propose a new protection model named Semi-Edge Anonymity. The model protects both user's sensitive attributes and connection information even when an attacker is aware of the publication algorithm. The authors theoretically prove that the Semi-Edge Anonymity model outperforms any clustering based model which protects links on two utilities, the possible world size and the true edge ratio. Extensive experiments on real data sets for several other utilities show that the proposed model also has better performance on the utilities than the clustering based model.

We would like to express our appreciation to the authors of the papers for their contributions and the referees for their generous and prompt help and valuable remarks and suggestions.
