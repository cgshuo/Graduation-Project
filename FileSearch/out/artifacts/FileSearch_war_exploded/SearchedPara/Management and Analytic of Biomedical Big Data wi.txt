 Analyzing Biomedical Big Data (BBD) is computationally expensive due to high dimensionality and large data volume. Performance and scalability issues of traditional database management systems (DBMS) often limit the usage of more sophisticated and complex data queries and analytic mod-els. Moreover, in the conventional setting, data manage-ment and analysis use separate software platforms. Export-ing and importing large amounts of data across platforms require a significant amount of computational and I/O re-sources, as well as potentially putting sensitive data at a security risk. In this tutorial, the participants will learn the difference between in-memory DBMS and traditional DBMS through hands-on exercises using SAP X  X  cloud-based HANA in-memory DBMS in conjunction with the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset. MIMIC is an open-access critical care EHR archive (over 4TB in size) and consists of structured, unstructured and waveform data. Furthermore, this tutorial will seek to ed-ucate the participants on how a combination of dynamic querying, and in-memory DBMS may enhance the manage-ment and analysis of complex clinical data.
 Mengling Feng is currently a visiting scholar at MIT in Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology Division.

Ishrar Hussain is working as a Machine Learning Re-searcher at SAP Research Labs, Montreal, and developing state-of-the-art machine learning solutions for Big Data ap-plications using the SAP HANA X  X  in-memory DBMS. He re-ceived his Master X  degree in Computer Science in 2007 from Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. He is now also a Ph.D. Candidate at the same university and is expecting to graduate in 2014.
 electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology and the MD degree from Harvard Medical School. At present Dr. Mark is Distinguished Professor of Health Sciences and Technology, and Professor of Electrical Engi-neering at MIT. His current research activities include In-tegrating Data, Models, and Reasoning in Critical Care and PhysioNet (http://www.physionet.org), both of which in-volve the development, use and open distribution of large physiological and clinical databases.
