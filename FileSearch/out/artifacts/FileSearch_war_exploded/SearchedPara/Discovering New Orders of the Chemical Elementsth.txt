 The design of new materials is a major issu e in many domains (electronics, environ-ment and so on). However, material design is a difficult task. Therefore, a large number of databases have been developed in order to help scientists to design new materials. Databases of experimental results can be us ed to learn prediction models of each prop-erty. Data mining methods can be applied on such databases to discover empirical rules and predict properties in order to restrain the research of new material to the more promising cases.

We are interested to know if accurate predictions can be realized using only basic information of the periodic table. In this paper, we propose a method for discovering new orders of the chemical elements. This r eorganization of the chemical elements can be used to improved prediction accuracy of cl assification method and to understand the physics beyond the predictions. The proposed method uses two types of information: labeled instances from the dataset and the position of the elements in the periodic ta-ble (atomic number, chemical group, etc.). A genetic algorithm is used to explore the possible orders of elements.
 In Sec. 2, we will present the new order discovering method and results are shown in Sec. 3. In this section, we will present the genetic algorithm used for order discovery. We will first present the data representation (Sec. 2. 1) and the goals of chemical elements order-ing (Sec. 2.2). Then, we will detail the method (Sec. 2.3) and the fitness functions that can be used (Sec. 2.4). 2.1 Data Representation In this paper, we will focus on two-classes pr oblems. The datasets concern the formation of specific compound types according to a se t of elements. A possible problem can be described as follow: considering the set of elements E = { A , B , C } is it possible to create a compound XYZ 2 ,where X  X  E , Y  X  E , Z  X  E , X =Y , X =Z and Y =Z .

We consider only information based on the position of the elements in the periodic table and the labeled instances of the datas et. Datasets are composed of a list of in-stances, described by the atomic numbe r of each element of the potential compound and the class label (formation or non formation).
 Definition 1. A distance measure can be defined between two instances, using the min-imum Euclidean distance among all permutations of elements of the instances. For in-stance, considering two instances a =( a 1 ,...,a n ) and b =( b 1 ,...,b n ) the distance can be defined by: where n is the number of elements, a i (resp. b i ) is the order rank (e.g. atomic number) all permutation of numbers from 1 to n . 2.2 Ordering of Elements The most common order of the chemical elements is the atomic number. However, this order does not give enough information about the properties of the elements. Elements with close atomic numbers may not have close properties (e.g. H and He are elements 1 and 2, but have very different chemical properties), whereas some elements with very different atomic numbers (e.g. elements of a same group) have similar properties.
In [1], a new order of the elements has been defined to predict the formation of one type of crystal structure of binary compounds. In this order, elements with close ranking have close properties regarding the cryst al structure. Moreover, elements of a same group are close to each other. This order of ele ments inspired other orders (Periodic Numbers, also called Mendeleev Numbers), defined by running through the periodic table group by group. These orders have been used in [2].
 Periodic Numbers are more consistent with the chemical properties of the elements. However, it could be interesting to define orders adapted to specific properties, as was the order proposed in [1]. In this paper, we propose an algorithm able to discover new orders of the elements. If we consider the chemical elements up to the actinide series (i.e. the 103 first elements), there is 103! 2 different possible orders. Thus, the algorithm must be able to discover satisfying solution among the whole set of orders. This is a difficult task as there are linear and non linear relation between the element and the properties of the compounds. 2.3 Genetic Algorithms for Order Discovery The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. A traveling salesman must find the shortest route to visit several towns. This problem is known to be NP -complete and has been widely studied. The problem of ordering the chemical elements is similar to the TSP.

Genetic algorithms have been proposed to find good enough solution [3]. Each indi-vidual is an order that will be evaluated acco rding to the function to optimize. However, it is not trivial to define a representation of the solutions and crossover and mutation op-erators for orders. Several representations and operators have been defined in literature. The most common representation for orders is an ordered list of the items. However in the case of order of chemical elements, we u ses the dual representation: the genotype is an array where the first element of the array is the rank of the first chemical element ( H ) in the new order, the second element of the a rray is the rank of the second chemical el-ement ( He ), and so on. This dual representation does not change the crossover and mu-tation operators, but facilitate the implementation of the data transformation. We tested several crossover and mutation operators. First experiments seemed to show that the crossover operator POS and the mutation operator EM and SIM provide the best results. 2.4 Evaluation of Orders As other data transformation methods (attribute selection, attribute weighing, attribute construction), the evaluation of the quality of an order can be performed through a filter approach or through a wrapper approach [4].

In the filter approach, the order is evalu ated according to some statistics based on the properties of the data. In this paper, we used distance based measures: intraclass distance and interclass distance. These t wo evaluation criteria can be used with the distance measure defined in Def. 1. In this defi nition, the distance between two elements is the difference between their ranks in the order. However, as there are no available data for some elements, we defined another measure where elements with no data will not affect the distance measure (Def. 2). In a wrapper approach the quality of an order can be evaluated by the accuracy of a classificatio n algorithm after the data transformation. Definition 2. The modified distance between two elements of ranks a i and b j (with a &lt;b j )inanorder ord is defined by: number of instances containing the element of rank c in the order ord .
 These criteria can be used to evaluate the quality of an order based on the dataset. To order correctly elements with no inform ation, we should also take into account some knowledge about the elements. We know that elements of a same group (same column of the periodic table) and elements of a same series (transition metals, metalloids, etc.) have similar properties. According to this knowledge, elements of the same group or series must be close so each other in the orde r. Thus, we can define a scattering cost of an order according to the periodic table.
 Definition 3. The scattering cost scat can be defined by: where G (A , B) = 1 iff A and B are in a same group, S (A , B) = 1 iff A and B are in a same series and d M is the distance between two elements in the Mendeleev table. The algorithm will use a Pareto-based approach for multi-objective optimization [5,6]. Two criteria will be used at the same time: one data criterion (distance based or accuracy based) and the scattering cost. We carried out a series of tests in order to evaluate the feasibility of chemical element ordering. In Sec. 3.1, we will present the datasets used in our experiments. In Sec. 3.2 are show some experimental results.
 We used a population of 100 individuals and run the algorithms for 2500 generations. We used an elitist strategy (all individuals on the Pareto front are conserved without any modification). The remaining individuals are created by crossover followed by a muta-tion (70%), mutation of one individual (25%) and new individuals (5%). Tournament selection is used to select parents. On the Par eto front, a priority is accorded to the data-based criterion. The algorithm has been designed in Java language using the GEAL library ( http://dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr/~blansche/en/geal.html ). 3.1 Data In this paper, we will focus on the prediction of formation of ternary chalcopyrite compounds ABX 2 ,where X is either S , Se or Te . ABX 2 compounds are promising for electronic applications because of semiconducting and nonlinear optical properties [7,8]. This dataset was extracted from the databases on inorganic substance properties of the A.A. Baikov Institute of Metallurgy and Materials Science [9].

As element X can take only a few number of values, the complete dataset has been divided into three partial datasets, corresponding to the different prediction tasks ABS 2 , ABSe 2 and ABTe 2 . In the three partial datasets, ther e are only two variable elements, so the new order result can easily be plotted o n a grid for visual interpretation. Because of space restrictions, results on the ABSe 2 dataset are not shown here. There are 240 positive instances (compound formation) and 49 negative instances (compound non-formation) in the ABS 2 dataset, and 109 positive instances and 85 negative instances in the ABTe 2 dataset. 3.2 Results For each datasets, we tested four versions of our algorithm, using each time two eval-uation criteria: intraclass distance and scattering cost, interclass distance (standard or modified) and scattering cost, or accuracy (using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm) and scattering cost. Only representative results are shown in this paper.

The datasets can be plotted on symmetric two-dimensions grids. Each row and each column corresponds to one element. The order of rows and columns is defined by the order of the elements (from left to right, from top to bottom). Each square of the grid is associated to a potential compounds ABX 2 colored in dark grey in case of non formation of compounds, in medium gray in case of formation, and in light grey when no data are available.

On Fig. 1 and 2 are shown the projections of the ABX 2 datasets using the atomic number. One can see that there is no clear separation between formation and non for-mation of compounds.

On Fig. 3 and 4 are shown the results obtained using the intraclass distance and the scattering cost as evaluation criteria. On the projection of the ABS 2 dataset, most of the formation instances are grouped together into two (symmetric) clusters. The rest of the instances (formation and non formation) are distributed in the middle of the grid. On the projections of the ABTe 2 dataset, all instances are grouped together into a compact cluster. Some parts of this cluster ar e mainly composed of formation instances, others of non formation instances, but it is difficult to see any clear separation between formation and non formation.

On Fig. 5 and 6 are shown the results obtained using the interclass distance and the scattering cost. It is easier to see a separ ation between formation and non formation. Two types of elements appears: low rank elements ( L ) and high rank elements ( H ). On the ABS 2 dataset, L elements seem to be able to form LBS 2 (or ALS 2 ) compounds with almost any other elemen t, whereas formation (or non formation) is difficult to predict for HH  X  S 2 compounds. The ABTe 2 dataset can be divided into four clusters. LL  X  Te 2 are non formation instances, HH  X  Te 2 are formation instances. It is difficult to predict the formation of HLTe 2 and LHTe 2 compounds. One should note that most of the data appears on the borders of the grid.
 On Fig. 7 and 8 is shown the result obtai ned using the accuracy (obtained by the Nearest Neighbor algorithm) and the scattering cost as evaluation criteria. Formation in-stances are grouped together into several line-shaped clusters. Non formation instances are distributed among the grid, forming mostly very small clusters of less than six in-stances. This structure is not very helpful to understand the data.

On Fig. 9 and 10 are shown the results obtained using the interclass distance with the modified distance and scattering cost. These results are similar to the results obtained using the standard interclass distance, but the obtained clusters are not too compact, the data are more distributed all over the grid.

These results seems to show that it is possible to perform an automatic reordering of the chemical elements. Evaluation measur e based on interclass distance seems more promising to reach interestin g results. Using this evaluation measure, groups of chemi-cal elements with similar properties have been detected on the three datasets. However, it seems difficult to order correctly elements with few data available.

While using a standard distance, the separ ation between formation and non forma-tion is clear but instances are forming compact clusters without incorporating similar elements not present in the dataset. When the modified distance is used, it seems possi-ble to order every elements more correctly.

Even on the best results, some inconsistancies still appear. For instance, on Fig. 10, in the upper-left part, one can see a non formation instance in the middle of a cluster of formation instances. This instance corresponds to the non formation of CeTlTe 2 . The Tl element appears in a large number of instance, but there are only two instances containing Ce . It would have been more logical to give a high rank to the element Ce for this dataset. This show that it will probably be necessary to refine the result after the end of the genetic algorithm. A local optimization method should be developed in order to improve the results. In this paper, we presented a method for discovering new orders of elements through a genetic approach. Two criteria, one data -based and one knowledge-based, are used through a Pareto-based multi-objective appr oach. New orders of the elements can be used to predict the formation of compounds more efficiently. Moreover, new orders can help to enhance similarities between elements. The first results presented in this paper showed that accuracy-based evaluation does not provides interesting results, at least for the Nearest-Neighbor classification method. Distance-based approach seems more promising, as it has been possible to discover groups of similar elements elements regarding the formation of a specific compound type.

However, there are still improvement to do as elements with few information seem hard to order correctly. Other evaluation function or  X  X ntelligent X  operators (such as order perturbation inside a group or a series of elements, or at the group or the se-ries level) should be developed in the future. As a further work, we should also apply the proposed method on other datasets. We applied our method only on binary prob-lems (formation or non formation), but it could be interesting to test it on multi-classes problem like the discrimination between several crystal structures. Moreover, we only applied our method on two elements problems and should now be tested with datasets of compounds of three or more elements. On more complex datasets, cluster analysis would be useful to discover groups of similar elements.
