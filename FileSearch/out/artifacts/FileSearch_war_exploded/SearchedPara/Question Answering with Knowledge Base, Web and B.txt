 Developing a Q uestion A nswering (QA) system to automatically answer natural -language questions has been a long -standing research problem since the dawn of AI, for its clear practical and scientific value. For instance, whether a system can answer questions correctly is a natural way to evaluat e a machine X  X  understanding of a domain . P roviding succi nct and precise answers to informational queries is also the direction pursued by the next generation of search engines that aim to incorporate more  X  X emantics X , as well as the basic function in digital assistants like Siri and Cortana. In this tutorial, w e aim to give the audience a coherent overview of the research of question answering . We will first introduce a variety of QA problems proposed by research trend in this domain, the audience can easily comprehend what technical problems remain challenging and what the main breakthroughs and opportunities are QA problems that have recently attracted a great deal of attention in the research community , and will present the tasks with the latest technical survey. The first two categories regard answering factoid questions, where the main difference of the problem settings is the information source used for extracting answers. QA with knowledge base aims to answer natural language questions using real -world facts to develop a semantic par ser (of questions), which will be the main focus. Other approaches like text matching in the embedding space and those driven by information extraction will also be discussed. The other category , QA with the Web , targets answering questions using mainly fr om the facts extracted from general text corpora derived from the Web . In addition to the common components and techniques used in also introduce latest work on ho w to leverage and incorporate additional structured and semi -structured data to improve the performance. The third category of the QA problems that we will highlight is the non -factoid questions. Due to its broad coverage, we will briefly cover three exemp lary topics: story comprehension, reasoning questions and paragraph QA. T he tutorial will conclude by summarizing a whole area of exciting and dynamic research that is worthy of more detailed investigation for many years to come. Part I. O verview of Question Answering R esearch  X  Overview of early Question Answering research  X  Current Question Answering research trend  X  Demo s of some existing QA systems Part I I. Question Answering with Knowledge Base  X  Introduction to modern large -scale knowledge base  X  Task setting and benchmark datasets  X  State -of -the -art approaches Part III. Question Answering with the Web  X  Problem setting and the general system architecture  X  Essential natural language analysis: entity and answer type  X  Leveraging additional information sources Part I V . Non -Factoid Question Answering  X  Story comprehension (e.g., MC -Test)  X  Reasoning questions (e.g., bAbI dataset &amp; task)  X  Paragraph QA (e.g., quiz bowl competition) Part V. Conclusion Scott Wen -tau Yih is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond. His research interests include natural language processing, machine learning and information retrieval. Yih received his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign. His work on joint inference using integer linear programming (ILP) [Roth &amp; Yih, 2004] helped the UIUC team win the CoNLL -05 shared task on semantic role labeling, and the approach has been widely adopted in the NLP community since then. After joining MSR in 2005, he has worked on em ail spam filtering, keyword extraction and search &amp; ad relevance. His recent work focuses on continuous semantic representations using neural networks and matrix/tensor decomposition methods, with applications in lexical semantics, knowledge base embedding and question answering. Yih received the best paper award from CoNLL -2011, an outstanding paper award from ACL -2015 and has served as area chairs (HLT -NAACL -12, ACL -14, EMNLP -16), program co -chairs (CEAS -09, CoNLL -14) and action editor (Transactions of AC L) in recent years.
