 1. Introduction
Some research that avoids the use of OCR for retrieving document images has been conducted. Lu and Tan and weighted Hausdorff distance, but they considered only printed documents and used language dependent documents using a number of different matching methods including shape context matching, SSD (sum of squared differences) correlation, Euclidean distance mapping and DTW (dynamic time warping). From the the George Washington corpus. However, these methods were tested only on handwritten English documents. Word matching was performed using the Manhattan distance. To evaluate the proposed method, they used a sample of 50 document pages and two query images. However, they only consider Greek documents in this type. Thus, their method was not appropriate for retrieval from multi-lingual document collections.
Most of the research has been done mainly using English, Chinese or Greek document images. In this Hangul, English and Chinese.
 provides the conclusions and outlines future work. 2. Text image matching system In this paper, we assume that document images are decomposed in advance into word images ( Jeong &amp; dorff distance. 2.1. Size normalization
In the preprocessing step, two input images are normalized to have the same height. Because most docu-pixels correspond to a point ( i , j )in Q as follows: ple of the size normalized result for input images. 2.2. Feature extraction Features from preprocessed images are extracted by using the local crowdedness method proposed by The modified local crowdedness at the point ( x , y ) can be calculated as a stroke.

 for an entire image by using the Sobel masks that are the most popular for computing gradients. which indicate the end point, junction and intersection point, respectively.

Fig. 5 shows examples of the three features mentioned in this section. 2.3. Similarity measurement (MHD) based on the average distance value for object matching. The MHD between two point sets Q ={ q 1 , ... , q n } and D ={ d 1 , ... , d m } is defined as h ( Q , D ) represents the distance from the set Q to D , and is defined as follows: where d ( q i , d j )= k q i d j k is the distance between two points q i and d j .
For the purpose of text image matching using the local crowdedness feature, we modify the distance mea-sure d ( q i , d j ) into d 0 ( q i , d j ) as follows: d ( q i , d 1 ), d ( q i , d 2 ), ... , d ( q i , d m ) for i th point in the query image q i . 2.2 . When using the modified distance measure, the distance d ( q 1 , d 5 ) is equal to 0.164. can also be used. The binary correlation of two images D of size H D W D and Q of size H Q W Q at the location ( x , y ) is defined as for 0 6 x 6 W D 1 and 0 6 y 6 H D 1. Fig. 7 shows an example of the correlation at (1, 2) in a document image.
 2.4. Classification each class can be estimated as fined as follows: is, where P (Class_1) = 0.5. P (Class_2 j x ) is calculated similarly. 3. Experiments 3.1. Effectiveness of the proposed method
To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared the six methods combining three feature extraction methods (local crowdedness LC, contour C and special points SP) and two similarity measures (Hausdorff distance HD, binary correlation BC). Therefore we denote the six methods as LC + HD,
LC + BC, C + HD, C + BC, SP + HD and SP + BC. 3.1.1. Dataset the size normalization process from the text image matching system. 3.1.2.

For this experiment, we consider only the case of Hangul and change the font size from 8 points to 16 points for two font types, Batang and Gullim.

In this paper, we attempt to retrieve document images based on text similarity without any language model. We found that the proposed method can be effective for searching a corresponding point between of time.
