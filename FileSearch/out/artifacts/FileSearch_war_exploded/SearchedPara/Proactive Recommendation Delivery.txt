 The main purpose of Recommender Systems is to minimize the effects of information/choice overload. Recommenda-tions are usually prepared based on the estimation of what would be useful or interesting to users. Thus, it is important that they are relevant to users, whether to their information needs, current activity or emotional state. This requires deep understanding of users X  context but also the knowl-edge of the history of previous users X  interactions within the system (e.g. clicks, views, etc.). But even when the rec-ommendations are highly relevant, their delivery to users can be very problematic. Many existing systems require active user participation (explicit interaction with the rec-ommender system) and attention. Or, on other side of spectrum, there are RS that handle recommendation de-livery without any consideration for users X  preferences of when, where or how the recommendations are being de-livered. Proactive Recommender Systems promise a more autonomous approach for recommendation delivery, by an-ticipating information needs in advance and acting on users X  behalf with minimal efforts and without disturbance. This paper describes our work and interest in identifying and an-alyzing the factors that can influence acceptance and use of proactively delivered recommendations.
 Proactive Recommendation Delivery, Recommender Systems, Content Relevance, Timing, Modality
Recommender Systems (RS) are a well-proven and effec-tive approach to minimize choice overload, whether the user is faced with abundance of content, goods, applications and services, etc. In ideal scenario, users receive highly relevant and interesting recommendations (items), while organiza-tions (system providers) benefit from increased user engage-ment (e.g. more videos watched, books read, items bought etc.). On a more practical level, relevancy, interestingness and other metrics are determined by the accuracy of the algorithms, or by optimizing for very specific metrics.
Many existing RS require active user participation and at-tention (i.e. request from the system when you need some-thing). Or, on other side of spectrum, there are RS that handle recommendation delivery without any consideration for users X  preferences of when, where or how the recommen-dations are being delivered. With abundance of applica-tions/services there is also ongoing competition for user at-tention. Human attention is generally considered as a scarce resource, especially in the recent times where organizations try to increase user engagement by delivering unsolicited content without basic understanding of users X  current con-text/situation. This intrusive approach can lead to frustra-tion and disturbance of users. These unwanted interruptions can have negative effects on work performance [3], emotional state [1], etc. Preliminary studies on time, location and modality (user interface) of interruptions, showed promising results in easing the negative effects of information delivery that was not explicitly requested.

Contrary to existing approaches, Proactive Systems (PS) want to avoid any requirement of user participation and ef-fort. PS promise to anticipate user needs in advance and then to take appropriate actions on their behalf. Actions are usually related to delivery of relevant content at the right time, place, etc. [5]. Consequently, Proactive Recom-mender Systems (PRS) should deliver relevant recommen-dations when needed, without disturbing users in any possi-ble way. Finding relevant content and identifying opportune moments, places, modalities for recommendation delivery is, at least for now, mostly unchartered research area.
In the next sections you can read about: related work, proposed research model and methodology for this thesis, progress to date and ongoing work, and finally about some closing thoughts and outlook on future work.
Since research in this domain is still at a very nascent stage, for the theoretical foundations we must look at the ex-isting work in Proactive Computing (PC), (context-aware) RS, information delivery, interruption and notification man-agement research areas.

The majority of research is focused on the theoretical foundations and potential of PS [11]. Experimental work is scarce, but what exists is usually related to tourism do-main. More prominent work includes RS with proactive de-livery of recommendations for POI 1 [4], gas-stations [17],
Points of Interest and restaurants [14]. Additionally, there are efforts to bring proactiveness to RS for writing tasks [9], personalized news, [19], and e-learning systems [7].

On more theoretical level, we can find user studies that in-vestigate user attitudes towards PS. Key insights from these studies can be summarized as follows [12, 13]: a) PS can cre-ate highly engaging experiences, in which such they can as-sist and enhance user experience and bring convenience and help when needed; b) in general users show strong interest and willingness to adopt and follow proactive recommenda-tions; c) practical implementations need to be handled with care, given that some users are afraid of growing too reliant on these systems, whereas others, still, refrain from using them due to unnecessary interruptions and the frustration they cause.

The present work was designed with insights on inter-ruption management work in mind, as wrong interruptions seem to be possibly the biggest challenge for successful im-plementation of PRS. Interruption management studies fo-cus on aspects like timing, location, modality, user feed-back, etc. which are similar/complementary to previously mentioned principles of Proactive Recommendation Deliv-ery (PRD). Finding optimal timing seems to be very chal-lenging. Preliminary studies argue that good time for inter-ruptions/information delivery could be after successful end of some primary task [6]. Location and Modality also seem to play major role for information delivery. Depending on the location, users seem to be more or less open to receive relevant notifications [8]. Modality (how information is pre-sented), on the other hand, can affect trust, understand-ability, transparency, accessibility of system that manages information delivery [10].

To summarize, PRS should follow core principles of PC paradigm, by offering relevant recommendations to users only at appropriate situations (right time, location, modal-ity, etc.). Thus, we want to investigate them, their relations and effects on actual acceptance and use of proactively de-livered recommendations.
In this section we present research questions for this the-sis. Their scope ranges from user attitudes towards PRS; importance and effects of the mentioned factors on their ac-ceptance and actual use; but also how to incorporate user feedback and what measures to use to for their evaluation. Concretely, we want to find out what are the perspectives, key factors to focus on when going for practical implementa-tions and how to use user feedback and evaluation measures to continuously improve existing systems. How users perceive PRS? Are they open to share their personal information? Is there an economic perspective for commercial im-plementations?
Although the questions are self-explanatory to what is goal of our research, we would add that these questions (e.g. economic perspective, access to user data, etc.) are probable concerns for any organizations willing to discuss any kind of practical implementation in this area.
 What are the effects of relevancy of recommenda-tions, timing and modality of their delivery, on ac-ceptance and use of PRS?
Let X  X  start with some basic understanding of the men-tioned terms. Relevance can be defined as a subjective and contextual judgment of information/content [15]. It is a complex concept that can be explained by five-factor model: topicality, novelty, reliability, understandability, and scope [18]. Some of these factors have higher level of im-portance on relevance (e.g. topicality). Specifically, situa-tional/contextual relevance refers to utility of information to particular situation, task, or problem at hand [16]. Fac-tors that define tasks could be importance, urgency, and complexity [2]. For further investigation of these research questions, we want to execute task-driven user studies with between-subjects design recommendations relevance, timing and modality of the delivery as manipulated variables. Acceptance and Usage are well-known TAM 2 concepts. Relevance of Recommendations with Timing and Modality of the delivery, were incorporated into adapted version of TAM presented on Figure 1.

This represents the most complex and important part of this thesis, and thus majority of attention in our future user studies and experiments will be on investigating relations from this model. How to elicit and incorporate user feedback? How to evaluate proactive recommendation deliver-ies?
User Feedback is very important since it can allow or-ganizations to improve PRS. It is necessary to investigate whether the users are willing to provide feedback at all, and in which form/modality. We plan to investigate jointly with research studies on appropriate modality for PRD.

Evaluation is another important factor for organizations that want to continuously improve their systems. We be-lieve that concepts like Responsiveness (i.e. time until user responds to delivered content), Attentiveness (i.e. whether and how user interacts with delivered content) and Recep-tivity (i.e. whether user accepts delivered content) from in-terruptions / notifications management literature, can be
Technology Acceptance Model reused to create unique set of measures adapted to evalua-tion of PRS.
In this section we want to present more details about our research progress to date and ongoing work.
Since practical implementations are very scarce and gen-erally not available to academic community, we wanted to start first with analysis of user attitudes towards these kind of systems. We looked at relationships between factors that would most probably impact the perception and adoption of proactive systems. Specifically, we were for instance look-ing at the relationships between information needs, attitudes towards making personal data available to a system, willing-ness to pay for proactive systems and the characteristics of a user X  X  personality. Information needs are important because main purpose of PRS should be information delivery. Atti-tudes towards making personal data available to a system and the willingness to pay for proactive systems are also important, because user data collection and monetization are logical challenges/concerns for organizations willing to consider any kind of practical implementation.
 In our exploratory study [12], we used Structural Equation Model technique with Maximum Likelihood Estimation to explore models for the economic and the privacy perspective. The economic perspective seems to be highly influenced by users X  tolerance towards interruptions from certain types of events (which is influenced by users X  trust) and attitude to-wards providing feedback. Analysis shows that lower the satisfaction with current solutions the brighter the economic perspective of proactive system would be. We concluded that in order to precisely quantify this perspective (economic model) it is necessary to find a proper strategy for measur-ing these concepts in an additional field study. A second model was related to information needs and users X  openness to allow system to exploit data for the purposes of provid-ing better services. Personal belief of Self-Efficacy (based on General Self-Efficacy scale) and Technology Use (i.e. the availability of different technical devices to the participant) seemed to influence the information needs and users X  open-ness to share their personal data. Based on this, for practical system development the sensitivity towards privacy concerns of users has to be high and an appropriate strategy for ask-ing users to share their personal data is required. This will be partially investigated with our future studies on how to acquire user feedback from users and preferred modality for interaction with system.
We are interested in analysis of factors which influence acceptance and actual use of proactively delivered recom-mendations. Specifically in: content relevancy, timing and modality of the delivery. So far, we have investigated only the content relevance and the preliminary results (not yet published) are presented in this section.

We conducted an online experiment among graduate stu-dents participating in a large statistics course at a university in the Netherlands. Participants were invited to take part in a multi-stage study (involving a pre-survey, the applica-tion challenge, and a post-survey). The pre-survey assessed demographics, which were combined with a participant X  X  re-sponses from Application Challenge (AC). The post-challenge survey assessed manipulation checks and participants X  expe-rience with the recommendations inside the application and application behavior itself. The AC was the most techni-cally complicated and time-consuming part of the study. In the AC, participants were given two tasks to work on us-ing mobile applications either on iOS or Android platforms. The two tasks involved the planning of a hypothetical trip to London for attendance at royal wedding (T). Each task required submission of an open-ended answer with neces-sary information (cost, type, etc.). The tasks were identical for all participants and distributed in the same order (i.e., sequentially). In order to complete these two tasks, par-ticipants needed to search for information exclusively via in-application browser.

The most important functionality of the AC was to al-low participants to work on tasks and to proactively deliver recommendations  X  even when they didn X  X  anticipate such recommendations. The AC employed a between-subjects design for the recommendations, and participants were ran-domly split to two experimental groups / conditions (CND). The first group received recommendations that were imme-diately relevant to the current task (CND = 1). For example, for the first task, participants received 5 recommendations in the form of links to websites that could help participants to find a mode of transportation (e.g. bus, train, plane, etc.) from their city to London. For the second task, they received 5 recommended links that could help them find an accommodation (e.g. hotel, hostel, etc.) in London. For the second group of participants, recommendations were re-lated to the general topic of  X  X raveling to London X , but were, nonetheless, irrelevant to the specific task (CND = 2). For example, for the first task, participants received recommen-dations related to web travel guides for London (e.g. Fodors, LonelyPlanet, etc.) and for the second task, these recom-mendations were related to websites that offered general in-formation on London X  X  transportation modes (e.g. metro, taxi, etc.) and gastronomical places (e.g. Yelp guide, etc.). The first group X  X  recommendations (CND = 1) thus were di-rectly relevant to task at hand, while the second group X  X  rec-ommendations (CND = 2) were somewhat relevant (tourism, city of destination), but too generic to solving the task at hand. Recommendations were delivered exactly 60 seconds after the start of each of the tasks, independently of platform or CND. The recommendations were delivered inside view  X  that is, on top of any application or UI that the participant was at the time working with it.

We manipulated the immediate relevance of recommenda-tions and tested for differences in our dependent variables, that are how useful the participants perceived the received recommendations and if they actually used them . The anal-ysis showed empirical evidence that the immediate relevance of proactively recommended content is well perceived by its recipients and led to its actual use. We furthermore also de-tected relations between relevance and the exact time when participants consumed the content, i.e. if the content is highly relevant to the task at hand it will be consumed im-mediately. We plan to reuse existing dataset and deploy new modified versions of the study setup to further investigate remaining factors. In this paper we discuss relatively novel concepts like PRS/PRD. Our motivation for research is driven by their promising nature and existing efficiency of RS. Proposed research model in this paper is based on theoretical founda-tions of PC, (context-aware) RS, information delivery, inter-ruption and notification management. From there we reuse concepts and principles to determine key research questions. They are grouped in three specific sections: Attitudes to-wards PRS, Acceptance &amp; Use and User Feedback &amp; Evalu-ation of PRS. Factors affecting acceptance and use represent the main focus of this thesis. For that specific set of ques-tions we created an adapted version of TAM. Preliminary results are promising. Specifically, we identified factors that influence the economic perspective but also users X  willing-ness to share data. Also, we determined that contextual relevance of content influences perceived usefulness and us-age of proactively determined recommendations.

For our future work, we plan to continue to analyze the influence of other factors on acceptance and use of PRS. For this purpose it will be necessary to modify the initial study design and find more ways for users to provide feedback, but also to put more attention on analysis of contextual information during the actual delivery of recommendations.
