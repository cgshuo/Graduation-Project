 Public debates are a common platform for present-ing and juxtaposing diverging viewpoints. As op-posed to monologues where speakers are limited to expressing their own beliefs, debates allow for participants to interactively attack their opponents X  points while defending their own. The resulting flow of ideas is a key feature of this conversation genre.
In this work we introduce a computational frame-work for characterizing debates in terms of conver-sational flow. This framework captures two main de-bating strategies X  X romoting one X  X  own points and attacking the opponents X  points X  X nd tracks their relative usage throughout the debate. By applying this methodology to a setting where debate winners are known, we show that conversational flow pat-terns are predictive of which debater is more likely to persuade an audience.
 Case study: Oxford-style debates. Oxford-style debates provide a setting that is particularly conve-nient for studying the effects of conversational flow. In this competitive debate format, two teams argue for or against a preset motion in order to persuade a live audience to take their position. The audience votes before and after the debate, and the winning team is the one that sways more of the audience to-wards its view. This setup allows us to focus on the effects of conversational flow since it disentangles
The debate format involves an opening statement from the two sides, which presents an overview of their arguments before the discussion begins. This allows us to easily identify talking points held by the participants prior to the interaction, and con-sider them separately from points introduced spon-taneously to serve the discussion.

This work is taking steps towards better model-ing of conversational dynamics, by: (i) introducing a debate dataset with rich metadata (Section 2), (ii) proposing a framework for tracking the flow of ideas (Section 3), and (iii) showing its effectiveness in a predictive setting (Section 4). In this study we use transcripts and results of Oxford-style debates from the public debate series These debates are recorded live, and contain mo-tions covering a diversity of topics ranging from for-eign policy issues to the benefits of organic food. Each debate consists of two opposing teams X  X ne for the motion and one against X  of two or three ex-perts in the topic of the particular motion, along with a moderator. Each debate follows the Oxford-style format and consists of three rounds. In the introduc-tion , each debater is given 7 minutes to lay out their main points. During the discussion , debaters take questions from the moderator and audience, and re-spond to attacks from the other team. This round lasts around 30 minutes and is highly interactive; teams frequently engage in direct conversation with each other. Finally, in the conclusion , each debater is given 2 minutes to make final remarks.

Our dataset consists of the transcripts of all de-bates held by IQ2 in the US from September 2006 up to September 2015; in total, there are 108 de-12801 words are uttered in 117 turns by members of Winning side labels. We follow IQ2 X  X  criteria for deciding who wins a debate, as follows. Before the debate, the live audience votes on whether they are for, against, or undecided on the motion. A sec-ond round of voting occurs after the debate. A side wins the debate if the difference between the per-centage of votes they receive post-and pre-debate (the  X  X elta X ) is greater than that of the other side X  X . Often the debates are quite tight: for 30% of the de-bates, the difference between the winning and losing sides X  deltas is less than 10%.
 Audience feedback. We check that the voting re-sults are meaningful by verifying that audience reac-tions to the debaters are related to debate outcome. Using laughter and applause received by each side note that differences in audience reception of the two sides emerge over the course of the debate. While both sides get similar levels of reaction during the introduction, winning teams tend to receive more laughter during the discussion ( p &lt; 0 . 001 ) 6 and more applause during the conclusion ( p = 0 . 05 ). Example debate. We will use a debate over the mo-tion  X  X illennials don X  X  stand a chance X  (henceforth Millennials ) as a running example. 7 The For side won the debate with a delta of 20% of the votes, compared to the Against side which only gained 5%. Promoting one X  X  own points and addressing the op-ponent X  X  points are two primary debating strategies. Here we introduce a methodology to identify these strategies, and use it to investigate their usage and Identifying talking points. We first focus on ideas which form the basis of a side X  X  stance on the mo-tion. We identify such talking points by consider-ing words whose frequency of usage differs signif-icantly between the two teams during the introduc-tion, before any interaction takes place. To find these words, we use the method introduced by Monroe et al. (2008) in the context of U.S. Senate speeches. In particular, we estimate the divergence between the two sides X  word-usage in the introduction, where word-usage is modeled as multinomial distributions smoothed with a uniform Dirichlet prior, and diver-gence is given by log-odds ratio. The most discrim-inating words are those with the highest and lowest z-scores of divergence estimates. For a side X , we define the set of talking points W X to be the k words with the highest or lowest z -scores. 9 We distinguish between X  X  X  own talking points W X , and the oppos-ing talking points W Y belonging to its opponent Y . These are examples of talking points for the  X  X il-lennials X  debate: The flow of talking points. A side can either pro-mote its own talking points, address its opponent X  X  points, or steer away from these initially salient Figure 1: The start of the debate X  X  interactive stage triggers a drop in self-coverage ( &gt; 0 , indicated by leftmost two bars) and a rise in opponent-coverage ( &lt; 0 , indicated by rightmost bars), with eventual winners showing a more pronounced drop in self-coverage (comparing the two bars on the left). ideas altogether. We quantify the use of these strate-gies by comparing the airtime debaters devote to talking points. For a side X , let the self-coverage f ( X, X ) be the fraction of content words uttered by X in round r that are among their own talking points W X ; and the opponent-coverage f r ( X, Y ) be the fraction of its content words covering opposing talking points W Y .

Not surprisingly, we find that self-coverage dominates during the discussion ( f Disc ( X, X ) &gt; f
Disc ( X, Y ) , p &lt; 0 . 001 ). However, this does not mean debaters are simply giving monologues and ignoring each other: the effect of the interaction is reflected in a sharp drop in self-coverage and a rise in opponent-coverage once the discussion round be-gins. Respectively, f Disc ( X, X ) &lt; f Intro ( X, X ) and f Disc ( X, Y ) &gt; f Intro ( X, Y ) , both p &lt; 0 . 001 . Examples of self-and opponent-coverage of two talking points in the  X  X illennials X  debate from the introduction and discussion are given in Table 1.
Does the change in focus translate to any strategic advantages? Figure 1 suggests this is the case: the drop in self-coverage is slightly larger for the side that eventually wins the debate ( p = 0 . 08 ). The drop in the sum of self-and opponent-coverage is also larger for winning teams, suggesting that they are more likely to steer away from discussing any talking points from either side ( p = 0 . 05 ). Identifying discussion points. Having seen that debaters can benefit by shifting away from talking points that were salient during the introduction, we now examine the ideas that spontaneously arise to serve the discussion. We model such discussion points as words introduced to the debate during the discussion by a debater and adopted by his oppo-words that become relevant to the conversation; only 3% of all newly introduced words qualify, amount-ing to about 10 discussion points per debate. The flow of discussion points. The adoption of dis-cussion points plays an important role in persuad-ing the audience: during the discussion, eventual winners adopt more discussion points introduced by their opponents than eventual losers ( p &lt; 0 . 01 ). Two possible strategic interpretations emerge. From a topic control angle (Nguyen et al., 2014), perhaps losers are more successful at imposing their discus-sion points to gain control of the discussion. This view appears counterintuitive given work linking topic control to influence in other settings (Planalp and Tracy, 1980; Rienks et al., 2006). Table 2: Example discussion points introduced by the Against side in the  X  X illennials X  debate. For each point, the first excerpt is the context in which the point was first mentioned by the Against side in the discussion, and the second excerpt shows the For side challenging the point later on.

An alternative interpretation could be that winners are more active than losers in contesting their oppo-nents X  points, a strategy that might play out favor-ably to the audience. A post-hoc manual examina-tion supports this interpretation: 78% of the valid discussion points are picked up by the opposing side plified in Table 2. Overall, these observations tying the flow of discussion points to the debate X  X  outcome suggest that winners are more successful at using the interaction to engage with their opponents X  ideas. We evaluate the predictive power of our flow fea-tures in a binary classification setting: predict This is a challenging task even for humans, thus the dramatic reveal at the end of each IQ2 debate that partly explains the popularity of the show. Our goal here is limited to understanding which of the flow features that we developed carry predictive power. Conversation flow features. We use all conversa-tional features discussed above. For each side X we include f Disc ( X, X ) , f Disc ( X, Y ) , and their sum. We also use the drop in self-coverage given by sub-tracting corresponding values for f Intro (  X  ,  X  ) , and the number of discussion points adopted by each side. We call these the Flow features.
 Baseline features. To discard the possibility that our results are simply explained by debater ver-bosity, we use the number of words uttered and num-ber of turns taken by each side ( length ) as baselines. We also compare to a unigram baseline ( BOW ). Audience features. We use the counts of applause and laughter received by each side (described in Sec-tion 2) as rough indicators of how well the audience can foresee a debate X  X  outcome.

Prediction accuracy is evaluated using a leave-one-out (LOO) approach. We use logistic regres-sion; model parameters for each LOO train-test split are selected via 3-fold cross-validation on the train-ing set. To find particularly predictive flow features, we also try using univariate feature selection on the flow features before the model is fitted in each split; we refer to this setting as Flow* . 13
We find that conversation flow features obtain the best accuracy among all listed feature types (Flow: 63%; Flow*: 65%), performing significantly higher than a 50% random baseline (binomial test p &lt; 0 . 05 ), and comparable to audience features (60%). In contrast, the length and BOW baselines do not perform better than chance. We note that Flow fea-tures perform competitively despite being the only ones that do not factor in the concluding round.
The features selected most often in the Flow* task are: the number of discussion points adopted (with positive regression coefficients), the recall of talk-ing points during the discussion round (negative co-efficients), and the drop in usage of own talking points from introduction to discussion (positive co-efficients). The relative importance of these features, which focus on the interaction between teams, sug-gests that audiences tend to favor debating strategies which emphasize the discussion. Previous work on conversational structure has pro-posed approaches to model dialogue acts (Samuel et al., 1998; Ritter et al., 2010; Ferschke et al., 2012) or disentangle interleaved conversations (Elsner and Charniak, 2010; Elsner and Charniak, 2011). Other research has considered the problem of detecting conversation-level traits such as the presence of dis-agreements (Allen et al., 2014; Wang and Cardie, 2014) or the likelihood of relation dissolution (Nic-ulae et al., 2015). At the participant level, several studies present approaches to identify ideological stances (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2015), using features based on par-ticipant interactions (Thomas et al., 2006; Sridhar et al., 2015), or extracting words and reasons char-acterizing a stance (Monroe et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2010; Hasan and Ng, 2014). In our setting, both the stances and the turn structure of a debate are known, allowing us to instead focus on the de-bate X  X  outcome.

Existing research on argumentation strategies has largely focused on exploiting the structure of mono-logic arguments (Mochales and Moens, 2011), like those of persuasive essays (Feng and Hirst, 2011; Stab and Gurevych, 2014). In addition, Tan et al. (2016) has examined the effectiveness of arguments in the context of a forum where people invite oth-ers to challenge their opinions. We complement this line of work by looking at the relative persuasiveness of participants in extended conversations as they ex-change arguments over multiple turns.

Previous studies of influence in extended con-versations have largely dealt with the political do-main, examining moderated but relatively unstruc-tured settings such as talk shows or presidential debates, and suggesting features like topic control (Nguyen et al., 2014), linguistic style matching (Romero et al., 2015) and turn-taking (Prabhakaran et al., 2013). With persuasion in mind, our work ex-tends these studies to explore a new dynamic, the flow of ideas between speakers, in a highly struc-tured setting that controls for confounding factors. This study opens several avenues for future research. One could explore more complex representations of talking points and discussion points, for instance using topic models or word embeddings. Further-more, augmenting the flow of content in a conversa-tion with the speakers X  linguistic choices could bet-ter capture their intentions. In addition, it would be interesting to study the interplay between our con-versational flow features and relatively monologic features that consider the argumentative and rhetor-ical traits of each side separately. More explicitly comparing and contrasting monologic and interac-tive dynamics could lead to better models of con-versations. Such approaches could also help clar-ify some of the intuitions about conversations ex-plored in this work, particularly that engaging in di-alogue carries different strategic implications from self-promotion.

Our focus in this paper is on capturing and under-standing conversational flow. We hence make some simplifying assumptions that could be refined in fu-ture work. For instance, by using a basic unigram-based definition of discussion points, we do not ac-count for the context or semantic sense in which these points occur. In particular, our annotators found that a significant proportion of the discussion points under our definition actually referred to dif-fering ideas in the various contexts in which they appeared. We expect that improving our retrieval model will also improve the robustness of our idea flow analysis. A better model of discussion points could also provide more insight into the role of these points in persuading the audience.

While Oxford-style debates are a particularly con-venient setting for studying the effects of conversa-tional flow, our dataset is limited in terms of size. It would be worthwhile to examine the flow features we developed in the context of settings with richer incentives beyond persuading an audience, such as in the semi-cooperative environment of Wikipedia talk pages. Finally, our methodology could point to applications in areas such as education and co-operative work, where it is key to establish the link between conversation features and an interlocutor X  X  ability to convey their point (Niculae and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2016).
