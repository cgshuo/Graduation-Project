 Computer and Information Science Dept. In this report we provide a sum mary of the First International Workshop on Utility -Based Data Mining (UBDM-05) held in conjunction with the 11 th ACM SIGKDD International Confer-ence on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The workshop was held on August 21, 2005 in Chicago, IL, USA. This work-shop was geared toward researchers with an interest in how eco-nom ic utility factors affect data m ining (e.g., researchers in cost-sensitive learning and active learning) and practitioners who have real-world experience with how these factors influence data m in-ing applications. Cost-sensitive learning, active l earning, utility -based data m ining Early work in predictive data m ining did not address the complex circum stances in which m odels are built and applied. It was as-sumed that a fixed amount of tr aining data were available and only simple objectives , nam ely predictive accuracy , were cons id-ered. Over tim e, it becam e clear that thes e assumptions were un-realistic and that economic utility had to be considered during the three main phases of data mining: 1) acquiring training data, 2) building a model and 3) apply ing the model in realistic environ-ments. The m achine learning and data m ining com munities re-sponded with research on active information acquisition , w hich focused on m ethods for cost-effective acquisition of inform ation for the training data (phase 1) and research on cos t-sens itive learning , which cons idered the cos ts and benefits as sociated with using the learned knowledge and how these costs and benefits should be factored into the data mining process (phase 3). The utility considerations for phase 2 include the running tim e of the algorithm as well as the cos ts and benefits as sociated with clean-ing the data, transforming the data and constructing new features. Alm ost all work that considers the im pact of econom ic utility on data mining focus es exclus ively on one of the three s tages in the data mining process. Thus, economic factors have been studied in isolation, without much attention to how they interact. One goal of this workshop was to begin to remedy this deficiency by bring-ing together researchers who currently consider different eco-nomic aspects in data mining, a nd by promoting an examination of the im pact of econom ic utility throughout the entire data m in-ing process. This workshop encouraged the field to go bey ond what has been accom plished individually in the areas of active inform ation acquisition and cost-s ensitive learning. The workshop organizers further suggested that all of utility -based data m ining could be viewed using a common framework, with a key question being whether such a framework would be beneficial. Past research which has addresse d the role of econom ic utility in data mining has focused on predic tive clas sification tas ks. An additional goal of this workshop was to encourage researchers to explore m ethods for incorporating econom ic utility considerations into descriptive data mining task s and other ty pes of predictive data mining tasks. The workshop received a strong response from the data m ining com munity which was reflected in the quality and breadth of the accepted papers. Each subm itted paper was reviewed by two or three m embers of the program com mittee. In total, 13 regular papers were accepted for inclusion in the workshop. In addition, the workshop featured 3 invited talks and one group/panel discus-sion. All of the papers are available from the workshop web page at http://storm .cis.fordham .edu/~gweiss/ubdm -kdd05.htm l. The m ajority of the 13 accepted papers dealt with either active inform ation acquisition or cost-sensitive learning and applica-tions. The active inform ation ac quisition papers all focused on active feature-value acquisitions, while the cost-sensitive learning papers addressed a broad range of cost-sensitive learning issues. The workshop featured three invite d talks, which were staggered throughout the day . The first invited talk, Toward Economic Ma-chine Learning and Utility-based Data Mining was presented by Foster Provost from New York University  X  X  Stern School of Business. This talk introduced a general econom ic setting for utility -based data m ining that in cludes as special cases cost-sensitive learning, traditional ac tive learning, sem i-supervised learning, active feature acquis ition, progressive sampling and budgeted learning. Thus, this talk introduced a framework for utility -based data m ining and dem onstrated that a great deal of exis ting res earch can be viewed from a com mon pers pective. It also clearly dem onstrated that issues relating to econom ic utility arise throughout the entire data mining process and highlighted open questions that the community can address in future work. Later in the m orning Robert Holte from the University of Alberta presented the second invited talk, Cost-Sensitive Classifier Evaluation . This talk discussed how to evaluate classifier per-form ance in a cost-sensitive setting when the m isclassification costs and/or class distributions are unknown. It was argued that the clas sic technique for vis ualizing clas sifier perform ance in this situation X  X he ROC curve X  X oes not allow several important experimental questions to be answ ered vis ually and that the cos t curves, introduced by Drummond and Holte at KDD 2000, over-com e thes e deficiencies . In par ticular, unlike ROC curves , cos t curves addres s what is a given clas sifier X  X  perform ance or ex-pected cos t given a s et of m isclassific ation c osts a nd c lass distri-bution. The speaker also gave a live demonstration of a tool for drawing and analy zing cost curves given the output of different clas sifiers . The third invited talk, Machine Learning Paradigms for Utility-based Data Mining was presented in the afternoon session by Naoki Abe from the IBM T.J . W atson Res earch Center. This talk described a number of existing m achine learning paradigms that are relevant for utility -based data m ining. Am ong these paradigm s are active (or query ) learning, active on-line learning, associative reinforcem ent learning and general reinforcem ent learning. The talk briefly reviewed learning th eory techniques and results for each of thes e paradigm s. Als o, it s howed s ome exam ples of real world applications for which so me of these paradigms have proved to be satisfactory . Thirteen contributed papers were presented at the workshop. The talks are briefly described in this section. Those talks that address similar topics are dis cussed together (with few exceptions they were presented contiguously at the workshop). Four of the talks presented at the workshop focused on the topic of active information acquisition and, in particular, focused on feature-value acquisition X  X here some feature values are un-known but can be acquired for a cost. The papers propose new policies for acquiring costly features so as to obtain the best model for a given cost. The talk Budgeted Learning of B ounded Active Classifiers by Aloak Kapoor and Russell Greiner considers the  X  X udgeted learn-ing X  problem in which a learner spends a fixed budget to acquire feature-values so as to produce the m ost accurate  X  active clas si-fier X . Given a clas sification m odel, an active clas sifier spends a fixed budget to acquire feature-values for each test instance. The paper presents a framework for the budgeted learning problem and proposes several feasible polic ies that a learner can employ . Empirical evaluation of the policie s demonstrated that two of the policies are often superior to a benchmark policy in which values of every feature for each instance are acquired sequentially until the budget is exhausted. This talk was followed up by a second talk by the sam e authors, Reinforcement Learning for Active Model Selection , in which reinforcement learning techniques were used to learn an effective spending policy for acquiring feature values. The paper concludes that reinforcement learning is not likely to improve upon simpler policies. The third talk on feature-value acquisition, Economical Active Feature-value Acquisition thr ough Expected Utility Estimation by Prem Melville, May tal Saar-Tsechansky , Foster Provost and Ray mond Mooney examined two policies for acquiring feature values based on an estimation of the expected improvement in model accuracy per unit cos t. The res ults showed that the author X  X  Sam pled Expected Utility policy is a prom ising strategy that re-duces the cost of producing a m odel of a desired accuracy and also exhibits a consistent perform ance acros s dom ains . The final paper on active feature-value acquisition, Learning Policies for Sequential Time and Cost Sensitive Classification by Andrew Arnt and Shlom o Zilberstein pointed out that the utility of acquiring a feature values depends not only on the dollar cost of measuring the feature, but on the tim e neces sary to obtain the meas urem ent. The problem is further com plicated by the fact that the tim e s pent m eas uring one attribute m ay im pact the cos t of future ins tances . The authors addres s the problem of how to s elect the feature values for m eas urem ent by us ing a decis ion theoretic approach, modeling the problem as a Markov Decision Process. The paper Noisy Information Value in Utility-based Decision Making by Clay ton Morrison and Pa ul Cohen addresses the ques-tion,  X  How m uch is inform ation worth?  X  In the context of deci-sions , the value of inform ation is generally the expected increas e in utility of the decision as a result of having the inform ation, but this becom es more com plicated when the inform ation cos t is re-lated to the quality of potentially noisy inform ation. This talk pres ented an analy tical decis ion m odel which incorporates the value of information when the information may be noisy . A num ber of the workshop talks related to cost-sensitive learning. The term  X  X ost-sensitive learning X  has traditionally been used in the predictive classification context where it generally refers to learning in domains where differe nt classes have different mis-clas sification cos ts. The talk One-Benefit Learning: Cost-Sensitive Learning with Re stric ted Cost Information by Bianca Zadrozny presented a new form ulation for cost-sensitive learning called One-Benefit learn-ing. Ins tead of having the correct label for each training exam ple, as in the s tandard clas sifier learning form ulation, there is one pos sible label for each exam ple (which m ay not be the correct label) and the cost or benefit associated with that label. The talk described how the One-Benefit learning problem could be re-duced to the s tandard clas sifier learning problem so that any exis t-ing error-m inim izing classifier l earner could be used to maximize the expected benefit by correctly weighting the training exam ples . Two of the talks on cost-sensitive learning concerned learning from data sets with unbalanced cla ss distributions. This topic falls under cost-sensitive learning because in this situation the cost of misclas sifying the rare clas s is ty pically m uch greater than that of misc lassify ing the common c lass (if this were not true then one would almost never predict the rare class). The talk Does Cost Sensitive Learning Beat Sampling fo r Classify ing Rare Classe s? by Kate McCarthy , Bibi Zabar and Gary W eiss analy zed the ef-fectiveness of two methods for dealing with unbalanced class distributions when cost information is known. It compared the effectiveness of cost-sensitive l earning with sam pling strategies that reduce the clas s im balance in the training s et. The res ults indicated that cost-sensitive l earning, under-sam pling of the ma-jority class and over-sampling of the minority class all perform well on some data sets and poorly on others; with no consistent winner. One question that arises wh en using sampling to deal with unbalanced data sets is what the sampling rate should be. The talk Wrapper-based Computation and Evaluation of Sampling Meth-ods for Imbalanced Datasets by Nitesh Chawla, Lawrence Hall and Aja y Joshi disc usse d this issue. The authors described a wrapper approach for computi ng the amount of under-sampling and sy nthetic generation of minor ity class examples (a method more sophisticated than over-sampli ng) to be done in order to best im prove clas sifier perform ance. The wrapper approach works by doing a guided s earch of the param eter s pace us ing cros s-validation to obtain es tim ates of clas sifier perform ance. Experi-mental results show that this approach significantly outperforms the baselines both in the true positiv e rate and the average cost per tes t exam ple. Improving Classifier Utility by A ltering the Misclassification Cost Ratio , by M ichelle Ciraco, M ichael Rogalews ki and Gary W eiss showed that, for two cost-sensitiv e classifier learning program s, improved performance could be achieved by altering the cost inform ation passed to the learner so that it does not m atch the actual cost information upon which the classifier is evaluated. These counterintuitive results indi cate that existing cost-sensitive learners m ay contain bias es that lead to s ub-optim al res ults. One of the goals of the workshop was to broaden the scope of cost-sensitive learning, to cover ta sks other than predictive classi-fication tasks. Two papers in th e workshop addressed this goal. Utility Based Data Mining for Time Series Analysis X  Cost-sensitive Learning for Neural Network Predictors by Sven Crone, Stefan Lessmann and Robe rt Stahlbock described how econom ic utility can be factored into data m ining methods for regression and time-series analy sis. These methods have ty pically used symmetric error m etrics even though errors in forecasting are often asy mmetric. The authors address this issue by develop-ing an as ymmetric cos t function which is then us ed as the objec-tive function for training a neural network. The second paper A Fast High Utility Itemsets Mining Algorithm by Ying Liu, Wei-keng Liao and Alok Choudhary applies the notion of utility to a descriptive data mining task, asso ciation rule mining. This work not of equal value (i.e., utility ). The authors consider different values of individual item s as utilities and use utility mining to identify item sets with high utilitie s. Since the downward closure property used in association rule m ining does not hold for utility mining, the authors develop a tw o-phase algorithm to efficiently prune down the number of candidates. The workshop also included a talk based on a position paper enti-tled Contextual Recommender Problems by Omid Madani and Dennis DeCoste. This paper descri bes a real-world problem that can potentially be solved using utility -based data m ining m ethods. The problem described is that of placing ads or related links on web pages based on the context info rmation (e.g. contents of the page or information on the current user) such as to maximize som e utility function (e.g. the ad click rate). The paper shows the relationship between this problem and m ulti-arm ed bandit prob-lem s, while highlighting two significant differences: the fact that contexts/arms may not be enumerab le and the non-stationarity of user preferences . There was one paper that did not fit into the active inform ation acquisition or cost-sensitive lear ning categories. This paper ad-dressed the issue of utility for the second phase of data mining X  the phase associated with building the m odel. Interruptible Any-time Algor ithms for Iter ative Impr ovement of Decis ion T rees by Saher Esmeir and Shaul Markovitc h described two interruptible algorithms for inducing decision trees. An any time algorithm is one that can trade additional resources for im proved quality of the output (in this case an improved decis ion tree). An any tim e algo-rithm is interruptible if the requi red resources need not be speci-fied up front and if the algorithm can be interrupted at any tim e and produce a result. One of the interruptible any tim e algorithm s developed by the authors operates by repeatedly selecting a s ub-tree  X  X hose reconstruction is estim ated to y ield the highes t m ar-ginal utility and rebuilding it with higher resource allocation. X  In this work it is assum ed that th e algorithm will be interrupted as soon as the decision tree is needed, but the stopping criterion could be modified to incorporate a m ore global notion of utility . That is, the algorithm should be allowed to run until the cost of allowing it to continue running (based on the need to use the learned m odel) exceeds the benefit derived from allowing it to run (i.e., improved classification performance). Authors, speakers and participants contributed to an open discus-sion. Practitioners com mented about the significance and rele-vance of the problems addressed by the papers presented in the workshop to the data mining industry . It was noted that the indus-try struggles to satisfy economic constraints but often no appro-priate scientific fram eworks are available. Participants identified a variety of specific industries a nd problem domains to which the problems addressed in the papers can be mapped, such as induc-tion from skewed clas s dis tributi ons, costly information acquisi-tions, and decision costs. It was noted that the workshop had high-lighted the range and com plexity of is sues that the res earch com -munity currently addresses. An important discussion addressed the need to focus research efforts on a well-defined research agenda. It was noted that vari-ous contributions to the utility -based data m ining literature ad-dress different objectives, assume different problem settings, and evaluate the work on different and sometimes proprietary data sets. This makes it difficult to com pare different solutions and to advance the field, more generally . It was subsequently proposed that it would be important for th e com munity to form ulate s everal generic problems and evaluation meas ures. It may also be useful to com pile relevant data s ets for each of the problem s. Having a com mon problem setting and objectives would facilitate com pari-sons among solutions and allow contributions to build upon ear-lier work. Overall, the UBDM-05 workshop was a success. The workshop published a set of diverse papers , which address many of the goals set out by the workshop organizers. In particular, the papers show how econom ic utility im pacts the three phases of the data mining process outlined in Section 1. In addition, the papers do not focus exclus ively on predictive clas sification tas ks, which have dom inated work on utility -based data m ining. The workshop was attended by participants from both academ ia and industry . In particular, the i ndustry participants made it clear that the issues the workshop focused on are issues they struggle with every day . The group/panel discussion also demonstrated that there was a lot of active inte rest in the topic of utility -based data mining. Due to a tight schedule the program did not leave substantial amounts of time for discussion. One area that did not receive a lot of attention at the workshop concerned the notion of m axim izing utility throughout the entire data mining process, as opposed to m axim izing utility at just one phase of the process. This is not surprising since this was the first workshop on utility -based data m ining, but we hope that in the future researchers and practitioners will begin to address this is-sue, which will, by necessity , bring together the active learning and cost-sensitive learning com munities. We aim ed for the workshop to facilitate interaction am ong re-searchers and practitioners and to prom ote the transfer of ideas among problems previously addresse d in isolation. We thank the authors , gues t speakers , program com mittee m embers and atten-dees for their contributions toward s this end. We are indebted to Mohammad Zaki, the KDD-05 Workshop Chair, and to the SIGKDD for organizational and f unding assistance. We also thank Foster Provost and our anony mous workshop proposal re-viewers for their insightful s uggestions and encouragement.
