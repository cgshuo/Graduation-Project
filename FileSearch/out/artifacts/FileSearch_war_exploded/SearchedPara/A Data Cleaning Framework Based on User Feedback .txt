 empirical, knowledge-based and logic-based approaches [6]. 
Most of the existing dependency-based data repair approaches [2,3] focus on ensure the correctness of the repairs and algorithm time complexity is too high, which could be srisky especially for critical data. 
In order to reduce the time complexity, we introduce a genetic model in section 2 to machine learning model based on the Bayesian theory in section 3 and users (domain experts) are involved to confirm these re pairs which can improve the learning model. Figure 1 shows the overall design of our framework. 1.1 Related Work [2,3,4]. Consistent information is obtained from an inconsistent database focusing on minimally differs from the original database [7]. 
Data cleaning systems described in the research literature include the AJAX system feedback to improve data quality focuses on identifying correctly matched references in a large scale integrated data [10]. 1.2 Contributions We summarize our contributions as follows: 1. We present our genetic model, an optimization technique for data repair, which them to determine their quality. (Section 2) 2. We incorporate user feedback in the cleaning process to enhance and accelerate 3.1) interactive response, fast convergence, and high accuracy. (Section 3.2) to a better quality database with minimal user intervention. (Section 4) working with dataset, the genetic model attempts to select solutions that minimize the output of a cost function and satisfy the constraints at the same time. repair  X  for which  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  is minimum. To solve this problem, we introduce three constraints [5]: (1) CFDs; (2) CINDs; (3) makes  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  minimum and satisfies constraints  X  . 
The following list:  X   X   X   X   X  =  X   X  X  X   X   X ,  X   X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  . represent a repair solution, thus the cost of the repair D is defined as Where  X   X   X   X  =  X   X  X , X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  . modify  X   X   X   X   X = such that  X   X   X   X   X =  X  . inefficient and the problem can be abstract ed an optimization problem.

To improve the quality of repairs, we introduce the novel users' feedback mechanism to confirm these repairs. which is suitable for embed feedback. For uncertain repairs, users give feedback and these responses constitute a new training set to improve the learned model. Then we database (Section 3.2). 3.1 Leaning Model for these repairs to construct a new training set to retrain the model.  X  user X  X  response  X  X  X 1,0, X 1 X  X  is as follows.
