 recommend ed people for different tasks . This paper presents a system, System U, which automatically derives people X  X  personality traits f rom social media and recommend s people for different tasks . The system leverages linguistic signals appearing in a person X  X  social media activities to compute the personality portraits including Big Five personality, fundamenta l needs and basic human value s. This system and technology can be used in a wide variety of personalized applications, such as recom mending people to answer questions . H.1.2 User/Machine Systems: Human factors.
 System U ; Big Five person ality; basic human values; funda mental needs; social media; recommendation system . People have different personality traits, such as openness to experience new activities, needs of closeness with families. Psychology and Behavioral Economic st udies show that personality influences a person X  X  behavior in the real world, e.g. occupational proficiency [2] and economic decisions [7]. However, it is impractical to obtain these traits for a la rge population with traditional psychometric surveys and tests. Fortunately, a number of studies show personality traits can be detected from individuals X  language use based on psycholinguistic analysis [2][3][8]. For example, the agreeableness of a person is highly correlated with their language choices of inclusive words, such as with, together, and us. Meanwhile, the public footprints left in social media offers us an opportunity to derive people X  personality traits at scale. In this paper, we demonstrate a system, System U, which automatically derives people X  X  personality traits from social media with psycholinguistic analysis. We currently focus on three types of tr aits, including Big Five personality [2][8], fundamental needs [7] and human values [1]. We present the system architecture, key technologie s and user interfaces. We also show how these traits can be used to recommend people who share similar interests. Figure 2 shows the system architecture of System U . The social media crawler s first obtain people X  X  public digital footprints (tweets, blogs and Facebook updates etc.), fro m various social media sources . Th is content is saved to a storage layer for later analysis . The module of people analytics then computes three types of traits from the textual content , and there are three models including Big Five personality, basic human values, and fundamental needs in this module. With the computed traits, the module of people recommender can suggest a group of people who can help on certain tasks . Also, some other person alization modules can be plugged into this to offer individualized services by leveraging the derived personality traits. Finally, the user interface allows users to interact with the personality traits and personalized services through interactive visuali zation . We currently model three types of personality traits with a lexicon -based, psycholinguistic analysis , including Big Five personality, basic human values, and fundamental needs. The f irst model is Big Five personality that consists of five unique and enduring personality character istics, including Openness , Conscientiousness , Extraversion , Agreeableness, and Neuroticism . It influences one X  X  life from many aspects, including job p rofici ency and team performance [2][8]. The s econd model concerns a person X  X  fundamental needs with 12 dimensions (6 of them are currently shown in System U ), which often influences one X  X  brand and produc t choices [7]. The last one is the basic values model capturing people X  X  beliefs and motivators along five majo r dimensions [1].
 A lexicon -based analysis is used to build the trait models by analyzi ng correla tions between personal ity traits and the usage of certain words or word categories. Specifically, our Big Five per sonality and basic values [6] use words and word categories derived from the LIWC dictionary [6], and o ur needs model [7] uses a custom dictionary. We developed a custom dictionary with a hybrid empir ical and computational approach . The idea is to analyze the correlation of set of words extracted from written samples with each trait dimension by feature-based, statistical models. The extracted words construct a custom dictionary . More details can be found in [1][7]. A people recommender is designed to suggest a group of people who can help on certain tasks by assess ing the task suitability of an individual . These tasks include finding  X  Answerers to questions : We built a smart social QA system  X  Information Spreaders : We built a recommendation system The user interface of System U is shown in Figure 1 . It includes three panels o f user twitter information, derived personality portrait, and recommended people. Specifically, Panel 1 shows basi c information of a Twitter user, including recent tweet posts from this user. Panel 2 shows a visualization of personality portrait, i ncluding Big Five personality, fundamental needs, human values and social activities. The visualization enables users to expand a trait of interest to see subtraits. For example, a user can have a better understanding of  X  Neuroticism  X  by expanding this sector to l ook at its subtraits, such as  X  Anxiety  X ,  X  Anger  X ,  X  Depression  X  and  X  Self -consciousness  X . Panel 3 shows a list of people who are recommended for certain tasks. In this paper, we present a system , System U, which automatically derives people X  X  per sonality traits , including Big Five personality, basic human values, and fundamental needs, from social media. We also demonstrate the capability of applying such technology for various potential personalized services such as recommending people to answer questions .
