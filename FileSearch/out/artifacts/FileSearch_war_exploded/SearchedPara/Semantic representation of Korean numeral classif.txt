 Soonhee Hwang  X  Aesun Yoon  X  Hyuk-Chul Kwon Abstract The complexity of Korean numeral classifiers demands semantic as well as computational approaches that employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The classifier is a universal linguistic device, having the two functions of quantifying and classifying nouns in noun phrase constructions. Many linguistic studies have focused on the fact that numeral classifiers afford decisive clues to categorizing nouns. However, few studies have dealt with the semantic categori-zation of classifiers and their semantic relations to the nouns they quantify and categorize in building ontologies. In this article, we propose the semantic recate-gorization of the Korean numeral classifiers in the context of classifier ontology based on large corpora and KorLex Noun 1.5 (Korean wordnet; Korean Lexical Semantic Network), considering its high applicability in the NLP domain. In par-ticular, the classifier can be effectively used to predict the semantic characteristics of nouns and to process them appropriately in NLP. The major challenge is to make such semantic classification and the attendant NLP techniques efficient. Accord-ingly, a Korean numeral classifier ontology (KorLexClas 1.0), including semantic hierarchies and relations to nouns, was constructed.

This article is concerned with the semantic representation of Korean numeral classifiers by means of semantic analysis when building a classifier ontology (KorLexClas 1.0). To build the classifier ontology, we propose the semantic recategorization of numeral classifiers in Korean, and we establish the semantic relations between classifiers and their co-occurring nouns. Ontology, defined as a specification of conceptualization (Gruber 1993 ), can be applied to diverse tasks, not only to formalize information and a knowledge base within a specific domain but also to assist in the semantic analysis of NLP.

It is necessary to mention briefly the importance of research on classifiers as it relates to the motivation behind this study. First, most natural languages in the world reportedly have classifiers (Allan 1997 ; Croft 1994 ; Goddard 1998 , pp. 301 X 311; Goddard and Wierzbicka 1994 ; Lyons 1977, vol. 1, p. 227, pp. 316 X 317; vol. 2, pp. 452 X 466), and a language has a unique classifier system when it has grammatical devices that, in certain contexts, oblige speakers to categorize a referent along specific semantic dimensions (Goddard 1998 , p. 301). The classifier is one of the universal linguistic devices, and its main two functions are classifying and quantifying nouns in noun phrase construction. The universality of the classifier can be verified by some experimental studies on the acquisition of classifiers in various languages with different classifier systems. In such studies, the following questions are key: Which classifier is acquired earlier than others? or, In light of children X  X  errors in using classifiers, which lexical items belong to the category of classifier? or, Which classifiers co-occur with which nouns? The latter issue is directly related to determining the semantic features underlying the distribution of each classifier.

Second, the classification or categorization of things in the world is one of the most important aspects of human cognition (Biq et al. 1996 ; Jackendoff 1983 ; Lakoff 1986 ). Human language is closely related to human cognition and is intrinsically involved in classifying or categorizing objects and events in the physical world by means of diverse linguistic structures. The classifier can thus be qualified as an important type of linguistic representation directly reflecting human cognition. Classifiers serve to quantify and categorize referent objects according to the semantic properties of co-occurring nouns.

Third, the classifier is totally dependent on its co-occurring nouns X  semantic features in the sense of possessing common semantic features identical to those of the nouns it modifies. Accordingly, classifiers can be effectively used to predict the semantic characteristics of nouns and to process them appropriately in NLP (Allan 2001 , pp. 287 X 320). For example, the Korean classifiers are among the most difficult words to handle in machine translation (MT), allowing only a low accuracy of translation from English or French, which lack refined classifier systems (Bond and Paik 1997 ; Nam 2006 ). In fact, a translation site ( http://www.translate. google.com ) provides us with the following translations of English numeral structures into Korean classifiers, which shows numerous examples of incorrect translation (Table 1 ).

Given an optimal classifier module as a sub-module for MT systems for generating the relationships between classifiers and their co-occurring nouns or noun classes, the performance of the MT systems will be improved. Considering the applicability of classifier ontology, a classifier module can be designed to provide correct translations for specific nouns when they are entered as input with corresponding classifiers.

The method by which Korean classifiers, for example, -dae in  X  beoseu-du-dae  X  1 ( 2 buses) ,or -myeong ,in X  se-myeong  X ( 3 people) , and the others, are classified, is the first issue we confront. In such a categorization, we make use of the semantic classes and hierarchies of co-occurring nouns as well as word-sense disambiguation (WSD) methodologies used in NLP. Thus the classifiers must be reexamined more systematically, according to semantic classes from an ontology. Then, a method for semi-automatic categorization of nouns by means of mapping to the KorLex hierarchy and finding the least upper bound (LUB) of synset nodes is suggested. Second, we present a semi-automatic method for extracting ontological relations and formalizing them by exploiting NLP techniques, focusing on how far a semantic categorization of a classifier can be generalized. The classifier ontology and its applicability are instrumental as language resources for NLP and machine translation (Bond et al. 1996 ; Bond and Paik 2000 ).

This article is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 , we examine related studies on the characteristics of classifiers, including Korean classifiers, in more detail. Moreover, the applicability of classifiers and their ontologies in NLP are illustrated. In Sect. 3 ,we present the language resources used for this work, and we suggest a semi-automatic method of extracting ontological relations using NLP techniques. In Sect. 4 , semantic recategorization of classifiers by integrating semantic properties and contextual features extracted from large corpora is described. Hierarchies of classifiers are generated, and each classifier is connected to noun classes based on the Korean wordnet, KorLex. The constructed classifier ontology is then evaluated in Sect. 5 . The implementation of a classifier module as a sub-module for MT systems and its performance evaluation are briefly reported in Sect. 6 . Conclusions and future work follow in the final Sect. 7 . 2 Related studies Two tendencies in classifier research can be perceived: exhaustive description of the classifier systems of individual languages, and generalizations of the semantic universals of classifiers. In this section, the general characteristics of classifiers, including Korean classifiers, and the effort to build a classifier ontology in each language are investigated. 2.1 General characteristics of classifiers Some languages have more developed classifier systems and are more appropriately called  X  X lassifier languages X  than others. For example, the languages of Asia, Central America, and South America are typical  X  X lassifier languages X , whereas English or French are not. In classifier languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, most nouns are quantified by a numeral classifier structure, which is quite different from Indo-European languages.

From a linguistic point of view, the classifier can be defined as a morphological device capable of categorizing a class of nouns according to specific semantic properties. In particular, classifiers are determined according to the semantic features of co-occurring nouns. Two typical types of classifier exist, the nominal classifier and the numeral classifier. In both cases, the classifier, in the form of either a word or an affix, is a noun phrase element. Nominal classifiers can appear with ordinary nouns in a broad range of contexts, whereas the numeral classifier is more grammatically restricted, occurring mainly next to numerals and quantifying referent nouns. Historically, both noun and numeral classifiers originated from common nouns with concrete meanings. In some languages, many or most classifiers are identical in form to common nouns. In the present study, we focus only on the numeral classifiers, which are characteristically found in Asian languages. In such languages, one cannot refer, for example, to a specific number of entities, like teachers, cats, or houses, without joining a specific numeral classifier to the noun.

Most classifiers are polysemous (Goddard 1998 , p. 307), in that they convey multiple intermeshed meanings. Sometimes it is easy to explain such a polysemy according to a  X  X adial polysemy X  structure, in which several meanings extend in diverse directions from one central meaning (Matsumoto 1993 ). One of the issues that scholars have been most interested in is the generalization of the semantic organization underlying classifier systems. The well-known examples are Allan X  X  scheme of seven  X  X ategories of classification X  ( X  X aterial, shape, consistency, size, location, arrangement, quanta X ), based on a survey of more than 50 classifier languages (Allan 1977 ), and Croft X  X  classifier distinction between  X  X umans X  and  X  X onhumans X  (Croft 1994 ). However, as Allan acknowledges, the semantic classification of classifiers is a notably difficult problem in that some subcategories can be heterogeneous, and moreover, most proposed categories intermesh. Effectively, even if it is possible to draw up an orderly scheme for categorizing the main semantic organization of classifier systems across languages, this does not mean that most individual languages will conform to such a scheme.

Related previous work has concentrated on (1) typological surveys and classification of classifiers (Allan 1977 ; Goddard 1998 , pp. 301 X 311; Lyons 1977 , vol. 1, p. 227, pp. 316 X 317); (2) description of classifiers according to their meaning (Downing 1993 ); (3) semantic analysis for various classifiers (Huang and Ahrens 2003 ; Matsumoto 1993 ); and (4) application of classifiers X  categories in NLP, using an ontology for generating numeral classifiers (Bond et al. 1996 ; Bond and Paik 1997 , 2000 ; Guo and Zhong 2005 ; Hwang et al. 2006 ; Jung et al. 2006 ; Paik and Bond 2001 ). 2.2 Approaches to basic properties of Korean classifiers Korean classifiers can be divided into three types, the prototype classifier, the quasi-classifier converted from common nouns, and the classifier noun (Kim 2005 ). The second and third types still undergo grammaticalization. The first type, which belongs to a dependent noun and subset of nouns, serves only as a classifier (e.g., -mali ,-gae ,-myeong ,-jjag ,-geulu , etc.). The second type, the quasi-classifier, is used largely as a classifier but can often be used as a common noun (e.g., -galag , -doe ,-majigi , etc.). The third type is a subset of  X  X ountable nouns X  that behave as classifiers (e.g., salam, hagsaeng , etc.). Grammatically, the main difference distinguishing the first type from the other types is that the first type cannot be used alone. Morphologically, these classifiers are suffixed to numerals. Table 2 shows us the effective means of realizing Korean numeral noun phrases. Considering the use of classifiers, we focus only on structures a and b from Table 2 . The quantified phrase, consisting of a numeral and a classifier, occurs in the post-NP position without -ui (GEN), as in (E1-a), or in the pre-NP position with an adnominal case marker (GEN) -ui as in (E1-b). In the former case, the quantifier noun phrases appear  X  X loating X  as adverbial phrases just before the verb (Chae 1983 ).  X  E3  X  a. du-tong -ui-jeonhwa b : jeonhwa du-tong Each classifier is determined by the semantic properties of co-occurring nouns. As shown in (E3), the nouns that can be used with the classifier -tong (CL for counting letters, documents or phone calls) are pyeonji (letter), seolyu (document), and jeonhwa (phone calls), among others.  X  E4  X  na-neun chaeg-eul du-gwon ilg-eossda :
A classifier -gwon as in (E4) is selected to indicate the quantity of books and the category of co-occurring nouns,  X  X ound objects X . Because the selection of the classifier is totally dependent on the properties of the quantified objects, we can say that each classifier exerts its specific semantic restrictions on its co-occurring nouns. The classifier -gwon must appear only with bound objects such as books, magazines, theses, and others. As for the research concerning Korean classifiers, it has been limited to typological classification and semantic analysis. Most studies have con-centrated on establishing an exhaustive list of classifiers, clarifying their function, and examining the practical use of individual classifiers related to their co-occurring nouns.

It is noteworthy that there are a number of homographic classifiers in Korean that are borrowed largely from Chinese classifiers. As is well known, Chinese has a rich system of classifiers that categorizes nouns into different classes. Effectively, Korean classifiers are composed of two groups, one comprising proper Korean classifiers and the other Chinese classifiers. The fact that Korean classification is affected by the use of Chinese classifiers can be explained by the following three types. For the first type, usage and meaning are completely the same in the two languages. For the second type, usage and meaning are totally different. For the third type, usage and meaning are sometimes the same but not always (Guo 2000 ). Table 3 summarizes the three types of classifiers used in the two languages. 2 2.3 Classifiers for application in NLP Recent research on classifiers, unlike previous studies, has been concerned with providing enough knowledge and information for applications in NLP. With the growing interest in ontology (Nichols et al. 2005 ; Philpot et al. 2003 ; Sowa 2000 ) and the need for semantic analysis in NLP (Nirenburg and Raskin 2004 ), classifiers have been dealt with in diverse ways. An important motivation behind approaching classifiers for application in the NLP domain and using its techniques is found especially in a series of studies (Bond et al. 1996 ; Bond and Paik 2000 ; Hwang et al. 2006 ; Jung et al. 2006 ).

Bond et al. ( 1996 ) and Bond and Paik ( 2000 ) proposed a method for the automatic generation of Korean and Japanese numeral classifiers using semantic categories extracted from a thesaurus and dictionaries. However, those studies dealt with only a few Japanese and Korean classifiers and did not treat the syntactic or semantic ambiguities derived from processing natural language texts. One semantic category was given to nouns to generate a default numeral classifier, and thus the noun classifier pairs were limited in their practical application. Hwang et al. ( 2006 ) proposed the semantic recategorization of numeral classifiers in Korean and the first Korean numeral classifier ontology based on large corpora and Korean WordNet. Jung et al. ( 2006 ) discussed a semi-automatic method of extracting and representing the various ontological relations of Korean classifiers. Those relations were formalized with OWL, and the results obtained show that relations such as  X  X sEquivalentTo X  and  X  X asOrigin X  can be used to improve performance in machine translation.

In addition, Paul et al. ( 2002 ) proposed an algorithm to assign the numeral classifier system in Japanese to numerals of nonclassifier languages like English, using a phrase alignment method. For this, a corpus-based method is used to extract the omitted classifier information from the corresponding phrases of bilingual samples similar to the input. The aligned phrasal knowledge of numeral classifiers is then reused to generate numeral classifiers corresponding to numeral expressions in English. Sornlertlamvanich et al. ( 1994 ) proposed an algorithm for generating numeral classifiers for nouns in Thai, using default classifiers associated with each noun. However, these two studies revealed that the noun classifier pairs were limited in their practical application: they did not provide the exact rules for classifier selection, and they did not offer any evaluation results.
 Nam ( 2006 ) presented a scheme for building a database for the application of Korean numeral classifiers to automatic translation of French into Korean. She selected and subcategorized 942 Korean numeral classifiers. However, more than 500 mensural classifiers fell into dummy categories without any semantic criteria, and neither the correlation of classifiers nor the salient semantic properties of co-occurring nouns was sufficiently described. Thus, the relations between classifiers and co-occurring nouns were not constructed. 3 Language resources and methodology In this section, the language resources used in this study are presented, and a semi-automatic method of processing the ontological relations using NLP techniques is illustrated. 3.1 Language resources To analyze Korean classifiers using semantic features, and to formalize the ontological relations of classifiers, we extracted examples of classifiers and nouns from large-scale corpora and the Standard Korean Dictionary . 3 To establish the relationship between classifiers and nouns, the semantic classes and hierarchies of co-occurring nouns, their mapping to the KorLex hierarchy and the least upper bound (LUB) of synset nodes are appropriately exploited (Hwang et al. 2006 ). 3.1.1 Standard Korean Dictionary and list of high-frequency Korean words 4 Although the Standard Korean Dictionary containing about 500,000 noun entries is a useful language resource, providing lexical definitions of entry words and information about semantic relations between them, it includes neither syntactic nor semantic information for extracting numeral classifiers. Therefore, classifier candidates were generated by shallow parsing (described in Sect. 3.2 ), and those classifier candidates that also appeared on the list of high-frequency Korean words were selected as our target classifiers. 3.1.2 Corpora The corpora were composed of articles from daily newspapers, texts from middle school textbooks, scientific papers, literature texts, and law documents. The total size was 7,778,848 words, and 450,000 examples containing target classifiers and their adjacent words were extracted and used for analysis of the semantic features of representative Korean classifiers. 3.1.3 WordNet and KorLex (KL) 5 WordNet (Princeton WordNet, hereafter, PWN) is a general-purpose lexical semantic network (Fellbaum 1998 ), whose design was inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. PWN has been used in many other NLP applications, such as information retrieval, query expansion and WSD (Buscaldi et al. 2006 ; Sinopalnikova 2004 ; Sundheim et al. 2006 ). We chose to use KorLex (ver. 1.0, published in 2004) for extracting semantic hierarchies and classes of nouns as ontology. KorLex, one of the representative Korean wordnets, was built based on a semi-automatic translation of PWN (ver. 2.0) and thus follows the semantic and hierarchical structure of PWN. After the semi-automatic translation of PWN into Korean, expert linguists manually checked the mapping results and then proceeded to fine-grained word-sense matching. In particular, KorLex has the ultimate utility of being able to interconnect to single or multilingual wordnet(s) such as EuroWordNet or Balkanet. To cope with its dependency on English wordnets, the hierarchy and semantic relations of PWN are modified as necessary to represent the lexical items proper to Korean lexicons. At present, KorLex Noun is being expanded with more than 10,000 basic and frequently used nouns. CoreNet, one of the other Korean wordnets, was developed based on the NTT thesaurus, and its two drawbacks are that it follows the semantic, hierarchical and conceptual structure in Japanese as it stands, with slight modification, and that the grain size for sense distinction is too large to determine the semantic categories and hierarchies in detail. The language resources used for this research are shown in Table 4 . 3.2 NLP techniques used There are no previous studies that attempted to build formalized ontological relations of classifiers. The methods using NLP techniques are required to extract ontological relations efficiently from semi-structured dictionaries or raw corpora (Alani et al. 2003 ; Garcia et al. 2006 ; Hovy 2005 ).

First, lexical information such as the POS, origin, polysemy (or sense distinction), domain, and definition of Korean classifiers were collected from the Standard Korean Dictionary.  X  X nits of measure X  included in KorLex and their semantic relations such as synonyms, hypernyms/hyponyms, holonyms/meronyms, and antonyms were obtained without additional processing. The methods then used for this research are as follows. 3.2.1 Shallow parsing of semi-structured dictionary-based definitions Because many Korean classifiers are dependent nouns and few of them are found among KorLex nouns, most semantic relations were extracted from the dictionary definitions by shallow parsing. For example, as  X  doe  X , a traditional Korean classifier, is not included among the KorLex nouns, its semantic relations were generated from the definitions in Table 5 (Jung et al. 2006 ).

The syntactic pattern of sentence (1),  X  bupi (volume)-ui (adjectival postposition representing  X  X f X , GEN) danwi (unit) X , typically, is composed of compound words combining a modifier and a head word. In this pattern, the compound word is the hypernym of the classifier, doe . Furthermore, the head word  X  danwi  X  becomes the hypernym of the compound word  X  bupi-ui danwi  X . In sentence (2), the objective phrases  X  gogsig, galu, aegche (grain, powder, liquid)-ui bupi+leul (ACC) X  of the verb  X  jae -(measure) X  are analyzed. Words representing attributes such as bupi (volume), gili (length), muge (weight) and the referred nouns such as gogsig, galu, aegche (grain, powder, liquid) are separated. The verb,  X  jae - X , and the word attributing the referred noun,  X  bupi  X , are translated into English and then combined to form an ontological relation,  X  X easureVolume X . From sentence (3), the syntactic pattern,  X  X  neun B ui 10+ bun-ui +1 X  represents  X  X  is one-tenth of B X . Thus, the holonym/meronym relation between A and B can be derived (Fig. 1 ). 3.2.2 Word-sense disambiguation Many homographic Korean classifiers, which have been borrowed from Chinese, are polysemies or homonyms. They can be resolved using WSD, semi-automatically. For example, the homographic classifier  X  tong  X , after being disambiguated, has at least the following senses. 1. Unit for counting letters; 2. Unit for counting paper or documents; 3. Unit for counting phone calls; 4. Unit for counting large, round fruit and vegetables, like melons, watermelons, 5. Unit for measuring substance contained in a vessel made with iron, wood,
The ambiguities can be resolved within the context. If  X  X ong X  appears in yeonaepyeonji han-tong (a love letter), the meaning of  X  tong  X  becomes  X  X  unit of counting letters X . When  X  X ong X  co-occurs with ilyeogseo (curriculum vitae), the meaning of  X  tong  X  is  X  X ocuments X  whereas when gugjejeonhwa (international telephone service) occurs with  X  tong  X , the meaning of  X  tong  X  is  X  X nit for counting phone calls X . Sometimes the automatically extracted information has too much noise to be used as a resource in itself for generating OWL triples; thus the extracted results are revised and modified by expert linguists. 3.2.3 POS tagging and parsing of unstructured texts As illustrated in Sects. 1 and 2 , classifiers allow us to predict what kind of noun or noun categories will appear, considering their selectional restrictions for co-occurring nouns. One of the effective ways to collect many co-occurring nouns is to extract them from unstructured texts in a corpus. The simplest and representative combination pattern of a numeral classifier and its context is shown in (E5).  X 
E5  X  a. se geulu -ui sonamu b. sonamu se geulu
However, a classifier can be combined not only with numerals and nouns but also with pre-numerals, post-numerals, and post-classifiers in real raw corpora. The extracted syntactic patterns of the combinations can thus be recognized variably, but they sometimes have too much noise for the classifier to be used without refinement. 4 Building classifier ontology and its formalization To build a Korean classifier ontology (KorLexClas 1.0) and to formalize the various lexical and semantic relations, we implemented this ontology in Prote  X  ge  X  ( http:// www.protege.standford.edu ) with OWL DL, which supports sufficient semantics using classes, instances, properties, and restrictions. 6 Section 4.1 describes the semantic and selectional constraints of classifiers and provides a taxonomy based on semantic classification of each classifier. In Sect. 4.2 , generation of a classifier X  X  hierarchy and mapping of nouns to CL ontology are illustrated. 4.1 Taxonomy of classifiers using semantic-feature analysis Before designing and building a classifier ontology, we require a detailed semantic analysis for each type of classifier, on which is based a taxonomy of classifiers. Above all, two types of classifiers were first generally distinguished and defined by Lyons (1977, vol. 2, p. 463):  X  X ensural-classifier X  (individuating in terms of quantity) and  X  X ortal-classifier X  (individuating the referent of the noun in terms of the kind of entity that it is). Furthermore, a number of successive studies have focused on describing classifiers and analyzing them to establish a semantic organization underlying classifiers, but they still lack refined categorizations of classifiers that can be applied to substantial and practical tasks.

Korean typically has four major types of classifiers. The mensural-CLs and sortal-CLs are distinguished and used in this paper in an identical manner to that of Lyons (Lyons 1977). The former relates to the measuring of the amount of some entity, and the latter to the denoting and modifying of certain noun classes. Mensural-CLs , for measuring the amount of an entity, can be classified into two subtypes, time and space. Traditionally, this type was identified with simple  X  X easure words X  (Huang and Ahrens 2003 ); however, we focus only on the possibility of recategorizing it using semantic features. Sortal-CLs , the most common classifier type, serve to classify the kind of quantified noun phrase they collocate with, and they can be classified into two larger subclasses according to [ X living thing]. Generic-CLs determine that the collocating nouns will be interpreted as a generic category relating to the noun class with semantic feature, [  X  living thing]. The terminology  X  X eneric X , identical to  X  X eneral X  or  X  X eutral X  (Lyons 1977, vol. 2, p.461), is derived from the fact that generic-CLs, in contrast to other types of classifiers, can co-occur with a wide range of nouns, except the noun classes with [+animacy]. 7 Generic-CLs thus can substitute for most other sortal-CLs. Second, generic-CLs can co-occur only with nouns referring to entities with shapes that can be fixed or determined. Therefore, even material nouns can appear with generic-CLs if they are specified or quantified by countable units or containers. Event-CLs quantify abstract events. The terminology and its definition arise from the applicability of syntactic and semantic criteria (Huang and Ahrens 2003 ) for determining whether noun phrases co-occurring with related classifiers possess the nature of an  X  X vent X  or not. According to the standard, an event must occur within a time frame and is to be transformed into the argument structure. We can classify event-CLs into at least two kinds, [+event] and [+attribute], according to its most salient feature, [ X time]. In addition, the semantic properties [ X group] and [ X part] can be added as attributes to each category. The [ X group] used for forming a unit by conjoining plural items can be subcategorized into the attribute [ X fixed number], and the latter into [ X pair].

Some examples of the four types of classifiers are as follows: (1) mensural-CLs (such as -sentimiteo (cm), -bun (minute), -do (degree), etc.), measuring the amount of some entity; (2) sortal-CLs (such as -myeong (CL for counting people), -chug (CL for counting squids), -ip (CL for counting leaves), etc.), classifying the kinds of quantified noun referents; (3) generic-CLs (such as -gae, -gaji, -jonglyu (CL for counting individual items), etc.), restricting quantified nouns to generic kinds; and (4) event-CLs (such as -dae (shot), -geon (CL for counting accidents), -beon (CL for counting turns), etc.), quantifying abstract events. To establish a taxonomy of Korean classifiers, some semantic features such as [ X living], [ X animacy], [ X human being], [ X shape], [ X function], and others, which are commonly used in  X  X emantic componential analysis X  (Nida 1975 ), were used in the present research. Since classifiers are chosen according to their co-occurring nouns, the representative classifier features must be derived from the co-occurring nouns X  features.
The semantic recategorization for each type of classifier was performed manually by an expert linguist, considering the semantic relationships between classifiers and their co-occurring nouns. Among 1,377 numeral classifiers that were collected and extracted semi-automatically using NLP techniques, the recategorization, which was realized by means of a hierarchy, was intended for about 521 classifiers, excepting the mensural-CLs because the latter cannot be represented in a hierarchical structure using semantic features. The process of semantic recatego-rization for each classifier is an inevitable and essential step in building the classifier ontology. Table 6 presents the semantic recategorization of each type of classifier. 4.2 Generation of classifier X  X  hierarchy and mapping of nouns to classifier According to the semantic classification of Korean classifiers analyzed above, the hierarchies of the four types of classifiers are generated differently, as follows. (1) Hierarchies of classifiers that are purely dependent nouns : Given that (2) Hierarchies of mensural classifiers, including universal measurement units (3) Hierarchies of classifiers converted from nouns : As explained in Chae ( 1983 ),
As for the mapping of nouns co-occurring with classifiers to KorLex noun X  X  hierarchy, we assume that once the semantic categories of co-occurring nouns are extracted and analyzed, the same semantic characteristics must be attributed to related classifiers. The process of categorization of nouns based on the lexical hierarchy in KorLex is described by taking a sortal-CL,  X  tong  X , and its co-occurring nouns as examples, as follows.
Step 1 : Create inventories of lemmatized nouns that are quantified by each classifier and nouns that are not combined with the classifier. Nouns quantified by -tong  X  tong (+) X , nouns not combined with tong  X  tong (  X  ) X  are collected and clustered as follows.

Tong (+): { subag (watermelon2 8 ), painaepeul (pineapple2 ananas2), baechu (Chinese cabbage2 celery cabbage2 Chinese celery1)} Tong (  X  ): { sagwa (apple1), podo (grape1)}
Step 2 : Map words to the KorLex synsets and list all common hypernyms of the synset nodes.

Step 3 : Find the least upper bound (LUB) of synset nodes mapped from the inventory. Here , melon (melon1), painaepeul (pineapple2), and yangbaechu (cabbage1 chou2) are selected as LUBs automatically. Selected LUBs are applied as a semantic category for the cluster of contextual features.

Step 4 : Connect the LUBs to the classifier tong in Korean Classifier Ontology, as shown in Fig. 2 . 5 Results Now we discuss our results and compare them with those of other studies. By exploiting NLP techniques, each classifier is connected to individual nouns or noun classes categorized semantically. The lexical information and semantic relations necessary for building the ontological relations of Korean classifiers are then extracted. In total, 1,377 numeral classifiers were categorized, and their taxonomy was constructed according to the  X  X s-a X  relations extracted from the dictionary, the KorLex noun hierarchy and a semantic feature analysis by linguists. Table 7 illustrates the four types of Korean classifiers and semantic classes of nouns.
As we have assumed that co-occurring nouns can assign the semantic properties of classifiers, the sense granularity of noun classes differs depending on the types of the classifiers. Mensural-CLs and generic-CLs can quantify and modify a wide range of noun classes, but they can seldom characterize the semantic features of nouns co-occurring with them. By contrast, sortal-and event-CLs can combine with only a few specific noun classes, for example,  X  X ruit1 X  and  X  X egetable1 X , respectively.

A classifier ontology composed of 1,377 semantically reexamined classifiers and formalized by various ontological relations of Korean numeral classifiers was constructed, considering both the semantic relationship between classifiers and their co-occurring nouns and the various types of semantic relations. Table 8 presents the numbers of representative relations constructed in Korean Classifier ontology. 6 Evaluation and discussion As mentioned above, one direct application for the classifier ontology is machine translation. Because Korean numeral classifiers are among the most difficult words to handle in MT, the implementation of a Korean numeral classifier module (hereafter, KCL-M) as a sub-module was expected to serve efficiently in post-processing in MT systems. Therefore, based on the semantic recategorization of Korean numeral classifiers and the assignment of semantic classes corresponding to classifiers through our previous studies, an algorithm was developed to generate the relations between a classifier and its co-occurring nouns or noun classes. Our KCL-M provides specific classifiers with nouns that are entered as input and vice versa (Hwang et al. 2007 ). In the current module, the relation of the mensural-CLs to their co-occurring nouns is not reflected, and several common nouns used as classifiers must be analyzed individually and added to our module. Enriching the KCL-M and testing it with test data of a large scale are still in progress.

In this section, the pilot test of the module for performance evaluation with small data sets is briefly reported, and some observations will be given. To test KCL-M X  X  performance, pairs of classifiers and their co-occurring nouns or semantic categories as test data were extracted from the Sejong Project X  X  Dictionary ( SPD ), in which nouns are tagged with semantic classification information (Table 9 ).

The performance test was conducted on the test set, pairs of classifiers and their co-occurring nouns. Because there were no classifier  X  noun pairs that had been matched in this way, the results were manually evaluated by the authors. We assumed that input was only nouns, and the module was to provide the specific classifiers. The test proceeded by selecting for the following two evaluation measures: (a) correctly extracted classifiers compared with the total number of classifiers in the test data (recall, R ) and (b) correctly extracted classifiers compared with the total number of classifiers created by the module (precision, P ). The results for KCL-M are shown in the following table. KCL-M showed about a 81.01% classifier noun pair unit recall with the test data, with a 99.45% classifier  X  noun pair unit precision (Table 10 ).

The test data, Sejong Project X  X  Dictionary , is characterized by the following points. Above all, it is one of the few language resources that have been tagged with semantic subcategorizations for entry words, ensuring good applicability for language and information processing. Moreover, making use of the information tagged with  X  X nit-expressions X  contained in SPD is efficient for extracting classifier  X  noun pairs. However, in spite of these merits, it has some drawbacks as follows.
First, the SPD contains many words with low frequencies: those rarely used at present (e.g., beom (tiger), gongchul (delivery of something to the government), gangjeom (occupation by force), ppalchisan (partizan), etc.), compound words (e.g., cheongdungoli (wild duck), meollittwigi (broad jump), wandukong (pea), gae-baldosanggug (developing country), etc.) and loanwords (e.g., gadeu (guard), deiteu (date), diseuko (disco), myujikeol (musical), etc.). Of these, only nouns occurring with frequency more than ten were considered in our classifier module. Second, there exist many classifier  X  noun pairs that are judged to be semantically awkward or unacceptable by native speakers, such as nyeoseog X  X om (guy X  X uy), butag X  X oe (request X  X imes), beomjoe X  X ae (crime X  X ae (generic-CL)) and insinmaemae X  X ha (flesh traffic X  X imes), etc. Third, most nouns in Korean can co-occur with -gae , (generic-CL), the default classifier, but not all. However, it is verified that a number of nouns in the test data, such as beomjoe (crime) and jaeneung (talent), etc. can co-occur with -gae without restrictions, but these pairs cannot be used.
The types of classifier  X  noun pairs that the KCL-M could not recall can be analyzed subsequently. The types are closely related to the characteristics of the test data. First, if nouns contained in the test data do not exist in KorLex, the module cannot provide the output. Most of the nouns not existing in KorLex are archaic terms, loanwords or low-frequency words. Second, the semantic categories of nouns in KCL-M are determined according to those in KorLex. Therefore, if the semantic category of a noun used in test data is inconsistent with KCL-M, the appropriate output cannot be provided. Third, the restriction of co-occurrence for -gae (generic-CL) as the default classifier is to be determined based on semantic categories of nouns co-occurring with -gae . Finally, from our manual evaluation of the results, some of the classifier  X  noun pairs in the test data were judged to be semantically awkward or unacceptable by native speakers. 7 Conclusions and further studies In this article, we have presented the semantic recategorization of Korean numeral classifiers. The construction of a classifier ontology was accomplished by means of the semantic features of the related nouns or noun categories. The hypothesis that the appropriate classifier is selected based on the semantic features of quantified nouns was verified by mapping the classifiers X  co-occurring nouns to KorLex X  X  nouns. For this, the ontological relations of classifiers were semi-automatically extracted using NLP techniques, and the various relations were formalized with OWL.

Secondly, as for the immediate application of classifier ontology, the implemen-tation of KCL-M as a sub-module for MT systems was required. For this, an algorithm was developed for generating the relations between a classifier and its co-occurring nouns or noun classes, using KorLex. The classifier module could be implemented in a more systematic way, based on semantic recategorization of classifiers and assignment of semantic classes corresponding to classifiers, on which is based a Korean classifier ontology. Through the pilot test of KCL-M, the applicability of the classifier ontology was verified and is expected to be used to improve the performance in machine translation. As future work, extending and modifying KorLex using specific domain ontologies and considering the semantic gaps between Korean and English will continue.
