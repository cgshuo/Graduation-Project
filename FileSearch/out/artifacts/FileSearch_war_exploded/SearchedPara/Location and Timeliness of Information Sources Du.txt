 People nowadays can obtain information on current news events through media outlets, social media, and by actively seeking information using search engines. In this paper we investigate the temporal relationship between news coverage by media outlets, social media, and query logs and show that social media frequently precedes other information sources. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is strong negative correlation between the probability for reporting of an event and the distance of the information source from the event.

The information people can receive of news events comes from diverse sources, including media outlets (TV, newspa-pers, media sites on the web), social media (Twitter, Face-book, etc), and active seeking of information using search engines on the web. These news sources assign importance to events (as manifested by the likelihood and extensiveness they will report on them) based on attributes of the event and on features of the news source itself.

Coverage of news is known to be influenced by the physi-cal distance of consumers from the location of the event. As [2] showed, the distance of an event from the USA is one of the most predictive attributes for its media coverage. Fur-thermore, Wu [5] showed that the volume of media related to news events in Canada and Mexico by USA-based news channels is partially explained by the distance of the events from the closest USA border.

Historically, news outlets were the source of many people X  X  information of world events. More recently, social media has keywords for each event. The keywords were drawn from several categories such as where the event took place, who was involved in the event, and what happened at the event. We also generated a list of excluded words. Queries and keywords were stemmed using a Porter stemmer. A query was considered relevant to the event if keywords from at least two categories were used in the query, and none of the excluded words appearing in it.

We encode data at the granularity of a day in order to remove diurnal e ff ects. The zip-code given by users at the time of registration with Yahoo was used to identify their approximate location. We computed the physical distance of each user to the event using the Haversine formula.
Daily media volume of news outlets related to an event was quantified by counting the number of document found on Yahoo News ( news.yahoo.com ) every day, which con-tained all the words used in any of the 50 most popular queries. Similarly, the volume of social media was measured via the number of Twitter messages which contained the words used in these queries.
Figure 1 shows the media and query volume related to the three events. Note the similarities in shapes between the dif-ferent information sources, i.e. the spike on day 5 of the San Bruno event which is observed in both the query volume and general media volume. In general, the peak in social media volume precedes both general news media and query vol-ume, and decays first. In the New York and Alaska events, query volume peaked and decayed later than media volume. San Bruno was unusual in that general media attention de-cayed more slowly than query volume. The cross-correlation of media volume with the number of queries per day, shown in Table 1, quantifies these findings and shows that news media and social media (Twitter) have a relatively strong correlation, as was also found by [3].

We binned the information sources according to their phys-ical distance from the event, on a logarithmical-spaced axis, and computed the fraction of event-related items from the total items generated at this distance. Table 2 shows the Spearman correlation between the physical distance and the fraction of event-related items. The correlation is extremely high, validating the findings of [5] and extending them to social media and query volume.
