 The ACM DOLAP workshop presents research on data warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). The DOLAP 2012 program is organized in four interesting sessions on data warehouse design and mainta inability, OLAP querying and trends, warehousing of complex data, performance optimization and benchmarking. H.2 [ Database Management ], D.2 [ Software Engineering ] Algorithms, Management, Document ation, Performance, Design, Theory. Data Warehouse, OLAP Data Warehouse (DW) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) technologies are the core of cu rrent Decision Support Systems. Traditionally, a data warehouse has been a historical (and relatively static) repository of data collected from a wide variety of heterogeneous data sources by means of Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) processes. The widespread deployment of both DWs and OLAP technologies is due to the intuitive representation of data provided to data analysts or managers in support of management decisions. Recently, the trend is that DWs become more and mo re dynamic, with near-real-time updates, and include more complex types of data. Research in data warehousing an d OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, management and use of information systems for decision support. Much of the interest and success in this area can be attributed to th e needs for software and tools to improve data management and an alysis given the large amounts of information that are being accumulated in corporate as well as scientific databases. Neverthele ss, the high maturity of these technologies as well as new data needs or applications not only demand more capacity or storing necessities, but also new methods, models, techniques or ar chitectures to satisfy these new needs. Some of the recent hot to pics in data warehouse research include distributed data warehouses, web wa rehouses, data streams, real-time da ta warehouses, GIS/lo cation-based services, biomedical data, integration of semi-structured and unstructured data, security/privacy and quality management. layer between business analysts and multidimensional data. In ontology based OLAP, dimensions and facts are enriched by concept definitions capturing the semantics of relevant business terms used to define measures and to formulate analytical queries. This session presents research related to models and querying techniques for complex data such as stream-, sequence-and graph-structured data. [4] proposes a framework for clustering and mining complex database object s extracted from distributed database settings. In particular, the authors propose an innovative tree-based distance function over complex objects that takes into account the typical tree-like nature of these objects in distributed database settings. [5] focuses on data warehouses built from streaming data, coming from several sources. The paper provides several results concerning approx imate querying against this type of data. [11] addresses the probl em of trajectory data streams warehousing and querying by propos ing an end-to-end framework in order to make the querying step quite effective. In particular, the proposed representation of traj ectory data heavily reduces the input data size, thus increasi ng performances. Finally, [17] proposes a novel OLAP framework, named HMGraph, for the purpose of mining multi-dimensional heterogeneous information networks. This session presents research related to performance evaluation and optimization. A particular em phasis is given to new physical architectures such as columnar databases and multi-core CPUs. [3] focuses on performance optim ization for XML cubes in a centralized architecture. The authors consider five different configurations that mix different physical structures and different type of storage. [16] discusse s and compares five different solutions for handling Type 2 slowly changing dimensions. A case study is run on the Co&gt;Operati ng System commercial software. [13] discusses the specific features of a cost model columnar in-memory databases should consider. In particular the author studies influences of data characteristics on aggregation operations. [18] proposes a set of techniques for high performance online spatial, temporal and spat iotemporal aggregations. A large set of experiments have been ru n on various spatial and temporal aggregations on both multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs. [8] extends the XML warehouse benc hmark (XWeB) with complex and scalable hierarchies that includes summarizability issues. Such extension will be useful to properly evaluate the performance of summarizability processing algorithms. [1] proposes a benchmark framework, which focuses on the  X  X reshness X  of materialized view s over time, i.e., whether they reflect all the data that have arri ved so far at any given point in time. The idea is to define fre shness as a function of time and compute its average (and minimum and maximum) value over the run of the benchmark. DOLAP 2012 continues the line of DOLAP workshop series that began in 1998. DOLAP 2012 presents relevant research results and open discussion on next-generat ion research directions that we hope will serve as a valuab le and up-to-date reference. [1] A. Baer and L. Golab.
