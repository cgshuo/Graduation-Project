 The goal of morphological segmentation is to seg-ment words into morphemes , the basic syntac-tic/semantic units. This is a key subtask in many NLP applications, including machine translation, speech recognition and question answering. Past approaches include rule-based morphological an-alyzers (Buckwalter, 2004) and supervised learn-ing (Habash and Rambow, 2005). While successful, these require deep language expertise and a long and laborious process in system building or labeling.
Unsupervised approaches are attractive due to the the availability of large quantities of unlabeled text, and unsupervised morphological segmentation has been extensively studied for a number of languages (Brent et al., 1995; Goldsmith, 2001; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Creutz and Lagus, 2007). The lack of supervised labels makes it even more important to leverage rich features and global dependencies. However, existing systems use directed generative models (Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Snyder and Barzi-lay, 2008b), making it difficult to extend them with arbitrary overlapping dependencies that are poten-tially helpful to segmentation.

In this paper, we present the first log-linear model for unsupervised morphological segmentation. Our model incorporates simple priors inspired by the minimum description length (MDL) principle, as well as overlapping features such as morphemes and their contexts (e.g., in Arabic, the string Al is likely a morpheme, as is any string between Al and a word boundary). We develop efficient learning and infer-ence algorithms using a novel combination of two ideas from previous work on unsupervised learn-ing with log-linear models: contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005) and sampling (Poon and Domingos, 2008).

We focus on inflectional morphology and test our approach on datasets in Arabic and Hebrew. Our system, using monolingual features only, outper-forms Snyder &amp; Barzilay (2008b) by a large mar-gin, even when their system uses bilingual informa-tion such as phrasal alignment and phonetic corre-spondence. On the Arabic Penn Treebank, our sys-tem reduces F1 error by 11% compared to Mor-fessor Categories-MAP (Creutz and Lagus, 2007). Our system can be readily applied to supervised and semi-supervised learning. Using a fraction of the labeled data, it already outperforms Snyder &amp; Barzilay X  X  supervised results (2008a), which further demonstrates the benefit of using a log-linear model. There is a large body of work on the unsupervised learning of morphology. In addition to morpholog-ical segmentation, there has been work on unsuper-vised morpheme analysis, where one needs to deter-mine features of word forms (Kurimo et al., 2007) or identify words with the same lemma by model-ing stem changes (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Gold-smith, 2001). However, we focus our review specif-ically on morphological segmentation.

In the absence of labels, unsupervised learning must incorporate a strong learning bias that reflects prior knowledge about the task. In morphological segmentation, an often-used bias is the minimum description length (MDL) principle, which favors compact representations of the lexicon and corpus (Brent et al., 1995; Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and La-gus, 2007). Other approaches use statistics on mor-pheme context, such as conditional entropy between adjacent n -grams, to identify morpheme candidates (Harris, 1955; Keshava and Pitler, 2006). In this pa-per, we incorporate both intuitions into a simple yet powerful model, and show that each contributes sig-nificantly to performance.

Unsupervised morphological segmentation sys-tems also differ from the engineering perspective. Some adopt a pipeline approach (Schone and Ju-rafsky, 2001; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Demberg, 2007), which works by first extracting candidate affixes and stems, and then segmenting the words based on the candidates. Others model segmenta-tion using a joint probabilistic distribution (Goldwa-ter et al., 2006; Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008b); they learn the model parameters from unlabeled data and produce the most proba-ble segmentation as the final output. The latter ap-proach is arguably more appealing from the mod-eling standpoint and avoids error propagation along the pipeline. However, most existing systems use directed generative models; Creutz &amp; Lagus (2007) used an HMM, while Goldwater et al. (2006) and Snyder &amp; Barzilay (2008b) used Bayesian models based on Pitman-Yor or Dirichlet processes. These models are difficult to extend with arbitrary overlap-ping features that can help improve accuracy.
In this work we incorporate novel overlapping contextual features and show that they greatly im-prove performance. Non-overlapping contextual features previously have been used in directed gen-erative models (in the form of Markov models) for unsupervised morphological segmentation (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) or word segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2007). In terms of feature sets, our model is most closely related to the constituent-context model proposed by Klein and Manning (2001) for grammar induction. If we exclude the priors, our model can also be seen as a semi-Markov conditional random field (CRF) model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004). Semi-Markov CRFs previously have been used for supervised word segmentation (Andrew, 2006), but not for unsupervised morphological segmentation.
Unsupervised learning with log-linear models has received little attention in the past. Two notable ex-ceptions are Smith &amp; Eisner (2005) for POS tagging, and Poon &amp; Domingos (2008) for coreference res-olution. Learning with log-linear models requires computing the normalization constant (a.k.a. the partition function) Z . This is already challenging in supervised learning. In unsupervised learning, the difficulty is further compounded by the absence of supervised labels. Smith &amp; Eisner (2005) proposed contrastive estimation , which uses a small neighbor-hood to compute Z . The neighborhood is carefully designed so that it not only makes computation eas-ier but also offers sufficient contrastive information to aid unsupervised learning. Poon &amp; Domingos (2008), on the other hand, used sampling to approx-imate Z . 1 In this work, we benefit from both tech-niques: contrastive estimation creates a manageable, informative Z , while sampling enables the use of powerful global features. Central to our approach is a log-linear model that defines the joint probability distribution for a cor-pus (i.e., the words) and a segmentation on the cor-pus. The core of this model is a morpheme-context one feature for each morpheme context. We rep-resent contexts using the n -grams before and after the morpheme, for some constant n . To illustrate this, a segmented Arabic corpus is shown below along with its features, assuming we are tracking bi-gram contexts. The segmentation is indicated with hyphens, while the hash symbol (#) represents the word boundary.
 Segmented Corpus hnAk w-vlAv-wn bn-w Morpheme Feature:Value hnAk:1 w:2 vlAv:1 Bigram Context Feature:Value ## vl:1 Furthermore, the corresponding features for the seg-mented word w-vlAv-wn are shown in Figure 1.
Each feature is associated with a weight, which correlates with the likelihood that the correspond-ing morpheme or context marks a valid morpholog-ical segment. Such overlapping features allow us to capture rich segmentation regularities. For example, given the Arabic word Alywm , to derive its correct segmentation Al-ywm , it helps to know that Al and ywm are likely morphemes whereas Aly or lyw are not; it also helps to know that Al ## or ## yw are likely morpheme contexts whereas ly ## or ## wm are not. Ablation tests verify the importance of these overlapping features (see Section 7.2).

Our morpheme-context model is inspired by the constituent-context model (CCM) proposed by Klein and Manning (2001) for grammar induction. The morphological segmentation of a word can be viewed as a flat tree, where the root node corre-sponds to the word and the leaves correspond to morphemes (see Figure 1). The CCM uses uni-grams for context features. For this task, however, we found that bigrams and trigrams lead to much better accuracy. We use trigrams in our full model.
For learning, one can either view the corpus as a collection of word types (unique words) or tokens (word occurrences). Some systems (e.g., Morfessor) use token frequency for parameter estimation. Our system, however, performs much better using word types. This has also been observed for other mor-phological learners (Goldwater et al., 2006). Thus we use types in learning and inference, and effec-tively enforce the constraint that words can have only one segmentation per type. Evaluation is still based on tokens to reflect the performance in real applications.

In addition to the features of the morpheme-context model, we incorporate two priors which cap-ture additional intuitions about morphological seg-mentations. First, we observe that the number of distinct morphemes used to segment a corpus should be small. This is achieved when the same mor-phemes are re-used across many different words. Our model incorporates this intuition by imposing a lexicon prior : an exponential prior with nega-tive weight on the length of the morpheme lexi-con. We define the lexicon to be the set of unique morphemes identified by a complete segmentation of the corpus, and the lexicon length to be the to-tal number of characters in the lexicon. In this way, we can simultaneously emphasize that a lexi-con should contain few unique morphemes, and that those morphemes should be short. However, the lex-icon prior alone incorrectly favors the trivial seg-mentation that shatters each word into characters, which results in the smallest lexicon possible (sin-gle characters). Therefore, we also impose a corpus prior : an exponential prior on the number of mor-phemes used to segment each word in the corpus, which penalizes over-segmentation. We notice that longer words tend to have more morphemes. There-fore, each word X  X  contribution to this prior is nor-malized by the word X  X  length in characters (e.g., the segmented word w-vlAv-wn contributes 3/7 to the to-tal corpus size). Notice that it is straightforward to incorporate such a prior in a log-linear model, but much more challenging to do so in a directed gen-erative model. These two priors are inspired by the minimum description length (MDL) length princi-ple; the lexicon prior favors fewer morpheme types, whereas the corpus prior favors fewer morpheme to-kens. They are vital to the success of our model, providing it with the initial inductive bias.
We also notice that often a word is decomposed into a stem and some prefixes and suffixes. This is particularly true for languages with predominantly inflectional morphology, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and English. Thus our model uses separate lexicons for prefixes, stems, and suffixes. This results in a small but non-negligible accuracy gain in our exper-iments. We require that a stem contain at least two characters and no fewer characters than any affixes pheme is identified as the stem, any preceding mor-pheme is identified as a prefix, whereas any follow-ing morpheme as a suffix. The sample segmented corpus mentioned earlier induces the following lex-icons: Prefix w Al Stem hnAk vlAv bn ywm jmAEp Suffix wn w
Before presenting our formal model, we first in-troduce some notation. Let W be a corpus (i.e., a set of words), and S be a segmentation that breaks each word in W into prefixes, a stem, and suffixes. Let  X  be a string (character sequence). Each occurrence of  X  will be in the form of  X  adjacent character n -grams, and c = (  X  context of  X  in this occurrence. Thus a segmentation can be viewed as a set of morpheme strings and their contexts. For a string x , L ( x ) denotes the number of characters in x ; for a word w , M number of morphemes in w given the segmentation S ; Pref ( W,S ) ,Stem ( W,S ) ,Suff ( W,S ) denote the lexicons of prefixes, stems, and suffixes induced by S for W . Then, our model defines a joint proba-bility distribution over a restricted set of W and S : where u
Here, f rence counts of morphemes and contexts under S , and  X  = (  X   X , X  are the weights for the priors. Z is the nor-malization constant, which sums over a set of cor-pora and segmentations. In the next section, we will define this set for our model and show how to effi-ciently perform learning and inference. As mentioned in Smith &amp; Eisner (2005), learning with probabilistic models can be viewed as moving probability mass to the observed data. The question is from where to take this mass. For log-linear mod-els, the answer amounts to defining the set that Z sums over. We use contrastive estimation and define the set to be a neighborhood of the observed data. The instances in the neighborhood can be viewed as pseudo-negative examples, and learning seeks to discriminate them from the observed instances. N (  X  ) be a function that maps a string to a set of strings; let N ( W  X  ) denote the set of all corpora that can be derived from W  X  by replacing every word w  X  W  X  with one in N ( w ) . Then, Unsupervised learning maximizes the log-likelihood of observing W  X  We use gradient descent for this optimization; the partial derivatives for feature weights are where i is either a string  X  or a context c . The first expected count ranges over all possible segmenta-tions while the words are fixed to those observed in W range over the neighborhood.

Smith &amp; Eisner (2005) considered various neigh-borhoods for unsupervised POS tagging, and showed that the best neighborhoods are TRANS1 (transposing any pair of adjacent words) and DELORTRANS1 (deleting any word or transposing any pair of adjacent words). We can obtain their counterparts for morphological segmentation by simply replacing  X  X ords X  with  X  X haracters X . As mentioned earlier, the instances in the neighbor-hood serve as pseudo-negative examples from which probability mass can be taken away. In this regard, DELORTRANS1 is suitable for POS tagging since deleting a word often results in an ungrammatical sentence. However, in morphology, a word less a character is often a legitimate word too. For exam-ple, deleting l from the Hebrew word lyhwh (to the lord) results in yhwh (the lord). Thus DELORTRANS1 forces legal words to compete against each other for probability mass, which seems like a misguided ob-jective. Therefore, in our model we use TRANS1 . It is suited for our task because transposing a pair of adjacent characters usually results in a non-word. To combat overfitting in learning, we impose a Gaussian prior ( L Our learning algorithm can be readily applied to su-pervised or semi-supervised learning. Suppose that gold segmentation is available for some words, de-for all words in W , we are doing supervised learn-ing; otherwise, learning is semi-supervised. Train-ing now maximizes L tives become The only difference in comparison with unsuper-vised learning is that we fix the known segmenta-tion when computing the first expected counts. In Section 7.3, we show that when labels are available, our model also learns much more effectively than a directed graphical model. In Smith &amp; Eisner (2005), the objects (sentences) are independent from each other, and exact inference is tractable. In our model, however, the lexicon prior renders all objects (words) interdependent in terms of segmentation decisions. Consider the simple cor-pus with just two words: Alrb, lAlrb . If lAlrb is seg-mented into l-Al-rb , Alrb can be segmented into Al-rb without paying the penalty imposed by the lexi-con prior. If, however, lAlrb remains a single mor-pheme, and we still segment Alrb into Al-rb , then we introduce two new morphemes into the lexicons, and we will be penalized by the lexicon prior ac-cordingly. As a result, we must segment the whole corpus jointly, making exact inference intractable. Therefore, we resort to approximate inference. To compute E rive a sample, the procedure goes through each word and samples the next segmentation conditioned on the segmentation of all other words. With m sam-ples S imated as acters. To sample a new segmentation for a partic-ular word, we need to compute conditional proba-bility for each of these segmentations. We currently do this by explicit enumeration. 4 When n is large, this is very expensive. However, we observe that the maximum number of morphemes that a word contains is usually a small constant for many lan-guages; in the Arabic Penn Treebank, the longest word contains 14 characters, but the maximum num-ber of morphemes in a word is only 5. Therefore, we impose the constraint that a word can be seg-mented into no more than k morphemes, where k is a language-specific constant. We can determine k from prior knowledge or use a development set. This constraint substantially reduces the number of segmentation candidates to consider; with k = 5 , it reduces the number of segmentations to consider by almost 90% for a word of 14 characters.

E S,W [ f i ] can be computed by Gibbs sampling in the same way, except that in each step we also sam-ple the next word from the neighborhood, in addition to the next segmentation.

To compute the most probable segmentation, we use deterministic annealing. It works just like a sam-pling algorithm except that the weights are divided by a temperature , which starts with a large value and gradually drops to a value close to zero. To make burn-in faster, when computing the expected counts, we initialize the sampler with the most probable seg-mentation output by annealing. We evaluated our system on two datasets. Our main evaluation is on a multi-lingual dataset constructed by Snyder &amp; Barzilay (2008a; 2008b). It consists of 6192 short parallel phrases in Hebrew, Arabic, Ara-maic (a dialect of Arabic), and English. The paral-lel phrases were extracted from the Hebrew Bible and its translations via word alignment and post-processing. For Arabic, the gold segmentation was obtained using a highly accurate Arabic morpholog-ical analyzer (Habash and Rambow, 2005); for He-brew, from a Bible edition distributed by Westmin-ster Hebrew Institute (Groves and Lowery, 2006). There is no gold segmentation for English and Ara-maic. Like Snyder &amp; Barzilay, we evaluate on the Arabic and Hebrew portions only; unlike their ap-proach, our system does not use any bilingual in-formation. We refer to this dataset as S&amp;B . We also report our results on the Arabic Penn Treebank ( ATB ), which provides gold segmentations for an Arabic corpus with about 120,000 Arabic words.
As in previous work, we report recall, precision, and F1 over segmentation points. We used 500 phrases from the S&amp;B dataset for feature develop-ment, and also tuned our model hyperparameters there. The weights for the lexicon and corpus pri-ors were set to  X  =  X  1 ,  X  =  X  20 . The feature weights were initialized to zero and were penalized by a Gaussian prior with  X  2 = 100 . The learning rate was set to 0.02 for all experiments, except the full Arabic Penn Treebank, for which it was set to iteration, 200 samples were collected to compute each of the two expected counts. The sampler was initialized by running annealing for 2000 samples, with the temperature dropping from 10 to 0.1 at 0.1 decrements. The most probable segmentation was obtained by running annealing for 10000 samples, using the same temperature schedule. We restricted the segmentation candidates to those with no greater than five segments in all experiments. 7.1 Unsupervised Segmentation on S&amp;B We followed the experimental set-up of Snyder &amp; Barzilay (2008b) to enable a direct comparison. The dataset is split into a training set with 4/5 of the phrases, and a test set with the remaining 1/5. First, we carried out unsupervised learning on the training data, and computed the most probable segmentation for it. Then we fixed the learned weights and the seg-mentation for training, and computed the most prob-able segmentation for the test set, on which we eval-eral versions of their systems, differing in how much bilingual information was used. Using monolingual information only, their system (S&amp;B-MONO) trails the state-of-the-art system Morfessor; however, their best system (S&amp;B-BEST), which uses bilingual in-formation that includes phrasal alignment and pho-netic correspondence between Arabic and Hebrew, outperforms Morfessor and achieves the state-of-the-art results on this dataset.
Table 1 compares our system with theirs. Our sys-tem outperforms both S&amp;B-MONO and S&amp;B-BEST by a large margin. For example, on Arabic, our sys-tem reduces F1 error by 21% compared to S&amp;B-BEST, and by 40% compared to S&amp;B-MONO. This suggests that the use of monolingual morpheme con-text, enabled by our log-linear model, is more help-ful than their bilingual cues. 7.2 Ablation Tests To evaluate the contributions of the major compo-nents in our model, we conducted seven ablation tests on the S&amp;B dataset, each using a model that differed from our full model in one aspect. The first three tests evaluate the effect of priors, whereas the next three test the effect of context features. The last evaluates the impact of using separate lexicons for affixes and stems.
 NO-PRIOR The priors are not used.
 NO-COR-PR The corpus prior is not used.
 NO-LEX-PR The lexicon prior is not used.
 NO-CONTEXT Context features are not used.
 UNIGRAM Unigrams are used in context.
 BIGRAM Bigrams are used in context.
 SG-LEXICON A single lexicon is used, rather than
Table 2 presents the ablation results in compari-son with the results of the full model. When some or all priors are excluded, the F1 score drops substan-tially (over 10 points in all cases, and over 40 points in some). In particular, excluding the corpus prior, as in NO-PRIOR and NO-COR-PR, results in over-segmentation, as is evident from the high recalls and low precisions. When the corpus prior is enacted but not the lexicon priors (NO-LEX-PR), precision is much higher, but recall is low; the system now errs on under-segmentation because recurring strings are often not identified as morphemes.

A large accuracy drop (over 10 points in F1 score) also occurs when the context features are excluded (NO-CONTEXT), which underscores the importance of these overlapping features. We also notice that the NO-CONTEXT model is compara-ble to the S&amp;B-MONO model; they use the same feature types, but different priors. The accuracies of the two systems are comparable, which suggests that we did not sacrifice accuracy by trading the more complex and restrictive Dirichlet process prior for exponential priors. A priori, it is unclear whether us-ing contexts larger than unigrams would help. While potentially beneficial, they also risk aggravating the data sparsity and making our model more prone to overfitting. For this problem, however, enlarging the context (using higher n -grams up to trigrams) helps substantially. For Arabic, the highest accuracy is at-tained by using trigrams, which reduces F1 error by 16% compared to unigrams; for Hebrew, by using bigrams, which reduces F1 error by 17%. Finally, it helps to use separate lexicons for affixes and stems, although the difference is small. ARABIC %Lbl. Prec. Rec. F1 S&amp;B-MONO-S 100 73.2 92.4 81.7 S&amp;B-BEST-S 200 77.8 92.3 84.4

They reported results for supervised learning using mono-lingual features only (S&amp;B-MONO-S), and for su-pervised bilingual learning with labels for both lan-guages (S&amp;B-BEST-S). On both languages, our sys-tem substantially outperforms both S&amp;B-MONO-S and S&amp;B-BEST-S. E.g., on Arabic, our system re-duces F1 errors by 46% compared to S&amp;B-MONO-S, and by 36% compared to S&amp;B-BEST-S. More-over, with only one-fourth of the labeled data, our system already outperforms S&amp;B-MONO-S. This demonstrates that our log-linear model is better suited to take advantage of supervised labels. 7.4 Arabic Penn Treebank We also evaluated our system on the Arabic Penn Treebank (ATB). As is common in unsupervised learning, we trained and evaluated on the entire set. We compare our system with Morfessor (Creutz and fessor Categories-MAP, which builds on Morfessor and conducts an additional greedy search specifi-cally tailored to segmentation. We found that it per-forms much better than Morfessor on Arabic but worse on Hebrew. To test each system in a low-data setting, we also ran experiments on the set con-taining the first 7,000 words in ATB with at least two characters (ATB-7000). Table 4 shows the re-sults. Morfessor performs rather poorly on ATB-7000. Morfessor Categories-MAP does much bet-ter, but its performance is dwarfed by our system, which further cuts F1 error by half. On the full ATB dataset, Morfessor performs even worse, whereas Morfessor Categories-MAP benefits from the larger dataset and achieves an F1 of 74.9. Still, our system substantially outperforms it, further reducing F1 er-This paper introduces the first log-linear model for unsupervised morphological segmentation. It lever-ages overlapping features such as morphemes and their contexts, and enables easy extension to incor-porate additional features and linguistic knowledge. For Arabic and Hebrew, it outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by a large margin. It can also be readily applied to supervised or semi-supervised learning when labeled data is available. Future di-rections include applying our model to other in-flectional and agglutinative languages, modeling in-ternal variations of morphemes, leveraging parallel data in multiple languages, and combining morpho-logical segmentation with other NLP tasks, such as machine translation.
