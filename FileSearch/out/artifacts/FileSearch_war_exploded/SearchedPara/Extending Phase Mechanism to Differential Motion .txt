Although the neural mechanism underlying the motion considered as a physiological basis responsible for the pop-out detection. processing motion and color information. Nakayama and Loomis [1] have predicted the existence of motion selective neurons with antagonistic cente r-surround receptive field organization in 1974. found in both middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas related to motion figure/ground segregation [5] and the differentiation of object motion from ego-motion [6]. There are many related works [7]-[12] on motion pop-out detection. Some works [7]-[9] are based inhibiting similar motion [7] or only enhancing opposite motion [8]. Heeger, et al. [7] proposed a respect to the surrounding speed effects, the neuronal responses are suppressed by the same speed with the center motion but not enhanced by other speeds. Similar problem existed in [8], which only visual cortex are sensitive to the motion contrast rather than depend upon the absolute direction and speed of the object motion. Although pooling over motion neurons tuned to different velocities can motions. The model proposed by Dellen, et al. [12] computed differential motion responses directly from complex cells in V1 and didn't utilize responses from direction selective neurons. In this paper, we propose an opponency model which directly responds to differential motions by utilizing the phase shift mechanism. Phase tuning is a ubiquitous mechanism in sensory information visual cortex have been found to detect disparitie s by adjusting the phase shift between the receptive field organizations in the left and right eyes [13][14]. Motion sensitive cells have been modeled in the similar way as the disparity energy neurons a nd detect image motions by utilizing the phase shift between the real and imaginary pa rts of temporal complex valued responses, which are comparable exploring the similarity between images from different spatial regions and from different eyes. The remainder of this paper is organized as following. Section 2 illustrates the phase shift motion energy neurons which estimate image velocities by the phase tuning in the imaginary path of the construction of differential motion opponency. The phase difference determines the preferred velocity difference between adjacent areas in retinal images. Sec tion 4 investigates properties of motion pop-out detection by the proposed motion opponency model. Finally, in section 5, we relate our proposed model to the neural mechanism of motion integration and motion segmentation in motion related areas and suggest a possible interpretation for adaptive center-surround interactions observed in biological experiments. Adelson and Bergen [16] proposed the motion energy model for visual motion perception by measuring spatio-temporal orientations of image se quences in space and time. The motion energy The motion energy model was extended in [15] to be phase tuned by splitting the complex valued temporal responses into real and imaginary paths and adding a phase shift on the imaginary path. Figure 1(a) demonstrates the schematic diagram of the phase shift motion energy model.

The parameters  X  and  X  computed by where and complex valued respon ses in real and imaginar y paths are obtained as, The superscript * represents the complex conjugation and the phase shift parameter  X  controls the odd profiles of the spatio-temporal RF tuned to a particular phase shift. Figure 1. (a) shows the diagram of the phase shift motion energy model adapted from [15]. (b) draws the spatiotemporal representation of the phase shift motion energy neuron with the real and imaginary receptive field demonstrated by the two left pictures. (c) illustrates the construction of differential motion opponency with a phase difference  X  from two populations of phase shift motion energy neurons in two spatial areas c and s . To avoid clutter, the space location ( x , y ) is not explicitly shown in phase tuned motion energies. location can be represented by a phase shift which leads to the peak response across a population of motion energy neurons. Across regions of different motions, there are clear discontinuities on the detection can X  X  discriminate between the object motion and uniform motions in contextual backgrounds. Here we propose a phase mechanism to detect diff erential motions inspired by the disparity energy model and adopt the center-surround inhibition mechanism to pop out the object motion from contextual background motions. The motion differe nces between different spatial locations can be locations are considered as the retinal images to the left and right eyes. Thus, we can construct a differential motion opponency by placing two populations of phase shift motion energy neurons at different spatial locations and the energy ( ) averaged phase shift motion energies over space and phase, where () ,, wxy  X  is the profile for differential motion opponency and v  X  is the velocity difference implement the functional role of spatial interactions , it is desired to be a separable function in space and phase domain and can be modeled by phase tuned summation of two spatial kernels, where () , Substituting Eq.

Finally, the differential mo tion energy is computed by the squared modulus of the summation of the integrated motion signal in region c and phase shifted motion signal in region s .

(a) Phase map and (b) peak magnitude map are obtained from stimuli of two patches of random dots moving with different velocities. The two patches of stimuli are statistically independent but share the same sp atial properties: dot size of 2 pixels, dot density of 10% and dot coherence level of 100%. The phase t uned population of motion energy neurons are applied to each patch of random dots with RF parameters:  X  t = 2  X  /8,  X  t = 2  X  /16,  X  x = 5 and  X  = 5.5. For each combination of velocities from left and right patches, averaged phase shifts over space and time are computed and so do the magnitudes of peak responses. The unit for velocities is pixels per frame. spatial regions. Figure 2 shows two types of structures for the differential motion opponency. In [17], the authors demonstrates that among cells in area MT with surrounding modulations, 25% of cells are with the an tagonistic RF structure as shown in Figu re 2(a) and another 50% of cells have the integrative RF structur e as shown in Figure 2(b). larger phase shift magnitude prefers the bigger velocity difference. This phase tuning of velocity difference is consistent with the phase tuning of motion energy neurons. Figure 3 shows the phase map obtained by using random dots stimuli with different velocities on two spatial patches (left and Deviated from the diagonal line to upper-left a nd lower-right, the phase magnitudes increase while The phase tuning can give a good cl assification of velocity differences. Out derivation and analysis above show that the ph ase shift between two neighboring spatial regions is a good indicator for motion difference between these two regions. In this section, we validate the surrounding directions and speeds on the center motion. Figure 4. Demonstrations of center-surround di fferential motion opponency, where (a) show the excitation of opposite directions outsi de the CRF and (b) show the inhibition b y surrounding motions in same directions. The center-surround inhibition models by Petkov, et al. [8] and Heeger, et al. [7] are shown in (c) and (d). Responses above 1 indicate enhancement and responses below 1 indicate suppressions. including both directions and speeds on the center a nd surrounding regions. On the contrary, visual stimuli of opposite directions or quite different speeds outside the CRF enhance the responses in the CRF. In their experiments, they used a set of stimuli of random dots moving at diffe rent velocities, where there are small patches of moving random dots on the center. We tested the properties of the proposed oppon ency model for motion difference measurement by using similar random dots stimuli. The random dot s on background move with different speeds and in different direction but have th e same statistical parameters: dot size of 2 pixels, dot density of 10% and motion coherence level of 100%. The small random dots patches are placed on the center statistical parameters with background random dots but move with a constant velocity of 1 pixel per frame. Figure 4 shows results for the enhanced and suppressed responses in the CRF with varying surrounding directions. The phase shift motion energy neurons had the same spatial and temporal preferred spatial frequency was 2  X  /16 radian per pixel and the temporal frequency was 2  X  /16 radian per frame. The sizes of RF in ho rizontal and vertical directions were respectively 5 pixels and 10 pixels, corresponding to a spatial bandwidt h of 1.96 octaves. The time constant  X  was 5.5 frames surrounding motion of opposite direction gives the largest response to the motion in the CRF for the inhibitory interaction and the smallest resp onse for the excitato ry interaction. Results demonstrated in Figure 4 are consistent with physiological results reported in [3].

The insensitivity of the proposed opponency model to absolute center and surrounding velocities is demonstrated in (a ), where responses are enhanced for all center velocities from -2 to 2 pixels per frame. In (b ), the model by Heeger, et al. [7] only shows enhancement when the center speed matches the preferred speed of 1.2 p ixel per frame. Similarly, responses above 1 indicate enhancemen t and below 1 indicate suppressions.

As shown in Figure 5, by varying the velocities of ra ndom dots on the center region, we found that responses by the proposed model are always enhanced independent upon absolute center velocity of 1.2 pixels per frame and maintain suppressed at other speeds. We proposed a new biologically plausible model of the differential motion opponency to model the spatial interaction property of motion energy neurons. The proposed opponency model is motivated by the phase tuning mechanism of disparity energy neurons which infers the disparity information Hence, the two neighboring spatial areas can be cons idered as left and right images and the motion complex valued responses at these two regions. Our experimental results demonstrate a consistent conclusion with physiological experiments that moti ons of opposite directions and different speeds low-level features such as edges, orientations and color information. Except providing a unifying phase mechanism in understanding neurons with different functional understand the motion integration and motion segm entation. Integration and segmentation are two opposite motion perception tasks but co-exist to constitute two fundamental types of motion Integration is obtained by utiliz ing the enhancing functi on of surrounding areas to CRF areas. Both types of processing have been found in motion rela ted areas including area MT and MST. Tadin, et al. [18] have found that motion segmentation dominan ts at high stimulus contrast and gives the way modulation is adaptive according to the visual stimulus such as contrasts and noise levels. Since our proposed opponency model determines the functional role of neurons by only the phase shift parameter, this makes the proposed model to be an ideal candidate model for the adaptive surrounding modula tion with the phase tuning between two spatial regions.
