 H.3.1 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Content Analysis Learning X  Induction Measurement, Design Question Answering, Machine Learning
An obvious method in question answering (QA) for assessing the relevance of candidate answer sentences is by considering their underlying event structures , i.e. syntactic and semantic informa-tion. Unlike simple term-based matching , these approaches can be more precise since they reflect more accurately the meaning of these textual units. However, even with state-of-the-art NLP soft-ware, such linguistic processing is error-prone. Moreover, there are relevant answer sentences of questions which cannot be matched by event structures. In some of these cases, term-based approaches still work. We propose a robust, dat a-driven method that learns the mapping between questions and answers using logistic regression and show that combining term-based and event-based approaches significantly outperforms the individual methods.
One popular term-based approach is presented in [2] where span-size ratio (SSR) and matching-term ratio (MTR) are interpolated to a combined measure. Though this method already fails at simple paraphrases, such as kill and murder , one still achieves fairly rea-sonable results on QA data sets, such as TREC QA 1 .MostQA systems making use of event-based modelling consult lexical re-sources. [5], for example, proposes a successful method for ex-panding queries using WordNet 2 . Additionally, grammatical rela-tions are important for sentence relevance detection or answer ex-traction, as [3] point out. With these information, sentences, such as question-answer pair (1)-(2), can be properly matched. The two events assassinated and killed can be identified as synonyms and their arguments properly matched despite the active-passive alter-nation due to the usage of grammatical functions.
Most event-based QA systems su ffer from lacking any simpler backing-off processing which should support matching of sen-tences when event-based processing fails. The causes for failure are diverse. The underlying event structures may be too compli-cated to match or the event processing erroneous. The following question-answer pair exemplifies a situation in which event struc-ture cannot be used for matching since the full-verb write ,which is the event denoting expression (EDE) of the question, is not re-flected by any word in the answer sentence. (3) Which famous book did Rachel Carson [ write ] EDE ? The reflection of EDEs in answer sentences is essential since they are the linguistic units from which event structures are bootstrapped. It should be obvious that, in the current example, term-based match-ing works in order to establish the relevance of the answer sentence. In the next section, we show an event-based model that even sup-ports matching of event structures which are bootstrapped by EDEs of different parts-of-speech. Thus a verb-based event structure can be mapped onto noun-based event structure 3 , as in question-answer pair (1)-(2):
The algorithm we propose is based on three different kinds of mappings of type where qap represents a tuple comprising question and candidate answer sentence ( 1 . 0 means optimal match). We call the overall quality of matching a question and a candidate answer sentence qaMap . We are looking for the best matching formally denoted by: This measure combines matching the underlying event structures ( esM ap ) and occurring terms ( tM ap ): qaMap ( qap ):=  X   X  ( esM ap ( qap )) + (1  X   X  )  X  ( tM ap Event-based matching is done by a linear binary classifier. We choose logistic regression : where  X  is the logistic function ( S-curve ), f is a feature vector, the corresponding weights and b is a bias. The features in similarity functions comprising information associated with event structure from various linguistic levels. The most prominent fea-tures 4 are: Each similarity function is either binary or continuous, i.e. it is defined over [0; 1] . In order to be able to match event structures across different parts of speech, we use NOMLEX-Plus [1]. This enables us to match EDEs, such as win and victory in question-answer pair (1)-(2), and assign grammatical functions to arguments of EDEs being nouns. We assess term-based matching with the help of SSR and MTR : The optimal weights are taken from [2], i.e.  X  =0 . 125 and  X  =1 . 0 . The other unknown parameters are estimated on the TREC QA 2005 data 6 . The parameters for esM ap ,i.e. w and are learned on a manually labelled subset of the corpus. The only unknown parameter for qaMap ,i.e.  X  , is determined via iterative optimization using a separate subset of the same TREC collection. Note that this optimization does not require a separate training set.
Figure 1 shows the plot of the performance on the complete pa-rameter space of  X  for Equation 3. It illustrates that tM ap 0 . 0 ) has a high recall but a lower precision whereas esM ap 1 . 0 ) has a high precision but a lower recall. The fact that the op-timal configuration is  X  =0 . 4 is plausible since the weighting Figure 1: Optimum of qaMap at  X  =0 . 4 shows the best possi-ble trade-off between precision and recall. trades recall against precision in the best possible way. This itera-tive optimization illustrates that the combination is successful since it outperforms the best individual method, i.e. tM ap , with an ob-served absolute F-score increase from 0 . 68 to 0 . 74 by including the information offered by our event-based approach based on logistic regression.
We proposed a data-driven algorithm for sentence relevance de-tection for QA which used event-based metrics to enhance term-based matching (i.e. span-size ratio and matching-term ratio ). The resulting matching method achieved an increase in F-Score from 0 . 68 to 0 . 74 . [1] A. Meyers, R. Reeves, C. Macleod, R. Szekeley, V. Zielinska, [2] C. Monz.
