 1. Introduction
In information interaction research, there is growing recognition for information systems to satisfy both utilitarian and hedonic needs, particularly in the area of exploratory search where users X  motivations go beyond merely completing an information task ( White &amp; Roth, 2009 ). This has created a call to action for researchers to design systems that are fun and engaging and that foster learning and discovery ( White &amp; Roth, 2009 ), but also to systematically consider the measure-ment of such experiences. Kelly (2009) underscores the need to capture affective responses during  X  X  X articular IR [information retrieval] interactions and states X  X  (p. 200), while O X  X rien and Lebow (2013) advocate developing robust measures of experience. There is an increasing impetus to support searchers to not only retrieve and evaluate information, but to engage with it. Further, we need  X  X  X ood measures X  X  that capture searchers X  affective experiences and allow a degree of standardization to facilitate comparisons between different search systems, user groups, etc. ( K X ki &amp; Aula, 2008, p. 86 ).
Questionnaires are commonly used to measure attitudes toward systems and perceptions of search experiences. Kelly (2009) notes that such measures have good face validity, but are often developed  X  X  X d hoc X  X  and their reliability and wider  X  validity are not well established. This is problematic because, without reliable and valid measures, how can we be confident of our findings ( Cairns, 2013 )? Thus it is essential to evaluate the robustness of self-report measures to bolster internal validity.

This paper looks to a particular questionnaire, the User Engagement Scale (UES) to evaluate its potential as a  X  X  X ood mea-sure X  X  for adequately assessing human information experiences. The UES is a 31-item self-report questionnaire developed in the e-shopping domain ( O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2010a ). It has been subject to some evaluation in search systems ( Arguello, Wu, ing applications ( Banhawi &amp; Mohamed Ali, 2011 ), and games ( Wiebe, Lamb, Hardy, &amp; Sharek, 2014 ) with mixed results regarding its generalizability in experimental settings, and the number of user engagement dimensions (UE) is captures.
Given these mixed results, our motivating question was:  X  X  X s the UES a reliable and valid experiential scale to use in informa-tion interaction research, specifically online news browsing? X  X  Here, we investigate its viability across three studies. 2. Related literature 2.1. User engagement
User engagement (UE) encompasses users X  initial reactions to technologies ( Sutcliffe, 2010 ), as well as sustained use of and re-engagement with information systems over time ( Jacques, 1996; O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2008 ). Engaging experiences involve system feedback and challenge, novelty, aesthetic and sensory appeal, interactivity, interest, choice, control, motiva-1997 ). UE has become increasingly important in recent years for evaluating search, social networking, and entertainment applications (see for example, Hong &amp; Yang, 2013 ), though it has been the subject of some research for nearly two decades ( Jacques, 1996; Jacques et al., 1995; Webster &amp; Ho, 1997 ).
 Currently, behaviour-based metrics are being proposed as indicators of engagement ( Lehmann, Lalmas, Yom-Tov, &amp;
Dupret, 2012 ). For example, search trail length and dwell time may signal continuous use or sustained engagement with a website ( Singla &amp; White, 2010 ). However, objective measures do not capture the subjective experiential aspects of information interaction, such as people X  X  motivations to use a system, or their emotional response to that usage. Indeed, the relationship between subjective and objective measures is not always clear. While Kelly, Fu, and Shah (2010) found that the number of documents retrieved was directly related to how favourable participants rated the IR system in three experi-ments; other studies have found weak or conflicting relationship between user perceptions and performance measures ( Al-Maskari &amp; Sanderson, 2011; O X  X rien &amp; Lebow, 2013 ).

Self-report measures, which include interviews, focus groups, think aloud or think after protocols, questionnaires and experiential scales offer a means to capture the subjective aspects of information experiences, though are also not without their disadvantages. Kelly, Harper, and Landau (2008) provide an excellent summary of these (e.g. demand effects, acquien-sence, etc.) based on their review of relevant psychology literature. In general, however, self-report measures allow people to express their knowledge, emotions or attitudes about an experience, are a staple of user-centered research ( Kelly, 2009 ), and an important element of multiple method approaches ( O X  X rien &amp; Lebow, 2013 ). Further, well-designed and empirically vali-dated questionnaires and scales allow constructs of interest to be explored, defined and standardized ( Fulmer &amp; Frijters, 2009 ).

In the case of a construct such as UE, a robust self-report measure would be useful for researchers, information purveyors and systems developers. It could be used in prototyping situations to provide designers with quick user feedback about an interface or search task, or in information retrieval studies to complement and corroborate behavioural or physiological measures, such as eye tracking. The ability to measure user engagement will provide a more holistic picture of people X  X  experiences with information systems. However, the measure must be broad enough to encompass the many dimensions of UE and capable of functioning in different interactive settings. In other words, it must demonstrate reliability, validity and generalizability. 2.2. The User Engagement Scale (UES)
The User Engagement Scale (UES) is a self-report measure that builds upon earlier work in the area of educational multimedia ( Jacques, 1996; Webster &amp; Ho, 1997 ). Jacques X  (1996) questionnaire consisted of 14 items related to achieve-ment, difficulty, attention, control, perceived time, motivation, boredom, patience, curiosity, and the desire to use the soft-ware again. Though rigorously developed, this questionnaire was never published, and as a result, its longitudinal reliability and validity were never addressed. Webster and Ho (1997) developed a questionnaire to measure  X  X  X nfluences on engage-ment X  X  (challenge, feedback, control, and variety) and  X  X  X ngagement X  X  (attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest) with multimedia presentations. They compared audience engagement with two types of presentation software and reported high internal consistency amongst influences on engagement and engagement items, and a unidimensional factor structure.
Subsequent work confirmed the internal consistency or reliability of the items with a multimedia training systems ( Chapman, Selvarajah, &amp; Webster, 1999 ), but the make-up of the questionnaire (one or two items per attribute) is problem-atic for reliability ( Webster &amp; Ho, 1997 ).
The more recent UES was motivated by the conclusion that engagement was a multi-dimensional construct, and that there was a need to re-examine its potential attributes and how these related to each other ( O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2008, 2010a ). Through a systematic scale development process, over 400 items were compiled, evaluated, and pre-tested. An in-depth review process with an independent researcher reduced the number of items to over 100, and these items were administered to 440 online shoppers. Six distinct factors emerged through exploratory factor analysis (EFA): aesthetic appeal, perceived usability, felt involvement, novelty, focused attention and endurability. Results from this study informed the second large-scale evaluation of the instrument with 800 shoppers of a specific online retailer. Structural Equation
Modelling (SEM) was used to confirm the factor structure and examine relationships amongst them (for more information about the process of developing and evaluating the UES, see O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2010a ). These two studies resulted in a 31-item instrument that encompassed system variables (aesthetic appeal, perceived usability), and users X  response to the online shopping interaction (felt involvement, focused attention, novelty) and its outcome (endurability).

Since its development, the UES has been administered to users of multimedia presentation software ( O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2010b ), search systems ( Arguello et al., 2012; O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2013 ), social networking applications ( Banhawi &amp;
Mohamed Ali, 2011 ), and games ( Wiebe et al., 2014 ). Collectively, these studies offer mixed results regarding the number of items and factor structure of the UES. The original UES consisted of 31 items and six distinct factors. However, subsequent studies have eliminated items in their initial analysis because they demonstrated poor contextual or system fit ( Arguello et al., 2012 ). In addition, some researchers have reported a four-or five-factor structure ( Banhawi &amp; Mohamed Ali, 2011; attention remain distinct factors, while items from the novelty, felt involvement, and endurability subscales merge to form into the more hedonic and pleasurable aspects of the experience, and could be labeled  X  X  X edonic engagement X  X . An exception to the four-factor structure was O X  X rien and Toms X  (2010b) examination of the UES in an informational webcasts experiment; felt involvement items were eliminated in the preliminary analysis, but the remaining five factors were present and distinct.
Despite issues with the factor structure, all of the studies confirm the multidimensional nature of UE and the internal consistency of the subscales (pre-factor analysis). Other work supports the concurrent validity of the UES with behavioural measures ( Hyder, 2010 ) and other scales, including the Cognitive Absorption Scale and System Usability Scale ( O X  X rien &amp;
Lebow, 2013 ), and Flow State Scale (FSS) ( Wiebe et al., 2014 ). Wiebe et al. (2014) found that the UES, in combination with the FSS, predicted video game performance as measured by the highest level of a game that players attained. However, the amount of predicted variance was low (11%), indicating that other variables (not accounted for by either scale) contributed to performance. Arguello et al. (2012) did not discern any differences in users X  interface preferences as measured by the UES in their investigation of aggregated search and task complexity; however, Levesque, Oram, MacLean, et al. (2011) successfully used items from the UES to compare haptic UE with widgets that provided different degrees of tactile feedback.
In summary, the UES has had positive results regarding its reliability and certain types of validity; some types of validity remain to be explored. Research has cast doubt on the original six-factor structure. Wiebe et al. (2014) advocate using a modified four-factor scale to evaluate engagement with video games, a finding concurrent with O X  X rien X  X  more recent work.
We sought to make sense of previous findings by conducting further investigations in the online news domain to examine the reliability and validity of the UES in this context. Here we ask,  X  X  X ow generalizable is the UES to online news? X  X  3. Current studies
Online news was the domain selected for these studies because it is interactive and multimodal ( Chung, 2008 ), is widely used by a cross-section of the population for information seeking and browsing ( Marshall, 2007 ), and satisfies both purpose-ful and serendipitous information needs. Online news, with its relevance to everyday life, ubiquity, and the interactive and multimodal nature of news delivery  X  is a fitting environment for studying UE and the utilitarian and hedonic aspects of information interaction.
 We drew upon North American and United Kingdom news sources in the design of three quasi-experimental studies.
Study 1 acted as a pilot to examine the meaningfulness of transferring the UES to the news domain with particular emphasis on scale reliability. Study 2 involved browsing online news websites in the context of a socially situated information scenario. Study 3 manipulated the mode in which participants interacted with news (text, audio, or video). Questions guiding this research were: 1. To what extent does the UES yield internally consistent subscales and a six-factor structure (all studies)? 2. Is the UES sensitive to differences between user engagement with different news websites based on people X  X  familiarity with the news sources (Study 2)? 3. Does the UES detect differences between experimental conditions, such as the modality for interacting with online news (i.e., text, audio, video) (Study 3)?
Research question #1 is focused on establishing the reliability of the UES for use in the online news environment. This is important, as we need to determine how the UES functions outside of the original e-commerce environment in which it was developed. Questions #2 and 3 looked specifically at construct validity. In IIR studies, we need to ascertain that self-report instruments can differentiate experiences with different interfaces and experimental conditions, should differences indeed exist. 3.1. Approach to data analysis
To reduce redundancy in other parts of the paper, we present our approach to data analysis used in all studies. First, the wording of the UES items was modified to fit the online news context. This was necessary because the original items were developed and tested in the online shopping domain.

For each data set the following procedures and tests were used to examine the data. Descriptives and missing value analysis was first done on each item though, as this produced no concerns, it is not reported in detail here. Cronbach alpha ( a ) was used to examine the reliability of the subscales of the UES. Values between 0.7 and 0.9 were considered optimal ( DeVellis, 2003 ). Where scales were considered to lack reliability, the Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) of each item was used to indicate potentially problematic items. MSA below 0.6 is a commonly used threshold to indicate problematic were used to describe inter-scale correlates and identify possible overlap between the scales; this would suggest a factor structure requiring fewer than the original six factors.

Where factor structure was considered, the Kaiser X  X eyer X  X lkin MSA and Bartlett X  X  test of sphericity were used to indicate that factor analysis would be suitable, though we note the issues of using this with small samples. The component structure of the UES was validated through replication of the original six-factor analysis on the new sample ( Kline, 2000 ) using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with oblique rotation (Direct Oblimin). The structure matrix was used for the analysis in each case. This decision was based on the significant relationships observed in the inter-item correlation matrix.
The structure matrix is more difficult to interpret than the pattern matrix because it does not  X  X  X artial out X  X  the overlapping same time it is conceptually clearer as it reveals the correlations seen between the factors. The cut-off value for loadings was 0.35 based on our modest sample sizes ( Kline, 2000 ). 4. Study 1: piloting the UES for online news 4.1. Methodology
The purpose of this study was to examine the plausibility and reliability of deploying the UES in the news domain to ensure that the UES retains its construct validity in this new domain. The design of this study was distinguished from the original UES work in several important ways. First, it examined the scale in the online news domain, rather than online shopping. This required the adaptation of the UES to be more generically suitable for engagement in a variety of domains.
Also, it was necessary to devise tasks that would realistically motivate participants in the study to engage with a news read-ing activity. Unlike shopping where the task is to end up with a product, news reading can have a variety of goals from being merely to pass time to having in-depth understanding of current issues. Within the context of this study, the intent was to provide a specific enough task to allow people to know what they needed to do without prescribing exactly what was required in too much detail thus allowing a genuine engagement at an individualized level. We were also interested in a more socially motivated scenario to reflect the different purposes of news consumption over product purchase. Though work on information sharing is not uncommon, all of the studies that have investigated user engagement, with the exception of Banhawi and Mohamed X  X  Ali (2011) study of Facebook, have looked at individual information seeking.

Second, this was a quasi-experimental study conducted in a laboratory, rather than a field study. O X  X rien and Toms X  (2010a) initial studies sampled people who had voluntarily performed online shopping tasks. This is important because sub-sequent work (summarized in O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2013 ) has questioned the application of some items to experimental research where information tasks are imposed; laboratory-based studies are a mainstay in information interaction.

The study ( n = 30) was conducted at a Canadian university using the CBC news website ( www.cbc.ca/news ). Participants ( M = 19, F = 11) browsed the news website and located three stories they were willing to share in a social situation. The study lasted 45 X 60 min. Approximately two-thirds of participants were between the ages of 21 and 35, and university students ( n = 20). No one read print news exclusively: 16 people reported reading online news only and 14 indicated they read both formats. Most interacted with news daily ( n = 18) or several times per week ( n = 8).

Each session followed the same procedure. Following informed consent, participants completed a paper-based demographic questionnaire. They were then introduced to the simulated task scenario. The scenario asked them to imagine they would be attending a social gathering later in the evening, and that browsing the online news website would be useful for gathering information for conversational purposes. They were given a rough timeline of twenty minutes to locate three news items. The timeframe was not strictly enforced, but used as a guideline to avoid fatiguing participants. They were asked to avoid non-news content (e.g., weather or classified ads), but otherwise were uninhibited in their browsing and selections. After their browsing session, participants completed a user perception questionnaire, which included the UES.
Respondents completed the questions using a seven-point Likert scale that ranged from  X  X  X trongly disagree X  X  to  X  X  X trongly 2000 ). The UES was administered on the computer in the form of one of four randomized lists. Lastly, a brief interview was articles, and describe what they found to be least and most engaging about the session. Commercial screen capture software recorded the browsing sessions and facilitated the interviews through playback of the session. At the end, participants were thanked for their time, debriefed, and paid an honorarium for taking part. 4.2. Results There were no missing values in the data. UES item means ranged from 2.67 to 6.23 (on a seven-point Likert scale).
Cronbach X  X  alpha for the five aesthetic (AE) and eight perceived usability (PUs) items was high (0.94 and 0.92, respectively) and suggested redundancy within these subscales. The endurability (EN) and focused attention (FA) subscales showed good reliability. The three novelty (NO) and three felt involvement (FI) (both between 0.6 and 0.7) items showed less than ade-quate reliability. Although removing one item from each NO and FI would have improved the alpha values of these subscales, moving forward with two items for each of these subscales was not ideal.

Thus there is some confidence that the scales are statistically reliable in this context though with caveats on two of the scales. The correlation analysis ( Table 1 ) showed high correlations between EN and PUs; EN, NO and FI; NO, FA, and FI; and
AE and PUs, which suggests some convergence amongst these groups of subscales. This is appropriate to some extent as all these scales are related to measuring engagement and ought therefore to have some conceptual overlap. However, the correlations are quite high in places, which suggested that perhaps the factor structure was not appropriate in this context.
We therefore turned to PCA analysis to gain insights into potential issues with the factor structure of the UES in the news domain. Bartlett X  X  Test of Sphericity was significant ( x
Sampling Adequacy (KMO = 0.27) was not satisfactory. Individual measures of MSA were examined and several were below acceptable values (0.7). Thus the pre-analysis for factorization gave mixed signals. While the alpha values were appropriate and inter-factor correlations were reasonable, MSAs were low. This could be a consequence of the small sample size. As a result, we proceeded with PCA on all items with the view that the analysis would better specify problems with specific items.
The scree plot showed a five-or six-factor solution. First, six factors were extracted; however, all of the items loaded on five factors. The five-factor solution presented more cohesive loadings ( Table 2 ) and explained 75.5% of the variance. Shading is used to convey the original subscales, and the highest loadings for each item are in bold; all loadings below 0.35 and 0.35 were removed from the table to improve readability. As expected from the high correlations amongst subscales, items loaded significantly on more than one factor. However, the items from the AE, EN, NO, FI and PUs subscales all loaded together on one component. The exception to this was FA, where six of the seven items loaded together on Component 3, but FA3 did not and instead loaded most strongly on Component 4. Interpreting the loadings, Component 1 (42.61% of the variance) con-sisted of PUs and EN sub-scales; Component 2 (12.51% of the variance) had FA items (with the exception of FA3). All of the AE items loaded on Component 3 (10.1% of the variance), as well as the FI items as a set. However, two FI items (FI1 and F12) loaded most strongly on Component 4 (5.6% of the variance); here we also see FA3 and significant loadings of
EN, and some PUs and NO items. The NO subscale loaded as a set on Component 5 (4.66% of the variance). 4.3. Summary Study 1 is limited by its small sample size but has served to highlight the potential validity of the UES in this new domain.
The reliability of the subscales was demonstrated in good Cronbach X  X  alpha values; the exceptions to this were low alphas for the three item scales NO and FI. Understandably with a small sample, PCA must be interpreted with caution. However, there are good grounds to see these results encouragingly. Although there is substantial cross-loading across factors, on the whole, for each subscale, there is some particular factor where all of the items in that subscale load on that factor. This is what would be expected when scales behave coherently in a new context ( Kline, 2000 ).

Of course with the smaller scales, FI and NO, any variation from fully loading on a factor is a substantial deviation from all loading together. Therefore the PCA does not unequivocally support the reliability of these scales. The interviews conducted with participants after they finished their browsing session confirmed the value of novel experiences, as people expressed the need for novel content and/or news interface features as part of their engagement with the website ( O X  X rien, 2011 ). Thus, it does not seem appropriate to dismiss the NO subscale entirely.

Although we did not find support for the six-factor structure, we did see the items load on five factors. Given the small sample size, this supports the high inter-scale correlations seen and it may be that with a larger sample the six factor structure would emerge. Overall though, we found evidence to support the reliability and use of the UES in the online news domain and we therefore proceeded to use the UES in a larger study in the same domain that would be more amenable to more detailed analysis. 5. Study 2: UES and news source familiarity
In study 2, we re-examined the reliability of the UES and investigated its sensitivity by manipulating news source famil-iarity. There are many contextual factors that may influence UE with news, notably trust and credibility. Johnson and Kaye (2009) , for example, explored politically oriented Internet users X  evaluations of political candidate websites, issues-oriented websites, blogs, email lists/bulletin boards and chat/instant sources. Users X  motivations to rely on blogs for non-mainstream perspectives predicted their credibility ratings of blogs. Thus with increased voluntary exposure to information sources (i.e., familiarity), users assessed the attributes of the source more positively.

In this way, familiarity pertains to the nature of the content, and the match between the tone of the content and users X  expectations. Novelty and interest has also been explored with respect to online news and the user experience. Studies have shown that users will engage with content on topics extraneous to their primary interests with positive results ( Toms, 2000 ), and will also be drawn  X  X  X ff-task X  X  when they view salient content ( McCay-Peet, Lalmas, &amp; Navalpakkam, 2012 ). Thus, the familiarity of the news provider must be tempered with human tendencies to seek out content that is novel and/or interest-ing. However, the range of topics and stories covered by a news provider on any given day could be quite similar. However, familiarity also applies to the interface/system itself. Familiar systems are those for which users X  have already developed a mental model or  X  X  X now-how X  X . Turner (2013) suggests that familiarity allows us to  X  X  X ope X  X  with digital technology, reduces cognitive load, and thereby frees us to engage more readily in the interaction.

In study 2, we reasoned that familiarity would influence UE for two reasons. First, users X  would have confidence in the accuracy of the news provided by the familiar source, trust that source, and understand its potential biases (e.g.,  X  X  X eft-leaning X  X ); depending on their inclination, readers should be able to find both novel and interesting content on both familiar and unfamiliar news websites. Second, the familiar website would be viewed as more  X  X  X sable X  X  by participants, freeing them to become more engaged in the interaction. This study therefore examined how news source familiarity impacted UE, 5.1. Methodology
This between-subjects design took place at a British university; participation was part of students X  degree program prac-ticals. The teaching goal of the experiment was to given the students experience of both running and participating in an experiment. Thus, students were paired with one taking the part of experimenter and one of participant to use one website and then swapping roles and using a different website. There is a risk about the person who is experimenter first getting insight into the tasks before attempting them for themselves but as this was about individual engagement, there is only a small risk that knowledge of the tasks could lead to particular engagement with the websites chosen. Also, the study was a between participants design so that even having seen how to  X  X  X chieve X  X  the task on one website would be no indication of how to do the same thing on the other. Counterbalancing the websites used in the first and second portions of the class also ensured that if there were such an ordering bias, then it would not systematically affect the experimental conditions.
Participants were first-year computer science undergraduates who ranged in age from 18 to 30 (Median = 19). Ninety-eight students took part in the study but due to some not returning their data, the data from only 91 students is included in the analysis resulting in an uneven split of participants across conditions. Students ( M = 77; F = 14) were randomly assigned to one of two websites: BBC News (BBC) ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news )( n = 50) and International Herald Tribune (IHT) (http://global.nytimes.com/) ( n = 41).
 Familiarity, the independent variable, could be directly manipulated. We exploited the fact that this study took place in a
British University and therefore all students would be very familiar with the BBC both as an important national brand and as a politically impartial news provider. For an unfamiliar brand, any non-UK news source was likely to be less familiar, but there was a risk that other factors (e.g., degree of sensationalism) would influence UE irrespective of familiarity.
Therefore the less familiar news source was taken to be the IHT as an internationally relevant, impartial, authoritative, and English news source. This manipulation was successful: 40 people in the BBC condition and 29 in the IHT condition had used the BBC television news as a news source. Forty people in the BBC condition and 27 in the IHT condition also reported using the BBC Online for news. No one reported using the IHT online as a news source.

Students worked in pairs of participant and experimenter. Following informed consent, participants were given paper copies of the task scenario and questionnaire to complete as they worked through the study. Firstly, they responded to demographic questions. Next, they were given the simulated task scenario used in Study 1 and instructed to interact with either the BBC or IHT news website. Once 15 min elapsed, participants were prompted by the experimenter to bring the task to a close within the next five minutes. After 20 min, they were asked to stop. Following their interaction with the news website, they indicated their familiarity with the news source and noted details about the stories they selected as part of the task scenario, including their confidence in their knowledge of the news items they selected and their ability to discuss them with others. Lastly, they completed the UES. Only one ordering of the UES items was used for all participants.
Familiarity, confidence, and UE were all measured using a five-point Likert scale. Seven-point scales were not used here because the experimenter (second author) used the original description of the UES ( O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2010a ) when preparing the experiment. The experimenter took other observational measures, but these are not discussed here. Students then exchanged roles and the new participant used a different news source from the previous one. Students were not privy to the questionnaire items until they were in the experimenter role, but the procedure introduced some bias as the first experi-menter watched the other student  X  X  X esearcher X  X  interact with the website according to the task scenario. There was no immediate debriefing as this was kept until the end of the practical class. After both completed the experiment, they were asked to discuss the value of the UES and to note any issues arising with answering its items. 5.2. Results
All scales had good reliability in the BBC condition and generally good reliability in the IHT condition ( Table 3 ). The excep-tion to this was EN, which had a lower alpha than usually considered acceptable, but only marginally ( DeVellis, 2003 ); this was not a cause for concern given the modest sample size. AE showed very high alpha value, which may indicate redundancy in the subscale.

Next, inter-scale correlations were examined ( Table 4 ). Only overall correlations are reported because a broadly similar picture was seen for IHT and BBC. The AE and PUs scales were only moderately correlated with the other five subscales suggesting, they should emerge as distinct components. Strong correlations were observed between NO, FI and EN, and FA, NO, and FI, which may indicate overlap amongst these subscales.

The Kaiser X  X eyer X  X lkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO = 0.8) and Bartlett X  X  Test of Sphericity were significant ( x = 1951.62, df = 465, p = 0.000). The scree plot suggested five or six components. Individual item MSA values were above 0.6, and all but three (FA7, EN3 and PUs1) were above 0.7 indicating that each item was suitable for inclusion in the analysis.
In the initial six-factor solution, all items loaded on only five rotated factors. This may reflect the high degree of correla-tion amongst the subscales observed in Table 4 . A five-factor solution was then investigated. Factor loadings for the five factors are shown in Table 5 with loadings above 0.35 and below 0.35 highlighted in bold ( Kline, 2000 ). First, it should be noted that all but one subscale had at least one factor where all items strongly loaded on that factor confirming the coherence of each subscale, similarly to Study 1. The exception was EN, where EN3 loaded on a single factor. This item,  X  X  X his experience did not work out the way I planned, X  X  may not have been meaningful in the context of an undergraduate class, and it may be argued that participants did not have a particular plan for the session. In addition to the coherence of the subscales, three subscales loaded as a whole scale on only one factor: FA, AE and PUs. There were some cross-loadings with FA and PUs but the strongest loadings were primarily on the factor containing the whole subscale. FI and NO had strong cross-loadings each on three factors but it is encouraging to see that these load only as the whole subscale or not at all. This suggests that each scale is functioning as a single unit.

In summary, all subscales (with the exception of one EN item) showed internal coherence both in terms of statistical reliability and PCA. It seems reasonable to conclude that the subscales may be used as meaningful measures of UE with online news sources. 5.2.1. Comparison of UE between conditions
The primary manipulation was familiarity with the news source. Three questions (coded ordinally on a scale of 1 X 5) were used to measure the effectiveness of the familiarity manipulation. BBC was rated as more familiar or more used than the IHT, with the median rating for all three questions about the IHT being the lowest point on the scale. Mann X  X hitney tests confirm these differences ( Table 6 ).

We then turned to examining differences in UE between the conditions ( Table 7 ). AE and PUs showed clear differences between conditions. It is notable that PUs scores for both websites are high but the IHT was slightly lower and in fact showed negative skew (more low values) compared to the BBC. NO was marginally significant, suggesting that the BBC offered more novelty than IHT -despite being more familiar.

To further investigate the implications of news source familiarity, participants were asked to rate their confidence in their knowledge of the three stories they selected and in discussing them (on a 1 X 5 rating scale). The average knowledge confi-dence ratings and discussion confidence ratings were compared across conditions. The mean ( SD ) knowledge confidence in the BBC news stories was 4.0 (0.64) and in IHT news stories 4.0 (0.52) which was not significantly different, W = 989, p = 0.902. The mean ( SD ) discussion confidence in the BBC news stories was 3.7(0.66) and in IHT news stories 3.8 (0.55) which was also not significant, W = 889, p = 0.474. 5.3. Summary
Study 2 supports the use of the UES in the online news domain. All subscales worked coherently with the exception of a single EN item. Pre-PCA, EN had a low alpha value, but removal of EN3, which emerged as discrepant in the factor analysis, produced more acceptable values of 0.74 overall, 0.81 in the BBC condition, and 0.72 in the IHT condition. Reliability analysis suggested AE had a degree of redundancy. Further, significant correlations were observed between subscales, and there were several significant cross-loadings, especially amongst the NO, FI and EN, and FA, NO, and FI items. This is not surprising given previous research in gaming and web domains.
 Turning to the familiarity manipulation, the IHT was both less recognized and less used as a news source compared to
BBC. Interestingly, this did not result in disengagement with IHT. FA, FI and EN were comparable for both sites, suggesting that, regardless of familiarity, both delivered similar news reading experiences. This was also reflected in participants X  confidence ratings. In other words, there was no perceived disadvantage of using the less familiar news source in terms of finding interesting content.
 However, users perceived AE and PUs differently depending on the news source. This suggests that familiarity with the BBC led to a better appreciation of the aesthetics  X  though of course there are different aesthetic qualities of each news site. For instance, BBC is heavily weighted to an image for each story, but the IHT features more text and advertisements that may disrupt the reading experience. These differences may reflect the different traditions of television broadcasting versus newsprint that underpin the two websites. It would be worth investigating differences between these websites on purely aesthetic grounds, at least for UK-based samples. The difference in perceived usability may be due to substantial differences with the more familiar BBC offering an already understood interface where any minor usability issues were already overcome. Perceived novelty was higher for the BBC than IHT website, though only marginally significant. NO items pertain to curiosity and self-motivation to interact with news. This may be due to familiarity with the BBC, or even that the news is more likely to be relevant to a UK-based student than stories generally found in the IHT. This should be examined further, but does confirm study one X  X  findings about the importance of novelty in the news domain.

Overall, this study points to interesting differences in engagement between the two websites. Whilst these cannot be con-fidently attributed solely to differences in source familiarity, they are indicative of how familiarity might influence online news interactions. The study offers further support that the UES is able to identify useful differences between online sources in terms of how they influence the perceived engagement of people using those sources. 6. Study 3
Building on studies 1 and 2, we investigated the reliability and construct validity of the UES further, specifically its ability to detect differences between conditions. The overarching question guiding this research was whether the modality of inter-action with news content would influence users X  level of engagement.

Previous research has demonstrated that video is more engaging for people interacting with digital media ( Chapman et al., 1999 ), and that it may enhance users X  performance ( Jacques et al., 1995 ). However, multimedia may also interfere with and Jia (2014) , experimented with exploring the impact of interactive features on user engagement. They created conditions that enabled users to download, zoom in on, mouse over, or drag content, or use a 3D carousel within an online news maga-zine. In addition to detecting differences in user perceptions according to interaction techniques, they also found that some interactive modalities led to higher recall/pictorial recognition than others.

We tested four modalities: video, audio, transcript text and narrative text, to see whether the UES would detect differ-ences in UE according to the media condition to which participants were assigned. We hypothesized that video would be most engaging because it requires multi-sensory involvement; we also reasoned that transcript text would be least engaging engagement ( McCarthy &amp; Wright, 2004 ). We were uncertain as to where audio and narrative text would rank in terms of UE.
The narrative text might be favoured for its narrative presentation, since story is a useful tool for making sense of informa-tion. However, the popularity of audio content (e.g., audio books) may be familiar and therefore a more engaging medium for interacting with online news. Thus, medium of interaction should affect user engagement with online news content and produce perceptual differences sufficient to examine the construct validity of the UES. 6.1. Methodology
Participants ( n = 90) interacted with two news stories (within-subjects) from a North American news source in one of four formats (between-subjects): audio, video, transcript style text, and narrative style text. Stories were presented in counter-balanced order, and participants were randomly assigned to one of the format conditions. The topic of both stories was technology and they varied in length (6 min, 26 s or approximately 2100 words and 9 min, 54 s or approximately 3100 words).

Participants were an opportunity sample and were recruited using print and electronic signage posted around a univer-sity campus. We were unable to use data from seven of the participants due to technical issues with the experimental system. For example, the system did not assign two participants to task two in the same mode as task one; this introduced confounds into the results. There were also instances where the experimenter suspected a participant  X  X  X heated X  X  by returning to the stories to answer the comprehension questions. The experimenter noted these cases and we removed the data of these participants before our analysis. X  X 
Of the 83 valid respondents, the majority were female (61.4%; M = 34.9%) university students (85.5%; non-students = 12%) an undergraduate degree and 19 people (22.9%) had/were pursuing a Masters degree. All experimental materials were presented on a laptop with a 15-inch monitor. After initial briefing, the experimental system guided participants through the session. The first screen was the informed consent page, followed by a demographic questionnaire. This was followed by story 1 and story 2 (counterbalanced).

The stories were incorporated into the experimental system via a link to the news website; the set up used a frame to keep participants from leaving the system. Within the frame, each multimedia condition was presented on a white back-ground and the news provider X  X  logo was centred at the top of the page; scrolling was permitted for the two text conditions but not required for audio or video. The video condition consisted of a 10 15 cm (approximately) video window; the audio condition had a bar that showed the duration of the story, and one X  X  current location within this total timeframe. The transcript text showed was structured as follows:  X  X  X erson X: quote X  X  and each new speaker appeared on a new line. Lastly, the narrative text was derived from the text transcript. It was the same content, but transitions were made more fluid between the speakers. One still image from the video was included on the right hand side of the screen for this condition.
After viewing/reading/listening to each story, participants completed a questionnaire, which included the UES with a 7-pointLikertratingscale;theUEScontainedwordingappropriatetothemodetheparticipantwasassignedtointheexperiment. ence, whilethose in the audio and video had the terms  X  X  X isten X  X  X nd  X  X  X iew X  X  accordingly.They also responded to questions about the story to gauge their interest in the content, and to recall information they had viewed/listened to/read.

Lastly, participants were interviewed about the stories and their overall experience. At the conclusion, participants were thanked for their time and paid an honorarium. 6.2. Results The UES subscales were all internally consistent and significantly correlated ( Table 8 ). FI, EN and PUs showed excellent
Cronbach X  X  alpha values, while the alpha values of FA, AE, and NO were &gt;0.9, which may indicate some redundancy in these subscales. Correlations were particularly high amongst FI, FA, and NO, and between the FI, NO and EN. As in studies 1 and 2, this suggested overlap amongst subscale items.

The KMO (0.91) and Bartlett X  X  Test of Sphericity were significant ( x four or five components; MSA values for all items were between 0.8 and 0.95, with the exception of EN3 (0.64), which was also a problematic item in study 2. Based on the correlation matrix and scree plot, extraction was based on eigenvalues (&gt;1), rather than by number of factors, revealing a four-factor solution ( Table 9 ). The structure matrix shows significant cross-loadings of items on multiple components; however, four clear factors are observed: (1)  X  EN, FI, No (46.07% of the variance); (2)  X  PUs (9.61% of the variance); (3)  X  AE (7.2% of the variance); and (4)  X  FA (4.1% of the variance). EN3 loaded with PUs (as in Study 2), but otherwise FA, AE and PUs items loaded on distinct factors. (Shading is used to highlight items included on
Components 1, 2, 3 and 4; items that load below 0.35 are removed, and the highest item loadings appear in bold.) 6.2.1. Comparison of UE between multimedia conditions
The four factors that emerged above were used to examine differences between the experimental conditions to determine whether the UES would detect differences according to the media used to interact with news stories.

The one-way ANOVA ( Table 10 ) indicated significant differences in aesthetic perceptions across the four conditions [ F (3, 109) = 13.69, p = 0.000]. Post-hoc tests (Dunnett) showed that video was more aesthetically appealing than narrative text
This finding was not surprising, as the video contained many images and the narrative text had one image, whereas the audio and transcript text conditions had no visuals that depicted events in the stories. There were no differences for FA or
FI + EN + NO; PUs was marginally significant [ F (3, 93) = 2.45, p = 0.068], and video was perceived to be more usable than the transcript text condition ( p = 0.05).

Overall, video was rated more positively on all components of UES, and transcript text the least. Narrative and audio were comparable in terms of FA, but narrative was rated higher on AE and PUs, and FI + NO + EN was higher on average in the audio condition. This is of interest because the UES allowed us to examine more dimensions of the user experience and see that audio contributed to a more hedonic user experience, whereas narrative text received higher ratings on the system interaction aspects (PUs and AE) of the news interaction session. 7. General discussion 7.1. Implications for using the UES
We conducted three studies using the UES in the online news domain to examine its utility as a measure for discriminat-ing online news experiences. In terms of reliability, all three studies showed support for the internal consistency of the six subscales prior to PCA (with the exception of NO and FI in Study 1, though this may be due to the small sample size).
However, a four-(Study 3) or five-factor (Studies 1 and 2) solution emerged during PCA. AE, FA and PUs emerged as distinct factors in all studies. In study 1, NO emerged as one component, whereas in studies 2 and 3, it merged with FI and EN items to form one component. These latter findings support recent work that suggests a four-factor structure for the UES is more due to the fact that the items on the fourth factor gauge users X  level of interest, curiosity, and overall impression of the experience, etc.

Yet, given the fact that NO loaded separately on Component 5 in Study 1, we do not wish to discount it entirely in the context of online news experiences. The value of NO in news interactions was supported in the qualitative interview data collected as part of this study ( O X  X rien, 2011 ) and noted in the literature on news browsing behaviours ( Toms, 2000 ). We need to be cautious in the interpretation of Study 1 due to sample size. We recommend that researchers with adequate sam-ple sizes perform factor analysis before moving forward to look at the UES in relation to other variables. Researchers with less than adequate sample sizes should still examine the reliability and correlation analyses on all six subscales of the
UES. High correlations amongst subscales would suggest utilizing the UES as a four-factor experiential scale: PUs, FA, AE and EN/FI/NO.

Researchers should also consider whether to adopt the items EN3 and PUs8 for inclusion in experimental settings. These items worked well in the original e-commerce context where respondents were asked about a shopping experience that was except to complete the experimental session. With these exceptions, the other items worked well in the online news context.
We adopted the broader term  X  X  X xperience X  X  in our administration of the UES (e.g.,  X  X  X  felt in control of the experience. X  X ), and other times refer to the  X  X  X ask X  X  and  X  X  X ews website. X  X  Researchers should give consideration to the wording of the items in IR settings, and elect not to look at experience but the search task and system to get a more nuanced view of the interaction.
In studies with multiple search tasks, researchers must decide whether to administer the UES post-task or post-session, and the implications for these choices. Asking participants to complete a 31-item questionnaire can add  X  X  X ulk X  X  to the experimen-tal design, but only administering the UES post-session may not accurately reflect the user experience, where some tasks were more challenging, fun, learning intensive, etc. than others.

The accident that led to using two versions of the UES with 5-or 7-point Likert scales has actually shown that both ver-sions give broadly similar results. This suggests that either is equally valid and reliable which is generally consistent with scales with a reasonable number of items ( Cox, 1980 ).

The multidimensional nature of user engagement and the composition of the UES make it a more complex tool to opera-tionalize and score than a unidimensional scale, such as the System Usability Scale (SUS). The endurability, felt involvement, and novelty items pertain to the more pleasurable aspects of system use. As a result, one might ask,  X  X  X hy measure usability, aesthetics, or focused attention? X  X  Previous work has shown the inter-relationships amongst the factors, as well as their the UES as one of multiple measures in an IIR study, and examining the relationships between UE and other variables of interest related to task performance and success, interaction with the IR system, and individual difference variables. 7.2. Evaluation of the UES in online news
The UES showed some potential for discriminant validity in studies 2 and 3. That is, in situations where there was expected to be a difference in levels of engagement, the UES did show some differences. This is an important aspect of examining the validity of any questionnaire that it should to some extent reflect our expectations of how the concepts being measured behave ( Cairns, 2013; Kline, 2000 ). There is of course a need for caution here. If a questionnaire produces exactly the results expected then what insights can the questionnaire bring that our intuitions lack? Thus, discriminant validity should be demonstrated only where there is an expectation of what the differences should be in the hope that where we do not know what to expect, meaningful differences are revealed.

For the work here, the UES distinguished user experiences with a more (BBC) and less (IHT) familiar news source in study 2, and between format conditions in study 3. It is interesting to note that in both studies 2 and 3, AE and PUs were perceived differently depending on the between-subjects condition to which participants were assigned. Both of these subscales pertain to the appearance of the interface and users X  cognitive and affective perceptions of using the news websites.
Neither news source (study 2), nor format (study 3) significantly affected FI, EN, or FA. Participants may have had more posi-tive experiences overall with the content encountered, regardless of the site or mode they interacted with. This is supported by their confidence in their findings in news study 2 where there was no systematic difference between the two sources of news for the confidence participants felt in their findings.

The case for discriminant validity is therefore that the source or type of content does not itself influence engagement but rather the aesthetic and perceived usability aspects of engagement. This is consistent with our previous work, ( O X  X rien, 2011;
O X  X rien &amp; Lebow, 2013 ) where we suggested that the role of content should be further explored in the user experience, as UE has tended to focus on attributes of users and systems ( O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2008 ).

Nonetheless, both studies 2 and 3 show that looking at individual components of the UES, as opposed to calculating an overall score, is useful. For example, in studies 2 and 3, there were relationships between participants X  perceptions of the usability and aesthetics of the news sources according to their familiarity with the site (Study 2) and the modality through which they interacted with news (Study 3). An exploration of other variables, such as interest in the news content or user characteristics, may show differences in perceptions of the more hedonic (FA, NO, FI, and EN) components of the scale.
Sundar et al. (2014) , for instance, detected differences in the behaviours (one measure of user engagement) and content evaluations of  X  X  X ower users X  X  (designated as such based on their technology skills). Thus, isolating salient characteristics of users, content and systems that promote higher and lower levels of engagement may be an effective way of utilizing the multi-dimensional subscales of the UES. 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, we found evidence to support the reliability and construct validity of the UES across three studies conducted in the online news domain. While our PCA did not confirm the six-factor structure of O X  X rien and Toms X  (2010a) original work, we did find support for the internal consistency of items with the subscales, and for PUs, AE and
FA being stable factors. Our findings around the NO, FI and EN subscales is more perplexing: in Study 1 novelty emerged as a distinct factor, while in studies 2 and 3 it loaded with EN and FI items. Future work should look more closely at this particular finding to determine whether the problem lies in the expression of the item, or is a consequence of how the more hedonic components of experience are perceived ( O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2013 ).

In previous work we have asked,  X  X  X s there a universal measure of user engagement? X  X  We believe that the UES reliably captures the dimensions of user engagement in a range of contexts. Aesthetics, usability, and focused attention appear to be  X  X  X table X  X  dimensions of an engaged experience across various types of digital media, whereas felt involvement, novelty, and endurability are more variable in terms of whether they are  X  X  X tand alone X  X  factors. Nonetheless, with further investment and continued use and evaluation, the UES is a  X  X  X ood X  X  measure that can assist researchers in capturing the users X  perception of information interactions, and be used in mixed methods studies to help make sense of, for example, behavioural data.
