 In this paper, we propose a new method for collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems. Traditional CF-based recommendation algorithms have applie d constant settings such as a reference group (neighborhood) size and a significance level to all users. In this paper we deve lop a new method that identifies optimal personalized settings for each user and applies them to generating recommendations for i ndividual users. Personalized parameters are identified thr ough iterative simulations with  X  X raining X  and  X  X erification X  datasets. The method is compared with traditional  X  X onstant settin gs X  methods using Netflix data. The results show that the new method outperforms traditional, ordinary CF. Implications and futu re research directions are also discussed. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information search and retrieval  X  clustering, inform ation filtering. Algorithms, Performance Collaborative filtering, Personalization, Netflix Collaborative filtering (CF) has become a popular method for recommender systems [1-2]. CF, in a nutshell, is a method that finds a group of users or neighb ors who have similar preferences with the active user and generates recommendations based on those users X  ratings. There are several parameters of CF-based recommender systems that need to be set in order to generate recommendations. These parameters include the number of people in the neighbor group of a user (reference group size or neighborhood size), the required minimum number of common items to be included in the reference group (significance leve l), etc. Most current CF-based recommender systems identify a set of optimal settings for recommendation and apply the settings to the task of generating recommendations for all users [3-4]. active user [1]. There are two met hods to set reference group size  X   X  X est-N neighbors X  and  X  X hresholding X  [1, 3-4]. The best-N neighbors method takes the top N (a pre-determined number) neighbors as a reference group, those who have the highest correlations with the active user. The thresholding method selects as a reference group users who ha ve correlations higher than a certain pre-set value. Generally, the best-N neighbors method has higher coverage, while thresholdi ng is more accurate [1, 4]. Previous studies examined the e ffect of reference group size. For example, Herlocker et al. [4] fo und that there exis ts an optimal reference group size in a given ci rcumstance. Another study found that optimal reference group size va ries across domains [1], which implies that the differences in the characteristics of these data may cause differences in optim al reference group size. It has been shown that users X  rati ng patterns are quite diverse [11]. Because of this diversity, it is very likely that users have different optimal reference group sizes. Fo r example, users who have unique tastes about movies, such as cult movie lovers, will have only a small number of people who share this common interest. For those users, a small reference group will lead to better results. On the other hand, for those users who have more common tastes, a larger reference group will be preferable because a larger reference group will be less biased than smaller groups. If the optimal reference group size for each user can be identified, more accurate recommendations can be generated. One issue in determining who should be included in a reference group is the level of significance. Le vel of significance refers to the number of co-rated items on wh ich the similarity measure of two users is based [4]. For exampl e, suppose the similarity of two users was calculated using ten movies that they both rated. Then, this similarity measure would be more reliable (would have a higher significance level) than the similarity of two users who rated only three m ovies in common. CF-based recommender systems usually set a weight for significance level, and apply it to all users [4]. It is probable, however, that the effect of significance level may vary across users. For example, a higher sign ificance level w ould be better for users with volatile rating patterns because making predictions with a small number of co-rated items would be inaccurate for these users. On the other hand, for users having stable or plain rating patterns, a low significance level would be fine because their ratings are more predictable with a small number of co-rated items. Therefore, if the optimal confidence level (or optimal weight for it, if weights are applied instead of a cut-off point) can be obtained and applied for each user, it would improve the accuracy of recommendations. Users X  ratings may be affected by timing. Users who watch and rate a movie right after its rel ease rate it differently from those users who rate the movie long afte r its release. This is because movies just released have the  X  X ew movie X  effect, which includes the influence of the ads and the buzz around them. This effect will affect users X  ratings. Therefore, it is desirable to weight ratings according to timing. There is another issue related to rating timing. Users may have different levels of sensitivity about rating timing. For example, some users may be affected greatly by the  X  X ew movie X  effect, personalized reference group si ze for the user. The final personalized reference group size is then used to calculate predictions for the validation set (movie a in Figure 1) for the user. For the validation set, all rated movies for each user were selected one at a time and simulations were run. For example, if a user has rated 20 movies, 20 iterations of the simulation were carried out and the accuracy measures were averaged. The data used to evaluate the new method in this study is from the Netflix contest (http://www.netf lixprize.com/). The dataset contains ratings from a total of 480,189 users on 17,770 movies. The total number of ratings is 100,480,507 and the number of ratings per user is 209.3. Since the original Netflix dataset is too big to be handled on ordinary PCs, a sampled sub-data set was used in this study. A total of ten sub-datasets (5,000 users each) were randomly sampled. In order to check if those sample datasets were biased, basic statistics were compared. As Table 1 shows, the basic statistics of the sampled datasets are compatible with the original dataset in terms of number of ra tings and other characteristics. The ordinary CF in this study employed a common CF method. Pearson correlation was used as the similarity measure. For better accuracy, the  X  X ias-from-mean X  adjustment was employed. In the  X  X ias-from-mean X  adjustment, ratings are converted to  X  X eviations from mean X  before being used fo r predictions, and the generated predictions are re-converted to original rating scales [4]. Due to time constraints, we present only the results about personalized reference group sizes a nd level of confidence in this paper. (The effects of pers onalized rating timing are being examined at the time of writing.) The results are summarized in Table 2. For each sampled datase t, the accuracy of PS-CF was compared against that of ordinary CF. MAE (mean absolute error) and RMSE (root mean squared error) were used as the accuracy measures in this paper. In the ordinary CF, reference group sizes of 1 to 100 were applied and the one showing the best result was selected as the final reference group size. For example, in Sample 1 in Table 3, the reference group size of 15 shows the best result (MAE = 0.741, RMSE=0.897). The coverage of the PS-CF method is also compared with ordinary CF method in Table 4. The coverage of PS-CF is slightly lower than ordinary CF, but difference is not big. For a more rigorous comparison, a non-parametric statistical analysis was conducted for the RMSE measures. Since the results from the ordinary CF and PS-CF are paired by samples, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was empl oyed. The z statistics are significant at 0.01 level for both (ordinary CF  X  PS-CF with personalized neighbor size) a nd (PS-CF with personalized neighbor size  X  PS-CF with personalized neighbor size and personalized significance level) pairs. This paper presents PS-CF, a new method for CF-based recommender systems which utilizes personalized settings. Although only two parameters, neighbor size and level of confidence, were personalized, our test shows that the PS-CF method outperforms the traditional method that applies a global setting to all users. It is expected that the accuracy of CF will improve further if other paramete rs are personalized and PS-CF is combined with other methods. This study has several limitations due to the dataset and methodology used. First, the PS-CF method was tested using only one dataset, Netflix. Although Netflix is a commonly used dataset, the method needs to be tested using other datasets. Second, the PS-CF method can only be applied when users have rated a substantial number of items because it requires additional data to determine personalized settings. Third, the PS-CF method requires intensive computing comp ared to ordinary CF because additional simulations need to be run to determine personalized
