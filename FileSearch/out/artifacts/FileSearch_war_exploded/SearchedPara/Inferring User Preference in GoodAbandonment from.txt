 Search engines have a long history of using user behavior as implicit feedback to improve retrieval performance. Typically, it is effective and efficient to use clickthrough data as implicit feedback, with the assumption that clicked search results are commonly more relevant than non-clicked ones. But, a query may not always be followed by a click. User X  X  inactivity in Web search is called search/query abandonment which has been generally considered as a negative signal. Recent studies (e.g., [ 1 ]) report that search abandonment is sometimes a good thing, because user X  X  information need can be satisfied directly by the content of the search engine results page (SERP). Search abandonment in this kind of situation is defined by the notion of good abandonment [ 2 ]. Many stud-ies have investigated good abandonment [ 3 ][ 4 ][ 5 ][ 6 ][ 7 ][ 8 ], but only a few have addressed the issue of how good abandonment can be used for search engine improvement [ 1 ][ 5 ][ 7 ][ 8 ].
 can be seen as a next step after successfully identifying good abandonment. To achieve our goal, we propose to use eye-tracking technologies, assuming that user X  X  preference can be revealed by his/her eye movements on the SERP. 2.1 Eye-Tracking Experiment The experiment was conducted to capture user X  X  eye movements in good aban-donment search tasks. A task is considered as good abandonment when the infor-mation need can be directly satisfied by the content of the SERP. We designed ten tasks within the categories in [ 2 ], e.g., the definition of image processing. For each task, we carefully selected the keywords to avoid any Answer (a direct result for topics such as weather) showing up on SERPs, and to make sure the search results satisfying the search goal were not always in top positions. We recruited 30 university students (15 females) who were from a variety of disciplines, with an age range from 19 to 28 ( M =23 . 9, SD =2 . 0), and were familiar with Web search engines. Eye-tracking was performed using a Tobii T120 eye-tracker. Log-ging of click and eye movement data were done by the software Tobii Studio. For each participant, the experiment began with a practice. Following the practice there were the 10 search tasks. For each search task, a search engine portal with predefined keywords was shown on the screen. Participants read the keywords and clicked on the search button triggering the SERP to show up. Participants had to find the information within the SERP and click on a  X  X omplete X  button (a simulation of  X  X losing the browser X  [ 6 ]). After that, the closed SERP was shown again, and participants need to click on the search result in which he/she found the information to provide a preference feedback. 2.2 Data Transformation and Machine Learning Algorithms We transformed the raw eye movement data into histograms and sequences. A histogram is a fixed-length feature vector describing the distribution (location wise) of one participant X  X  eye movements in one search task. The histogram has three forms: total fixation count (TFC), total fixation duration (TFD), and TFC+TFD. That is, where c x and d x are the fixation count and fixation duration of search result (10 search results in each SERP), respectively. A sequence is an unfixed-length feature vector presenting one participant X  X  scan path in one search task. The sequence has two forms: fixation location (FL), and fixation location and fixation duration (FL+FD). That is, where l x and d x are the location and duration of fixation in light of its corresponding preference feedback. This makes the inference of user preference become a multi-class classification problem. We employed two machine learning algorithms for each data type: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) for histograms; and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Hidden-state Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) for sequences. From the eye-tracking experiment, we obtained usable eye movement data for 285 of the 300 tasks. Based on the distribution of participant X  X  preference feedback, a naive majority baseline (MB), assigning all instances to the class of highest frequency, resulted in an accuracy of 30.88%. Besides the MB, we created three criteria to infer user preference: most viewed (MOV), longest viewed (LOV), and last viewed (LAV). The MOV and LOV assume that the preferred search result is the most frequently viewed one, measuring by either fixation count (MOV) or fixation duration (LOV). The LAV assumes that the preferred search result is the last viewed one. We used the metric of accuracy to evaluation the inference of user preference, where Accuracy =(1  X  misclassifed all summarized in Table 1 . All machine learning algorithms and criteria outperform the MB baseline, and machine learning algorithms outperform criteria (except for HCRF which is worse than LAV). Besides, the performances of SVM and RF are better than HMM and HCRF, suggesting that the histogram is more suitable for inferring user preference than the sequence.
 instances. For example, clickthrough rate (CTR) is one of the most used features for search engine improvement. Traditionally, CTR is calculated by Impressions . Now we know which search result has satisfied user X  X  information need in good abandonment, we can create another CTR or a Good Abandonment CTR (GACTR) by taking inferred user preference into account: where Preferences is the number of inferred user preferences, and GoodAban-doments is the number of good abandonment instances. We believe that the proposed CTR features are more precise than the original one. But further stud-ies are needed to examine the impact of these new features. In this paper, we proposed an approach to infer user preference in good aban-donment based on eye movement data. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we discussed how to use the inference result to improve search engine performance by refining the CTR feature.
