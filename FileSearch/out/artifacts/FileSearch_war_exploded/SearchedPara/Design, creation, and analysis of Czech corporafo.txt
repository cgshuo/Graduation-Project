 J X chymKol X   X  Abstract Structural metadata extraction (MDE) research aims to develop techniques for automatic conversion of raw speech recognition output to forms that are more useful to humans and downstream automatic processes. The MDE anno-tation includes inserting boundaries of sentence-like units to the flow of speech, labeling non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers for optional removal, and identifying sections of disfluent speech. This paper describes design, creation, and analysis of data resources for structural MDE from spoken Czech. The annotation is based on the LDC X  X  MDE annotation standard for English, with changes applied to accommodate specific phenomena of Czech. In addition to the necessary language-dependent modifications, we further proposed and applied several language-independent modifications slightly refining the original annotation scheme. We created two Czech MDE speech corpora X  X ne in the domain of broadcast news and the other in the domain of broadcast conversations. Both cor-pora have already been published at LDC. The analysis section of this paper pre-sents a variety of statistics about fillers, edit disfluencies, and sentence-like units. The two Czech corpora are not only compared with each other, but also with statistics relating to the available English MDE corpora. We also report the statistics indicating that edit disfluencies have a different part of speech (POS) distribution in comparison with the overall POS distribution. The findings from the corpus analysis should help guide strategies for developing automatic MDE systems.
 Keywords Speech corpus  X  Structural metadata extraction  X  Speech disfluency  X  Filler  X  Slavic language 1 Introduction Speech corpora are important for training and testing automatic speech recognition and understanding systems. Standard corpora usually only contain audio recordings plus their time-aligned verbatim transcripts. However, the standard transcripts may often be insufficient since they lack important structural information. Raw streams of words do not convey complete information because the structural information beyond the words (metadata) is as important as the words themselves. This is especially important for disfluent spontaneous speech, which is no doubt more difficult for current speech processing systems than prepared speech (Goldwater et al. 2010 ). Note that annotating spontaneous utterance structure by simply making reference to standard punctuation is inadequate for a number of reasons. For example, there are no agreed-upon rules for punctuating faulty syntactic structures frequent in spontaneous speech, punctuation marks are often ambiguous (e.g., commas may indicate several different structural/syntactic events), and do not enable annotating speech disfluencies. Thus, a more complex annotation system is needed.

To better understand our motivation, take a look at the verbatim transcript of a spontaneous utterance in the following example:
The raw transcript is very difficult to read and understand. To this end, our goal is to produce a  X  X ich transcript X  that would contain much richer information than the raw stream of words. For example, the transcript becomes more readable if we label speech repairs and filler words, and divide the text into chunks approximately corresponding to sentences. Given this structural information, transcription can be  X  X leaned up X  for improved readability. The second version of our example illustrates how such a rich transcript might be formatted X  X peech reparanda are crossed out, fillers are displayed in italics, and each segment is delimited by a period: Several different annotation schemes have been proposed for similar tasks. Earliest efforts include the manual for disfluency tagging of the Switchboard corpus by Meeter ( 1995 ), the annotation scheme for the Trains dialog corpus by Heeman ( 1997 ), and the syntactic-prosodic labeling system for spontaneous speech called  X  X  X  presented by Batliner et al. ( 1998 ). The ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al. 2003 ) also contains annotation of disfluencies and dialog act boundaries, as described by Dhillon et al. ( 2004 ). Recently, Fitzgerald and Jelinek ( 2008 ) presented a new annotation scheme for spontaneous speech reconstruction, which has also been extended to Czech by Hajic  X  et al. ( 2008 ). Among related work on other Slavic languages, we can mention the paper about discourse marker annotation in spoken Slovenian by Verdonik et al. ( 2007 ).

For our work on spoken Czech, we have decided to adopt the approach introduced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) as part of the structural Metadata Extraction (MDE) research within the DARPA EARS program (Strassel et al. 2003 ). The MDE research aims to develop techniques for automatic conversion of raw speech recognition output to forms that are more useful both to humans (e.g., for easier reading of broadcast or medical transcripts), and to downstream automatic processes (e.g., machine translation, information extraction, speech summarization). The MDE-enriched transcripts contain boundaries of sentence-like units, labels for non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers for optional removal, and identification of sections of disfluent speech. Originally, the MDE annotation standard was defined for English by Strassel ( 2004 ). Later efforts have extended the guidelines for use with Mandarin and Arabic (Strassel et al. 2005 ), however, the first complete non-English MDE corpus was Czech (Kola  X  r  X  et al. 2005 ).

Czech belongs to the family of Slavic languages, which are highly inflectional and derivational, and thus have an extremely large number of distinct word forms. For example, the declension of Czech nouns has seven cases. Case, number (singular or plural), and gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) are usually distinguished by an inflectional ending; however, sometimes the inflection affects the word stem as well. In addition, colloquial Czech has a different morphology than standard Czech X  X refixes and endings are often changed in the former. Another typical feature of Czech is a relatively free word order. There is no particular fixed order for constituents marking subject, object, possessor, etc., however, the most frequent order is subject-verb-object. Pragmatic information and considerations of topic and focus also play an important role in determining word order X  X opic usually precedes focus. Czech is a good test bed for Slavic MDE because it is probably the most explored Slavic language for speech recognition research, mainly because of the recent MALACH project (Psutka et al. 2004 ; Ircing et al. 2009 ), but also because of other work, for example (Nouza et al. 2004 ; Praz  X  a  X  k et al. 2006 ; Mikolov et al. 2009 ). We believe that many conclusions from Czech will be applicable to other Slavic languages.
 This paper describes design, creation, and analysis of data resources for structural MDE from speech for Czech. We decided to create two corpora in two different domains: broadcast news (mostly prepared speech) and broadcast conversations (mostly spontaneous speech). The first corpus was created by enriching an existing Czech broadcast news corpus (Radova  X  et al. 2004 ) with structural metadata annotation, whereas the second had to be created from scratch (Kola  X  r  X  and S  X  vec 2009 ). The broadcast conversation genre was selected because of the easy data acquisition as well as for its increasing popularity in the speech processing community X  X ome of the current large research project, such as GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation), also focus on automatic translation of broadcast conversations (Zheng et al. 2008 ). Both Czech MDE corpora have been made publicly available. The broadcast conversation corpus was released by LDC as catalog numbers LDC2009S02 (audio) and LDC2009T20 (transcripts and structural metadata annotations) in July 2009. The audio for the broadcast news corpus has been available since 2004 (LDC2004S01), the MDE annotations for that corpus were released in January 2010 (LDC2010T02).
 and S  X  vec 2008 ). In contrast with the earlier publications, this paper contains a much more detailed description of the annotation method, analyses based on the latest versions of the corpora, and more discussion. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the audio data and standard transcripts, Sect. 3 presents MDE annotation guidelines and tools for Czech, Sect. 4 analyzes the corpora in terms of various MDE statistics, and Sect. 5 provides a summary and conclusions. 2 Audio data and transcripts 2.1 Broadcast news We used Czech broadcast news (BN) data from the Czech Broadcast News Corpus, which is publicly available from LDC (Radova  X  et al. 2004 ). The corpus is spanning the period February 1, 2000 through April 22, 2000. During that period, news broadcasts on 3 TV channels and 4 radio stations were recorded. The broadcast companies include both public and commercial subjects. Therefore, the corpus contains news broadcasts presented in different styles X  X anging from a very formal style typical for public radio companies to a more colloquial style typical for many commercial TV channels. The whole corpus contains over 60 h of audio recorded over the air, which yields almost 27 h 1 of pure transcribed speech from 284 talkers (188 males and 96 females). The signal is single channel, sampled at 22.05 kHz with 16-bit resolution. More numbers about the corpus are shown in Table 1 . The data were manually transcribed in the Transcriber tool (Barras et al. 2001 ) using a careful transcription approach. More details about corpus transcription are given in Psutka et al. ( 2001 ). 2.2 Broadcast conversations The broadcast conversation (BC) speech database contains recordings of a radio discussion program called Radioforum , which is broadcast by Czech Radio 1 (CRo1) every weekday evening. Radioforum is a live talk show where invited guests (most often politicians but also journalists, economists, teachers, soldiers, crime victims, and so on) spontaneously answer topical questions asked by one or two interviewers. The number of interviewees in a single program ranges from 1 to 3. Most frequently, one interviewer and two interviewees appear in a single show. The material includes passages of interactive dialog, but longer stretches of monolog-like speech slightly prevail. Because of the scope of the talk show, all speakers are adults. Although the corpus was recorded from a public radio where standard (literary) Czech would be expected, many speakers, especially those not used to talking on the radio, use colloquial language as well. Thus, standard and colloquial word forms are often mixed in a single sentence. The usage of colloquial language, however, is not as frequent as in unconstrained informal conversations.
The final release of the corpus contains 72 recordings acquired over the air during the period from February 12, 2003 through June 26, 2003. The signal is single channel, sampled at 22.05 kHz with 16-bit resolution. A typical duration of a single discussion is 33 X 35 min (shortened to 26 X 29 min after removing compact segments of telephonic questions asked by radio listeners, which were not transcribed). In total, the duration of the audio data is 40 h, which yields approximately 33 h of pure transcribed speech. The total number of speakers in the whole corpus is 128. Male speakers are more frequent than females (108 males, 20 females). As for the BN corpus, the recordings were manually transcribed in the Transcriber tool using the careful transcription approach, however, the transcription guidelines were slightly different. Some interesting numbers about the BC database are also shown in Table 1 . 3 Structural metadata annotation Structural metadata annotation can be viewed as a post-processing step applied to the standard transcription. It involves identification of a range of spontaneous speech phenomena (fillers and disfluencies) and insertion of sentence-like unit breakpoints (SUs) to the flow of speech. Annotators not only work with the verbatim transcripts, but also listen to audio and use prosody to resolve potential syntactic ambiguities.

When developing structural metadata annotation guidelines for Czech, we aimed to follow the original LDC guidelines for English as closely as possible. However, it would not be correct to simply translate and copy all conventions from one language to another. Individual rules must be adjusted to accommodate specific phenomena of the target language. The language-dependent modifications are mainly based on the description of syntax of Czech compound and complex sentences as given by Svoboda ( 1970 ), and Grepl and Karl X   X  k( 1998 ). The differences are more visible in annotation of SUs, annotation of fillers and disfluencies is less language-dependent.
This section is organized as follows: Sect. 3.1 describes annotation of sentence-like units, Sect. 3.2 annotation of fillers, and Sect. 3.3 annotation of edit disfluencies. Section 3.4 discusses some technical aspects of the MDE annotation, such as annotation tools and formats. 3.1 Sentence-like units (SUs) Dividing the stream of words into sentence-like units is a crucial component of the MDE annotation. The goal is to improve transcript readability and processability by presenting it in small coherent chunks rather than long unstructured turns. Because speakers often tend to use long compound sentences in spontaneous speaking, it is nearly impossible to identify the end-of-sentence boundaries with consistency using only a vague notion of a  X  X onversational equivalent X  of the  X  X ritten sentence X  definition X  X trict segmentation rules are necessary. Past experience with similar annotation problems has indicated that acceptable inter-annotator agreement (IAA) can only be achieved in the context of rules grounded in  X  X urface features X , i.e. mainly syntax and prosody. Semantic features have not proved to be reliable.
One possible solution to the  X  X onversational sentence X  definition problem is to divide the flow of speech into  X  X inimal meaningful units X  functioning to express one complete idea on the speaker X  X  part. It means that we divide the stream of words wherever it is grammatically possible and meaningful. The potential break point is the interword boundary right before the coordinating conjunction as shown in the following example.

The resulting units are either shorter or equally long as sentences in standard writing. These smaller units also seem to be convenient for downstream automatic processes. For example, speech translation applications usually prefer to process shorter segments (Hillard 2008 ).

The target utterance units are called SUs within the MDE task. In the MDE definition, the abbreviation SU may stand for one of the following possibilities: Sentential/Syntactic/Semantic/Slash Unit. Every word within the discourse is assigned to an SU (each word contained between two SU boundaries is considered part of the same SU), and all SUs are classified according to their function within the discourse. Besides a few exceptions mentioned in the text below, candidate locations for SU labels are usually boundaries between two adjacent clauses. The following list shows the SU symbols (breaks) along with brief descriptions of their meaning: /. Statement break X  X nd of a complete SU functioning as a declarative statement /? Question break X  X nd of an interrogative ( Do you like irises /? ) /, Clausal break X  X dentifies non-sentence clauses joined by subordination ( If it /&amp; Coordination break X  X dentifies coordination of either two dependent clauses /-Incomplete (arbitrarily abandoned) SU ( Because my father was born /~ Incomplete SU interrupted by another speaker ( A: Tell me about /~
Based on their function, the SU symbols may be divided into two categories: sentence-internal (/&amp; and /,) and sentence-external (others). Sentence-external breaks are fundamental and directly support the MDE research task. They are used to indicate the presence of a main (independent) clause. These independent main clauses can stand alone as a sentence and do not depend directly on the surrounding clauses for their meaning. The sentence-level breaks may also appear after a short phrase that nonetheless functions as a  X  X omplete X  sentence. In many cases, these breaks would be represented in standard writing with end-of-sentence punctuation. On the other hand, the sentence-internal breaks are secondary and have mainly been introduced to support IAA. These breaks delimit units that are smaller than a main clause and cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. In standard writing, they often correspond to commas.

In our work on Czech, we did not use the SU annotation in the same form as originally defined by Strassel ( 2004 ). The modifications we proposed and used may be divided into two groups: language-independent (slightly refining the original standard regardless of the target language) and language-dependent (motivated by differences between English and Czech). The following two subsections describe these two groups of modifications. In the following text, all illustrative examples are presented in Czech and then in English translations. Because of significant differences between Czech and English, it is often impossible to present a good verbatim translation X  X e tried to use English translations that best illustrate the linguistic phenomena of interest. Also note that SU symbols in all English translations are not displayed as based on the English MDE standard, but rather illustrate their placement with respect to the Czech guidelines. Furthermore, the examples do not contain standard punctuation but only SU symbols. 3.1.1 Language-independent modifications In comparison with the original set of SU symbols, we made two significant changes that are not language-dependent. First, while the original set contains only one symbol for incomplete SUs, we decided to distinguish two types of incomplete SUs: /-indicates that the speaker abandoned the SU arbitrary, while /  X  indicates that the speaker was interrupted by another speaker. This distinction of incomplete turns is useful since their patterns differ significantly in prosody, semantics, and syntax.
Furthermore, in order to identify some  X  X ore boundaries X  that could be both easier to detect by automatic systems using prosodic cues, and also relevant for spontaneous discourse analysis, we added two new symbols: //. and //? The double slashes indicate a strong prosodic marking on the SU boundary, i.e. pause, final lengthening and/or strong pitch fall/rise. The additional annotation refinements do not seem to cause a corresponding growth in annotation complexity. A rule of thumb instructs annotators to use the double-slash SU symbols when in doubt. Note that in contrast with ToBI-like systems (Silverman et al. 1992 ), our system only involves labeling prosodic boundaries at SU boundaries, rather than at all word boundaries, which is much less time-consuming. IAA on this annotation subtask is discussed in Sect. 4.1 below.
 to support IAA, the pause longer than 0.5 seconds automatically induces the end of a speaker turn and thereby requires a corresponding SU-external break. But the half-second threshold is problematic because some speakers produce long pauses in places where other speakers might produce filled pauses. Hence, we decided to drop the threshold rule and to rely solely on syntax. Likewise, we do not require the presence of a noticeable pause after incomplete (abandoned) SU breaks (/-) when syntax provides an overt evidence of incompleteness. 3.1.2 Language-dependent modifications Other modifications in the SU annotation for Czech are motivated by differences between Czech and English. Comparing Czech sentence structure with English, the most distinctive difference (beyond the relatively free word order) is the possibility of subject dropping. In English, subject dropping is only allowed in the second clause of a compound sentence when both clauses share the same subject; whereas in Czech, the subject (pronoun) can be dropped every time it is  X  X nderstood X  from context and/or from the form of a conjugated verb (predicate).

Thus, since the conjugation of the verb includes both person and number of the subject, it is possible to say for instance P X   X  u/ ., lit. (I am) writing/ . The phenomenon of subject dropping is typical for highly inflective languages. For this reason, subject dropping in the coordinated clause does not imply the use of the coordinating break (/&amp;) alone, as is the case for English. Instead, we separate the coordinated clauses with an SU-external break, even if the subject is present in the first clause and dropped in the second clause:
Another important fact influencing Czech MDE is that Czech syntax discriminates between compound sentences sharing a single common subject and simple sentences with compound predicates (i.e., compound predication in a simple sentence). The compound predicate is defined as a  X  X ight unit X  of two or more predicate verbs predicating on the same subject. On the other hand, if the predicate verbs do not form such a  X  X ight unit X , a compound sentence is recognized. Unfortunately, there is not absolute agreement in the literature on the exact borderline between compound predicates and compound sentences. For the purposes of MDE, we only recognize such compound predicates that can be identified based on unambiguous features. Thus, a compound predicate is recognized if: 1. The predicate verbs share a common constituent (e.g., object).
 2. The predicate verbs joined by a copulative conjunction have the same or very
While compound predicates did not motivate any SU breaks according to the initial version of the annotation guidelines, the current version instructs annotators to separate parts of compound predicates by the coordination break. A preliminary analysis showed that the redefined annotation rule supports IAA. Similarly, if the second clause of the compound sentence has an elliptical (dropped) predicate the clauses are separated by /&amp; as well.

The coordination symbol is also used when main clauses are joined by the syntactically primarily coordinating yet semantically often rather subordinating conjunction nebot  X  (lit. for ): there exists a subordinate clause depending on both main clauses or the compound sentence is structured with a non-continuous expression such as Not only ... , but also ... ).

We also adjusted some rules dealing with SU-internal breaks to reflect Czech syntax. For example unlike English, relative clauses are separated by clausal breaks in Czech MDE. This adjustment reflects Czech syntax which requires separating relative clauses by commas, regardless whether they are restrictive or not. If we did not use clausal breaks for relative clauses, the MDE transcripts would be less transparent for the annotators.
 3.2 Fillers Fillers are words, short phrases, or non-verbal sounds that do not alter the propositional content of the utterance in which they are inserted. Their characteristic feature is that they do not depend on identities of surrounding words. In general, fillers are those parts of the utterance that may be removed from its transcript without losing any  X  X mportant X  piece of information. Four types of fillers are distinguished within the MDE annotation system:  X  Filled Pauses (FP),  X  Discourse Markers (DM),  X  Explicit Editing Terms (EET),  X  Asides/Parentheticals (A/P).

Annotating fillers consists of identifying the filler words and assigning them an appropriate label. 3.2.1 Filled pauses FP is a non-verbal hesitation sound produced by a speaker (either intentionally or not) to indicate uncertainty or to keep control of a conversation while thinking what to say next. In general, FPs can appear anywhere in the flow of speech. They make no contribution to the semantic proposition of the utterance. Thus, FPs should not be confused with certain interjections that function to express agreement or disagree-ment, or backchannels (such as English uh-huh ). An important (and also very interesting) fact about FPs is that they vary across languages. For instance, FPs in American English are known as uh and um , while Japanese speakers use ahh, ano ,or eto , and French talkers most frequently vocalize a sound similar to euh (Erard 2004 ). Up to the present day, no thorough linguistic study on FPs has been conducted for Czech. Consequently, there is no general agreement on how to transcribe them X  X heir transcription differs corpus to corpus. For instance, Kaderka and Svobodova  X  ( 2006 ) proposed to distinguish six FPs ( e, ee, eee, eh, ehm, em ). The first three FPs from this list differ only in length, while the other three differ in phonetic makeup. We decided to distinguish a smaller number of FP categories. When developing transcription rules for FPs, one must be aware of the fact that there is always a trade off relation between transcription accuracy and consistency. If we choose too many categories, annotators will not be consistent in their recognition. On the other hand, too broad categories might cluster wholly different FPs (both phonetically and functionally). Based on the experience learned from listening to a large number of spontaneous Czech recordings, we decided to distinguish the following two FP categories:  X  EE  X  X his FP category is most typically represented by sounds similar to Czech  X  MM  X  X his FP category contains all hesitation sounds that are phonetically more
In actual speaking, EEs are significantly more frequent than MMs . Experience with annotation of the spontaneous speech corpus presented herein indicates that these two categories very well cover a vast majority of all FPs. The only problematic case in terms of our FP transcription approach is the sound similar to emm . In such FPs, vowel-like and consonant-like component immediately follow each other. Since such FPs are really rare in spontaneous Czech, we decided not to introduce a special category for them. When both FP components are strong, the FP is transcribed using both symbols, one after another. An example of an FP-annotated utterance follows.
Because we did not allow annotators to transcribe FPs using other words or symbols than EE and MM , the MDE annotation of FPs was in principle performed during the verbatim transcription stage. However, the annotators in the MDE annotation stage had the right to insert or change FP symbols. Note that this approach to annotating FPs was only used for the BC corpus. The verbatim transcripts of the BN corpus were created earlier using an FP annotation based on different guidelines that paid only little attention to distinction of FP categories. 3.2.2 Discourse markers DMs are words or phrases that function primarily as structuring elements of spoken language. They do not carry separate meaning, but signal events such as a change of speaker, taking or holding control of the floor, giving up the floor, or beginning of a new topic. There exist a number of diverse definitions of DMs in the linguistic literature. Within MDE, we are only interested in such DMs whose presence in the utterance is unnecessary and whose cleanup do not lead to loss of  X  X mportant X  not receive DM labels. An example of DM annotation follows.
 Tak j X  jako nev X m / .
 So I like don  X  t know / .
 For any language, it is not possible to create a closed list of all possible DMs. The use of DMs is dependent on a dialectal variation and rhetorical style of a particular talker. The list of popular Czech DMs includes: dob  X  e (well), jako (like), jaksi (somehow), no (well), pod X vejte se (you see), prost  X  (simply), tak (so), tak  X  e (thus), tedy (then), v X te (you know), v X te co (you know what), vlastn  X  (actually), v podstat  X  (basically) . Some of the frequent DMs also have other literal meanings, which sometimes makes DM identification more difficult. For example, it is often difficult to decide whether the word tak  X  e serves as a DM or not. When annotating instances of this word, one must analyze whether the speaker intended to express relation to his/her preceding proposition, or to mark a discourse boundary. Another ambiguous word is jako , as illustrated in the following example. In the first sentence, it expresses a comparison, while in the second, it functions as a DM.
 It is like nothing unusual / .

Besides general DMs, the MDE annotation system also recognizes a DM subtype  X  X iscourse Response (DR). DRs are DMs that are employed to express an active response to what another speaker said, in addition to mark the discourse structure. For instance, a speaker may also initiate his/her attempt to take the floor. DRs typically occur turn-initially, but should not be confused with direct answers to questions. An example of a DR follows.
 B: Hele j X  si t X m nejsem jistej / .

B: Look I  X  m not sure about it / . 3.2.3 Asides/parentheticals Asides and parentheticals occur when the speaker utters a short side comment and then returns to the original sentence pattern. Asides are comments on a new topic, while parentheticals are on the same topic as the main part of the utterance. For annotation purposes, asides and parentheticals are not distinguished but treated as a single filler category. A/Ps are often prosodically marked; speakers usually pause or shift their intonation. Strictly speaking, A/Ps are not fillers, but because as with other filler types, annotators must identify the full span of text functioning as an A/P, they are included with fillers in the MDE guidelines. An example of an A/P follows.
In line with the English guidelines, some very common Czech words or short phrases that can be denoted as  X  X exicalized parentheticals X  (e.g.,  X  ekn  X  me (say) , mysl X m (I think) ) are not annotated as A/Ps. They usually lack the prosodic features that typically accompany A/Ps. In order to ensure high IAA, an illustrative list of the  X  X exicalized parentheticals X  was prepared. In addition, the maximal allowed length of a lexicalized parenthetical was limited to two words. 3.2.4 Explicit editing terms Another type of fillers, EET, may only occur accompanying an edit disfluency. EETs are explicit expressions by which speakers signal that they are aware of the existence of the disfluency on their part. In principle, they can appear anywhere within the disfluency, but most frequently occur right after the end of the reparandum. EETs are rather rare in actual conversational language. Typical Czech EETs include nebo (or),  X  i (or), sp X   X  e (rather), vlastn  X  (actually) . An example of EET is shown in the following subsection as part of the edit disfluency example. 3.3 Edit disfluencies Edit disfluencies are portions of speech in which a speaker corrects or alters his/her utterance, or abandons it entirely. Within MDE, disfluency phases are referred to as Deletable Region (DelReg, speaker X  X  initial attempt to formulate an utterance that later gets corrected), interruption point (IP, the point at which the speaker breaks off the DelReg with an EET, repetition, revision or restart), optional EET (an overt statement from the speaker recognizing the existence of a disfluency), and correction (portion of speech in which the speaker corrects or alters the DelReg). Whereas corrections were not explicitly tagged within the English MDE project, we decided to label them in order to obtain relevant data for further research of spontaneous speech. Their labeling is not very time consuming and the data may be very useful  X  they may enable automatic systems to learn typical correction patterns. An example of an edit disfluency follows. The following notation is used: DelRegs are displayed within square brackets, IPs are marked by *, EETs are typed in italics, and corrections are underlined.

Nested disfluencies (some component of the disfluency is disfluent itself) are more difficult to annotate. To keep annotation as simple as possible, the MDE standard does not allow using nested disfluency labels, so that all nested disfluencies must be annotated using just simple, non-nested DelRegs. The following example shows a correction that contains an additional disfluency:
Since Czech disfluencies have the same patterns as English, the rules about complex disfluencies from the English guidelines can basically be directly applied to Czech. Thus, we do not list all particular rules for annotating complex disfluencies herein because interested readers may consult the original MDE guidelines. 3.4 Technical aspects of MDE annotation The two Czech MDE corpora were annotated only by two annotators. Since Czech syntax is quite complex, na X   X  ve annotators could not be employed; at least some linguistic education is necessary, and such annotators were quite difficult to find. The small number of labelers slowed down the annotation process, but on the other hand, it supported annotation consistency. The submitted annotations were checked by a senior annotator. The MDE annotations of the easier BN corpus were checked on the basis of a random sample, while for the more difficult BC data, all submitted annotations were carefully revised.
 To ease the annotation process, a new annotation software called QAn (Quick Annotator) has been developed (Kola  X  r  X  and S  X  vec 2009 ). It has been designed to reflect the particulars of the Czech annotation task. As with the LDC X  X  MDE Annotation Toolkit (Maeda and Strassel 2004 ), the Czech tool allows annotators to highlight relevant spans of text, play corresponding audio segments, and then record annotation decisions. The screen of this tool is shown in Fig. 1 . The screenshot also serves as an example of a longer stretch of MDE-annotated Czech data. The tool can be freely downloaded from the project website http://www.mde.zcu.cz/ .
In the corpus release, the structural annotations are provided in two different formats. The first is the format used by QAn. It is based on the XML-based Transcriber format, which is extended by special tags representing structural metadata information. The format uses two types of metadata tags: SUs associated with interword boundaries, and Labels spanning over one or more words (i.e., these are begin/end pairs).

The second format is RTTM. It is based on the RTTM-format-v13 specification that was used for storing MDE annotations in the EARS project. The format uses object-oriented representation of the rich text data. There are four general object categories to be represented: speech-to-text objects, MDE objects, source (speaker) objects, and structural objects. Except for the speaker information object, each object exhibits a temporal extent with a beginning time and duration. The duration of interruption points and clausal boundaries is zero by definition. The objects are represented individually, one object per record, using a flat record format with object attributes stored in white-space separated fields. 4 Analysis of structural metadata annotation This section presents and discusses some interesting statistics about structural metadata in the two Czech MDE-annotated corpora. The first subsection presents inter-annotator agreement on the Czech MDE annotation task, the following three subsections report numbers and statistics relating to fillers, disfluencies, and SUs, respectively. The MDE statistics are compared with corresponding statistics relating to the English MDE corpora released by LDC (Walker et al. 2005 ). The Czech BN corpus is compared with the English BN MDE corpus, and the BC corpus with the English Conversational Telephone Speech (CTS) corpus; unfortunately, there is no available MDE-annotated English BC corpus. Therefore, quite a good match is expected for BN data, but when comparing Czech broadcast conversations with English telephone speech, one must also take into account significant differences in the speaking styles. Broadcast conversations are more formal and less interactive than CTS. The English statistics referred herein were taken from (Liu et al. 2006 ; Liu 2004 ). However, note that not all English numbers we needed for a complete comparison with our Czech data have been available. For easier reading, the most important English statistics are summarized in Table 2 . Individual cross-lingual comparisons are presented in text in the corresponding subsections below. 4.1 Inter-annotator agreement on MDE annotation To measure annotation reliability in terms of inter-annotator agreement (IAA), we used the K (kappa) statistic (Carletta 1996 ), which is considered to be a standard measure of agreement in many annotation tasks related to language processing. The measure is defined as where A o denotes the observed (i.e., measured in the test data) agreement and A e the expected agreement (i.e., based on label priors). The interpretation of K is not completely straightforward. In the original paper presenting this measure, Carletta claims that for tasks like content analysis, K [ 0.8 is considered to be good reliability, and 0.67 \ K \ 0.8 allows to draw tentative conclusions.

For Czech MDE, we tested IAA on three recordings from the more difficult BC corpus. These recordings were dually-annotated by two experienced annotators. The total duration of the compared recordings was 86 minutes, the total number of words was 13k. All MDE annotations from the test sample were created by the two annotators who annotated whole corpora, so the test should very well reflect the real annotation consistency. For SU breaks, we got K = 0.88 taking into account all SU types (both internal and external). For the key task annotation X  X  X U-boundary X  versus  X  X o SU-boundary X  X  X e got K = 0.92. For filler and disfluency labels, we got overall K = 0.85. Given the complexity of this annotation task, these numbers seem to be very good. Unfortunately, we could not compare our IAA with IAA for the English MDE corpora since the numbers for English are not publicly available.
We also measured IAA for the additional Czech MDE annotation subtask X  labeling of prosodic strength of SU boundaries. Measuring IAA on  X  /. vs. //.  X  on the same dually-annotated recordings, the following consistency values were obtained. If the two annotators agreed on using a statement break after a particular word, they also used the identical symbol (/. or //.) in 86.9% of the cases. In terms of the K statistics, we got K = 0.69 when only taking into account the words followed by a statement break (i.e. ignoring all words with no statement label). For comparison, for  X  /. vs. //. vs. other X , we obtained K = 0.85. 4.2 Statistics about SUs Relative frequencies of all SU symbols (both SU-external and SU internal) are displayed in Table 3 . This table shows that both corpora significantly differ in their SU symbol distributions. The symbol  X /, X  is most frequent in the BC corpus, whereas  X //. X  is strongly dominant in the BN corpus. This indicates that complex and compound sentences are more common in spontaneous conversations, while prearranged broadcast news typically consist of statements with simpler clause syntax. Further substantial findings relate to differences between relative frequen-cies of single-and double-slash SU-symbols. Overall, the double-slash symbols are more frequent. The contrast is more distinctive in BN data, where  X //. X  is almost ten times more frequent than  X /. X  This fact is not surprising since sentence boundaries are usually attentively prosodically marked by professional newscasters. In the BC corpus,  X //. X  is approximately twice as frequent as  X /. X . The statistics about incomplete SUs indicate that incompletes are much more common in conversational speech. Furthermore, incomplete SUs interrupted by another speaker (/  X  ) are more frequent than arbitrarily abandoned statements (/ X ). The latter type of incompletes almost never appears in broadcast news.
 Table 4 shows average lengths of particular SU subtypes for both Czech corpora. For SU-external symbols, the SU length is defined as the number of words before the SU-external symbol up to the previous SU-external symbol. For SU-internal symbols, it is defined as the number of words before the SU-internal symbol up to the preceding SU-internal or SU-external symbol, whichever occurs first. The numbers in the table indicate several interesting findings. First, statement SUs are longer than interrogative SUs. Furthermore, double slash SUs (i.e., SUs with a strong prosodic marking at their boundaries) are significantly longer than corresponding single-slash SUs. Note that the difference in length is more prominent in the BN data. Table 4 also presents overall average lengths of all, complete, and incomplete SUs. The numbers indicate that SUs in the conversational corpus are slightly longer. For comparison, the English CTS corpus has mean SU length 7.0 words and the English BN corpus 12.5 words. The average SU length for broadcast news corpora is similar for both languages, whereas the average SU length in the compared spontaneous corpora strongly differs. The average segment length in conversational data is largely affected by the number of backchannels. There is a large number of short backchannel SUs in the English telephone corpus, while backchannel SUs are not taken into account for the single-channel Czech BC corpus. 4.3 Statistics about fillers The top part of Table 5 reports numbers relating to occurrences of FPs. As expected, FPs are significantly more frequent in conversational than in broadcast news speech. Another important observation is that EEs are much more frequent than MMs  X  they represent almost 90% of all FPs. This comparison is only available for the BC corpus since the Czech BN corpus used different rules for transcription of FPs (cf. Sect. 3.2.1 ). For comparison, 1.4% of words are FPs in the English BN corpus, and 2.9% in the English CTS corpus. A relatively smaller number of FPs in the English CTS data than in the Czech BC data might be explained by three different hypotheses. First, transcribers of the English database could have missed a number of FPs since some of them are less audible and telephone data are noisier than BC. Second, the Czech language is more complex than English, which may cause a higher number of hesitations. Third, talkers may hesitate by voice more when speaking in public. In private conversations, people often do not care that much about being grammatically correct, which makes speech planning easier. On the other hand, the larger percentage of FPs in English BN is caused by the fact that these data contain a larger proportion of speech having a relatively higher level of spontaneity. Commercial TVs and radios are in minority in the Czech BN corpus, and broadcast news on Czech public radio and TV channels have significantly less interactive style than American broadcast news.

The bottom part of Table 5 shows numbers of words labeled as DMs or DRs. As with FPs, this type of fillers is more common in conversational speech X  X ust 0.1% of words is labeled as a DM or a DR in the BN data. One interesting statistic to observe is the proportion of DMs and DRs. In the BC corpus,  X  X on-DR X  DMs prevail, whereas the DR subtype covers over 53% of all DMs in the BN corpus. The explanation for this observation may be the following. DMs are not frequently used by anchors in the studio, but they are quite typical for local reporters referring on actual events directly from their venues. These reporters typically react on questions coming from the studio and their interactive replies contain a number of DRs. Furthermore, we observed that the English MDE corpora contain a higher number of DMs than Czech data X 0.5% in BN and 4.4% in CTS.

Table 6 shows five most frequent DMs in the Czech data. The most frequent DM was tak (so) followed by no (well) and prost  X  (simply). The DM tak was first in both corpora (but more dominant in the BN corpus), while no came second in the BN corpus, and prost  X  came second in the BC corpus. Note that all frequent DMs consist of just one word. The table indicates that most significant difference are in DMs as prost  X  , vlastn  X  (actually) , and jaksi (somehow) , which are more frequent in the BC corpus. The reason is that DMs of the DR subtype prevail in the BN corpus, while the three mentioned DMs typically occur as turn-internal. Another interesting observation is that DMs containing a verb are much less frequent in Czech than in English. Although there exist some Czech equivalents of the popular English DM you know (such as v X te which ranked 16th), only a minority of Czech speakers use them.

Table 7 displays frequencies and average lengths of A/Ps and EETs. A/Ps are relatively frequent in the BC corpus, containing 1.5% of all uttered words. On the other hand, A/Ps are quite rare in planned speech; they cover just 0.2% of words in BN. For comparison, English CTS data have only 0.3% of words in A/Ps, which supports the hypothesis that A/Ps are more frequent in conversational Czech than in conversational English. The statistics also indicate that A/Ps in conversational speech are on average longer.

As expected, EETs were found to be really rare. In total, they include just 0.01% of words in the BN data and 0.08% in the BC data and. These numbers are similar to those for the English MDE corpora, where EETs contain 0.02 and 0.05% of words, respectively. Since the average length of an EET is 1.1 words for both Czech corpora, it is possible to ratiocinate that one word EETs are strongly dominant. Table 8 shows the most frequent Czech EETs. For both corpora, we can observe that by far the most frequent EET is nebo (or) ; it represents more than two thirds of all EET instances. The second most frequent EET is respektive (lit. respectively or let  X  s say ).

The total proportions of filler words (i.e. sum of all FPs, DMs, A/Ps, and EETs) significantly differ between the two Czech corpora. While they represent just 0.8% of all words in the BN corpus, they cover 7.9% of words in the spontaneous BC corpus. For English MDE corpora, the total filler percentage is 2.1% for BN and 9.2% for CTS. 4.4 Statistics about edit disfluencies Statistics relating to edit disfluencies are presented in Table 9 . As with fillers, disfluencies were much more frequent in the conversation corpus, where 2.9% of words were labeled as within a DelReg. The corresponding percentage in BN was just 0.3%. Likewise, edit IPs were ten times more frequent in the BC corpus than in the BN corpus. In the comparable English corpora, edit disfluencies were more frequent. DelRegs covered 1.7% of words in English BN and 8.5% in CTS. Again, the explanation for this is in the different speaking styles.

Further interesting numbers refer to occurrences of corrections and EETs within edit disfluencies. The proportion of DelRegs having a correction is dependent on the frequency of restart disfluencies since this disfluency type does not contain a correction. Because restarts are typical for spontaneous speech, the relative number of DelRegs having corrections is accordingly smaller in the BC corpus. We also observed that EETs were very rare in both corpora. Only approximately 4% of all disfluencies contain an EET. The next statistics in Table 9 show average lengths of DelRegs and their corrections. It is possible to see that short disfluencies predominate; their average length is around 1.5 word in both corpora. Another interesting observation that should be pointed out is that corrections have almost the same average length as DelRegs.

Furthermore, interesting statistics are those referring to the total portion of data marked for the potential automatic cleanup. This number is obviously correlated with the complexity of the MDE task for a particular corpus. Hence, we summed words in DelRegs and fillers and compared the two Czech MDE corpora. As expected, the results were largely unequal X  X ust 1.1% for the BN corpus, while 10.8% for the BC corpus. For comparison, it was 3.8% for the English BN corpus and 17.7% for the English CTS corpus.

We also analyzed DelRegs and corrections in terms of which parts of speech (POS) they typically contain. To our best knowledge, this is the first analysis studying the POS content of speech disfluencies in any language. Both Czech corpora were tagged using a state-of-the-art automatic POS tagger trained on newspaper data (Spoustova  X  et al. 2007 ). Tagging accuracy could not be measured because we did not have any reference POS annotation for our speech corpora. However, note that in our analysis, we only used the first position of the PDT positional tags, which are typically used for Czech (Hajic  X  et al. 2006). The first position only distinguishes 10 basic POS categories, for which a very good tagging accuracy is expected. Then, for either Czech corpus, we computed three POS distributions corresponding to the whole corpus, DelRegs, and corrections, respectively.

The relative frequencies of particular POS categories are shown in Fig. 2 . The top chart represents the BN corpus, the bottom chart the BC corpus. The POS categories on the x -axis are sorted according to their frequencies in the BC corpus. The blue bars show that the corpora differ in overall POS distributions. The BN corpus contains significantly more nouns and adjectives, while the conversational corpus shows distinctively higher relative numbers of pronouns, adverbs, and conjunctions, and a slightly higher proportion of verbs. These observations may be clarified by differences in speaking styles. The BN data consist of sentences that were prepared to be as informative as possible, and thus contain a lot of nouns and adjectives. On the other hand, conversational language is characterized by a more complex way of locution. A higher number of complex and compound sentences logically implies a higher number of conjunctions, and numerous discourse markers having the form of an adverb cause the higher proportion of adverbs.

Despite the differences in the overall POS distributions, both corpora show similar changes in the distributions when only POS in DelRegs are displayed. The proportion of nouns, pronouns, and prepositions is increased, while verbs, adverbs, and adjectives are less frequent in comparison with the general distribution. The increased number of nouns in DelRegs is logical. Speech disfluencies more frequently occur in more informative utterance regions, and nouns usually carry information more densely than, for instance, verbs. The higher frequency of prepositions is consequent because prepositions are dependent on nouns. Interesting variances may also be observed between DelRegs and their corrections. The most prominent difference is in the higher rate of adjectives within corrections. This fact indicates that speakers often put in the adjectives omitted in DelRegs. We can also observe slightly higher frequencies of verbs and adverbs. On the contrary, nouns and conjunctions are less frequent in corrections than in DelRegs. 5 Summary and conclusions In this paper, we have described the creation of two Czech speech corpora annotated with structural metadata X  X ne in the domain of broadcast news and the other in the domain of broadcast conversations. The structural metadata annotation is based on the LDC X  X  MDE annotation standard, originally defined for English. The original guidelines were adjusted to accommodate particulars of Czech syntax. In addition to the necessary language-dependent modifications, we applied some language-independent modifications refining the original annotation scheme. The refinements included limited prosodic labeling at SU boundaries, distinction of two types of incomplete units, and annotation of corrections of edit disfluencies. Moreover, we proposed and used a novel approach to transcribing filled pauses in Czech, distinguishing vowel-like and consonant-like sounds. Importantly, the inter-annotator agreement measures showed that we achieved good annotation consis-tency. We believe that our experience with porting the annotation guidelines to a new language will help researchers who work on other languages.

Furthermore, we have presented a comparison of Czech broadcast news and broadcast conversations in terms of MDE statistics relating to SUs, fillers, and edit disfluencies. The comparison is useful for evaluating complexity of the MDE task in the two genres. Among others, the comparison showed that the total proportion of filler words (i.e., the sum of all FPs, DMs, A/Ps, and EETs) is significantly higher in the BC corpus (7.9% of words) than in the BN corpus (0.8%). Likewise, edit disfluencies are much more frequent in the BC corpus (2.9% of words within DelRegs in BC and 0.3% in BN). We also found that DelRegs and their corrections show differences in POS distributions in comparison with the general POS distribution. For example, DelRegs show a higher percentage of nouns. This observation can be explained by the fact that disfluencies more frequently occur in more informative utterance regions, and nouns usually carry information more densely than, for instance, verbs. Regarding SU symbols, we found that clausal breaks are more frequent in the BC corpus, which indicates that complex sentences are more common in talk shows than in broadcast news. Furthermore, we found that SUs in the conversational broadcast data are on average slightly longer than SUs in broadcast news. Overall, the findings from this study should help guide strategies for automatic MDE across genres in future work.

Both Czech MDE corpora described in this paper have been made publicly available via LDC. We hope that the corpora will be of great benefit for the spoken language processing community. First results evaluating automatic MDE and Liu 2010 ), reporting experiments with automatic SU boundary detection. However, the impact of Czech MDE on downstream language processing applications has not yet been evaluated. The two new MDE corpora should also be useful for training standard speech and speaker recognition systems as well as for linguistic analysis of prepared and spontaneous Czech speech. We also believe that the conclusions from Czech will be largely applicable to other Slavic languages, and possibly also partly to other languages with rich morphology and fluid word order.
