 In the information age, Internet-based recruiting platforms become increasingly crucial as the recruitment channel[ 1 ]. Normally, human resources department can receive numerous resumes from job seekers everyday. It is an extra work for them to record these resume data into database. Meanwhile, job seekers may use diverse resume formats and varying typesetting to gain more attention. As a result, most of the resumes are not written in accordance with a standard format or a specific template file. Although unique writing format can bring a better experience for reader, it X  X  really harmful to data mining and candidates searching system. They can decrease the success rate of recommending recruits who meet the employer X  X  requirements perfectly, and on the contrary, may bring some data noise. Thus, it is important to extract the valuable information of each resume.
 In the field of web data extraction, most of the proposed research methods have focused on how to extract the main content from news web pages. Compared to news web page, resumes have some other unique properties. First, different people have different writing style for personal resume, but the content are all the same items including their personal information, including contacts, educations, work experiences etc. Second, in the same module of one resume, the writing style is shared among different items. In other words, resumes share the document-level hierarchical contextual structure[ 4 ], because items in one module sharing the same writing style can make the whole resume more comfortable. Above all, resumes can be segmented into several groups, and knowledge can be identified based on the text classifier constructed with the major elements of each resume. knowledge from resumes without the limit of file types and too much human efforts to label data. Different with previous research, we construct the knowledge extraction frame-work based on text classifier for resumes with two steps, which are semi-structured information extraction step and detailed information identification step. The detail of our approach are described as follows. 2.1 Pipeline of Resume Knowledge Extraction Framework The pipeline of our framework for resume knowledge extraction without the text format information for building a structured resume repository with an example is presented in Fig. 1 .
 First, the input of the framework is raw text, which is parsed from the origin resume files. Tika 1 is used to get the pure text content and styles are removed from the files including table cells, font styles, images etc.
 Second, each line of the text is segmented into phrase and a basic text clas-sifier is used to predict the label, such as university, date, number etc. With the help of phrase classifier, the composition information of each line can be deter-mined and the semi-structured information will be the input of the next step. In order to distinguish the difference among lines, the line with only one word is tagged Simple, the line with two words and a common between them is tagged KeyValue and others are tagged Complex.
 Last, name entities are matched to the candidates profile based on the infor-mation statistics and text classifier. 2.2 Construct the Text Classifier It X  X  known that each resume consist of someone X  X  education information including job information, personal contact information, certificates etc. Inspired by the components of a resume, we prepared a lot of name entities, such as name of university, name of company, job positions, department etc., which are easy to collect from the internet without human efforts to label. These name entities are used to train a basic multi-class classifier, which covers the important part of a resume. In our experiments, the Naive Bayes algorithm is used to train the classifier. For evaluating the proposed framework, we tested it on a real world dataset. Education and work experiences parts are extracted from each resume. Since the extracting algorithms are independent on the test corpus, we compared our approach with PROSPECT[ 2 ]andCHM[ 3 ], which also use the natural language processing method to extract the detail knowledge from the resume text. How-ever, only two parts X  data were provided by these two models, we compared them respectively.
 the results about work experiences. The PROSPECT X  X  precision and recall are higher than our framework in the education block classification, the main reason is the difference of test corpus. The application scene of PROSPECT focus on the resumes of software engineers with IT professionals. The advantage of such a limited fields of resumes is that these resumes always cover a limited major, which help to increase the precision and recall for classifier. Face to the work experience block, this advantage is very small and the reason also explain the low precision and recall. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to extract the knowledge from raw resume text. This work aim to improve the accuracy of building resume repository for head-hunters and companies focus on recruiting. The experiments show that this framework encouragingly comparable to other previous research based on sequence labeling model. In future, we are planing to work on the identification of more detailed knowledge from the resume text and investigate the difference of solution on Chinese and English resumes.
