 State-of-the-art expert search approaches rely on document-person associations to infer the expertise of a candidate per-son for a given query. Such associations have traditionally been modeled as boolean variables, indicating whether or not a candidate authored a document, and further normal-ized to penalize prolific authorships. In this paper, we ad-dress expert search in academia, where the authorship of a document can be determined with reasonable certainty. In contrast to traditional approaches, we propose to model associations as non-boolean variables, reflecting the proba-bility that a document is informative of the expertise of a candidate. Moreover, we introduce an alternative normaliza-tion scheme that measures how discriminative a particular document-person association is in light of all associations in-volving either the document or the person. Through a large-scale user study with academic experts from several areas of knowledge, we demonstrate the suitability of the proposed association and normalization schemes to improve the effec-tiveness of a state-of-the-art expert search approach.  X  Information systems  X  Expert search; Academic search; expertise retrieval
Users search for an expert whenever they need proficient knowledge on a given topic [7]. For instance, an expert on  X  information retrieval  X  could be searched for providing con-sultancy or for being recruited by a search company. Expert search has received considerable attention from the informa-tion retrieval community over the past decade, with a par-ticular focus on finding experts within an enterprise organi-zation [2, 8, 10, 19]. Several expert search approaches have been proposed that attempt to model the expertise of can-didate persons and their relevance given a user X  X  query (e.g., [3, 12, 15]). In common, all of these approaches rely on some form of association between people and documents in order to model the expertise profile of each candidate [7].
Document-person associations are commonly modeled as boolean variables, indicating whether or not a person has authored or is mentioned in a document. Given the am-biguous nature of such associations in typical enterprise col-lections [1, 10], attempts to model non-boolean associations have been made that reflect the confidence that the right person has been identified (e.g., based upon the frequency of occurrence of the person X  X  name in the document [6] or its occurrence in proximity to the query terms [20]). In ad-dition, to limit the impact of false positives, the inferred associations are typically normalized to penalize prolific au-thorships. In contrast, many other expert search scenarios provide unambiguous associations, such as email-sender in email corpora [5] and paper-author in academic corpora [4, 11], which preclude the need for authorship inference.
In this paper, we address expert search in academia. In this scenario, the authorship of a document can be deter-mined with reasonable certainty, by leveraging metadata as-sociated with individual publication records. As a result, rather than attempting to infer the authorship of a doc-ument, we propose to model associations as non-boolean variables reflecting the probability that the document is in-formative of the expertise of a candidate. Moreover, because authorships in this scenario are unambiguous, penalizing documents with many associated authors or authors with many associated documents becomes arguably counterintu-itive. Therefore, we further introduce an alternative nor-malization scheme that measures how discriminative a par-ticular document-person association is in light of all associa-tions involving either the document or the person. Through a large-scale user study with academic experts from several areas of knowledge, we demonstrate the suitability of the proposed association and normalization models to improve the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art expert search approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to infer the strength of document-person associations beyond authorship attribution for expert search in academia.
In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 discusses related work on expert search and association models. Section 3 introduces our information-theoretic models for weighting document-person associations. Section 4 describes the setup and the results of the empirical evaluation of our proposed models. Finally, Section 5 presents our conclusions.
E xpert search has been the subject of intense research over the past decade, particularly with the introduction of an ex-pert search task at the TREC 2005 Enterprise track [10]. For instance, Balog et al. [3] introduced two alternative gen-erative probabilistic approaches for expert search, which es-timate the likelihood that a given query is generated by each candidate expert. Their Model 1 performs this estimation directly, by relying on the candidate X  X  language model built from his or her associated documents. In turn, their Model 2 assumes a generative process in which candidates generate documents, which themselves generate the query. Discrimi-native probabilistic models have also been proposed, which attempt to estimate the relevance of a given query-candidate pair directly from training data [12]. Other prominent ap-proaches include graph-based models [18], which perform inference on an expertise graph built from document-person associations, and voting models [15], which aggregate the query-biased document relevance estimates into relevance estimates for the associated candidate experts.

A common characteristic of most existing expert search approaches is their reliance on document-person associa-tions. In particular, almost all approaches consider boolean associations, indicating whether or not a candidate has au-thored a particular document. However, in a typical en-terprise setting, document-person associations can be am-biguous. For instance, candidate names may be mentioned in different parts of a meeting minute without any explicit authorship indication. To overcome such an ambiguity, non-boolean association models have been proposed to estimate the confidence that the correct candidate has been identi-fied. For instance, Balog and de Rijke [6] proposed to weight document-person associations based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the document and the candidate X  X  lan-guage models built using only the candidate X  X  name. Other association models also estimated the distance between the candidate X  X  name and the query terms to improve the iden-tification of authorships related to the query topic [20].
In contrast to the aforementioned approaches, we tackle expert search in academia, a domain where authorships can be determined with reasonable certainty via publication meta-data records uniquely associated with each candidate. As a result, we propose to model associations as non-boolean vari-ables aimed to convey the informativeness of each document for the expertise profile of a candidate. In a similar spirit, Macdonald and Ounis [14] proposed to estimate the extent to which a document is related to the core interests of each candidate associated with it. To this end, they clustered each candidate X  X  profile and ranked the resulting clusters in decreasing order of their size, weighting a document-person association by the inverse of the rank of the cluster that contained the document. Our proposed approach is sim-pler, and relies on a standard information-theoretic measure of the informativeness of the document for the candidate X  X  expertise. The cluster-based approach of Macdonald and Ounis [14] is included as a baseline in our experiments.
Another aspect of document-person associations that is relevant to our proposal is normalization. For instance, both generative models proposed by Balog et al. [3] rely on a normalization component to estimate the probability p ( d | e ) that document d is associated with candidate e . This es-timation can be either document-or candidate-centric, de-pending on whether the association weight is normalized by the sum of the weights of all associations related to the doc-ument or the candidate, respectively. Normalizing associa-tions may be useful even for non-probabilistic approaches, to counter the noise introduced by spurious associations result-ing from false-positive authorship attributions. With this in mind, Macdonald and Ounis [16] proposed to normalize as-sociations by the length of the candidate X  X  profile, measured in either number of terms or number of documents. Given the absence of spurious associations in our scenario, we pro-pose a normalization scheme that does not penalize prolific candidates, but instead measures how discriminative each association is for each document or candidate. The nor-malization schemes of Balog et al. [3] and Macdonald and Ounis [16] are used as baselines in our investigation.
A key element of any expert search approach is its abil-ity to represent the expertise of each candidate expert. As discussed in the previous sections, most expert search ap-proaches in the literature rely on explicit document-person associations to model a candidate X  X  expertise profile. With-out loss of generality, we can formalize the association f ( d;e ) between document d and candidate e according to: where  X  ( d;e ) and  X  (  X  ) denote association and normaliza-tion schemes for the association between document d and candidate e , respectively. The majority of the expert search approaches in the literature rely on a boolean association scheme, which assigns a constant value  X  ( d;e ) = 1 for all existing associations. In turn, the most straightforward nor-malization scheme simply divides the association  X  ( d;e ) by the sum of all document or candidate associations, such that
In the following, we introduce novel information-theoretic association and normalization schemes for expert search in academia. The proposed schemes exploit the unambiguous nature of document-person associations leveraged from pub-lication records in order to better quantify the informative-ness of each association for a candidate X  X  expertise.
Our proposed association scheme aims to weight a given document-person association based on how informative the document is of the expertise of the candidate. To this end, we rely on an information-theoretic measure of the distance between the language use in the document and in the entire profile of the candidate. Precisely, our proposed association scheme  X  H ( d;e ) can be instantiated as follows: where H (  X  e ; X  d ) is the cross-entropy between the candidate language model  X  e  X  X uilt by concatenating all documents associated with candidate e  X  X nd the document language model  X  d . It can be shown that this formulation is equiv-alent to estimating the likelihood of generating the candi-date language model  X  e given the document language model  X  [13]. It is also equivalent to the standard Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two models minus the entropy H (  X  of the candidate model  X  e , which is discarded here as it is the same for all documents d . Based upon the latter ob-servation, our proposed formulation can also be seen as a generalization of the association scheme proposed by Balog et al. [6] and discussed in Section 2. While their approach is based on language models built from candidates X  names, we evaluate our approach using multiple textual representations for the document and candidate models. Finally, while al-ternative formulations (e.g., based on non-textual features) are possible, we leave their investigation for future research.
Existing expert search approaches linearly normalize as-sociation weights either by the sum of all related association weights [3] or by the length of the candidate X  X  profile [16]. As discussed in Section 2, these approaches have been shown to be effective, particularly in the enterprise domain, where ambiguous associations may spuriously compromise the es-timation of a candidate X  X  expertise. In the academic do-main, where associations are generally unambiguous, such linear normalization approaches may harshly penalize pro-lific candidates. To counter this limitation, we propose two alternative normalization schemes aimed to measure the dis-criminativeness of each association. In particular, our soft document-centric (SDC) normalization scheme is given by: where the summation in the numerator comprises the weights of all other associations related to target document d . Our soft candidate-centric (SCC) normalization scheme can be defined analogously with respect to target candidate e :
In both the SDC and SCC schemes, the logarithm provides for a softer normalization compared to existing approaches from the literature, with parameter  X  in the numerators con-trolling the intensity of the normalization X  X he larger  X  , the softer the normalization. With  X  = 1, both normalization schemes reduce to the information-theoretic concept of self-information [9], which quantifies the improbability of occur-rence of a particular association given all other associations related to the same document or candidate.
In this section, we evaluate our information-theoretic asso-ciation models for expert search in academia. In particular, we aim to answer two research questions: Q1. How effective is our proposed association scheme? Q2. How effective are our proposed normalization schemes?
In the following, we describe the setup and discuss the results of our empirical investigations.
Our evaluation is based on the Lattes Expertise Retrieval (LExR) test collection [17], a publicly available test collec-renowned initiative for managing information about science, technology, and innovation for individual researchers and research institutions in Brazil. The LExR test collection comprises metadata records for 11,942,014 scientific publi-cations associated with 206,697 candidate experts from all areas of knowledge working in multiple Brazilian research institutions spread all over the country. Moreover, it in-cludes 235 queries suggested by real experts who judged one another on a graded scale. Grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 indicate an unknowledgeable, somewhat knowledgeable, very knowl-edgeable, and expert person on the query topic, respectively.
As baseline association schemes, we consider a standard boolean scheme (B), as well as non-boolean schemes based on the divergence (KL) of document and candidate language models built from each candidate X  X  name [6] and on a clus-tering (CL) of each candidate X  X  profile [14]. As baseline normalization schemes, we consider the standard document-centric (DC) and candidate-centric (CC) schemes [3] as well as schemes aimed at profile length normalization based on terms (Nt) and documents (Nd). All association and nor-malization schemes are deployed on top of Model 2 [3] as a representative of state-of-the-art expert search approaches. Model 2 is set to operate with the top 1,000 documents re-trieved by a standard language model with Dirichlet smooth-ing with parameter  X  = 2 ; 000. We index the title, keywords, abstract, and author names as separate document fields af-ter removing stop words and applying no stemming. All
Our proposed association scheme in Equation (2) is de-ployed with document and candidate language models built using the abstract and author name fields of each document. Other textual representations showed similar effectiveness. In turn, our normalization schemes in Equations (3) and (4) are deployed with  X  = 2, which showed marginal improve-ments compared to the standard setting of  X  = 1. A full parameter sensitivity analysis is left for future research.
Table 1 shows the retrieval effectiveness of several asso-ciation (  X  ) and normalization (  X  ) schemes in terms of nor-malized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG@10), precision (P@10), and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Our proposed as-sociation (  X  H , Equation (2)) and normalization (  X  SDC  X  SCC , Equations (3)-(4)) schemes are highlighted in gray. Statistical significance is verified using a paired t -test with p &lt; 0 : 01. Superscript and subscript triangles ( N ) denote sig-nificant improvements against the boolean association scheme (  X 
B ) and the standard document-(  X  DC ) or candidate-centric (  X  CC ) normalization schemes, respectively.

From Table 1, in order to address research question Q1, we first analyze the effectiveness of our proposed association scheme. In particular, when using a standard document-centric normalization scheme (  X  DC ), our association scheme  X 
H consistently outperforms all other association schemes (  X 
B ,  X  CL , and  X  KL ) with respect to all evaluation metrics, with significant improvements compared to the strongest boolean association baseline (  X  B ). On the other hand, when using the standard candidate-centric normalization (  X  CC both the boolean association baseline as well as our proposed association scheme underperform, probably because of the harsh penalization applied to prolific candidates. Recalling research question Q1, these results attest the effectiveness Table 1: Retrieval effectiveness of several association (  X  ) and normalization (  X  ) schemes. Our proposed weighting schemes are highlighted in gray. of our proposed information-theoretic association scheme, particularly under a document-centric normalization.
To address research question Q2, we contrast our soft normalization schemes (  X  SDC and  X  SCC ) to their standard counterparts (  X  DC and  X  CC ) and the two profile length nor-malization baselines (  X  Nt and  X  Nd ). From Table 1, we ob-serve that both of our proposed normalization schemes sub-stantially outperform all baselines, with significant improve-ments compared to the standard document-and candidate-centric baselines with respect to all metrics. Recalling ques-tion Q2, these observations confirm the effectiveness of our proposed soft normalization schemes. Indeed, substantial improvements can be observed even when normalizations are candidate-centric, which further emphasizes the bene-fits of avoiding a harsh penalization of prolific candidates. On the other hand, the benefits of our improved associa-tion scheme  X  H over boolean associations seem to be offset, which suggests further investigations towards an improved combination of association and normalization schemes.
We have proposed novel information-theoretic models to weight document-person associations for expert search in academia. Unlike existing approaches, which attempt to ascertain the authorship of a document, we proposed an as-sociation scheme aimed to estimate the extent to which the document is informative of the expertise of each candidate associated with it. Likewise, rather than penalizing prolific documents or candidates to avoid noisy estimations of ex-pertise, we proposed soft normalization schemes that seek to infer how discriminative each association is. We evaluated our proposed association and normalization schemes using a publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval in academia encompassing candidate experts from multiple or-ganizations and with expertise in a range of diverse knowl-edge areas. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed weighting schemes, with substantial and statisti-cally significant improvements over several baselines from the literature. As a direction for future research, we plan to extend our current investigation to non-textual association schemes, exploiting temporal and social signals of expertise.
