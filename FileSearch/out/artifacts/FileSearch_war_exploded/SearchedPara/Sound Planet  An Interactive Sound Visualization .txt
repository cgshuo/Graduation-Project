 Sound Planet is a spherically -shaped interactive installation with the group interaction and the real -time visualization against audiences' voice and singing. The audience approaches the sleeping planet, wakes it up, creates some artifacts such as soil, wa ter, and atmosphere, and then popula tes it with the li fe forms , thereby creating a living planet of their own . Its compelling storyline reinforces the audience X  X  experience while the audience -mostly young children -establishes an emotional engagement with the fictitious planet. The installation whose primary purpose is to provide the synesthetic experience to young children has been operational since April 2014, serving about one hundred children and their family pe r day .

Sound Planet is an artistic audio/visual installation based on the sound visualization onto a spherical display. It was installed at DDP (DongDaeMun Design Plaza), a new landmark designed by the world -famous architect Zaha Hadid , in Seoul, South Korea. The installation aims at providing the synesthetic experience to young children, who will design and create a new  X  X lanet X  through their voice as the input interface, roughly following the 5 -minutes story line [2][4]. The primary r eason that Sound Planet was designed with sound interaction has to do with the concern on the level of difficulty. The interaction should be designed without high difficulty because the target age of exhibition is young children who cannot understand any s ophisticated interaction. The story line consists of singing and voicing so that any audience can easily participate and see the artistic result on the fly [3].
We have studied various technologies for creating interactive multimedia contents on various di splay systems such as media fa X ade, titled LCD X  X , and spherical displays. Sound Planet is one of our latest attempts where a multitude of audience members interact, collaborate, and most of all, enjoy themselves through the multimedia visualization.
The spherical display system has the following advantages over the conventional flat display: 1. Symmetrical experience: Each and every participant is 2. Focused experience: Participants can easily recognize the 
Sound Planet was implemented based on t he external projection system with four projectors. Since 2004, we have developed numerous contents for the spherical display [1]. The external Projection system is more complex than the internal projection system, but it can produce brighter and clearer images on the surfac e [6].

The configurat ion of the display system consists of one spherical screen, one computer, and four projectors. The diameter of the screen is two meters, and the reflection gain of the surface is close to 1.0. The screen was made of molded two hemispherical screens by weld ing, and the weight is about 200Kg. The display is installed 40cm above the floor using a horizontal cylinder bar of 76mm in diameter.

Each projector is placed in a position based on a 90 -degree angle near the projector and 2.3m, 2.1m, 2.3m, and 3.3m away from the screen. The distance from the ground is 2.1m, so that shadow made by the audience can be minimized. All the projectors are controlled by one computer that four channel displays throughout two graphic cards (GTX760).

The software for Sound Planet was coded in Processing 1 is one of the visual art tools based on Java language. The program makes virtual spherical objects in a three -dimensional virtual space, and four virtual cameras shoot the spherical object at the projector's locations. The images generated from the computer are transmitted to the projectors so that a real spherical displaying is realized.
Although precise and accurate interaction s based on the voice/speech recognition may not be realizable, simple and nat ural interactions based on sound and voice may be appropriate for the spontaneous, multi-user environment [5]. In Sound Planet , the pitch detection technique based on FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and the loudn ess of voice are used to reflect the audience X  X  intention. Sound Planet processes and visualizes the audience X  X  voicing in real -time through the multi -channel audio processing. MAX/MSP 2 , simple music software and the OCTA -CAPTULE by ROLAND, an external audio interface are used to handle multi -channels audio signals from the microphone . 
The two primary roles of sound are the landscape design and the creature design. Sound Planet first paints the landscape with various colors, and then at the following stage, creates four different life forms, all dependi ng on the pitch and loudness . story line. There are four creatures  X  fishes, bugs, ma m mals, 
We borrowed the classical four -element metaphors for the basic story line. The concept of four elements is suitable for the subject Processing -http://www.processing.org Cycling 74 MAX/MSP -http://cycling74.com/products /max on how to design a planet. Furthermore, the distinction of the concept is useful to help the audience recognize their interaction feedback with the m inimal cognitive load . The concepts of  X  X ater, fire, earth, and air X  represent the different shapes of brush in the level of 'Nature of Sound Planet', and it also affects the shapes of artificial creatures (See Figure 2).
In numerous literatures, it has been argued that compelling stories reinforce the quality of experiences, especially group experiences. In our Sound Planet , the three main points was taken into account. First , the story should enable the audie nce to participate actively , getting out of the passive participation. The active experience is mainly correlated with physical presence like 'hear sound', 'look at image'. Second considerati on poin t is the nature of the group interaction -either collaboration or competition. For group interaction with the audience of over ten people, it is known that collaboration task is more appropriate. There fore, the group interaction mainly consists of collaboration task and contains some competition task as well. Last consideration point is fun ctionality. The exhibit should be able to provide fun and learning through the designed story line.
The following interaction techniques were used to express abov e considerations: 1. Story in steps: The Sound Planet responds only to the 2. Visual feedback: In order to express the reaction of a 3. Audio feedback: Appropriate sound effects are provided 4. Rotation: affecting range is unavoidably limited because 5. Characterized agent: Creating characteri zed agent 
The story line of Sound Planet incorporates the universa l notion of  X  X reation of Life X . The story consist of following four steps: 1. Sleeping Sound Planet: The Planet look s like a colorless, 2. Nature of Sound Planet: After the wake, Sound Planet 3. Living Life of Sound Planet: Having completed the 4. Revived Sound Planet: In the case where the audience is

From the technical point of view, Sound Planet is a novel platform to investigate some of the critical research issues such as information visualization, ubiquitous display systems, natural user interface and multi -user interaction. At the same time, it is a multimedia installation that serves both ed ucational and entertainment purposes. Some of the future work is as follow: 1. Incorporating other voice/music parameters for richer 2. Incorporating other input modalities for richer interaction, 3. Incorporating other auxiliary displays such as wall This work is partially supported by the NRF and by the BK21 Plus Postgraduate Organ ization for Content Science . [1] J. Jin, K. Wohn. 2007.
