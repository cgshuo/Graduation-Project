 1. Introduction
In order to manage the huge amount of freely available textual information, various text categorization tasks have been proposed. In this study, we address the authorship attribution (AA) problem ( Love, 2002 ; Juola, 2006 ) whereby the author of a given text must be determined based on text samples written by known authors. Knowing that the real author is one of the text might correspond to various items such as a romance, a part of a play, an anonymous letter, a web page, or a sequence of paragraphs. Other questions are related to such issues as the mining of demographic or psychological information on an net message (chat, e-mail, Wikipedia article) or document ( verification )( Koppel, Schler, &amp; Argamon, 2009 ).
As with all text categorization problems, the first step is to represent the texts by means of numerical vectors comprising selected features that help in discriminating among the various authors or categories. In the current context, we must iden-tify pertinent terms depicting differences between the authors X  writing styles. In the second stage, we weight the chosen fea-tures according to their discriminative power as well as their importance in the text representation. Finally, through computing a distance or applying classification rules, the system assigns the most appropriate author to a given input text ( single-label categorization problem).

In the classical authorship attribution studies ( Juola, 2006 ), we usually focus on frequent words or on a small number of very frequent terms to represent each text item. We then define a distance measure and determine the probable author of the query text as the one that depicts the smallest distance. As an alternative way, the machine learning paradigm ( Sebastiani, 2002 ) will focus more of the selection process on identifying the most pertinent features according to their distribution into the different categories or authors. As classification model, this paradigm may use a larger range of possible on a probabilistic topic model ( Blei, Ng, &amp; Jordan, 2003 )weshowhowwecandeterminethepossibleauthorofadisputedtext.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 exposes the state of the art. Section 3 describes the corpora used in our experiments while Section 4 presents an overview of four authorship attribution models used as baselines. Section 5 pre-sents the idea of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and its application as an authorship attribution method. An evaluation of these classifiers is presented and analyzed in Section 6. 2. Related work
Authorship attribution owns a long-standing history ( Mosteller &amp; Wallace, 1964, Juola, 2006, Zheng, Li, Chen, &amp; Huang, 2006, Stamatatos, 2009 ). As a first solution, past studies have proposed using a unitary invariant measure that must reflect the style of a given author but should vary from one writer to another. The average word length, mean sentence length, as have been suggested as well as the proportion of word types occurring once or twice. However, none of these measures has proved satisfactory ( Hoover, 2003 ).
 this case, we represent documents as points within a given lexical space. In order to determine who might be the author of a new text excerpt we simply search the closest document assuming that the author of this nearest document would prob-ably be the author of the disputed text.

Following the idea of measuring an intertextual distance, some recent studies suggest using more topic-independent fea-tures that may reflect an author X  X  style more closely. In this vein, we can limit text representation to function words (e.g., determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and certain auxiliary verbal forms). Since the precise definition of func-tion words is questionable, a wide variety of lists have been proposed. Burrows (2002) , for example, lists the top m most frequent word types (with m = 40 X 150), while the list compiled by Zhao and Zobel (2005) contains 363 English words.
Not all studies, however, suggest limiting the possible stylistic features to a reduced set of functional words or very frequent word types. In their study of the 85 Federalist Papers , for example, Jockers and Witten (2010) derive 2907 words appearing at least once in texts written by all three possible authors. As another example, Hoover (2007) suggests considering up to the top 4000 frequently occurring words, including in this case both function and lexical words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs). On the other hand, more sophisticated intertextual distances have been suggested ( Labb X , 2007 ), where the dis-tance between two documents depends on both their shared vocabulary and occurrence frequencies.

As another source of features, we could take into account part-of-speech (POS) tags by measuring their distribution, fre-quency and patterns or their various combinations. Finally, some studies, usually related to the web, suggest exploiting structural and layout features (the number of lines per sentence or per paragraph, paragraph indentation, presence of greet-or the occurrence of certain spelling errors.

As a second main paradigm, we can apply machine learning techniques to determine the probable author of a disputed text. In this vein, we can see each author as one possible category using the set of previously described features. We then need to define a classification model that can distinguish among possible authors. Zheng et al. (2006) suggests employing decision trees, back-propagation neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs). They found that by solely using lex-ical features, the performance levels obtained are similar to those of POS and lexical feature combinations. This finding is confirmed by another recent study ( Zhao &amp; Zobel, 2007 ). Zheng et al. (2006) also found that SVM and neural networks tend to have significantly better performance levels than those achieved by decision trees. Nanavati, Taylor, Aiello, and Warfield (2011) have obtained good overall performance with a na X ve Bayes classifier for deanonymizing referees X  reports extracted from two scientific conferences. Zhao and Zobel (2005) on the other hand, found that the Nearest Neighbor (NN or k -NN) approach tends to produce better effectiveness levels than both the na X ve Bayes and decision-tree approaches.
Instead of applying a machine learning classification method, Burrows (2002) designed a more specific Delta classifier based on the differences of standardized word occurrence frequencies. This method assumes that authors X  styles are best reflected by identifying the use of function words (or very frequent words) rather than relying on a single vocabulary mea-sure or more topic-oriented terms. Recently, Jockers and Witten (2010) showed that the Delta method could surpass perfor-mance levels achieved when using the SVM method. 3. Evaluation corpora
The number of publicly available test corpora related to the authorship attribution domain is quite limited. Thus, making sufficiently precise comparisons between reported performances and general trends regarding the relative merits of various classification approaches is problematic. The relatively small size of the corpora used is a second concern. In various exper-iments, the number of disputed texts and possible authors are rather limited (e.g., the Federalist Papers are composed of 85 texts from which 12 are disputed articles mainly written by two possible authors ( Mosteller &amp; Wallace, 1964, Jockers &amp;
Witten, 2010 )).
In order to obtain a replicable test-collection containing authors sharing a common culture and having similar language 2004 ). More precisely, we extracted articles in the Glasgow Herald (GH) and published in 1995. To form a suitable test-col-lection, we then chose 20 authors (see Table 1 ), either as well-known columnists (names in italics) or having published numerous papers. This selection process yields a set of 5408 articles.

This corpus covers different subjects with a clear overlap among authors. For example, five authors are listed under the Politics and Arts &amp; Film headings.
 The  X  X  X umber X  X  column in Table 1 lists the number of articles written by each author, showing a minimum of 30 (John
Fowler), and a maximum of 433 (Andrew Wilson). This distribution is rather skewed, with a group of eight authors having published more than 350 articles and another group of four journalists writing less than 100 articles (mean: 270, median: 332, standard deviation: 139). An analysis of article length shows that the mean number of word tokens is 725 (minimum: 44, maximum: 4414, median: 668, standard deviation: 393).

As a second evaluation corpus, we selected newspaper articles published in La Stampa during the year 1994. This corpus
ELRA web site. In selecting this corpus, our intention was to verify the quality of the different authorship attribution methods using a language other than English.
 From the set of all possible articles (58,051 documents), we must first select papers with a known author (37,682 articles).
From this, we ignore articles written by more than one author, as well as authors contributing to only a few texts. In order to form a suitable test-collection, we thus chose 20 authors (see Table 2 ), either as well-known columnists (names in italics) or as authors having published numerous papers in 1994. This selection process resulted in a set of 4326 articles. The  X  X  X umber X  X  column in Table 2 lists the number of articles written by each author, showing a minimum of 52 (Fiama
Nirenstein), and a maximum of 434 (Oreste Del Buono). An analysis of article length shows that the mean number of word tokens is 777 (minimum: 60; maximum: 2935; median: 721; standard deviation: 333). In the selected newspapers articles, we automatically removed the author name (full name or first name) as well as some recurrent phrases (e.g., Dal nostro (or della nostra ) corrispondente , nostro servizio , etc.).

The accuracy rate (percentage of correct answers) will be used as an evaluation measure. As an aggregation function, we consider that all classification decisions share the same importance (micro-average). In authorship attribution domain, this evaluation measure is the most frequently used. As a second approach, we may use the macro-average accuracy rate. In this case, we first compute the accuracy rate obtained for each author then average these 20 values. Both effectiveness measures are strongly correlated and thus we have just reported the micro-average in our experiments. 4. Categorization models 4.1. Preprocessing
Before classifying the newspaper articles according to their possible authors, we first replaced certain punctuation marks with their corresponding ASCII symbols and removed a few diacritics (e.g., chich X  ) when appearing in Glasgow Herald articles.
For the English language, the absence of the diacritics is usually not seen as a real spelling error. For the Italian corpus, we ics. To standardize spelling forms we expanded contracted forms (e.g., don X  X  into do not ) and replaced uppercase letters with their lowercase equivalents.

After this step, the resulting vocabulary contains 56,447 word types, with 19,221 hapax legomenon (words occurring once), and 7530 dis legomenon (words occurring exactly twice). Usually the expression word is ambiguous. To be precise, in the sentence  X  X  X he cat sleeps on the table X  X  we count six word tokens (or simply tokens) but only five word types (the deter-miner the appears twice). When considering only those word types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more, we count 14,890 types, or 9628 types having frequencies equal to or greater than 20. The most frequent token is the (219,632 occur-rences), followed by the comma (183,338), the full stop (146,590), and ranking fourth is the token to (95,350), followed by of (92,755), and a (78,867).

From the Italian newspaper La Stampa , we find 102,887 word types, with 41,965 hapax legomenon , and 14,944 dis legom-enon . In this corpus, we can count 19,580 word types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more, and 11,410 types having frequencies equal to or greater than 20. The most frequent token is the comma (212,736 occurrences), followed by the full and che (that) (59,600).

Finally, to define each author profile, we concatenated all texts written by the same writer. Using this subset, we applied the feature selection procedure, and represented each author profile or disputed text by a set of weighted features. Through-out all the experiments, the text whose author we need to determine was never included in the corresponding author profile. 4.2. Delta rule
To determine the most probable author of a disputed text, Burrows (2002) suggests that the most important aspect to take into account is the frequency of very frequent terms (the top m = 40 X 150 most frequent word types). In this set of very ation marks and numbers. The main underlying idea is to consider only very frequent words used unconsciously by an author and able to reveal his/her own  X  X  X ingerprint X  X .

Burrows proposed to not consider directly the absolute frequencies, but rather their standardized scores. This Z score va-lue is computed for each selected term t i (word type) in a text sample (corpus) by calculating its relative term frequency tfr in a particular document D j , as well as the mean ( mean corpus as depicted in the following equation.

Once these dimensionless quantities are obtained for each selected word, we then can compute the distance to those ob-tained from author profiles. Given a query text Q , an author profile A suggests to compute the Delta value (or the distance) by applying the following equation
When computing this distance we attribute the same importance to each term t frequencies. Large differences may occur when, for a given term, both Z scores are large and have opposite signs. In such cases, one author tends to use the underlying term more frequently than the mean while the other employs it very infre-quently. On the other hand, when the Z scores are very similar for all terms, the distances between the two texts would be small, indicating that the same author had probably written both texts. 4.3. Chi-square distance
As a second baseline, we selected one of the best text representations found in an empirical study done by Grieve (2007) which is based on word tokens together with eight punctuation marks (. , : ; -? ( X ). For feature selection, instead of account-ing for all word types, Grieve (2007) considers words in a k -limit profile, where k indicates that each word type must occur in at least k articles written by every possible author. For example, when k = 2, the selected terms must appear in at least two articles written by every journalist. This selection strategy implies the principle that all authors must use terms used to dis-criminate between them. In this case, we cannot base an attribution decision on word types used by a single author or more generally a subset of authors. At the limit, when only a single author uses a given term, we can assign this text to this author as soon as the target term occurs. However, another author may easily play a masquerade by using the same term.
Increasing the value of k will reduce the number of word types to be taken into account while a small value for k implies that we consider more words. As for the effective values of the parameter k , Grieve (2007) observed that the best perfor-mance results were achieved when k =2, k =5or k = 10.

To compare a given query text Q with an author profile A j fq ( t ) represents the relative frequency of the i th feature in the query text Q , fa author profile A j , and m the number of selected terms t
When comparing a disputed text with different author profiles, we simply select the lowest v most probable author. 4.4. Kullback X  X eibler divergence (KLD)
Zhao and Zobel (2007) suggest considering a limited number of predefined word types to discriminate between different tuation symbols and numbers are not present in this list, we will ignore them when evaluating this authorship attribution scheme.

In our experiments with the Glasgow Herald newspaper, we found 19 words that do not appear. For nine of them, their absence can be attributed to the fact that during the preprocessing we expanded the contracted forms (e.g., aren , isn , wasn , contain 344 words (363 19).

To obtain a similar list for the La Stampa corpus, we select an Italian stopword list provided by a search system achieving high retrieval performance in CLEF evaluation campaigns for that language ( Savoy, 2001 ). This Italian list contains 399 words.

After defining the feature set, the probability of occurrence of each item associated with a given author or a disputed text must be estimated. Based on these estimations, we can measure the degree of disagreement between the two probabilistic distributions. To do so Zhao and Zobel (2007) suggest using the Kullback X  X eibler divergence (KLD) formula, also known as rived from the query text Q diverges from the j th author profile distribution A where Prob q [ t i ] and Prob j [ t i ] indicate the occurrence probability of the term t
A respectively. In the underlying computation, we state that 0.log when the two distributions are identical, the resulting value is zero, while in all other cases the returned value is positive. As a decision rule, we assign the query text to the author whose profile shows the smallest KLD value.

To estimate the underlying probabilities, we may consider the term occurrence frequency (denoted tf appearing in the sample at the expense of the missing terms. To resolve this difficulty, we suggest smoothing the probability estimates using the Lidstone X  X  technique ( Manning &amp; Sch X tze, 2000 ) based on the following estimation: Prob[ t ( n + k |V|), with | V | indicating the vocabulary size. Based on some experiments, we suggest fixing this k value to 0.01 which yields a slightly improved performance over other choices. 4.5. Na X ve Bayes
With the three previously described authorship attribution methods we follow the classical paradigm. In this case, these approaches propose a selection procedure focusing on frequent words. Then, based on a distance measure between the query text and author profiles, they suggest determining the probable author as the one that depicts the smallest distance.
In the machine learning domain, other approaches have been suggested for text categorization ( Sebastiani, 2002 ). Follow-ing this paradigm, we first need to define a selection criterion to reduce the number of possible features (term space reduc-tion). This step is useful to decrease the computational cost and to reduce the over-fitting of the learning scheme to the across the different categories or authors in our context.

As a learning scheme, we selected the na X ve Bayes model ( Mitchell, 1997 ) to determine the probable writer between the set of twenty possible journalists (or hypotheses), denoted by A query text Q , the na X ve Bayes model selects the one maximizing Eq. (5) , in which t the query text Q , and n q indicates the size of the query text.

To estimate the prior probabilities (Prob[ A i ]), we simply take into account the proportion of articles written by each author (see Table 1 for the GH corpus, and Table 2 for La Stampa ). To determine the term probabilities Prob[ t all texts belonging to the same author to define the author profile. For each term t occurrence frequency in the author profile A i ( tf ji ) and the size of this sample ( n
As mentioned previously this definition tends to over-estimate the probabilities of terms occurring in the text with re-spect to terms that still never occur. As with the previous method, we will apply Lidstone X  X  law through smoothing each esti-
As a selection criterion, various measures have been suggested and evaluated. As a first approach, we have selected the odds ratio (OR), a selection function found historically effective ( Sebastiani, 2002 ). For each term t author A i for i =1,2, ... , r , we can compute the odds ratio defined by Eq. (6) . In this formulation, Prob[ t probability that, for a random document, the term t j appears knowing that this text was written by author A
Prob[ t j | A i ] indicates the same probability except that the underlying document was not written by author A
When a given term t j appears more frequently in the author profile A from the rest. In this case, its probability Prob[ t j | A Eq. (6) , this phenomenon will assign a relatively high value for the numerator compared to the denominator. The resulting
OR( t j , A i ) value will be high. The corresponding term t other possible writers.

Using Eq. (6) we obtain a value for each pair (term, author), and to rank the different terms, we need to define one selec-this, we need to aggregate the r values, one for each author. Sebastiani (2002) indicates that the sum operator (see Eq. (7) ) tends to produce the best results with the OR used as term selection function.

Based on this criterion, we can then select the m most discriminative terms. As an alternative to this selection procedure, we will also choose terms according to their document frequency ( df ) values, sorted by decreasing values. In this case, terms appearing in a larger number of articles will be selected first. This selection criterion owns the advantage of being simple to implement and has also been proved to be effective in other text categorization problems, as mentioned by Yang and Pedersen (1997) . Finally, in this scheme as well as for the LDA (see next section), we consider as possible terms the following seven punctuation symbols {. , ; : ! ?  X  X . Such symbols could provide useful information to discriminate between authors. For exam-ple, if a given author tends to write longer sentences, the number of full stop symbols will be less than for another author who usually writes shorter sentences (thus producing more full stops). 5. Latent Dirichlet allocation the probabilistic topic model suggested by Hofmann (1999) . In this framework, documents are viewed as composed of a mix-ture of topics. Of course, a given document may cover only a single topic, but this is more the exception than the norm. For example, the document D 1 may cover intensively Topic 1, present some aspects related to Topic 2, and marginally to Topic 3.
An equal mixture of Topic 1 and 3 may generate the second article D based on a distribution over the k topics, where k defines the maximum number of topics. This value is fixed and defined a priori. In the LDA model, each document in the corpus may be generated according to all k topics with different intensities.
Each topic does not correspond to a symbolic subject heading such as  X  X  X olitics X  X  or  X  X  X ports X  X  but it is defined as a specific word distribution. In this model, the word position in the document or in the sentence is not taken into account (bag-of-word assumption), as well as the document order in the corpus. When inspecting the vocabulary, we can find a very specific word strongly related to a single topic that may appear only in a particular distribution. Usually, however, a word tends to cover different semantic fields such as the word Java ( Java as a drink, an island, a programming language, a dance, etc.). In such cases, the word may appear in different topics to model its polysemy. Finally, when a word is a function word or simply rence probability.

Some examples can illustrate this view. Based on the Glasgow Herald corpus, some topic examples with their most prob-able words are given in Table 3 (after removing the 400 most frequent words). In this table we can see that Topic #3 is re-lated to rugby competitions in Edinburg (Murrayfield stadium) while Topic #4 is related to macro-economic measures in the US. Topic #9 is about budget reduction(s) under the Chancellor of the Exchequer K. Clarke.

For the newspaper La Stampa , the same information is depicted in Table 4 . For the Italian corpus, we can see that soccer is an important topic appearing in Topic #1 with the Milan AC and its stars (R. Gullit, D. Savicevic, M. Desailly, G. Lentini, F. Baresi) and its trainer (F. Capello). The national soccer team appears with Topic #12 (Arrigo Sacchi, Roberto Baggio ( il Divin known figures as M. D X  X lema, the successor of A. Occhetto, or W. Veltroni. With Topic #6, we see the financial world with figures of this world (e.g., Marco Biagi).

In this generative view and for a given document, we first randomly select a topic according to the topic distribution for the underlying text. Then we randomly select a word according to the word distribution associated with the selected topic.
Finally we repeat this process for all words in the target document. Denoting by Prob[ z the j th topic was used to generate the word at the i th position, and by Prob[ t the term t i in the document as:
For a given document containing n d tokens, we can then multiply the Prob[ t observing this document with its corresponding sequence of n words, or unigram assumption).

In practice, however, we are usually more interested to solve the dual view (posterior probabilistic inference). Given a fixed number of k topics and the observed words (with their occurrence frequencies) in a set of n documents, we need to determine the most likely topic model corresponding to these data. In this formulation, the hidden structure is the topics and the word distributions. Thus we need to estimate the probability distributions over words associated with each topic (see examples given in Tables 3 and 4 ), and the distribution of topics over documents. Of course, we are interested in the hidden structure that best explains the observed words and documents. Based on the Gibbs sampling procedure, these esti-mates can be computed under an iterative procedure. As an alternative way to estimate the underlying distribution, some authors have suggested using variational EM methods ( Blei, 2011 ).

A few implementations are freely available (e.g., we used a C version written by Blei, and other possible packages such as lda are available with the R system ( Crawley, 2007 )). In our case, given as input the 20 documents (author profiles) repre-sented by their term frequencies, the system will return the estimated distribution of words over the topics together with the distribution of topics over documents. This simple LDA approach was chosen due to its simplicity and because previous studies have shown that such simple topic models may provide better effectiveness than more complex ones ( Carman, Crestani, Harvey, &amp; Braillie, 2010 ).

Finally, using these distribution estimates, the system can infer the topic distributions of a new and unseen document (the disputed text in our case). To define the possible author of this query text, we suggest computing the distance between the topic distribution of the query text and those corresponding to the 20 author profiles. To achieve this and following the suggestion of Steyvers and Griffiths (2007) , we propose using the symmetric Kullback X  X eibler distance ( Abdi, 2007; Lin, 1991 ) based on two discrete probability distributions. in which Q indicates the distribution of topics over the query text, A p ( s i ), p j ( s i ) are the probabilities that the texts Q and A As a decision rule, we define the author of the query text as the author profile showing the smallest sKLD value.
Various applications in different contexts (unsupervised learning) have been suggested, and good overviews are pre-sented in ( Blei et al., 2003, Steyvers &amp; Griffiths, 2007, Blei, 2012 ) As a first example, we can mention the study done by
Sugimoto, Li, Russell, Finlay, and Ding (2011) . In this study, we can see the topics evolution between 1930 and 2009 in doc-toral dissertations related to library science. Xing and Croft (2006) suggest using the topic modeling techniques as a search model depicting a reasonable overall performance. Carman et al. (2010) propose using the LDA approach to build personal-ized search models and evaluate them using query logs and their click-through data. More closely related to our context,
Rosen-Zvi, Griffiths, Steyvers, and Smyth (2004) and Griffiths, Smyth, Rosen-Zvi, and Steyvers (2004) proposed to include the authors X  information by the mean of a distribution over the topics. Such a view can be useful to see the topic variation for a given author, or relationship between authors based on shared topics, but the authorship attribution was only men-tioned as possible future directions.

In a more closely related study, Arun, Saradha, Suresh, Narsimha Murty, and Veni Madhavan (2009) suggest using the LDA approach to represent documents as a mixture of topics. In a first experiment, these authors used only 555 stopwords while all available word types (93,980) were employed in a second. The main idea is to reduce the document representation to a smaller set of topics (from 5 to 50). Such a compact representation is then used in conjunction with a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier ( Cristianini &amp; Shawe-Taylor, 2000; Joachims, 2001 ) to determine the probable author of a literary works (excerpts of 5000 words). Using only words appearing a stopword list or all possible words, this study shows that we can achieve similar performance levels.

In a recent study, Seroussi, Zukerman, and Bonhert (2011) suggest also to employ the LDA approach to represent the doc-ument as a mixture of topics. In order to reduce the number of terms, they have applied different filters (e.g., selecting only word types having an occurrence frequency larger than a given threshold). They found that using all available terms tends to produce the highest performance levels. After representing each document as a mixture of topics, they first suggest applying a SVM classifier (solution denoted LDA + SVM). As a second AA scheme, they propose to compute a distance between a query text and two possible author profiles using the Hellinger metric. Their experiments demonstrate that LDA + Hellinger tends to produce significantly better performance (micro-average) than the LDA + SVM classifier. When considering more authors (from 1000 to 19,320, using a blog collection), the achieved accuracy rate was rather low (between 1% and 14%), too low to be practically useful.
 6. Evaluation
To evaluate and compare the different authorship attribution methods, we used the 5408 articles of the Glasgow Herald written by 20 well-known columnists. As a second corpus, we used the Italian newspaper La Stampa (4326 articles written by 20 distinct journalists). As the evaluation measure we will use the accuracy rate based on the assumption that each decision owns the same importance (micro-average). As a second possible performance measurement, we can use the macro-average principle. In this case, the mean performance obtained for each author corresponds to one vote and the overall accuracy rate is the mean over all authors. We have decided to limit the performance measure to the micro-average because this measure is commonly used in authorship attribution studies on the one hand, and, on the other, both measures are strongly correlated in our context.

To statistically determine whether or not one strategy is better than another, we applied the sign test ( Conover, 1980 ), ( Yang &amp; Liu, 1999 ). In this test, the null hypothesis H levels. Such a null hypothesis would be accepted if two authorship attribution schemes returned statistically similar accu-ferences will be indicated by a double cross (  X  ) in the following tables. 7. Classical authorship attribution
Using the Delta method ( Burrows, 2002 ), we first need to select the top m most frequent word types. Based on previous experiments, the highest accuracy rate was achieved with the top 400 most frequent types (with small differences as more or less terms are taken into account, e.g., 200 or 600). As a second authorship attribution method, we also evaluated the v measure ( Grieve, 2007 ), based on word types and punctuation symbols respecting a minimal document frequency on a per-author basis. In this case, the best performance was achieved when considering all words and punctuation symbols appear-ing in at least two texts for each author (2-limit). As a third baseline, we used the KLD scheme proposed by Zhao and Zobel (2007) based on a predefined set of 363 English words. For the La Stampa corpus, we have selected an Italian stopword list containing 399 terms.

In order to compare the proposed LDA-based scheme with the other three classical approaches, we will use the same set of terms. In Table 5 , we have reported the accuracy rate of the Delta method, v
Glasgow Herald (GH) and La Stampa (IT) corpora. Using the same terms, we have also reported the accuracy rate achieved by the LDA-based approach, fixing the number of possible topics k between 20 and 80. In the current context, we may assume that each topic corresponds to the style of a given author and thus fixing k = 20 represents a reasonable choice. Of course, having a value for k smaller than 20 does not really make sense. The value for k could however be larger than 20 reflecting the fact that two or more distributions of words (topics) are needed to well describe the various styles of a given columnist. In Table 5 we have reported the performances obtained using the three classical authorship approaches together with the
LDA model. As statistical testing, we used the sign test (significance level a = 1%, two-sided), using the performance achieved by the best performance (depicted in bold) as a baseline. After the accuracy rate value, we added a double cross (  X  ) to denote a statistically significant performance difference.

When applying the Delta rule with the 400 most frequent terms, the accuracy rate (micro-average) is 63.7% with the Eng-lish corpus, and 76.07% with the Italian collection. When computing this performance using the macro-average principle (mean over all author performances), we obtain an accuracy rate of 66.14% with the Glasgow Herald , and 75.08% with La
Stampa . The two performance measurements are clearly correlated. Thus we will limit our analysis to the micro-average principle.

The evaluations reported in this table indicate that the LDA-based authorship attribution method performs significantly better than the Delta model or the v 2 measure for the English corpora. With the La Stampa newspaper, the LDA scheme per-forms better than the v 2 metric but at a lower performance level than the Delta model. In this latter case, the performance differences between the two schemes are not always statistically significant.

The KLD method tends, however, to display a better effectiveness than the corresponding LDA-based scheme. This feature set defined a priori seems to be not well adapted for the LDA approach. For the Italian corpus for example, this term set con-taining 399 entries is able to produce an accuracy of 55.88% ( k = 20). Using a similar amount of terms (400 most frequent terms) as proposed by the Delta method, we obtain a higher effectiveness of 72.83% ( k = 20). When more terms are selected (as shown in the top and the middle of Table 5 ), the LDA-based scheme may produce better performance levels than those achieved with the small set of terms selected under the KLD model.

When considering the possible values of the parameter k (number of topics), we cannot see a clear and precise prescrip-tion for this parameter. Using the top 400 most frequent terms or terms belonging to a 2-limit, the effectiveness achieved with k = 40 X 80 reveals some small performance differences that are however usually statistically significant. With the fea-ture set defined with the KLD model, the accuracy rate variations are more important between different k values as shown in the bottom part of Table 5 . 7.1. Na X ve Bayes In order to have another point of view, we decided to compare the LDA-based scheme with a machine learning approach.
As a typical text categorization model used in this domain, we have selected the na X ve Bayes technique. Unlike the three classical attribution schemes described previously, the selection of the feature set is not usually specified within a machine learning model. Therefore, we have conducted a set of experiments using the odds ratio (OR sum) criterion, and a second set using the document frequency ( df ).

As shown in Table 6 , we have reported the evaluation of the na X ve Bayes model together with the suggested LDA-based model using either the Glasgow Herald (GH) or La Stampa (IT) newspaper. In these evaluations, we have used the same terms for both the na X ve Bayes and LDA experiments. In a first evaluation, we have considered the na X ve Bayes with terms selected according to the OR sum operator (Column 3 and 4). In a second experiment, we used the document frequency ( df ) as a selec-tion function to rank all possible features, from the highest to the lowest (Column 5 and 6). In this case, we favor terms appearing in many articles over those occurring in a limited number of documents. Such a selection function is simple racy rate value, we added a double cross (  X  ) to denote a statistically significant performance difference (using the sign test and compared to the best performance depicted in bold).

These evaluations tend to indicate that when using the odd ratio (OR) as the selection function, the achieved performance levels are lower than those obtained with the document frequency ( df ) measure using the same number of terms. When the number of word types is increased, the accuracy rates are improved, but the marginal enhancement tends to decrease. When analyzing the best number of topics, it is difficult to specify any rule. The optimal value for this parameter depends on the corpus, the number of terms and the underlying selection function. From data reported in Table 6 , we can simply state that fixing k = 20 is usually not a good solution.
 7.2. Additional experiments
In a final set of experiments, we want to study the best performance that can be achieved with the LDA-based authorship attribution model. As a term selection scheme, we first want to ignore words having a small occurrence frequency. Such words are clearly less important in defining the particular style of a given author. Moreover, they represent a large propor-tion of the vocabulary due to the Zipfian distribution of word occurrence. For example, with the Glasgow Herald we can find 56,447 distinct word types, with 19,221 hapax legomenon (words occurring once). When considering only those types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more, we count only 14,890 types. During the term selection, we also add the constraint that each selected word appears in at least three distinct articles written by at least two authors. Thus we want to ignore words appearing only in a few papers or used only by a single author. Taking into account this second constraint, the English vocabulary is reduced to 2511 word types (or 4.4% of the initial vocabulary size).

From the newspaper La Stampa , we find 102,887 distinct word types, with 41,965 hapax legomenon . In this corpus, we can count 19,580 word types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more. Adding the constraint that each word type must appear in at least three articles written by two distinct journalists, we obtain a vocabulary of 9825 terms corresponding to 9.5% of the initial size. The accuracy rates achieved using these feature sets are depicted in the top part of Table 7 .
As a second feature selection, we have applied a less strict scheme, considering all words occurring in at least three dif-ferent articles ( df P 3). In this case, we reduced the English vocabulary size from 56,447 word types to 26,005 (or 46.1% of the initial size), but the resulting feature set is clearly larger than the previous one. For the Italian corpus, the vocabulary decreases from 102,887 word types to 36,928 representing around 35.9% of the initial size.

The evaluations reported in Table 7 complement the performance values shown in Table 6 . Using the LDA-based author-ship attribution method, we can achieve an accuracy rate around 82% with the Glasgow Herald corpus and around 91.5% with the La Stampa newspaper. For the English corpus, the overall best performance level of 82.84% was obtained when selecting the top 5000 words according to the df criteria (see Table 6 ). With the Italian collection, the best performance was obtained when considering 9825 terms (see Table 7 ) with an accuracy rate of 91.94%. These values are similar to those achieved by the na X ve Bayes, maybe slightly lower for the Glasgow Herald , and slightly higher when considering the La Stampa corpus.
When considering the number of features selected, having more word types is not always a guarantee to obtain a higher accuracy rate. In Table 6 with the df selection scheme, the performance level with 2000 or 5000 terms were similar with the
Italian collection. Increasing the number of word types as shown in Table 7 may slightly increase the overall accuracy rate with the Glasgow Herald corpus. For the La Stampa however, the increase from 9825 to 36,928 terms tends to hurt the overall quality of the assignment.

The computational cost is however not the same when faced with a larger number of terms. In our experiments using a C version of the LDA, we need around 1 min and 30 s to build the author profiles for the smallest feature sets (e.g., those pre-sented in Table 5 ) and with k = 20 (English corpus). Based on our implementation of the Delta rule, v proach using the interpreter language Perl, the computational time needed to build the underlying data structures was around one minute. Using the larger set of 26,005 terms (see Table 7 ), this task requires an average of 21 min and 54 s for the LDA model ( k = 20). 7.3. Further analysis of LDA results
Until now we have focused our evaluation on the accuracy rate and compared it to other possible authorship attribution schemes. In addition to this assignment evaluation, the LDA-based model allows us to analyze the relationships between the different topics (or word distributions) and the authors. To achieve this, the LDA scheme returns k topic distributions show-ing the occurrence probability of each word. Each topic may cover one or more subjects and two topics may reflect a similar domain but using different word frequencies. Some topic examples are given in Table 3 ( Glasgow Herald ) and in Table 4 ( La
Stampa ). However, these examples were obtained after removing very frequent word types. As another example, we can fetch some topics (or word distributions) obtained with the Glasgow Herald newspaper based on 2511 words and with the k = 20 topics (accuracy rate depicted in Table 7 ). Table 8 depicts a subset of six of these 20 topics.
In this table, we clearly see that the function words dominate the top part of these distributions. We can see mainly deter-under Topic #3 we can find the word film .

These topics reflect the different word distributions used in the documents composing the underlying corpus. We can use the topic distribution generated for each of the 5408 Glasgow Herald articles to define a topic distribution per author. To achieve this, we compute an average topic distribution for each journalist based on all articles written by that person.
After doing this computation, we obtain a topic distribution for each author and an example is provided in Table 9 . In this have ignored all topics representing less than 5% for all three chosen journalists (these 12 remaining percentages are re-grouped under the label  X  X  X thers X  X  in Table 9 ).

As we can see from data depicted in Table 9 , Julie Davidson X  X  profile is mainly related to Topic #17 (34.7%), and Topic #9 (15.7%). With John Fowler, we can see that his articles are mainly related to Topic #17 (39%), and Topic #4 (10.4%) while
William Russell is first related to Topic #17 (21.2%), then to Topic #3 (16.3%) and Topic #10 (10%). Clearly, these journalists belonging to the  X  X  X rts &amp; Film X  X  domain have in common a word usage reflected by Topic #17 for which the corresponding word distribution is depicted in Table 8 . In this distribution, the most probable word type is the determiner the (10.1%) fol-lowed by the comma (8.8%), and the preposition of (5.5%). In the fifth rank, we can see the conjunction and (3.8%). On the other hand, the full stop appears only in the fourth rank. These elements seem to indicate that these three authors tend to write longer sentences than the mean (other topics have the full stop closer to the top).

Topic #17 represents the common vocabulary they share. But Topic #3 and #10 are useful to discriminate Russell from the others, while Topic #4 does the same with Fowler. Referring to word frequencies shown in Table 8 , we can see that Rus-distribution of Topic #4 (see Table 8 ), Fowler uses the verb forms was , were ,or had more frequently, showing maybe a pref-erence for the past tense and/or the passive voice. Finally, the word usage reflecting Julie Davidson X  X  style is also related to Topic #9.

Even if for the  X  X  X rts &amp; Film X  X  subject we have found a common word distribution between the journalists writing in this domain, we are not able to find a similar pattern for the five journalists working in the sports columns. Each of them is more strongly related to a distinct topic, as for example, Derek Douglas who is related mainly to Topic #20 (32.8%), and the second most important word distribution is Topic #4 (10.4%). Based on word distributions shown in Table 8 , we can see that words related to rugby or Scotland are mainly listed under Topic #20 while the usage of functional words appears under Topic #4, a word distribution shared with John Fowler. 8. Conclusion
In this paper we described the authorship attribution problem in the context of the closed-class problem in which the correct author is one of possible known candidates. As an attribution scheme, we have described the Delta rule method ( Burrows, 2002 ) based on the top m (=400) most frequent word types. As a second authorship attribution method we evaluated the v 2 measure ( Grieve, 2007 ), based on word types and punctuation symbols having a minimal document fre-quency of two on a per-author basis (generating 653 terms with the GH corpus or 720 Italian words). As a third baseline, we used the KLD scheme proposed by Zhao and Zobel (2007) and based on a predefined set of 363 English words. We have adapted this approach to the Italian language by using a known stopword list (containing 399 terms). These first three solu-tions represent classical approaches to the authorship attribution problem. As a forth baseline we have used the na X ve Bayes model ( Mitchell, 1997 ), representing a well-known model in the machine learning domain. In this case, we have applied both the odd ratio (OR) and the document frequency ( df ) as selection function.

As a new authorship attribution scheme, we suggest considering the LDA ( Blei et al., 2003 ) paradigm that was applied for different purposes as, for instance, to produce an overview of k topics appearing in a given corpus (as shown in this paper). We explained how we could adapt this scheme for authorship attribution applications.

To evaluate and compare these different authorship attribution approaches, we have extracted 5408 articles of the Glas-gow Herald written by 20 well-known columnists. This corpus is stable and freely available (CLEF-2003 test suite). Since these articles are written during the same short period (year 1995), sharing the same culture, having similar language reg-isters and targeting the same audience, this corpus presents a pertinent test bed for authorship attribution empirical studies.
As a second test collection, we have extracted 4326 articles from the Italian newspaper La Stampa written by 20 different journalists. This corpus covers the year 1994 and is also available in the CLEF test suite.

Using the same feature sets, the adapted LDA scheme produces significantly better performance levels than the Delta rule and the v 2 -based method. On the other hand, the suggested approach achieves lower performance levels than the KLD mod-el. Based on more terms, the LDA-based scheme may perform better than the KLD model. Using the same feature sets, and with an appropriate number of selected terms, the LDA-based scheme may show better performance than the na X ve Bayes model. For other parameter values, the na X ve Bayes may demonstrate a better effectiveness. Finally, the underlying compu-tational cost of the LDA-based model is higher compared to other solutions.
