For all x  X   X  X , y  X   X  Y and  X   X   X  R l , we have and for given x  X   X  X ,y  X   X  Y and  X   X  , we have that where, in the last line, we used by the definition of  X   X  t and  X  t .
 On the other hand, Combining these two inequalities, we have This and Lemma 11 gives Now summing up this bound for t = 1 ,...,T , then we have Now since G t =  X I  X   X  t  X A  X  A , we have that This and the initial settings of x 1 ,y 1 , X  1 give the assertion.
