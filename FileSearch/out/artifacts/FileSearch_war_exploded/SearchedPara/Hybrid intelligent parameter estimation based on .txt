 1. Introduction
In steel manufacturing industry, the hot-rolled strip laminar cooling (HSLC) process is used to cool a strip from a finishing rolling temperature of roughly 820 X 920 1 C down to a coiling temperature of 400 X 680 1 C. Strips enter laminar cooling section after the finishing mill, then are cooled in the water cooling section, and finally are coiled by coiler. When the strip is cooled down on the run-out table, the mechanical properties of the corresponding strip are determined by the cooling curve ( Tang et al., 2007 ; Sha et al., 2007 ). Therefore the highly flexible and precise control of the cooling curve and coiling temperature in the cooling section is extremely important for the product quality.
However, since it is difficult to measure the strip temperature continuously while in the cooling section, establishing a dynamic parametric model to estimate the strip temperature plays an impor-tant role in controlling the hot-rolled strip temperature. A fixed-parameter model can represent a certain product type (i.e. grade).
However, in strip manufacturing process, many different grades need to be produced which necessitates using a parameter-varying dynamic model to predict the temperature. Each grade is identified using a number of different process settings (e.g. moving speed, strip temperature, etc.). Then, in order to manufacture the required grade, attributes are obtained. Consequently, rapidly changing operating conditions of cooling process lead to the instability of heat transfer characteristics. The model parame ters represent the thermal char-acteristics of the cooling process, such as heat transfer coefficient which is influenced by many variables including ambient tempera-ture, hardness grade of strip, strip thickness, temperature of cooling water, strip moving speed, strip temperature, and the distribution of cooling water. Since the resulting dynamic model parameters, e.g. the heat transfer coefficient are non linear and time varying, the mathe-matical model derivation is extremely difficult. Furthermore, tradi-tional estimation techniques fail to estimate nonlinear parameters accurately due to the lack of prior process knowledge. In order to overcome these difficulties, an estimation technique based on case-based reasoning (CBR) has been considered in Tan and Chai (2005 ). However, the authors have considered to determine the weights of CBR features based on operator X  X  expert experience, which incorpo-rates significant uncertainties from one operator to another, and as a result, to inaccurate estimation of the parameters. In this paper, a new algorithm hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is developed to optimise the weights of CBR features. 1.1. CBR background
The CBR is formed of concepts and techniques which relate to knowledge representation, reasoning, and learning from experience ( Aamodt and Plaza, 1994 ; Wettschereck and Aha, 1995 ; Bonzano et al., 1997 ; Jarmulak et al., 2000 ; Coyle and Cunningham, 2004 ; Xiong and Funk, 2006 ; Ahn et al., 2006 ; Sun and Li, 2009 ;
Xiong, 2011 ). Perhaps the most significant advantage of CBR is similarity of its prediction approach to that of human reasoning system which makes predictive processes and results easily under-standable to industrial users. It is known that human beings always search their memories to find similar experiences when they encounter a new problem. The human reasoning system can learn over time, reason in domains with incomplete or non-well-defined concepts, and provide means for explanation. The CBR is a well established methodology with broad applications such as medical ( Chang et al., 2008 ), chemical engineering for quality design ( Suh et al., 1998 ), intelligent Web-based sales service ( Watson and
Gardingen, 1999 ; Wilke et al., 1998 ), building and mechanical design ( Nikolaychuk and Yurin, 2008 ; Rivard and Fenves, 2000 ; Mileman et al., 2002 ), material science ( Amen and Vomacka, 2001 ; Mejasson 1999 ) as well as planning and real-time scheduling tasks ( Cunningham et al., 1997 ; Coello and dos Santos, 1999 ).
Generally, the process of CBR cons ists of four steps: retrieve, problem case, it is first necessary to search similar cases. After
Alternatively, new knowledge is used to establish a new case, through the adaptation process. The performance of CBR relies on the composition of a case base, similarity assessment, and a case adaptation method, in which similarity assessment plays an impor-tant role ( Aamodt and Plaza, 1994 ). Many CBR-based systems represent cases using features and employ a similarity function to measure the similarities between new and historical cases ( Shin and
Han, 1999 ). The approach commonly used to assess similarity is the distance function including the Euclidean distance ( Cheng et al., 2008 ; Elhadi, 2000 ; Kwong and Tam, 2002 ) and the Manhattan
GA-based feature weighting toge ther with number of nonlinear similarity functions based on standa rd the Euclidean distance metric.
So far the main stream of the works involving similarity models has been focused on feature weighting ( Kohavi et al., 1997 ;
Wettschereck and Aha, 1995 ). Features are assigned with different weights in accordance with their importance and the global simi-larity metric is defined as a weighted sum of the local matching values in single attributes ( Xiong, 2011 ). Different approaches have been proposed for estimating such weights automatically. Feature weights are modified by incremental learning according to success/
Avesani, 1995 ). Probability-based techniques are used to assign et al., 1999 ). For weight adaptation, the case-ranking information is used as the similarity degree of case retrieval ( Branting, 2001 ;
Coyle and Cunningham, 2004 ; Stahl and Gabel, 2003 ). An accuracy improvement method has been proposed representing an approach for adapting the set of weights ( Jarmulak et al., 2000 ; Ahn et al., 2006 ). Xiong (2011) has also proposed a new method to similarity assessment based on fuzzy rule-b ased reasoning and advocate that the set of fuzzy rules for similarity assessment can be learned from thecasebaseusinggeneticalgorithms. 1.2. Hybrid genetic algorithm for optimisation
GA has been widely applied to control systems and is one of the most powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques ( Bedwani and Ismail, 2001 ). Compared with gradient-based search algo-rithms, GA is very suitable for optimisation problems with several local minima. It is also effective if the search space is either (partially) non-differentiable or discontinuous ( Kargupta and
Smith, 1991 ; Kristinsson and Dumont, 1992 ). The GA techniques have been applied to identify linear and non-linear systems by many researchers. For instance, Hossain et al. (1995) have used
GA for parameter estimation of a flexible beam to design a vibration controller where a first order central finite difference (FD) method was used to study the behaviour of the beam. to global optimum and the premature convergence. In order to overcome the convergence speed problem, this paper employs a truncation-based selection algorithm ( Tavakolpour et al., 2010 ).
The selection strategy involves replacing the weakest member of the present generation with the strongest member of the previous generation. This strategy improves the performance of the GA by ensuring monotonic improvement in the best fitness value of each generation. The second problem, i.e. premature convergence, is caused by the loss of diversity in population, especially when the search is continued for several generations ( Gudla and Ganguli, 2005 ). Hence, an annealing algorithm is employed to overcome the drawback in the way that each member of a new population is obtained by the self-recognition crossover and mutation operators and then is determined whether to enter the next population according to the Metropolis criteria in annealing algorithm. 1.3. Objectives and contributions temperature model parameters so that the accuracy of predicting temperature distribution and cooling temperature of strip in the laminar cooling process are improved. For this purpose, a hybrid intelligent parameter estimation algorithm formed by a hybrid genetic algorithm and grey case-based reasoning is proposed. The
HGA is used to optimise the weights of retrieval features in case-based reasoning which is considered an advantage over the existing methods in which the weight values are determined by expert experience. The weight vector is then used by grey case-based reasoning to accurately estimate the model parameters online. The proposed method is validated using a set of opera-tional data gathered from hot-rolled strip laminar cooling process.
Experiment results show significant precision improvement in the prediction of strip temperature in the laminar cooling process. laminar cooling process is presented, and then the problem of parameter estimation of the thermodynamic model is discussed.
In Section 3 , a detailed description of the proposed hybrid intelligent parameter estimation method is presented. Section 4 presents the implementation and results of the proposed method.
Concluding remarks are made in Section 5 . 2. Process description and related work 2.1. Process description strated in Fig. 1 . Strips enter cooling section after the finishing mill at finishing rolling temperature of 820 X 920 1 C. After being cooled in the water cooling section, the strips are coiled at coiling temperature of 400 X 680 1 C. Strips are 200 X 1100 m in length and 6.30 X 13.20 mm in thickness. There are 90 top headers and 90 bottom headers on the run-out table. The top headers that are of
U-type are used for laminar cooling and the bottom headers that are of straight type are used for low pressure spraying. These cooling water headers are divided into 12 groups. The first nine groups are considered as the main cooling section and the last three groups are the fine cooling section. The corresponding thermodynamic model is presented in Appendix A .
 2.2. Motivation for estimating model parameters
The meaning of thermodynamic model parameters, a k , a v , a , c and D v , are fully explained in Appendix A , where k proportional coefficient  X  influence on the accuracy of v velocity parameter  X  represents the influence of finish d thickness parameter  X  represents the influence of finish
T temperature parameter  X  represents the influence of
D v velocity increment  X  represents the influence of velocity c velocity coefficient  X  represents the influence of velocity
Since boundary conditions and strip temperature have non-linear characteristics, functional relationship between the model parameters and the boundary conditions with input is nonlinear.
Therefore, it is difficult to represent the model by mathematical first principle approach and therefore, an efficient estimation technique has to be applied. There i s no prior knowledge concerning the functional relationship. Moreover, the model parameters are both time-varying and nonlinear. Therefo re, traditional estimation meth-ods are not appropriate. In this case , a hybrid intelligent parameter estimation algorithm based on grey case-based reasoning is used to estimate the parameters. The flow chart of the proposed estimation method is presented in Fig. 2 . The estimated parameter values are used to calculate the model coefficients (i.e. the heat transfer coefficient, the thermal conduct ivity coefficient and the thermal diffusivity coefficient), and the n the dynamic model is determined which can be used to calculate the temperature distribution of any point on the strip at any time. Hence, real-time temperature control for hot-rolled strip can be conducted. 2.3. Related work
Many models for laminar cooling p rocess have been developed so far. However, the existing models are often not validated using practical data and remain as simulation models ( Serajzadeh, 2004 ).
Even in cases where the models are verified using industrial data, they assume fixed model parameters ( Guo, 1997 ; Chai et al., 2002 ). However, neglecting the time-varying nature of the model para-
Therefore in this paper, the time-varying parameter estimation is the main focus in system identification of the laminar cooling process. The dynamic parameter tuning has been investigated so as to cope with the varying operating conditions in the laminar cooling process. The model paramet ers are determined by trial-and-error and back-calculating methods ( Chai et al., 2002 ; Guo and Hwang, 1996 ), in which considerable human time besides computa-tional effort is needed to select the model parameters. Moreover, the precision of the parameter estimation using these methods is not in industrial practice. The nonlinear least-square and the nonlinear quadratic programming methods are well-developed techniques for parameter estimation ( Fletcher and Xu, 1987 ; Tjoa and Biegler, 1991 ). However, if the search space is either (partially) non-differentiable or discontinuous w ith respect to the parameters, the nonlinear least-square and the nonlinear quadratic programming methods often fail to determine the global optimum ( Hossain et al., 1995 ). In addition, the laminar cooling is a complex process due to time-varying, highly nonlinear dynamics, non-existent mathemati-cal representation of intermediate parameters, and also absence of online strip temperature measurem ent. As a result, the nonlinear least-square and nonlinear quadr atic programming methods cannot be directly used in practice.

In this context, case-based reasoning ( Tan and Chai, 2005 )isa more suitable parameter estimation method, due to its speed and simplicity. However, the approach proposed in Tan and Chai (2005 ) has several drawbacks. First, the time-varying nature of the heat transfer coefficient is neglected. Therefore, since the control signal is calculated after parameter is determined, this might incorporate applying the control signal with wrong model parameters. Second, the weights of the case attributes in case-based reasoning are fixed by expert experience or by off-line experiments that cost time and effort. In addition, when historical case base has a significant change, since the weights of retrieval features are fixed by expert experience, the accurate estimate of parameters in the thermodynamic model cannot be realised.
An alternative approach is hybrid intelligent parameter iden-tification based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks ( Pian and Chai, 2008 ). In this approach, the time-varying beha-viour of the heat transfer coefficient caused by the effect of the speed and the temperature changes is considered. However, the procedure to determine the weights using the RBF neural networks is time consuming. Hen ce, in a very small control period, this method is unable to complete the accurate estimation of the model parameters and the accurate estimate of strip coiling tem-perature cannot be completed as well. 3. Hybrid intelligent parameter estimation based on grey case-based reasoning
The basic idea of the proposed estimation method is presented in Fig. 2 , which includes the grey case-based reasoning (CBR) and
HGA. The weight vector of retrieval features in CBR is first optimised offline using HGA. Then the weight vector is used in the process of grey case-based reasoning. 3.1. Grey case-based reasoning (GCBR)
The boundary conditions and strip temperature have a non-linear characteristic, which cause nonlinearity between the model parameters and the boundary conditions. In addition, the bound-ary conditions affecting the model parameters contain many qualitative and quantitative attributes, which are not necessarily known. In theory, there exists a grey relationship between various qualitative attributes and model parameters, which makes the grey decision method suitable for estimating the model para-meters of laminar cooling process. Therefore, the case retrieval based on the grey similarity ( Sun and Hui, 2006 ), which can address the grey relationship is adopted in the proposed GCBR-based hybrid intelligent parameter estimation algorithm for laminar cooling process. 3.1.1. Case description by a structured description in HSLC ( Tan and Chai, 2005 ). Therefore the case representation based on frame structure is applied to represent the cases. The case in case base is composed of retrieval features and solution features. A series of qualitative or quantita-tive attributes are served as retrieval features of each case, which is quantitative attribute, which is denoted as Y . Namely, a case can be expressed as a tuple consisting of retrieval feature X and solution feature Y . Thus, case model can be denoted as u i  X  Case ( X , Y ).
Case base composed of all cases can be denoted as U  X  { u ( i  X  1,2, y , m ), where u i represents a case. 3.1.2. Establishment of case base
D v (see Appendix A ) cannot be measured online, we need to find the optimal parameters satisfying certain conditions to establish the case base. Since grid-search method can traverse variable space, it is inevitable for the optimal model parameters to be obtained by computing index function of each point in variable space. Moreover, equal step grid-search method is simple and feasible to determine the optimal model parameters a k , a c , D v by minimising the following performance index: J  X  1 I where I is the number of strip segments. In fact, (1) indicates the mean absolute deviation between measured coiling temperature
T i c and the coiling temperature y i computed by the thermodynamic model of the top surface. Also in (1), i indicates the i th segment strip. The optimal values of the model parameters are computed by minimising J in variable space. The resulting optimal parameters are then used alongside hardness grade G , strip thickness F d temperature F T and strip head velocity F v to form a case. 3.1.3. K-nearest neighbour case retrieval based on the grey similarity
In the present work, the retrieval strategy combining para-meter optimisation method of hybrid genetic algorithm with
K-nearest neighbour case retrieval is applied. There exists a kind of grey relation between various qualitative attributes and model parameters, which makes the traditional similarity difficult to deal with. However, it makes the grey similarity suitable for computing the similarity between two cases. Moreover, the calculation accu-racy of grey similarity method is higher than the traditional similarity ( Sun and Li, 2009 ). Therefore, grey correlation analysis ( Sun and Hui, 2006 ) is applied for model parameter estimation. of retrieval features consist of practical operating conditions retrieval feature values of all cases denoted as F
F  X  2 6 6 6 6 4 where f ij is the value of the i th case at j th retrieval feature.
In the practical operating condition of HSLC, the retrieval features have different dimensions and orders of magnitude (e.g. strip hardness grade G , finishing rolling thickness F d , finishing rolling temperature F T and finishing rolling velocity F v ). Therefore, it is necessary to normalise the primitive factor matrix to make the retrieval features with different dimension and order of magnitude comparable. Relative membership grade (RMG) of every retrieval feature is obtained as follows. The RMG matrix F 0 of retrieval features is obtained by normalisation. That is, each element is divided by the maximum of the corresponding column.

F 0  X  2 6 6 6 6 4 f  X  max where max j f ij is the maximum of j th column.

It must be noted that the problem case is represented as u and f 0 j represents RMG obtained by normalising the j th retrieval feature of u 0 . 3.1.3.1. Grey relational degree of attribute. According to formulation of grey relational degree, the relational degree g ij between case u and case u i at retrieval feature is defined as  X  min where max j 9 f 0 0 j f 0 ij 9 and min j 9 f 0 0 j f 0 ij minimum of membership grade distance between the problem case and every case in U at j th retrieval feature, respectively. the problem case and case u i in U at j th retrieval feature. b is grey relational degree matrix between the problem case and the case in case base is R  X  { g ij } with the dimension m n .
Similarity calculation method based on distance is employed in this paper. Grey similarity sim 0 i ( Sun and Li, 2009 ) between problem case and historical case u i is defined as sim 0 i  X  1 where h is a distance parameter, which is the Manhattan distance when h  X  1 and the Euclidean distance when h  X  2. Also, o weight of i th retrieval feature. The weights of n retrieval features form feature weight vector W  X f o 1 , o 2 , , o n g , the value of which is optimised by the proposed HGA. Greater the value of sim 0 i , greater the similarity between problem case u 0 is applied. 3.1.3.2. K-nearest neighbour case retrieval. Similarity threshold T is set according to k-nearest neighbour. K-nearest neighbour case set U * of the problem case u 0 is composed of all historical cases whose similarities are equal to or greater than T and U * is defined as U n  X f u i n 9 sim 0 i n Z T g X  i n  X  1 , 2 , , L  X  X  7  X  The value of the threshold T can be calculated using T  X  r max  X  sim 0 i  X  X  8  X  where max  X  sim 0 i  X  is the maximum of similarity and r is the percentage.

In cases where the sub-historical case base in the historical case base have the same hardness grade and thickness (main indices) with the problem case, the weight vector of the problem case is known. That is, one of the sub-historical case bases and then the case retrieval can be conducted. When there are no cases in the historical case base having the same hardness grade and thickness (main indices) with the new problem case, the weight vector of the new problem case is unknown, which makes the case retrieval impossible. Thus, in the latter cases, the following calculation procedure is carried out.
 First, establish the case structure of the weight vector W  X f o 1 , o 2 , , o n g , in which the retrieval features are G , F F and the solution is the weight vector W . The case structure of the weight vector W is shown in Table 1 .

Then, the retrieval features of the sub-historical case base and the weight values of retrieval features corresponding to the sub-historical case base form a case. In this way, the case base of the weights can be established. When a new type of steel (a new problem case) is required to be cooled, which has never been produced in a steel industry, the weight vector of the new problem case is obtained using CBR for the case base of the weight vector.
With the weight vector of the new problem case obtained by above method, the whole historical case base serves as the retrieval case base and the model parameter values corresponding to the new problem case can be obtained by CBR. Since there are no similar cases in case base for a new type of steel, the resulting model parameter values are only provisional model parameter values. 3.1.4. Case re-use based on replacement method
Using the similarities between the problem case and retrieved cases as weight values, the solution of the problem case can be obtained with the weighed sum of all retrieved similar cases.
Greater the similarity between the problem case and retrieved case, greater the weight value of the corresponding case solution.
In other words, the corresponding case solution is in large proportion in the solution of the problem case. Once the re-use solution is obtained, it is used for appropriate case solution. 3.2. Local search method
Since the fitness function is not differentiable, we have to use methods that do not use gradients. Therefore the multidimen-sional minimisation method based on inverse parabolic interpo-lation was employed as a Local Search (LS) method in the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA).

Almost all multidimensional minimisation methods use one-dimensional minimisation ( Makeyev et al., 2010 ). One-dimensional minimisation methods include inverse parabolic interpolation, golden section search, and their combinations (e.g. Brent X  X  method
Press et al., 2007 ). Here it is assumed that GA stops at the solution nearest to the global extreme of the fitness function and that in each direction in the neighbourhood of the global extreme of the fitness function is approximately parabolic. The smoothness of the fitness function suggests that in the neighbourhood of the global extreme the first three terms of Taylor X  X  series can approximate the fitness function. Indeed, it is approximately parabolic in this neighbourhood. Then the abscissa value corre-sponding to the extreme of the parabola which can be fitted through any three different points should lie at least very close to the abscissa value of the global minimum ( Makeyev et al., 2010 ).
Thus, the inverse parabolic interpolation should be suitable under given assumptions in this research. 3.3. Hybrid genetic algorithm
Since hardness grade and thickness have a greater influence on model parameters, they can be used as main indices in case retrieval, while speed and temperature which have a less influ-ence on model parameters can be used for secondary indices.
Historical case base can be sub-divided into sub-historical case bases according to the main indices. In each sub-historical case base, the hardness grade and thickness of all the cases are same.
The weight values of retrieval features corresponding to the sub-historical case base are calculated by the hybrid genetic algo-rithm. When the problem case is formed, a search is carried out in the historical case base to retrieve the sub-historical case base with the same hardness grade and thickness as the problem case.
In the next step, the search is performed within the sub-historical case base retrieved from the first step above. The goal for this search is to obtain the solution of the problem case. If the sub-historical case base having the same hardness grade and thickness with the problem case is not found by searching, the whole case base is served as the retrieval case base and the weight values of retrieval features are calculated by the hybrid genetic algorithm.
Then the solution of the problem case can be retrieved using the optimised weight vector. The retrieval accuracy can be improved by above mentioned method. When the historical case base changes significantly (equivalent to an increase of more than 30% over the number of cases) or a case having new hardness grade and thickness joins the historical case base, the weight having significant change and new type of steel should be recounted to improve the retrieval accuracy of problem case solution. The drawback that the weight values o f retrieval features are fixed through engineering experience can be overcome by the above process. When the case base chang es significantly, recounting of retrieval feature weight vector can improve the retrieval accuracy using hybrid genetic algorithm.
 accuracy in reaching the optimum s olution is poor. Local search algorithms are likely to stop at a solution which is the closest close to optimal solution if the lo cal search method starts near the global optimum.
 is based on the inverse parabolic interpolation ( Goldberg, 1989 ) is used as a local search method. The LS method is applied for post-hybridisation of GA. The flow chart of the proposed HGA is presented in Fig. 3 .
 optimisation in the following two consecutive steps. Firstly, in order to find an area with low fitness values in the search space,
GA algorithm is executed and then the local search method is applied to the best set of weights found by GA. In contrast to LS method, a precise initial guess is not required for such HGA which can find good solutions faster than the standard GA. To overcome the drawback of genetic algorithm and improve the local search performance of GA, diversity of evolution population should be enhanced. The optimum can be found in the neighbourhood of optimal solution with low fitness values and the optimum can be found as well in the neighbourhood of poor solution with high fitness values. Accordingly, in order to improve the local search performance of GA, an annealing algorithm is adopted in this paper. Initial population is optimised by the genetic operations of
GA, namely, crossover and mutation are performed on the initial population at self-recognition crossover and mutation probabil-ities to obtain a new population. Each member is determined whether to enter the next population according to Metropolis criteria in the annealing algorithm and GA proceeds using the population as parental generation ( Liu et al., 2009 ). The whole process is repeated until the termination conditions meet. 3.3.1. Generation of initial population large dimensional search spaces than binary-coded GAs since they are more precise, consistent and they lead to faster conver-gence ( Baskar et al., 2003 , 2004 ). Moreover, a real-parameter GA does not require the knowledge of bounds on parameter values and can be applied in problems where such information is not available ( Subbaraj et al., 2011 ). Thus real-coded GA is employed in this paper.
 point numbers, with the same length as the vector of weights in vector of chromosomes to the solution of the weight vector in case retrieval of GCBR. Initialisation of M individual population is carried out using where o u i and o l i are the domain of o i , where o u i
Also, s i is a random number uniformly distributed over [0,1]. The tuning law (9) is repeated N times to produce the vector
M uniformly distributed initial feasible solutions in the search space are obtained.
 3.3.2. Fitness function of GA
The estimation error e i between the optimal value R i and the estimated value Y i of model parameter is e  X  R i Y i  X  10  X 
The mean square error e is defined as  X  1 N where N is the number of cases in historical case base.
An obvious approach is then to estimate the parameters of strip coiling temperature model so as to fit the estimated value Y as closely as possible to the optimal value R i as determined in
Section 3.1.2 . In fact, the parameters of strip coiling temperature model should be estimated so that the mean square error ( e )of the estimated parameter converges to zero. Therefore, the mean square error ( e ) of the estimated parameter is used as fitness function of GA. 3.3.3. Selection strategy
In this study, the selection strategy as in Tavakolpour et al. (2010 ) is applied for the GA X  X  selection criteria. Since parameter estimation is a minimisation problem, it is natural to assume that the weakest feasible solution is the one which has the highest mean square errors. At the other extreme end, the strongest individuals are associated with smallest values of mean square error. The individuals with smaller mean square error values will replace those with higher mean square error values. Consequently, the new population is found by the selection operator so that the mean square error of the fitness function is minimised. The probability values, which are used in the selection strategy are determined through trial-and-error to find the best performance. 3.3.4. Self-recognition crossover and mutation
Premature convergence which is the main disadvantage of GA is caused by the loss of diversity in population, especially when the search is continued for several generations ( Gudla and Ganguli, 2005 ). It has been shown by Liu et al. (2009 ) that the self-recognition crossover and mutation operators have the cap-ability to overcome the mentioned drawback, which is employed in this paper. Crossover probability p c and mutation probability p m change with fitness values. That is, the individuals with higher fitness (mean square error) are associated with greater crossover and mutation probability values. When the GA is stuck in a local optima, the individuals with smaller fitness (mean square error) are associated with greater crossover and mutation probability values as well, which can contribute to inhibit the premature convergence of GA. 4. Implementation and results 4.1. Training
In this section, the experiment results conducted on a laminar cooling process are presented. In this example, the number of the thickness grade range of low-carbon steel produced by a steel plant is 500. Thickness range of strip cooled by laminar cooling system is 1.1 X 28 mm, which is divided into 15 grades. In this study, 179 strip data (8117 sampling po ints) are used for experiment, in which the thickness grade is 9 (i.e. the thickness is between 10.6 mm and 12.6 mm). The temperature modelling is conducted on 11 points along the thickness dir ection. Also, 139 strip data (6469 sampling points) are used to optimise the weight values of retrieval features offline and to establish the initial case base. Furthermore, 40 strip data (1648 sampling points) are used to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. Since the temperature of strip on the head and the tail varies with changing operating conditions, in order to guarantee the generalit y of the experiment, the middle segment of every strip is used as test case for the experiment. The estimated value of the parameters a k , a v , a d , a are used to validate the proposed method. It is worth mentioning that estimation of a k is continued within each control period and the rest are estimated before the control starts.
 The estimation strategy explained earlier is implemented within
MATLAB TM environment. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed method and compare it against existing estimation meth-ods. The proposed algorithm yields the model parameter weights summarised in Table 2 .

Fig. 4 . shows the convergence of the HGA. The minimum mean square error of 10.29 was determined after 70 generations. The value of parameter a k estimated by the proposed method is illustrated in the model parameters. Fig. 6 represents the error variations between the estimated values using the proposed method and the optimal value from the simulation.

In this research a new parameter estimation method was proposed for the estimation of the model parameters. Table 3 summarises the HGA parameters employed in the estimation scheme. 4.2. Validation
Once a parameter estimation method is proposed, it is required to validate whether the method is good enough to estimate the parameters accurately. There are two ways to investigate the validity of an estimation method ( Soderstrom and Stoica, 1984 ). Using plots, visual exploration, and experience; Performing statistical tests on the prediction error.

While visual exploration of the predictions and comparing them against the measured data provide convenient means for model validation, statistical residual analysis (e.g. independence or whiteness tests) provides more concrete means to assess the performance of an estimation algorithm. 4.2.1. Plots and visual exploration
In order to evaluate the proposed method, different types of strips should be employed. As in this paper, four strips of different types are employed for the experiment. Then the results are compared with the measured coiling temperature of the strip points.
 temperature for different types of strips. As can be seen, the proposed method has predicted the coiling temperature of dif-ferent types of strips accurately in Fig. 7 (a) X (d). 4.2.2. Statistical tests
It is known that the auto-correlation and cross-correlation tests are the most useful statistical methods for model validation ( Tavakolpour et al., 2010 ). The auto-correlation and cross-correla-tion tests are carried out to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the auto-correlation and cross-correlation tests are shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b), respectively. 4.3. Comparison and analysis
A question may arise about the performance of the proposed method compared to other existing estimation methods. To address this, a comparative study was carried out between the existing methods and the proposed method. The existing methods ( Tan and Chai, 2005 ; Pian and Chai, 2008 ) and the proposed method were executed 10 times. The maximum of generations was restricted to 120. The estimation scheme was run until the mean square error became less than 10.5.

Table 4 shows the comparative results obtained from the pro-posed method and the existing methods. It can be clearly seen that the proposed method has estimated the model parameters more effectively than the existing methods. The method addressed in ( Tan and Chai, 2005 ) has not achieved the desirable mean square error of 10.5, which may be attributed to the drawback that the weight values are fixed by the expert experience. Fig. 9 shows the estimation error of the parameter a k using the existing methods and the proposed method. The RMS error and maximum absolute error of the three methods in the estimation of parameter a k are shown in
Table 4 .Asshownin Fig. 9 and Table 4 , it is can be seen that the proposed method contributes significant accuracy improvement in the parameter estimation. Moreover, it is fast and effective and may be used in real-time control of strip temperature in the laminar cooling process.

The RMS error and maximum absolute error are defined as follows:
RMSE  X 
MAXE  X  max f : R 1 Y 1 : , : R 2 Y 2 : , , : R I Y I : g X  13  X  where I stands for the number of the cases in test case base.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 196 samples of four strips under different operating conditions are used. Fig. 10 shows the comparison of the estimation error of the coiling temperature among the existing methods and the proposed one. The forecasting results of coiling temperature using the three methods are shown in Table 5 . As shown in Fig. 10 and Table 5 , it can be seen that the average error is 17.28 and 10.53 in Tan and Chai (2005) and Pian and Chai (2008) , respectively, and 118 and 154 segments are controlled in the range of 7 with hit rate of 60.2% and 78.6%, respectively. However, with the proposed method, the average prediction error is 4.69 1 C and the coiling temperatures of 190 segments are controlled in the range of 7 5 1 C with the hit rate of 96.9%. Therefore, experiment results show that the proposed method is effective in the parameter estimation.

A hybrid intelligent method based on grey case-based reason-ing is proposed to estimate the parameters of strip thermody-namic model in HSLC. The problem is formulated as a non-linear optimisation problem. To verify the feasibility, the proposed method was tested on a set of industrial data from HSLC and the results were compared with th e existing parameter estimation methods ( Tan and Chai, 2005 ; Pian and Chai, 2008 ). The proposed method has been found to be more accurate as it gives minimum
RMSE and MAXE than the existing methods. By analysing the results, it can be observed that the proposed parameter estimation method gives better results than other methods. The future work will be focused on the practical application study of the proposed method. Moreover, the computati onal burden of the weight vectors of retrieval features in grey case-b ased reasoning optimised using the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm offline is considerable.
Therefore, the fast hybrid genetic algorithm is still a problem to be solved in future work.

The radiation boundary condition is only applicable in the air cooling section. The transfer coefficient h w is applicable only in the water cooling section and is calculated as follows: h  X  2 "# where N cur stands for the current valve position where the moving strip segment arrives. T , d and v are the strip temperature, the thickness and the moving speed, respectively. v 0 , d 0 and T values of operating points. a k , a v , a d and a T are proportional coefficient, velocity parameter, thickness parameter and tempera-ture parameter, respectively, which are time-varying parameters.
The thermal conductivity coefficients of the top surface and the bottom surface are defined as v ( t ) the strip speed after the finishing mill. D v and c are velocity increment and velocity coefficient, respectively, which are time-varying parameters.
