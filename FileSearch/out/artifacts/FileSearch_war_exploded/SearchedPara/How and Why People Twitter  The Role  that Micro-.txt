 Micro-blogs, a relatively new phenomenon, provide a new com-munication channel for people to br oadcast information that they likely would not share otherwise using existing channels (e.g., email, phone, IM, or weblogs). Micro-blogging has become popu-lar quite quickly, raising its potential for serving as a new informal communication medium at work, providing a variety of impacts on collaborative work (e.g., enhancing information sharing, build-ing common ground, and sustaini ng a feeling of connectedness among colleagues). This exploratory research project is aimed at gaining an in-depth understanding of how and why people use Twitter  X  a popular micro-blogging tool -and exploring micro-blog X  X  potential impacts on info rmal communication at work. J.4 SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES Human Factors Micro-blog, Twitter, Informal Communication Informal communication often c onsists of unplanned and brief  X  X atching-up X  conversations am ong employees in organizations (e.g., water-cooler conversations; [15]). Researchers have sug-gested that informal communicati on at work may play important roles for collaborative work and organizational innovation. It sup-ports sharing of work-relevant information among employees; co-ordination of group activities; creating potential collaboration opportunities; and social functions such as transmission of office culture and maintenance of common ground and a feeling of con-nectedness between co-workers [14,15,19,29]. Through the emer-gence and use of computer-med iated communication technologies (CMC), communication patterns have shifted from primarily face-to-face to significant use of online computer-mediated communi-cation. However, even though CM C has expanded the possibilities for staying in touch with collaborators and thereby increasing productivity, workers continue to suffer from time-famine and have little opportunity for informal exchange with each other, especially with those outside their daily work activities [21]. Researchers studying informal co mmunication have been seeking ways to increase the chances of informal conversations at work. For instance, media richness theory and social presence theory suggest that social cues are bene ficial in promoting spontaneous conversations and that we should be able to design systems that make better use of such cues [ 15,25]. Tool designs guided by the-ory were helpful for increasi ng social presences among co-workers [8,25], however, few empirical studies have yet shown significant impacts of increased social cues in CMC systems on leading to promote impromptu c onversations and informal ex-changes [24]. More recent efforts have shifted the emphasis to social software in organizations, including corporate blogs [7,11,12], social tagging [18,23], a nd social networking sites [5]. Micro-blogging, enabled by a variety of online social networking tools (e.g., Twitter, Jaiku, Pown ce, and Facebook), refers to the activity that users broadcast brief text updates about small little things happening in their daily life and work activities, such as what they are reading, thinking, and experiencing [17]. Micro-blogging is used to achieve a wide variety of social purposes and has been quickly gaining popularity as an option for online social networking. In Twitter.com, people update their daily life activi-ties with friends, families, and co-workers; share information, news, and opinions with interest ed observers; and seek knowledge and expertise in public tweets [ 13,17]. Emotionally, people seem to use micro-blogging to achieve a level of cyberspace presence, being  X  X ut there X  and to feel another layer of connection with friends and the world [17]. The increasingly popular use of micro-blogging for lightweight communica tion in the world of social computing makes it a candidate media for informal communica-tion at work. However, micro-blogs are still a relatively new phenomenon in online social networking, and have received little scholarly atten-tion as yet. In particular, there is no solid understanding of how and why people micro-blog, and there is no research studying the potential impacts of micro-blogging on informal communication at work. The exploratory study reported in this paper takes a step in this direction, seeking to build a rich understanding of why people use micro-blogs and exploring how the characteristics of their micro-blogging behaviors en able informal communication. As mentioned in the prior sec tion, scholars studying informal communication in work settings ha ve emphasized that informal exchanges in opportunistic convers ations (e.g., water-cooler con-versations) among employees in or ganizations play an important role in organizations X  success a nd provide a variety of potential benefits supporting for collaborativ e work [14,15,19,25]. We have organized the benefits discussed for informal communication into relational and personal beneficial consequences (Figure 1). The relational consequences capture the effects that informal commu-nication may have on two persons X  relationship and their future interpersonal activities (e.g., collabor ative work). This consists of building person perceptions of each other, developing common ground, and sustaining a feeling of connectedness with one an-other. The personal consequences capture the benefits that infor-mal communication X  X  may have fo r one X  X  personal interests and goals (e.g., information and knowle dge gained for one X  X  profes-sion and other personal interests; serendipitous collaboration op-portunities). In this section, we re view relevant theories in inter-personal communication and soci al-psychology to expand the theoretical conceptions behind this simple framework. In brief, knowing what others have been doing and thinking and what new things may have ha ppened or are now happening to them may help one to develop more accurate person perceptions of others (e.g., knowing people X  X  competence, personality, behav-ioral characteristics). Person percep tion is an important factor for people making decisions in interacti ons with others, such as seek-ing collaborators for joint projects [15]. Social cognition scholars believe that reality is too complex to fully discern, and that we understand the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality [2]. Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people tend to build a background perception on others and rely on heuristics to save time and energy [6]. In these proc-esses, vivid or highly memorable possibilities are more useful than those that are harder to picture or difficult to remember [2]. Through opportunistic conversations in informal communication, people often hear stories about each other X  X  experiences and thoughts, which may produce a more memorable set of informa-tion to use in constructing sche mas about others. Keeping aware of others X  personal life updates ma y help update people X  X  schemas and build a background perception about a person. Common ground refers to mutual understanding among communi-cators about a fact. Clark X  X  definition of common ground [3] sug-gests that a proposition P is common ground only if all the people conversing know P; and they all know that they all know P. (e.g., I know that you know that I am not a native English speaker). Clark suggested that common ground can be built through a grounding process in conversations, and propos ed that conversants seek to minimize communication effort, which in turn motivates them to develop common ground. The extent to which conversants have developed common ground in previous interactions may affect the efficiency of future communication. In this sense, informal catch-ing-up conversations between colleagues may help to increase awareness of updates about each othe r, so as to better create and maintain common ground. As previous literature has suggested, informal communication may lead to feelings of intimacy and connectedness between col-leagues [19]. This positive emotional feeling that one has for an-other may be important for future interactions and collaboration (e.g., seeking information or help someone at work). Interpersonal attraction theory from social psyc hology may help to explain how informal communication may produce such emotional effects (e.g., intimacy and liking). Interpers onal attraction refers to all of the forces that lead people to like each other, establish relation-ships, and in some cases, fall in love. Several general principles [2] have been discovered by researchers in this area; these include physical proximity, familiarity (i.e., exposure to others X  personal life happenings), and similarity (e.g., similar attitudes, experi-ences, and other traits). Informal communication may promot e feelings of liking another person based on these three prin ciples. Though it may not increase the physical proximity with others who are not in our daily work being there, still there [22]). Keeping in touch with colleagues may increase the chances of sharing personal life updates, and may raise the possibilities for disc overing similar experiences and attitudes (e.g., places both have vis ited, similar reactions to cur-rent events). Informal communication with peopl e at work (both related and unrelated to active projects) can lead to acquisition of valuable information that is beneficial for one X  X  personal work goals. For example, keeping in touch with co-workers from different busi-ness units may help employees acquire new information and knowledge about their professions, ga in different perspectives for their own jobs, and even disc over new collaboration opportunities [14,15,25]. Scholars studying social networks have suggested that a greater proportion of novel information flows to individuals through weak than through strong ties. This is not only because novel (and thus potentially more valuable) information is more likely to be gained from people outside our daily activitie s [9,10], but also that rapid feelings of mutual trust -called  X  X wift X  trust -are more likely to form in weak tie interactions [16]. Weak ties are the most com-mon social relationships that peopl e have in their personal social networks. Thus an increased le vel of informal communication 
Figure 1. Proposed benefits of informal communication throughout one X  X  social network at work may increase the chances of sharing and gaining valuable information. In addition to interpersonal trus t, source credibility is a second criterion used in determining the trustworthiness and value of a piece of information. People must trust that the person they gain the information from has sufficient expertise or credibility [1]. In one X  X  social network, there are often individuals who have com-mon interests (e.g., profession, hobbies) but different specific experiences. Informal conversa tions might often be invoked around shared interests but distinct expertise, so as to increase possibilities of information exchanges that they perceived as valu-able as well as fro m trusted sources. From here, we will turn to reporting our exploratory study. We began with the general expecta tion that lightweight communica-tions like broadcasting and sharing personal life updates in micro-blogging make it a strong candidate for informal communication at work. If so it may produce benefits such as we have described. However, micro-blogging is a relatively new phenomenon in modern online social networking, and we still know little about it. Thus we carried out a qualitative study of employees in a large corporation who have integrated micro-blogging into their own practices, using the Twitter micro-blog tool. Twitter is the most popular micro-blog tool among other existing equivalents and has been featured extensively in the public media; for example it has been used by political campaigns, news organi-zations, and for business communi cations. Yammer is a corporate version of Twitter that provides micro-blog support for a com-pany X  X  internal use. However, Ya mmer is at its early phases: cor-porate users seem to still have c oncerns of whether it is a safe place to post, and it has low participation thus far. The investigation reported in th is paper focuses on less public micro-blogs that are updated by or dinary people for much smaller audiences, rather than the heavily followed micro-blogs like those associated with political campaigns or major news organizations. To study the potential impact of micro-blogging on informal communication in work settings, we needed to focus on ordinary Twitter users who currently wo rk in corporate settings. We used semi-structured interv iew methods. Phone interviews (about 40 to 60 minutes each) we re conducted during September and December 2008 with 11 participants (seven men and four women) from a large IT company; the work roles of participants included both workers and managers in engineering, product man-agement, marketing, and corporate communication. Participants were recruited first through personal contacts in the company; we then used a  X  X nowball X  method, asking each informant to connect us to other Twitter users they know. Pseudonyms are used when discussing comments by specific informants. The interviews were structured by two sets of questions, including (1) people X  X  current micro-blogging practices (characteristics of content shared, what makes them share such information on Twit-ter); and (2) their experiences micro-blogging with co-workers (consequential effects that micr o-blogging have or might have on collaborative work; issues encountered, opinions and anticipated feature needs). Questions were asked from both information sender and receiver perspectives. Participants were also asked more generally about their perceptions of micro-blogs, compared with other communication media av ailable. A complete set of questions used to guide the interviews can be found at our re-search website 1 . The 11 participants had been us ing Twitter for six months to a year. They included six heavy users whose post frequency ranged from 626 to 1552 tweets ( X  X weet X  is the word used to refer to a Twitter posts); they submitted tweet s from 5 to 30 times per week. The remaining five participants were more casual users who posted from 48 to 167 tweets. Seven of the 11 interviews had more than 60 followers (people who subscribe to their Twitter updates), with a range from 67 to 193 (except for Alice, a market-ing director who had 665 followers). Their followers represented a variety of social relationships , including friends; colleagues and business partners from both inside and outside of company; and other interested observers. All used multiple Twitter clients on multiple devices (e.g., PC, Mac, mobile phones), including Twit-terfox for the Firefox browser and Twitterific on mobile phones. Like what Java et al. [13] reported in their study, we found that even in our small sample, there was tremendous diversity in Twit-ter content: personal whereabouts in formation, links to articles and news, and opinions to headlin e news. Our interviewees re-ported using Twitter for a variety of social purposes, including (1) keeping in touch with friends and colleagues; (2) raising visibility of interesting things to one X  X  soci al networks; (3) gathering useful information for one X  X  profession or other personal interests; (4) seeking for helps and opinions; and (5) releasing emotional stress. These motivations seem to be quite similar to purposes reported in studies of other social media for (e.g., IM, Blogs, and RSS), and as such offer little insight about why people use Twitter. Thus we turn now to a discussion of me ssage characteristics and technol-ogy features that seem important to how these users X  have appro-priated micro-blogging into their social lives. Our interest in micro-blogging as informal communication alter-native led us to emphasize how Twitter is used differently from other communication media and how they perceive the unique characteristics of messages shared on Twitter compared with those on other media. Although we have not yet conducted a systematic analysis of the interview transcripts, we have reviewed them to identify ways in which Twitter may be playing a special role in serving informal communication needs. In the following we illus-trate three interesting ways in wh ich our interviewees think about tweets, from both micro-blogger a nd follower perspectives: fre-quent life updates, real-time inform ation, and what we have meta-phorically called people-based RSS feeds. Many of our informants use Twitte r to update others (e.g., friends, colleagues) about interesting th ings happening in their personal lives (e.g., whereabouts, interesting articles read, and thoughts). By staying aware of others X  ongoing updates, people are able to http://cscl.ist.psu.edu/public/use rs/dzhao/Twitter+interview+ques tions keep in touch with friends and main tain social relationships; this is especially important for contacts that are not part of their daily life or work activities. Pete, a busin ess development manager, de-scribed Twitter as  X  X  great tool to allow keeping a pulse on them, whom I don X  X  see all the time X . He said, Tom is a business development manager at the company. Because of job needs, he moved from Seattle to San Francisco two years ago. But he was able to keep up with some friends through Twitter physically 1000 miles away, so that he knows what X  X  been hap-pening in their daily lives. He said, As Nardi [20] found, people blog to provide a record of events in their lives. Some of our informants use Twitter as an alternative to blogging, for keeping track of what they have been doing. Brad, an IT analyst, posts 20-30 times a week, and as he described, many his posts are: Note though that in contrast to blogging, some of our informants reported that they found micro-blogging easier and that they do it more frequently than blogging. Brad said [Brad-2]  X  X t X  X  just a way for me to blog [frequently]. I think I am more able to blog 140 characters than, you know, sit down and compose blogs every-day. X  The easy access to Twitter se rvices encourages people to twitter about interesting things as they happen, rather than waiting and writing a perhaps longer and mo re reflective message later on. Bob, a product solution manager, often uses the camera on his mobile phones to  X  X ake pictures of things [he saw] interesting going on in my daily life and post it X . He often posted tweets to convey  X  X un things different from a normal day X . Bob said, Similarly, Aaron and Delilah, bot h IT engineers, often twittered about interesting articles in the IT industry that they came across when sitting on their desks at work. Tasha and Ray, corporate communication managers, often a ttend external conferences and events, where they twitter about in teresting talks and ideas they encounter. Ray told us that he maintains a private account to share whereabouts information with severa l close friends, for staying in frequent touch with them on Twitter [Ray-1]. In sum, micro-blogging was viewed as a quick and easy way to share interesting and fun things happening in daily life activities; it lets users keep in touch with friends and colleagues, especially who are outside our life cycles. Because the length of tweets are restricted and there is very little overhead to sending or receiving tweets, users see it as a low-cost way to share updates that might otherwise not be seen as worth the effort. People often create Twitter posts as things happen in real time, for example as they are doing some activity, thinking about some-thing, or reading or viewing material. Our informants reported in common that real-time information of this sort is more useful than more outdated comments for both re lational and personal interests. With respect to relational interest s, real-time updates are useful for monitoring changes in context and mental states, and initiating impromptu conversations. Delilah said, Pete reported that monitoring some one X  X  live updates is useful for prompting catching-up conversations and organizing joint events with friends whom he does not see very often. He said: As to personal interests and goals, real-time information is consid-ered much more valuable than older information. Alice, a market-ing director, reports that she often tweets about ideas and thoughts as they fly across her mind in her daily professional observations. She described her twitter habits as Another interesting example was gi ven by Aaron, an IT engineer who works on the company X  X  internal Web 2.0 social software. Aaron needs to frequently gather information about available products and services for his work tasks. He said that  X  X rior to Twitter days X , he usually went to review sites to find this informa-tion; unfortunately those reviews are often months old. Bob reported that he found real-time information more useful when it is about specific things that people are doing or reading, rather than general comments lik e  X  X  went shopping today X . He continues with examples, Real-time information posted th rough micro-blogging is consid-ered a quick and interesting source of news. It can also provide valuable context information that may prompt catching-up con-versations with distant friends and colleagues. Many our informants used Twitter also as a RSS feed for gather-ing information interesting and us eful for their work and other personal interests. Bob describe d this as  X  X eople-based RSS feeds X . He considered informati on gathered in his personal Twitter account as more relevant to his individual interests and as having higher credibility. When asked to compare Twitter with other available tools, like social tagging and bookmarking, Bob said, Many of our informants reported th at they are able to get useful information in Twitter because th ey follow (subscribe to) people with whom they share similar inte rests, either about social hobbies or their professions. Donna, a mark eting manager, said  X  X  follow tea, politics, social media, or people I just like X . She described Twitter as  X  X  fabulous way to keep current on information coming to me without me having to search for it X . According to her, rea-son that Twitter helps is that she can find and follow people who are active in the fields of her interests. Tasha, a corporate communication manager, was able to use Twit-ter to get useful work-related information from researchers and practitioners she met at conferences. She once went to a social media conference last year in San Francisco. As she described, Similarly, Delilah, an IT manager, often needs to keep an eye on new web services that are availa ble and might be useful for her work purposes. She found that Twitter was useful for keeping track of current threads among many emerging new services by following others who are active in the field. From an information sender X  X  perspective, the fact that Twitter content is perceived as containing valuable content is tied to the fact that people tend to tweet when they consider their content to be interesting or useful to others . Many of our informants reported that they often tweet when they are reading or seeing something really interesting. Aaron said,  X  X ypically when I am reading or seeing something that I think is absolutely wonderful, I just re-tweet X . Pete is quite interested in politics and sometimes tweets about it. He gave this as an example, Similarly Donna said she tends to tweet more about interesting things from her personal observati on than about daily routines. Micro-blogging is useful for gathering valuable information for people X  X  personal work and other in terests. From an information provider X  X  perspective, this is because users often share a piece of information when they find it very interesting and useful. From a reader X  X  perspective, informati on posted by a person the reader has deliberately selected to follow is perceived as useful and trustworthy. In the following section, we will discuss the technol-ogy characteristics of micro-blog that makes our informants use and perceive Twitter differently from other CMC tools. In the previous section, we de scribed several interesting commu-nication behaviors found across pe ople who use Twitter. Frequent updates of interesting things in personal life activities allow users to keep a pulse on what is going on in others X  minds and maintain social relationships with friends and colleagues who are outside their life cycles. People use Twitte r for gathering useful informa-tion for their personal interests ( both work and life interests) be-cause content shared is real-time, from people who share similar interests, and is trustable in formation from one X  X  personal net-works. We turn now to a discussion drawn from informants X  re-ports about how micro-blog technologies powered by Twitter help to afford these communication behaviors. We found the following technology characteristics that might help to further explain why people use Twitter for informal communication. From a micro-blogger X  X  perspec tive, a 140-character limitation on text messages is a good thing. This feature helps reduce the cost of sharing, as summarized by Aaron:  X  X f I am doing something, my effort to share it with someone should be minimum. X  Similarly as what we have reported in [Brad-2] previously, in comparison with blogging, Aaron described his pref erence to use micro-blogging to share interesting things and opinions with friends. In addition to ease of use, some informants suggested that the brevity feature also helps make information more concise, a pos-sible benefit from the reader X  X  perspective. For example, Tom said  X  X he fact that is limited to 140 characters also requires you to pro-vide a little more thought to what you say and economy of words to be used X . Similarly, Donna said As a reader, the brevity of Tw itter posts makes it efficient to browse large amount of updates. For example, Tom said, Similarly, Donna said that  X  X ne th ing I like is that, it is short, you are not forced to read a lot and you can get a lot of information in a short amount of time. X  In addition, she believed that  X  X ecause it is short, you are forced to get into the point X . Similarly, some informants reported that, compared with the limited view provided by RSS reader tools, posts by a real person tend to be not only brief, but well-crafted and right to the point. Easy access to Twitter services is another important technology feature that allows users to post updates frequently and in real time. Tasha reported that  X  X  proba bly use 5 or 6 tools, depending on which platform I am on, whethe r it X  X  Mac or PC, or iPhone, or sometimes just on the website, if I am not on one of my devices X . Similarly, most of our informants used a variety of Twitter ser-vices on multiple devices and reported that the pervasive access to Twitter makes it easy to update as th ings happen, so that they are more likely to do it frequently (as we have already illustrated in [Bob-1]). Aaron said, The flexible access to Twitter also makes it easy and convenient for readers to monitor others X  updates. Zack, a marketing man-ager, often is in meetings all day. He has found it very convenient to have Twitter on his Blackberry, so that he can check new in-formation, as he described,  X  X he never I got a moment in-between meetings X  [Zack-1]. Tasha is a corporate communication manager, as we mentioned before. Part of her job is to post questions and ask opinions to her group through various media. She found it often to be quicker to gather feedback from Twitter. She said, The broadcasting nature that micro-blogging inherits from the blog paradigm makes it easy for people to share and check posts. As information producers, micro-bloggers broadcast interesting things on their own channel to their  X  X ubscribed X  audience. These are often small little things happening in their daily lives, such as where they will hang out tonight, interesting news or articles they have found, or work status like  X  X een writing a CHI paper X . This information is modest enough that they probably would not bother to select recipients for sending via IM or email. As Bob described, Twitter is good at broadcasting thi ngs that he found interesting, but with unknown beneficiaries. When asked to compare his mi-cro-blogging with phone, IM, and email, he said, Similarly, Tom implied that the voluntary readership made him broadcast and share things with less concern than when he uses other media. He said, Some informants also found the broadcasting and voluntary listen-ing nature in Twitter useful for releasing emotional stress. For example, Pete said, In addition to helping reduce the cognitive threshold for people to share, broadcasting simply makes it easier to reach a lot of people relative to some other communicati on media, as many of our in-formants reported. For example, Donna said that  X  X f you use email, you may have to broadcast to a huge list, and I think it is very very impersonal. If you use phone, you can never get to eve-rybody at one time. X  From a reader X  X  perspective, just as people choose radio channels to listen to, Twitter users choose to subscribe to people X  X  tweets based on similar interests, as we have illustrated in [Donna-1, Tasha-1, and Delilah-2]. Tasha described the subscribing feature in Twitter as,  X  X t provides me a filter for the best types of informa-tion in the topics that I am most interested in. Because, more of-ten, the people that I monitor in Twitter are people who have simi-lar interests with me, so I find them very valuable X . The subscrib-ing feature also increases the per ceived credibility of a subscribed information source (as illustrated in [Bob-3]). Tom described this as,  X  X f I choose to follow somebody, and I know that person has established himself in that area, then I don X  X  have to worry about the types of content I am gonna get from him X . The open subscription feature in Twitter not only allows users to find interesting people to follow for exchange of information and thoughts, but may also help to es tablish valuable personal rela-tionships for future collaborations . Tom told us an amazing story about such an experience. A wh ile ago, he tweeted about a book that he was reading and liked a lot. Natasha, a social constructer, was reading the book at the similar period of time. She found Tom X  X  tweets about the book very interesting and they started following each other on Twitter. Natasha worked on a project with the Kenyan government working to pull Kenya people out of pov-erty through ICT. Several months later, Natasha sent Tom a mes-sage on Twitter asking whether she could talk with him to learn more about Tom X  X  company before her meeting with executives of the company about the Kenya project. After the meeting with Tom, Natasha invited him to the executive briefing and also in-vited him as a representative from the company working on the Kenya project. In Tom X  X  words Voluntary readership also helps reduce cognitive cost for users to browse and keep up with the large amount of updates on Twitter, compared with cognitive overload often perceived by email users [4]. As Nardi [20] found about blogging in general, voluntary readership allows users to check others X  updates at their own con-venience, is not intrusive (no one is forced to pay attention), and no one needs to respond unless they wish to. As Pete put it [Pete-1], Twitter is a great tool for monitoring and keeping a pulse on friends, and reaching out to them only if you find any of their posts interesting. When asked to compare with keeping up with messages in email inbox, Donna said [Donna-4]  X  X ecause it is only 140 characters, you just do the quickest look, interested or not interested, I mean it is just so easy X . Donna X  X  comment also implies that browsing Twitter updates is easier than reading mes-sages in email inbox, not only because the messages are short and easy to scan, but also because they entail no action implications; reading and responding is volunt ary and action takes place only when there is a specific interest. As discussed in prior sections , micro-blogging was useful for keeping in touch with friends a nd colleagues, and in gathering useful information for work and pe rsonal interest. In this section, we turn to a discussion of the potential impacts that micro-blogging might have on informal communication at work. We do this by returning to the conceptual framework offered in section 2, using our findings of Twitter use a nd experiences to illustrate the framework. When asked specifically how he thought micro-blogging might influence him at work, Pete suggested that it would help him to keep in touch with colleagues whom he didn X  X  see all the time at work. He said, [Pete-5]  X  X t may not replace the water-cooler conversations, but it de finitely helps. There are some people that I actively follow and communicate with through Twit-ter, who are probably within 100 feet of me geographically that I never see. X  As we have found previously, Twitter is useful for keeping a pulse on what is on others X  minds and knowing their personal life up-dates. Therefore, micro-bloggi ng may contribute vivid content useful in constructing person sc hemas as well as building back-ground perceptions of others to reduce social cognitive cost in interaction. This suggests that micro-blogging may complement other social software (e.g., blogs, SNSs) in organizations, as a way of getting to know a colleague as a person and learn about his or her interests as well as work responsibilities, e.g., Bob had some experiences of Twitter X  X  impact on learning about team members in his virtual team. Bob works in a virtual team with members from different sites around the world. They once had a persistent chat room open a ll day for them to exchange in-formation about what they have been working on. However he found Twitter to be better for starti ng a water-cooler conversation, Similarly, Donna follows a large number of people at her com-pany, and she said that she learned a lot more about who a person is by what they tweet. As she described it,  X  X  think it makes the person more human, than just professional carbon unit X . Pat, Donna X  X  previous boss at the company, was one of the colleagues she followed in the organization. In the story that we have descri bed previously in [Tom-4] about Natasha inviting Tom into her Kenya project, Tom told us that this collaboration opportunity not only came through a personal rela-tionship built between him and Nata sha, but also because she was able to get to know him from his Twitter updates. We found that micro-blogging was useful for increasing aware-ness of what is on each others X  mind; this in turn implies that it may help to generate more common ground that can be used to support future conversations. Pete thought that in accomplishing any job with multiple people, it has a lot to do with the relationships and common ground devel-oped between the people. He gave a personal experience of this in Twitter use, Zack worked in a marketing gr oup, and several members in the group that he follows on Twitter often post industry news and articles. He said that he replie s to a co-worker X  X  update or opinion sometimes just as an alert that he read it, or sometimes to convey that he agrees with it to a great er or lesser extent [Zack-2]. As we discussed in section 2, f eelings of connectedness might be facilitated by proximity, similarity, and exposure to personal events. The real-time personal updates found in Twitter may help sustain a virtual feeling of proximity (i.e., being there, still there), enable more chances of exposure to what is on others X  minds and what they have been doing, and provide possibilities to explore similar experiences and attitudes with each other. Delilah, one of our informants, reported that, through monitoring others X  personal updates,  X  X ou ki nd of know them, before you start the conversation for the first time, so that the conversation is easier to get started and flow X  [Delilah-3]. Another example was given by Tom. Most of Tom X  X  team members use Twitter. During Nov 2008, Tom was part of a fund-raising project for a child can-cer association. He used Twitter to ask people to donate money, and to share the status of the project. He said, An experience from Brad told us that micro-blogging may in-crease the chances to exchange so cial supports and build intimacy among co-workers. He reported that [Brad-3]  X  X or instance, I updated about that I am staying late at work, and my manager commented that I appreciate your hard work, you know something like that, my manager is great! X  In a word, micro-blogging may help colleagues to know each other better as a person in additi on to professional relationships, through being aware more of their personal life updates, their interests, and current mood. Keeping aware of what each other have been thinking, reading, and doing helps create more oppor-tunities of exchanging acknowledge ments, social supports and building common ground. Through such informal social ex-changes, it may help build intimacy between colleagues and sus-tain a feeling of connectedness that is beneficial for work collabo-ration in future. Information and knowledge sharing has been a critical issue in organizations. Practitioners and re searchers have long sought in-centives that would lead employ ees to share knowledge and valu-able information; incentives are needed because information shar-ing often involves extra effort by a worker. The technology char-acteristics of micro-blogging (e.g., brevity, mobility, broadcast nature) may offer ways to reduce us ers X  cost of sharing, and thus make it easier for other employees to obtaining useful and trust-worthy information. Donna followed several people in Twitter who work in marketing departments from differe nt business units. They all share an inter-est in social media and post quite a bit about what they read and think in the field, such that they exchange information and share perspectives from a variety of work contexts. She said,  X  X  am very fortunate to have some people w ho are at very different experi-ence sites than I am, but are really fascinating people. X  She con-tinues by giving an example of reading tweets from a marketing contractor who works for another business unit. When asked about the potential impact of micro-blogging on in-formation sharing at work, Delilah thought it might increase the role of serendipity. She said, Similarly, Tom said that, in a very large company, it is very hard to navigate through the organizati on structure to create alignments. He thought that micro-blogging might help get a stream of what people are working on so as to foster and inspire the ability to find collaborative opportunities that we might not find without it. Though Yammer, a corporate version of Twitter, aims to provide such support by asking users to update  X  X hat they are working on X , Tom said that the issue with Yammer is lack of critical mass and participation in the organiza tion. Tom X  X  virtual team tried Yammer for exchanging work rela ted information. He said, Pete thought that Twitter-like communication technology may help expertise seeking. He said, Alice thought that micro-blogs might help senior managers to send down strategic information (e.g., what they think are priorities for the company to work on) to their group members. In sum, people use Twitter at work to keep up with what X  X  new and what X  X  happening with one a nother, and to share and ex-change information needed. It provides a new informal communi-cation channel complementary to other media (e.g., IM, email, phone, F-to-F, and other social tools). Although Twitter is being used to serve a variety of informal communication goals, the technology supporting micro-blogging still has issues associated with its use, especially for work pur-poses. We turn now to a discussi on of some of these issues. Some informants reported that they might share even more work-related updates and would like to be aware of similar things from co-workers, if Twitter could be a safe place to post inside the company X  X  firewall. For example, Zack gave a scenario [Zack-3] that a salesman could provide an update of  X  X orking on a Pepsi project X , and others who know about Pepsi or have worked with Pepsi in different ways may repl y to him, and further conversa-tions may be invoked. However, people hesitate to mention pro-ject-or client-specific information on a public feed. Though Yammer (lack of participation currently), a corporate version of Twitter, provides micro-blog support for a company X  X  internal use, some informants still worried whether it would be a safe place to explicitly discuss bus iness-sensitive information. For instance Delilah said, [Delilah-5]  X  X owever, you still need to be careful what you say, we are not sure whether someone outside the company will come to look at our conversations, unless it is inside our firewall X . As Bob described [Bob-4], Twitter was helpful for getting to know his virtual team members as real persons (e.g., knowing about their personal social life); however he also emphasized that one reason members post about pe rsonal lives on Twitter is be-cause the audience is a blend of work colleagues and friends. This implies that integration of mi cro-blogging inside and outside a company will be another challenge . A sales manager may want to use micro-blogging to maintain awareness with his co-workers inside the company, but also keep in touch with sales partners and other friends outside the company. As we mentioned in [Ray-1] previously, Ray maintains two Twit-ter accounts, one for tweeting a bout work and another one for tweeting about social life. Howeve r, he has also found it to be very hard to separate work and social updates, Another challenge for micro-blogs at work is that users might end up following a large number of people and groups, to gather as much work-related information and expertise seeking as possible. One consequence from a readers X  perspective is that there may be cognitive overload for monitoring a large number of people and keeping up with great amount of daily updates, not unlike what people now experience with email. Brad reported that sometimes he feels annoyed by people who twitter too much and he would like to have a filtering function that allows him to create a page of updates based on his current contexts and interests. For example, he said,  X  X hen I am in LA, I want to group my friends down there, because it X  X  more relevant X . Privacy would be another consequential concern for corporate use of micro-blogs. In Twitter, subs cribing to one X  X  updates is open without permission approval, and the system sends a user X  X  up-dates to all his/her subscribers. An employee may have concerns about what to update if his boss is in this subscription list. A man-ager may hesitate to update because he may not want all his team members to know what he has b een doing. As Donna, a marketing manager, said,  X  X f you use Twitter to communicate within your own team, I think I have a problem with that. I see what happens is that everybody is following you is going to see all those tweets X . And she would like to have a way to create different circles, so that in each circle she might decide who may follow her updates. This feature need might be achieved by providing users easy ways of grouping recipients for broadcasting different types of informa-tion. In this paper, we reported an e xploratory study, which we hope to be helpful for providing a better understanding of why ordinary people use Twitter, and for shedding some light on the possible role that micro-blogging might play on informal communication at work. Our analysis points to several characteristics of the mes-sages shared in micro-blogging, as well as other features that seem to be more technology-related, that take us part of the way toward understanding why and how people d ecide to post or browse mi-cro-blog updates. For example, fre quent small updates of personal life events, one of the unique characteristics of content shared on Twitter, enabled our informants to  X  X eep a pulse X  on people they do not encounter in their daily life activities. Because micro-blogging tends to happen in real time, Twitter posts were consid-ered more valuable than other me dia for connecting information to personal goals, for knowing what is on others X  minds at this mo-ment, and for prompting opportunis tic conversations. The concept of a  X  X eople-based RSS feed X  was another characteristic described by our participants; they were ab le to get trustworthy and useful information from people who they know personally and elected to  X  X ollow X . Often these individuals are selected because they share similar interests with the subscr iber. Other important characteris-tics were attributed the nature of micro-blogging, for example the enforced message brevity, access mobility, and its broadcast na-ture. These technology characteristics were found useful for re-ducing our informants X  cost of sharing and promoting more fre-quent updates in real-time, as we ll as making it easier for users to browse and monitor large amount of information updates. A conceptual framework was offe red in the paper for studying possible beneficial consequences of informal communication; we used this framework to consider how our interviewees X  comments might illustrate the impacts that micro-blogging may have on informal communication at work. Our results suggest that micro-blogging may help colleagues to know each other better as per-sons, that is in addition to profe ssional relationships; this benefit is achieved by staying aware of sma ll details about others X  personal lives, interests, and current moods , which in turn creates more opportunities for exchanging acknow ledgements and social sup-port, generating new common ground, and creating and sustaining a feeling of connectedness. All of these can enhance colleagues X  efforts toward future collaboration at work. Even though we have identified characteristics of Twitter behavior that may enhance informal communication, we also have seen that there are challenges in realizing these benefits as broadly as possi-ble. Twitter makes it easy to share and gathering useful and valu-able information for personal inte rests, but employees are leery about sharing everything without knowing that the content is man-aged securely within organiza tion X  X  firewall. As micro-blogging grows in popularity, new needs for update management, filtering, and inter-connection may be requi red to help in managing the costs of staying up to date, even given the brevity and pointedness of most micro-blog messages. Th ere is also a lingering question about the boundary between work and personal content  X  one irony is that micro-blog characteristics that help build person per-ceptions and promote feelings of connectedness in a work setting may also blur the distinction between work and leisure, and it is not clear what the implications of this will be in the longer term. To sum up, our informants X  comme nts suggested that micro-blogs might indeed be one mechanis m for generating virtual water-cooler conversations, and that th e low cost of micro-blogging may promote it as a new informal communication channel that com-plements other forms of interaction (e.g., IM, email, phone, face-to-face, other social computing tools). However the technology is still new and its ultimate impact is subject to participation and critical mass (e.g., Yammer has not yet built a user population). In addition to providing a rich description of a group of work-based Twitter users, we have raised a number of issues and design im-plications that may contribute to improved support for micro-blogging in organizational use contexts. In our own future work we will be continuing to expa nd our understanding of micro-blog practices, but at the same time begin to work from our current understanding toward the development of micro-blogging support that supports informal communication at work.
