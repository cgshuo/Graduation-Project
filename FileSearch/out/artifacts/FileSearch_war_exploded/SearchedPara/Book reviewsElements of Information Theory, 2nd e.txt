 Elements of Information Theory, 2nd ed., Thomas M. Cover, Joy A. Thomas, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (2006)
Although information theory has existed formally for the last 50 years, the mathematical framework in which it operates continues to be studied by educators and students alike. While some researchers charge that the theory is a mathematical one rather than an actual theory of information, it has inarguably become a pop-ular framework in which to quantify and measure the concept of information (Case, 2002). Consequently, information theory has emerged as a core foundation for the communications industry (i.e., computer science and thermodynamics), due largely to Claude Shannon X  X  early research of signal transmission (Gallistel, 2003).
Thus, the basic foundations and assumptions of information theory continue to be studied by educators and students alike in many mathematically-grounded disciplines.

This book, first published in 1991 and based on 10 years of classroom lectures, is intended to be an intro-ductory classroom textbook in which students of communication theory, computer science, and statistics can discover and explore the answers to fundamental questions arising from information theory. The authors examine information theory on two levels: first (and more briefly), on a disciplinary level, in which older and recently-developed coding theorems associated with information theory are deconstructed through an interdisciplinary lens; and second, on a mathematical level, by which algebraic notations and structures are used to demonstrate key ideas. For example, Cover and Thomas, in drawing on Shannon X  X  early work (1948), present answers to theoretic problems in the form of algebraic formulas so that students can develop and maintain a logical approach to solving those problems. Accordingly, the material in the book is ordered in such a way that the learning process easily is accommodated, thus fulfilling a reasonable expectation of any classroom textbook. The authors recommend that the book be taught in a semester-long class, with the first nine chapters covered in the first quarter of a semester, and the remaining eight chapters covered in the second quarter.

The book contains 17 chapters that cover fundamental concepts associated with information theory; each chapter is accompanied by problems that instructors can assign to students. The first nine chapters focus on central problems of communication, which are derived from the Shannon model of signal transmission. As expected, entropy serves as the main backdrop of the entire book; asymptotic equipartition, data compression, channel capacity, and the Gaussian channel are the major properties and methods discussed throughout these first nine chapters. Additionally, the authors use Shannon X  X  research as a framework to establish rationales for the definitions and algebraic structures used therein (although the authors do maintain that in this book, infor-mation theory is an entity separate from Shannon X  X  work).

The final eight chapters cover several theories, including rate distortion theory and information theory and statistics. These last chapters also emphasize material that has been added to the second edition, including universal source coding (Chapter 13), network information theory (Chapter 15), and portfolio theory (Chap-ter 16). While focusing on theory in later chapters seems counter-intuitive to the learning and teaching process, the approach is a sensible one in this context, since the later chapters provide students with intellectual space in which to place coding theorems learned in earlier chapters.

The authors point out that although the fundamental aims of the book abide, the second edition contains additions and changes that have been made since publication of the first edition. For example, 200 new prob-lems have been added, while many of the proofs have been simplified; as the authors note, these additions and changes arise from wishing to update and expand the first edition. Additionally, the authors have reorganized the chapters in order to create a more teachable textbook, and have provided an updated reference list.
Finally, given its complex mathematical framework, this book noticeably is intended for students of mathe-matically-based disciplines, with specific attention geared toward those in communication theory, computer science, and statistics. Therefore, it is not an ideal choice by instructors for students who are interested in or curious about information theory but who do not have the academic or professional background necessary to sustain a successful learning experience.

Like these other volumes, Stimulated Recall and Mental Models is a vehicle for illustrating a particular methodology in order to demonstrate its potential and to show how to design, conduct, and report research according to its theoretical stance and characteristic procedures. The book begins with an over-view of the study itself (Chapter 1); provides a review of the research literature on mental models (Chapter 2); argues for using stimulated recall to uncover the complexity of these constructs (Chapter 3); presents case studies of the two teacher-librarians who represent opposite ends of the continuum of mental models identified through the study (Chapters 4 and 5); compares the two cases to show how stimulated recall revealed the differences between them (Chapter 6); and concludes by discussing the implica-tions of the study and of stimulated recall itself for understanding and applying mental models in teaching (Chapter 7).
