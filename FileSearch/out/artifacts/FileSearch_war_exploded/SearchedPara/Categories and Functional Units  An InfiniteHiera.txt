Our model consists of three main components: ( a and  X  variables in the model. 2.1 Nonparametric Hierarchical Co-clustering Model Let x subject j . The co-clustering model describes the distribution of vox el activations x voxels within functional unit k have the same probability  X  category l of stimuli. Let z = { z and c = { c co-clustering assumes: The set  X  = {  X  summarizes the structure in the responses of voxels to stimu li.

Accordingly, measured signal y voxel i of subject j at time t is modeled as: where G or a linear temporal trend, at time t and  X  throughout that  X  to stimulus s can be estimated by solving the least squares regression pro blem. i is activated by stimulus s , i.e., if x voxel-specific amplitude of response; otherwise, its respo nse remains 0 . We can write b and assume that a binary activation variable x different subjects, sessions, and experiments.
 We assume the following priors on voxel response variables: where Normal 2.3 Algorithm weights  X  = {  X  observed variables. Here, v = { v expected value with respect to distribution q . We assume a distribution q of the form: q ( h ) = q ( r | z ) Y present the update rules and their derivations in the Supple mentary Material. we estimate b to values between 0 and 1 using the voxel-wise maximum and minimum. We use the estimat es of by one in random order to the collapsed Gibbs sampling scheme [18] constructed for our model regression on the data. We demonstrate the performance of the model and the inference algorithm on both synthetic and real data. As a base-line algorithm for comparison, we use the Block Average Co-clustering (BAC) al-gorithm [6] with the Euclidean distance.
 First, we show that the hierarchical struc-ture of our algorithm enables us to retrieve the cluster membership more accurately in synthetic group data. Then, we present the results of our method in an fMRI study of visual object recognition. 3.1 Synthetic Data  X  = 3 ,  X  = 100 ,  X  = 1 , and  X  1 =  X  2 = 1 , N j = 1000 voxels, S = 100 stimuli, and J = 4 We use the least squares estimates of voxel responses ( b our algorithm is always initialized with 15 clusters.
 measures take values between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to perfect clustering. 3.2 Experiment space [24]. We removed noisy voxels from the analysis by perf orming an ANOVA test and only can examine the consistency of our stimulus categorization with respect to identical trials. We use  X  = 100 ,  X  = 5 ,  X  = 0 . 1 , and  X  together in category 3 while tools are mainly found in catego ry 6.
