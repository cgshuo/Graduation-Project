 Recommendation for cold users is fairly challenging because no prior rating can be used in preference prediction. To tackle this cold-start scenario, rating elicitation is usually employed through an initial interview in which users are queried by some carefully selected items. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to mine the most valuable items to construct query set using a semi-supervised discriminative selection (SSDS) model. To learn a low dimensional repre-sentation for users in item space which can reflect their tastes to a large extent, the model incorporates category labels as discriminative information. To ensure the used labels reli-able as well as all users considered, the model utilizes a semi-supervised scheme leveraging expert guidance with graph regularization. Experimental results on real-world dataset MovieLens demonstrate that the proposed SSDS model out-performs traditional preference elicitation methods on top-N measures for cold-start recommendation.

With the prevalence of massive web 2.0 applications, on-line information for a large variety of items is growing rapid-ly. Recommender systems, as important tools for informa-tion filtering, have received success in many famous com-mercial websites such as Amazon, Netflix and Last.fm. Most of these websites are based on Collaborative Filtering(CF) which is a widely used recommendation approach. The basic hypothesis of CF is that similar users have similar responses to similar items. However, it is difficult to compute similari-ty for users without any observed rating, thus CF would fail in this cold-start scenario. In general, recommendation for new users is quite challenging.

Existing studies on cold-start problem mainly focus on three different strategies. The first strategy is extracting la-tent features via auxiliary social relations instead of directly exploiting CF [5, 3]. The second one is mapping addition-al attributes from user profiles into a latent feature space such that the lacked rating records can be compensated [1]. One limitation of these methods is that the user profile and social connection are usually personal and not always avail-able. Hence many recommender systems resort to an alter-native strategy named Rating Elicitation which solicits user preference by initial interview process on some items [4, 2, 6]. On the one hand, rating elicitation admits an overal-l tendency that the more ratings requested from users the better recommendations are. On the other hand, different observed rating sets might lead to significantly different rec-ommendation performance. Consequently, for the purpose of constructing a most valuable query set to interview cold users, the essential goal of preference elicitation is item s-election by making full use of available information in the system.

In this paper, our item selection model is developed on the basis of the following two concerns. From the perspective of elicitation mechanism, the qualified items in query set should largely reflect user taste on diverse items of multiple genres. The reason is natural. If the interests on categories are captured, it would be much easier to comprehensively understand user preference such as to return an appealing item list. Moreover, from the perspective of user modeling, since there is no extra information to describe user except observed ratings, the rating vectors can be viewed as a sort of representation for users. The problem of item selection is converted to the problem of learning a low dimensional representation which can embody user preference as much as possible.

For above two considerations, we incorporate category la-bels as discriminative information to guide the representa-tive item selection. Particularly, the user category labels are inferred by rating matrix and item category relations. Here we only utilize the category labels of partial users( experts ) to make sure labels are trustworthy. In addition, to take advantage of unlabeled user data, a graph regularization is employed. Therefore, a Semi-Supervised Discriminative Se-lection(SSDS) framework is proposed for preference elicita-tion to integrate discriminative and semi-supervised compo-nents by combining expert guidance and graph constraint together.

As aforementioned, the output of SSDS model is the se-lected representative items. Ratings on them are regarded as new descriptions of users in a low dimensional space. Final-ly, ranking scores are generated for cold users through these learned user representations as well as the original rating matrix.
Let U = { u 1 ,  X  X  X  ,u n } be the user collection and V = { v 1 ,  X  X  X  ,v m } be the item collection. Normally, tradition-al elicitation model have an observed rating matrix R = ( r 1 ,  X  X  X  , r n )  X  R m  X  n as input. Due to high data sparsity in a real world scenario, there exists large amounts of missing value in each column r i , and most of the items are not pop-ular. Thereby a candidate pool V p = { v 1 ,  X  X  X  ,v m p } m p &lt;m is constructed by filtering out the long-tailed item-s. Then X =( x 1 ,  X  X  X  , x n )  X  R m p  X  n is the submatrix of R where each column x i corresponds to ratings user u i given to candidate pool V p and is deemed as item representation for u i .

Suppose there are k categories in the given dataset, C = { c 1 ,  X  X  X  ,c k } is the category label set. Let X l =( x 1 ,  X  X  X  ,  X  R m p  X  n l with n l &lt;n denote rating matrix for labeled user-s. Y l  X  R n l  X  k denote user-category matrix where Y l ( 1ifuser u i is interested in category c j ,and0otherwise. A toy example of data resources is depicted in Figure 1. Note that the labeled user set U l is a small subset of U , which con-sists of only active users in each category and is regarded as informative experts .

Based on above notations, the problem of item selection canbestatedas: givenratingmatrix X forwarmuserset U , rating matrix X l and label matrix Y l for expert set U the goal is to select most representative item set V s from candidate pool V p by building an item selection model f as
In order to capture preference for cold users, an intuitive scheme is using most discriminative items as queries which can express users X  attitude to wards items of different cate-gories, thus user category labels are embedded into our s-election model. Concretely, a user who has a quantity of ratings in certain category suggests that the user may be interested in the category. Yet, there is no sufficient rating for most users to determine their loved categories. Instead, labels of experts are utilized as selection guidance, and thus the correctness of used labels can be guaranteed. With representation matrix X l and category label matrix Y l for experts predefined, the selection procedure can be for-mulated as the following 2 , 1 -norm regularized least squares regression problem: Figure 1: A toy example of data resources. X and X l are representation matrices for all users and experts respectively, Y l is expert label matrix, and x n +1 is interview result related with cold user. where P  X  R m p  X  k is a mapping matrix to find a low di-mensional subspace such that the disagreement of predicted preference over categories and their true labels is minimized.  X  is the parameter of 2 , 1 -norm regularization. P 2 , 1 is de-fined as where 2 , 1 -norm constrains the sparsity of item dimension and inclines to select items by jointly considering regression task on k categories.
However, the supervised setting of selection model might suffer overfitting problem for unlabeled data because of mere-ly taking ratings of experts into account. To overcome this limitation, unlabeled users should be concerned. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised method to integrate graph regularization into the above selection model, which is pre-sented as where  X  is a weight to control the strength of graph regu-larization. In particular, we construct an undirected graph G with adjacency matrix S for both labeled and unlabeled users. The nodes in G correspond to user representation { x 1 ,  X  X  X  , x n } . The adjacency matrix S is computed by co-sine similarity based on the following rule,
S ( i, i )= where N ( x i ) denote the nearest neighbor set of x i .The assumption under graph regularization in Eq.(3) is that if two users are similar in representation space, their category labels should also be similar .
 Using Laplacian matrix L S = D S  X  S in Eq.(3) where D
S ( i, i )= j S ( i, j ) is a diagonal matrix, the SSDS model combined expert guidance with graph regularization can be finally written as
To optimize the unified objective function in Eq.(5), we convert the first term into tr (  X  ) and discard the constant term tr ( Y T l Y l ). The minimization problem becomes where G = X l X T l +  X  XL S X T and H = Y T l X T l .Toobtain the optimal solution for P , the derivative of the objective function in Eq.(6) is set as  X  J ( P )  X  P =0. Then P is presented as where D P is a diagonal matrix with D P ( i, i )= 1 2 P ( i, :) can be proved that G +  X  D P is a positive definite matrix, thus the inverse in Eq.(7) exist. Since D P is dependent to P , P and D P can be updated alternatively until convergence. The detailed optimization algorithm for SSDS is described in Algorithm 1.

Once representative items are selected, for a new user, an interview process is conducted by offering questions with the learned items aiming to elicit preference efficiently. Further-more, to recommend items, a r anking estimation method is introduced to predict possible rankings towards the whole item set V .

Without loss of generality, a new user can be denoted as u n +1 . After interview process, one new column x n +1 is gen-erated. Next, we place emphasis on utilizing representative item set V s , observed rating matrix R and representation vector x n +1 in cold-start recommendation. Inspired by low-rank matrix factorization, a global optimal formulation is developed which solves a loading matrix W  X  R K  X  m by where X = X ( V s , :) is new matrix description for user set basedonselecteditems V s . Similarly, u n +1 also has x n +1 Accordingly, the solution of W is given by Where I  X  R K  X  K is an identity matrix. When there is a new user, the personalized ranking score is eventually computed by r n +1 =( W  X  ) T x n +1 . Notice that the loading matrix can be pre-computed and thus our model is consistent with online-updating principle of real-world systems.
 Table 1: Comparison of Different Selection Strate-gies for Cold-Start Recommendation( n l =50 , X  =0 . 1 )
In order to evaluate how SSDS behaves on user cold-start recommendation, we conduct experiments using a bench-mark dataset MovieLens. The dataset includes one million observed ratings ranged from 1 to 5 points which are given by 6,040 users to 3,952 movies. Besides, category informa-tion about movies is available. To simulate cold users, 20% users are randomly picked from the whole user set. Then to test the cold-start recommendation results, an 80-20 split is used for each cold user, where 80% ratings are randomly chosen as the response set to answer queries during inter-view while the rest of 20% ratings is test set. The experi-ments are set up as 5-fold cross-validation. The parameter  X  in Eq.(8) and the size of the nearest neighbor set are re-spectively determined on MovieLens data as 0.1 and 10 by cross-validation. We also choose items owned more than 500 ratings to construct the candidate pool V p .
After SSDS-based preference elicitation, ranking scores are predicted. The performance can be measured by three classical evaluation metrics in top-N recommendation:
Mean Average Precision(MAP) .Foreachuser,Av-erage Precision(AP) is first defined as where prec( i ) is precision and pref( i ) is a binary preference indicator at ranked position i . MAP is computed based on AP by the following equation Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain(NDCG) .
 For a ranked list of N item, NDCG is computed by where IDCG is produced by a perfect ranking algorithm. Figure 2: Performance Variation of SSDS with re-spect to expert number n l and query number K
Precision . If an item is contained in the test set, we consider that it is correctly predicted. Prec@N evaluates the ratio of correctly predicted items in top-N lists. In our work, we report results for Prec@5.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSDS model, we compare it with several traditional query selection methods for cold-start problem including random, popular, k-medoids strategies. It is worth to notice that we combine the same cold-start recommendation approach introduced in Section 3 with all above selection methods. The experimen-tal results are shown in Table 1. To make a fair comparison, there are two different popular strategies used here. The first one(popular 1) is a query list which is comprised of popular items extracted from multiple categories to make sure diver-sity of query list, while the other one(popular 2) is normal popular set without considering category information.
Because rating elicitation aims to minimize user interac-tion costs at the same time im proving recommendation ac-curacy, the length of the interview is the pivotal parameter in our work. To avoid boring interviews, we vary the query number K from 10 to 30. The overall trend of recommen-dation correctness along with the interview process can be observed.
 For all compared methods, the performance increases when K is expanded. This phenomenon confirms a basic fact: the more ratings are elicited from the users, the more effective the recommendations are. On the other hand, these method-s are not equally efficient for learning user preference. Specif-ically, two points could be inferred by comparing the per-formance of these methods: 1. Random strategy performs severely worse than other strategies, which empirically prove the necessity of designing an appropriate selection model. 2. SSDS model yields best performance under all of the e-valuation conditions, which verify that our semi-supervised discriminative selection framework can do benefits on iden-tifying more informative items than other methods and then boost cold-start recommendation accuracy.

Additionally, to assess influence of the two fundamental components of SSDS: expert guidance and graph regulariza-tion, we study the impact of parameters. Correspondingly, the two important parameters of SSDS are the number of experts n l and weight of regularization term  X  .Thereby, we analyze each of them by keeping the other one fixed. Firstly, fixed  X  as  X  =0 . 1 and given the query number K  X  X  10 , 20 , 30 } , the performance variation with respect to n l is shown in Figure 2. When n l is increasing, both MAP and NDCG first increase until reach peaks and then drop. The main reason behind this observation is: At the Figure 3: Performance Variation of SSDS with re-spect to graph weight  X  and query number K beginning, adding more labeled users can provide more dis-criminative information so as to help us finding a better user representation in item space. Nevertheless, with the num-ber of labeled users growing, some untrustworthy labels are mixed into discriminative information and finally result in the accuracy declining.

Secondly, fixed n l as n l = 50 and still given the query number K  X  X  10 , 20 , 30 } , the performance variation with respect to  X  is illustrated in Figure 3.  X  is varied from the range { 0 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 , 1 } where larger  X  of graph constraint on users who are similar in rating behav-iors. From the figure we can see that, even though it achieves the best point when  X  is at different value, it is clearly that the performance upgrades on the basis of the model without graph regularization(  X  = 0). Especially, the improvement is significantly when the interview is short( K = 10).
In this paper, we propose a novel query selection frame-work for preference elicitation. By using semi-supervised and discriminative information, our model tends to select representative item set which can describe user preference on diverse categories comprehensively. Experimental results on benchmark movie rating dataset show that the proposed query selection model produces more accurate recommenda-tion for cold users than competitors.
