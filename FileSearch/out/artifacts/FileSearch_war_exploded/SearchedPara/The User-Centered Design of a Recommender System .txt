 This paper describes a collaborative project between the University of Sheffield X  X  iSchool and OCLC (an international library cooperative), the aim of which is to develop a prototype recommender system for WorldCat.org, the aggregated catalogue of OCLC X  X  member libraries. This paper describes a user-centered approach, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, which aims to establish how and why users engage with library catalogues and WorldCat.org in particular, whether there is a need for recommendations in the library domain, and if so what type of recommendations best support the information-seeking needs of users. An outline of the proposed methodology is provided, along with a report on work completed to date. An analysis of UK library catalogues shows the prevalence of recommender systems to be very low, while initial results from focus group interviews and a pop-up survey show a significant demand for recommendations from two key user-groups (students and academics).

The problem of information overload, identified as a key issue for information seekers, is one that particularly applies to the library community. The huge growth in av ailable resources has led to a wealth of accessible information with the potential to inform scholarship and facilitate teaching and research, while the provision of that information over the web has dramatically increased the range and scope of services available to users [18]. Despite these undoubted benefits, however, it has become increasingly clear that traditional models of information retrieval frequently fail to best connect users with potentially relevant material. As Baez et al note, the sheer volume of available material often demands that searches are narrowed to identify core resources rather than broadened to take in potentially useful but perhaps ill-defined items [3]. This is exacerbated by the increasing preference of users  X  born out of practice and familiarity -for self guided web-based searches, bypassing the traditional role of the librarian or information professional [14]. Furthermore in an increasingly competitive information market-place, institutions are becoming ever more conscious of the need for their services to match the expectations of users in both appearance and functionality. The application of recommender sy stems to diverse library and research systems is potentially a key step towards ensuring that all types of library users are properly serviced, as a growing body of evidence suggests that recommender systems can help users find and use information more efficiently [14, 18]. This raises several key questions for researchers seek ing to apply the principles of recommendation to the library domain. Since such applications are required to serve a diverse community of users, previous implementations have tended to orientate themselves towards a generic user model [2]  X  a problem given the increasingly diverse user-base [13]. That this divers ity is manifest not only in a demographic sense, but also from a task-orientated perspective, further complicates the development of systems that can truly be described as  X  X seful X   X  in othe r words closely attuned to the context of the search [14]. This AHRC funded research proj ect represents a collaborative venture between the University of Sheffield X  X  iSchool, and OCLC (the International library consor tium), and forms the basis of the author X  X  doctoral thesis. We aim to explore the role of recommendations in a library context, with the goal of producing a prototype system for WorldCat.org. The principle research questions for the project are defined as follows: The objectives for the research are: OCLC is an international not-for-profit library cooperative. Founded in 1967 by a consortium of Ohio libraries, its purpose was to  X  X reate a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world X  X  information and reducing info rmation costs X  [9]. Most importantly this meant the devel opment of a networked platform on which to build shared resources, thereby increasing access to information while lowering ope rational costs among member libraries. Today OCLC has more than 72,000 member libraries in 170 countries. OCLC X  X  operations cover a broad range of activities, including the provision of library management systems, library advocacy, research and product development, and cataloguing services. Aside from its ownership of the Dewey Decimal Classification system, it is perhaps best known for WorldCat.org 1 , the aggregated catalogue of the holdings of its member libraries. Representing the largest bibliographic database in the world, WorldCat contains more than 250 million bibliographic records and more than 1.8 billion holdings. This catalogue is publically accessible via a web interface (see Figure 1). Users of this service can search the catalogue and access a range of supplementary information about items, including reviews and ratings (both user generated and imported from third parties), links to online retailers selling the item, and related content based on cla ssification number. Users are also able to create customized lists of items. While these features are visible to all users, creation of a WorldCat.org account is required in order to add tags and reviews, and create lists. At present the number of accounts created as a proportion of the total user-base is low, with a significant majority of users accessing the system without logging in. http://www.worldcat.org There are a number of existing recommender systems within the library domain. Significant work has been done with regards to the recommendation of journal articles, with two principle methods being employed. Systems such as TechLens [18] and Synthese [15] supply the user with recommendations through traditional collaborative filtering algorithms utilizing citation data in lieu of user generated ratings. Taking a different approach, Ex Libris X  bX service mines link resolver logs to identify articles downloaded by individual users during the same session, and uses this data to infer relationships between items [16]. It has been suggested that recommender systems powered by access data generate more diverse and interesting recommendations  X  particularly for newly published pa pers [11]. Interestingly it has also been shown that the two methods  X  citation based and usage based  X  demonstrate a high level of complimentarity; not only does testing show that they rarely provide the same recommendations, but they can rarely both provide recommendations related to a given specific article [16]. Several relatively recent projects have also attempted to implement OPAC (Online Public Access Catalogue) recommendation functions. The University of Huddersfield in the UK has developed a system that mi nes circulation logs to present users viewing an item on the catalogue with suggested alternatives [10], while the BibTip project utilizes three software agents to build recommendations based on implicitly inferred data [7]. An Observation Agent observes all the titles selected within each discrete user session, passing the data to an Aggregation Agent which collates co-occurrences and builds links between items. Finally a R ecommendation Agent mines these links to provide recommendations to users in the form of hypertext links in the browser. A third model for providing OPAC recommendations is provided by Library Thing For Libraries (LTFL). Library Thing is an online service allowing members to catalogue their book collections, and supplement this catalogue with a wide array of ratings, re views and tags. LTFL is sold to libraries as an OPAC overlay, using a small piece of JavaScript to query Library Thing  X  X  database for the ISBN of the item being viewed in the OPAC. Relevant tags, reviews and recommendations are then exported to the OPAC interface and can be viewed by the user. As the title of this project indicat es, a key feature of the proposed system development process is that it should be  X  X ser-centered X . User Centered Design (UCD) de scribes a design process  X  X n which users have a deep impact on the design by being involved as partners with designers th roughout the design process X  [1]. Seen as particularly relevant to the development of technological innovations, and as originally proposed by Norman and Draper [8], the primary purpose of UCD is to ensure that finished products combine optimal functi onality with intuitive usability. At the heart of all UCD processes is a focus on engaging with users to understand their n eeds and requirements. In accordance with these principl es our initial work has been focused on better understanding the users of WorldCat.org, establishing whether there a demand for recommendations, and if so identifying the type of tasks that recommendations can support. To this end a series of Focus Groups with WorldCat.org users have been conducted, and a pop-up survey attached to WorldCat.org (see section 5). Furthermore OCLC have provided access to WorldCat.org transaction logs, which will be the subject of analysis on two counts; as a m eans of further investigating user behaviour within the system, a nd as a potential data source for developing recommendations (see section 6). It is hoped that the first stage of analysis can provide greater clarity about the types of tasks undertaken on the system , and provide more data about the prevalence of known item vs subject searching. The results of this research w ill feed into an iterative system design process that will evaluate potential data sources and produce a prototype system for testing and evaluation. In order to ascertain the extent to which recommendation feature in current library catalogues, a comparison of UK OPACS was undertaken [17]. 118 University and 211 Local Council library OPACS were analyzed, and the incidence of recommendations noted. For the purposes of this study, a recommendation was characterized as: The presentation to the user of one or more specific resources not directly related to the rankin g of the search results, and not requiring the use of a faceted browsing function (e.g.  X  X ind more by this author X ). Results showed that only 11% (n=13) of University OPACS and 2% (n=4) of public library OPACS offer recommendations, indicating that the the incorporation of recommendations into the OPAC is extremely limited. While these results can partly be explained by the prevalence of legacy Library Management Systems unable to support recommender functionality, it also appears that librarians have yet to persuaded that the value of and demand for recommender systems justifies their implementation becoming a priority. Focus group research offers  X  X  way of collecting qualitative data, which  X  essentially  X  involves engaging a small number of people in an informal group discussion (or discussion),  X  X ocused X  around a particular topic or set of issues X  X 19]. Focus groups constitute an established methodology within Li brary and Information Science [12], and a number of previous studies have used the methodology to investigate the use of online catalogues [4, 6]. The research was conducted in three stages, based on geographical location: Australia and New Zealand (21 March  X  8 April 2011), the UK (9  X  17 May 2011) and the US (25  X  27 October 2011). Participants were drawn from four of WorldCat.org X  X  main user-groups; Librarians, Students, Academics and Booksellers. 21 focus group interviews were conducted, with a total of 118 participants. The questions posed were deliberately broad, and aime d to explore how and why users engage with WorldCat.org, what they perceived as its strengths and weaknesses, and how they believed the system could be improved. Recommender systems were not explicitly mentioned recommender functionality to support specific information-seeking tasks (specifically rela ting to subject searches) among several key user-groups, particul arly students and academics. The full results of the research are currently being prepared for publication. To determine the make-up of the WorldCat.org user-base, and to obtain quantitative data about the types of task the site is used for, a pop-up survey was developed for WorldCat.org, and offered to users between 4  X  19 April 2012. In addition to gathering basic demographic information, the survey attempted to identify the purpose and context for the user X  X  engagement with the system, and explored their views on the utility of recommendations. A total of 2,917 users completed the survey. Initial findings suggest a significant demand for recommendations, with 65% of respondents who accessed the survey from the WorldCat.org homepage stating that some form of recommendations would be useful. Further analysis is underw ay, and it is hoped that the data will reveal the types of users and tasks that can be best supported by recommendations. The following work will be undertaken in the remaining eighteen months of this project: Based on the findings of the user-centred research, one or more experiments will be developed th at investigate how users of online library catalogues respond to recommendations in a variety of contexts. These experiments w ill consist of giving participants a number of information seeking scenarios, and asking them to rate or rank various recommendation lists, each generated by different existing book recommender sy stems. In order to control variables, a basic web interface w ill be developed to display the recommendations to participants , thereby negating the potential influence of interface design. The development of the scenarios and the selection of participants will be heavily influenced by the data collected in the first stage of the research. It is also possible that the raw rating or ranking data generated during the experiment can be supplemented w ith the participants X  reflections on the exercises  X  perhaps during a post-experiment interview or questionnaire. The low number of users with WorldCat.org accounts is likely to represent a significant challenge for the prototype design, since the system will have only very limited data about the user for most sessions. Given these limitati ons, a key aspect of the design process will be the extent to which a variety of information seeking contexts can be supported. A number of potential data sources for recommendation generati on have been identified, and will be evaluated according to the user needs revealed in earlier phases of the project. These data sources include selected library circulation records, WorldCat.org transaction logs, explicit user ratings, OCLC member library holdings, and a variety of metadata fields that supplement item records within the catalogue. The results of this evaluation will inform not only system design, but also allow for the selection of a subset of WorldCat.org holdings for the prototype system to work on. It is anticipated that the design will be an iterative proce ss, with additional user testing being conducted to refine th e recommendation algorithm and interface design. OCLC have committed the time of one software engineer to assist with system development. Once complete, it is hoped that the prototype system will be tested and evaluated in a usability laboratory setting, either at the University of Sheffield or the OCLC headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. Although a variety of approaches to recommendation in the library domain have been attempted, the prevalence of systems in public access catalogues remains low. This suggests that library professionals remain to be convi nced that such systems offer enough value to users to justify th eir implementation. In taking a highly user-centered approach to the development of a recommender system for a library catalogue, it is anticipated that this project will go some way to establishing recommender functionality as an important facet of library systems. It is also hoped that the methodology used can be employed in other domains, particularly those in which recommender systems have not previously been widely applied, and for systems where recommendations must be made with only minimal data about individual users.
