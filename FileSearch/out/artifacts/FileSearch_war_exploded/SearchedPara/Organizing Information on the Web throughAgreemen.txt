 The Web contains vast amounts of potentially useful information on a variety of topics. Web search engines such as Googl e help users to locate documents that are relevant to their topics of interest, however, they often generate millions of hits, and it is infeasible for users to check them all. Faced with an overflow of data, users rely on search engine ranking to act as a filter.

Although the relevance between a user X  s query and the documents retrieved is reflected in search engine ranking, so me users may misinter pret this ranking as an indication of credibility or trustworthiness, Fallows [8] found that over 1/4 of Web users surveyed selected a searc h engine X  X  first results because they thought it was most trustworthy. This misunderstanding gives users who only read the top search results a skewed impression of the information available on a given topic, as they may miss important information, such as conflicting opinions, buried in the search results. In order to find reliable information and come to a deep understanding about the query, users must survey and evaluate the documents. However, there is often too much information to be manually feasible. A technological solution is needed to help users organize information on the Web.

To support users in organizing information, a typical approach is information classification and the most popular criteria is sentiment polarity. There has been a lot of research on classifying documents based on sentiment polarity [30,26,24]. A commonplace example of this is the classification of product reviews into positive and negative categories. Such classifications make it easy for users to evaluate a product X  X  reputation. The study we report in this paper aims at going a step further by generalizing the previous sentiment-oriented classification approaches. We consider a natural language proposition as a user X  X  query, and classify and organize information based on the semantic relation between the query and each relevant document.

Fig. 1 shows an example screenshot from our Japanese Information Organi-zation System for the query,  X  X ybrid c ars are good for the environment. X  Our system retrieves relevant sentences and classifies them as either Agreement or Conflict based on their relation to the query. For example,  X  X ybrid cars limit emissions and gas usage X  agrees with the query and  X  X he more you drive a hy-brid car, the more damage it does to the environment X  conflicts with it. Finally, a bird X  X -eye-view of the agreeing and co nflicting sentences is shown to the user. In the bird X  X -eye-view, sentences whic h agree with the query are classified into Agreement and shown in a red column on the left, and sentences which are conflicting to the query are classified into Conflict andareshowninablue column on the right. To give users an idea of the factual support for each po-sition, Evidence relations for Agreement and Conflict are also displayed. For example,  X  X ybrid cars use an electric motor to reduce gas usage, X  is evi-dence for  X  X o they are good for the environment X  and is highlighted. Below each relevant sentence, a hyperlink to its sour ce page is given, and summaries of the total number of sentences for each viewpoint are given, making the amount of support clear at a glance. Sentences are ordered by a confidence score, ensuring that the most relevant and reliable information is given the most visible position.
Organizing information based on Agreement -vs-Conflict relations to a given natural language propositional query can be considered as a generaliza-tion of previous sentiment-oriented classification approaches. For example, find-ing positive and negative reviews for a given product can be achieved by querying  X (product name) is good. X  Organizing such sentiment information in terms of product features (attributes) can be ac hieved by issuing more specific queries such as  X (product name) is good for the environment. X  as is the example in Fig. 1. More importantly, information organization based on Agreement -vs-Conflict relations can also handle issues which cannot be captured by sen-timent orientation. For example, the query  X  X olar ice caps are melting X  is not a matter of good or bad but rather a matter of true or false. Agreement -vs-Conflict -based information organization with propositional queries can deal with such a broad range of cases in a uniform manner.

In order to detect the Agreement and Conflict relations necessary for information organization, we frame our task as an extension of Recognizing Textual Entailment (hereafter  X  X TE X , [5]), whose goal is detecting entailment or contradiction relations between texts. We treat the former relation as Agree-ment and the latter as Conflict and construct machin e learning models to automatically detect thes e relations between user queries and Web texts. In this paper, we implement an Information Organization System that uses RTE technology to automatically detect and organize Web texts relevant to a user query into agreeing and conflicting g roups. To evaluate our system, we per-form two kinds of evaluation. First, we empirically evaluate relation classification performance on a large, open dataset of real world Web texts consisting of 1,467 query-sentence pairs, taki ng care to use different queries for development and evaluation. Then, we conduct a large-scale usability study with 112 participants to determine the effectiveness of our syst em for information organization. The study participants were selected in a manner such that they have no knowledge of our research goals and do not exhibit any bias toward our system.
Our major findings are two-fold. First, classification performance evaluation showed that our system X  X  RTE-based semantic relation recognition, when cou-pled with ranking by classification confidence scores, is sufficient to construct a usable information organization system. In addition, study participants re-ported that looking at visualizations of the viewpoints on a query lead to a deeper understanding of the query, indicating that users were receptive to our approach. These results support the view that exposing lay users to different opinions reduces confirmation bias [15,4].

Our primary contributions are: the development of an information organi-zation system that automatically generates viewpoint visualizations from user queries, an investigation of the level of performance of state-of-the-art RTE tech-nology on Web data, and a large-scale usability study of the effectiveness of our system for information visualization.
 Sentence Retrieval In this section, we describe our approach to organizing information on the Web. When a user enters a query into our system , relevant documents can be retrieved using an existing web search engine. Then if the semantic relation between the query and the relevant sentence can be recognized, the organized viewpoint visualization (shown in Fig. 1) is easy to generate. Therefore, the most important factor to be discussed is how to recognize the semantic relations between a query and a relevant sentence.

We employed the technology of RTE, a widely-researched topic in the field of natural language processing. The RTE Challenge [5] is a major task where two sentences are classified into Entailment , Contradiction ,or Other .
Before describing how to apply the RTE technology to organize information, we need to clarify what sentences are the ta rget of semantic relation classification. While in RTE, entailment is judged between hypothesis ( H )and text ( T ), we use a natural language query ( Q ) and a retrieved sentence ( T ). Q and T are classified into one of four relations: Agreement , Conflict , Evidence or Other .
The RTE Challenge has successfully employed a variety of techniques in order to recognize instances of textual enta ilment, including methods based on: mea-suring the degree of lexical overlap bet ween bag of words [10,31], the alignment of graphs created from syntactic or semantic dependencies [19,18], statistical classifiers which leverage a wide range of fe atures [12], or reference rule genera-tion [29]. In the RTE-5 [2], Iftene et al. [14] achieved 68.33% accuracy. In spite of the high accuracy on the RTE Challenge, as de Marneffe et al. [6] found in their experiments that RTE on Web text s that real world settings were much more challenging, reporting that  X  In a real world setting, it is likely that the contradiction rate is extremely low  X .

We tackle this problem by limiting queries to simple clauses. This means that Q consists of a single predicate and its arguments, as in Mineral water is safer than tap water . In RTE it is not enough to consider whether the infor-mation contained in H is also contained in T , it is also necessary to determine what information could be ignored to recognize entailment. In our case, if Q is a simple clause, the contained informati on is limited so there is no need to consider what information to ignore in order to detect our target semantic relations.
An overview of our Information Organization System is given in Fig. 2. A short description is as follows. A simple clause natural language sentence is taken as input. Then sentences relevant to the query are retrieved. Finally, the sys-tem recognizes semantic relation between the query and the retrieved sentences, organizes the sentences by relation type , and shows the user a bird X  X -eye-view visualization (Fig. 1).
 Sentence Retrieval We retrieve sentences that are relevant to the user query using the TSUBAKI search engine [27] and apply the following heuristics to filter out noise. 1. the sentence contains context all nouns in query 2. the sentence length is greater than 20 words and less than 150 3. the sentence must be a well-formed sentence 4. the part of speech of the last word must be a verb, auxiliary verb, or adjective 5. the sentence contains less than t hree post-positional particles Because Q consists of a single predicate and its arguments, the purpose of the filter 1 is to obtain a variety of relevant predicates. The purpose of the other filters is to exclude malformed sentences.
 Linguistic Analysis In order to identify semantic relations between Q and T , we first conduct syntactic and semantic linguistic analysis to provide a basis for alignment and relation classification. For syntactic analysis, we use the Japanese dependency parser CaboCha [17] and the predicate-argument structure analyzer ChaPAS [32]. CaboCha splits the Japanese text into phrase-like units called chunks and represents syntactic dependencies between the chunks as edges in a graph. ChaPAS identifies predicate-argument structures in the dependency graph produced by CaboCha. We also conduct extended modality analysis us-ing the resources provided by Matsuyoshi et al. [20], focusing on source, time, modality and polarity because such information provides important clues for the recognition of semantic relations. We conduct sentiment polarity analysis of each word in Q and T using the resources [16,13].
 Corresponding Portion Detection Corresponding portions between Q and T are detected based on word similarity. When the content words in corresponding chunks are identical or semantically similar then they are aligned. We use the following resources to determine semantic similarity. When a pair of chunks ,one from Q and the other from T , is found in one of the resources, the chunks are aligned. The chunks are matched against the resources using a character bi-gram cosine-based similarity measure [23].
 Ontologies. We use the Japanese WordNet [3] and Sumida et al.  X  X  [28] to Predicate databases. To determine if two predicates are semantically related, Semantic Relation Recognition. Once the alignments are successfully identi-fied, the task of semantic relation classification is straightforward. We solve this problem with machine learning by training linear classifier [9]. We used an L2-regularized logistic regression model. As features, we draw on a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic information including the alignments from the previous section. The feature set is as follows: alignments. We define binary function, ALIGN word ( q i ,t m )tobetrueifand modality. This feature encodes the possible modalities of predicate nodes. Moods antonym. The feature indicates if a given pair is an antonym. This information negation. To identify negations, we primarily rely on a predicate X  X  Actuality Evidence Detection. Evidence is identified in Web text after it has been clas-sified into one of the query X  X  viewpoints. Identification is treated as a discourse processing task where presence of explicit cues are used to indicate the presence of
Evidence . For example, in the following example, the cue because indicates that Xylitol is effective at preventing cavities is supporting evidence of the cavity-causing bacteria streptococcus mutans cannot metabolize it .  X  Xylitol is effective at preventing cavities because the cavity-causing bacteria streptococcus mutans cannot metabolize it.
 Visualization. Visualization is carried out as described in Section 1. Our goal in evaluating the semantic relation recognition performance is to deter-mine the feasibility of applying RTE technology to the information organization task. We also conducted evaluation with a subset of the evaluation data manu-ally annotated with correct alignments (called  X  X old X  in Table 1) to determine the upper bound to semantic rela tion recognition performance. 3.1 Evaluation Data Murakami et al. [22] constructed 370 Q -T pairs, however their data is small and consisted of only 5 queries. This is insufficient to represent the variety of possible topics in real Web data. Furthermore, their dataset has not been publicly released. Therefore, we constructed a new, open data set consisting of 20 queries. The new evaluation data set consists of 1,467 Q -T pairs including 1,467 in-stances consisting of 524 Agreement instances (i.e. 524 pairs of Q -T ), 205 Conflict , 131 Evidence , and 607 Other instances. Annotation was car-ried out by two native speakers of Japanese with an inter-annotator agree-ment kappa score of 0.72. The data set is publicly available for download at http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/stmap/ .

The queries are created by an annotator who does not concern the develop-ment of our system. A criterion of constr ucting query is described as following.  X  The query is a simple clause as described in Section 2  X  When considering query as a question, it must be answerable as a yes-or-no question.  X  There must be both agreeing and conflicting opinions for the query on the
Web.  X  There must be scientific evidence for bot h agreeing and conflicting opinions. In other words, queries which are not supported scientifically such as superstition are excluded.  X  The actual truth of the query does not matter. It can be either true or false. 3.2 Evaluation Results We conduct 10-fold cross validation over the 20 query open data set described above. In each fold, query-text pairs from 18 queries were used for training, and the other two queries were used for evaluation.

The results are given in Table 1. setting indicates alignment setting ( Gold is the result of using correct alignments) and # indicates the number of Q -T pairs. In the setting System , while Agreement is identified with high precision and recall, the performance of Conflict and Evidence are limited. In spite of the limited performance, our goal to organize information is achieved as described in Section 4
To investigate the source of errors, we randomly sampled 10% of instances from the data set and manually annotated them with alignment information. On this data set with correct alignment information, we conducted a 10-fold cross validation, where the correct alignment information was used in both training and testing. The results are shown in the rows indicated by Gold in Table 1. These results show a substantial gain was obtained particularly for Conflict when the system was given correct alignments 1 . These results suggest that it is crucial to further address the issue of alignment in order to improve the overall performance for relation classification. A breakthrough in alignment performance could help make our system practical for arbitrary, user-g enerated queries. We conducted a usability study to gain an understanding of the issues that need consideration when deploying an information organization system to real Web users and to provide further evaluation of semantic relation classification in a real world application.

In the usability study, participants were asked to compare our system to existing web search engine 2 in investigating topics with diverse viewpoints on the Web. We prepared 54 user queries in the same way as described in Section 3.1 that can be categorized into three topics: Society , Health ,and Environment . Example queries are shown as follows. We recruited 112 Japanese adults (62 males and 50 females) ranging from 20 to 70 years in age. Almost all participants identified themselves as daily Internet users. In order to avoid bias toward our system, we employed participants in-directly through a recruiting agency, having the agency conduct the evaluation and distribute a survey on completion.
 Before starting evaluation, the study pa rticipants freely selected 4 queries. Then, in order to avoid bias from system o rdering, they alte rnated the order of system evaluation between each query. Upon completion of the evaluation task, participants answered a two-question s urvey, rating each system on the Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). (1) Could you find texts on the Web that agrees and disagrees with the query? (2) Could you find texts that contain evidence that supports or opposes the agree The results are given in Table 2. They show that satisfaction with our system was greater for both questions. Responses to question (1) showed that over 84.8% of users found the Agreement and Conflict viewpoints useful, and question (2) showed that 55.4% of users found Evidence detection useful.

Despite the limited performance of our system in Table 1, it was still found more useful than the web search engine for identifying different viewpoints and their support. We offer two theories for this. First, the classified opinions shown to users are sorted by the system X  X  classification confidence level, so many incor-rectly classified results were likely not appeared in the top of the output. Second, users may have been able to find enough results which they knew were correct to give our system the edge in evaluation.

Study participants were also given an opportunity to give feedback during the survey. We received positive responses such as  X  X he system is useful for finding various viewpoints on the topic. X  and  X  X he system helps me organize and understand information from various sources. X  , showing that participants found the goal of Web information organization to be meaningful. For the question  X  X o you want to continue to use this system? X  , 70% of the participants responded in the affirmative. This percentage includes people who want to use the system together with the web search engine.

Another response showed that classifying the viewpoints instead of ranking search results is better suited to analyzing information credibility:  X  X hile in Google, I only look some high-ranked results, prevent me from noticing minor viewpoints, but the [Information Organization] system is useful for objective thinking because it gives each viewpoint an equal rank. X  We also received some negative responses concerning user interface problems. The majority referred to trivial issues such colors and font size, however, some raised issues about how the presentation could influence how it is perceived by users. In particular, this important response indicated that displaying informa-tion about viewpoint size could create bias toward popular ones:  X  X he number of opinions seems to indicate that the majority viewpoint is correct. X  These sort of comments indicate that the study participants naturally understood what our system was displaying without explanation. While further evaluation is needed to determine the best way of visualizing results, these comments indicate that our approach to information is promising.

Several users expressed the desire to use our system to find viewpoints on ar-bitrary topics. This raises the question of how search queries should be generated from user input and is an area that requires investigation.

Other responses indicated the importance of identifying the author of texts:  X  X  want only trustworthy sources. X  and  X  X here are many untrustworthy sources such as weblogs. X  Detecting authorship is also important for recognizing Evidence and needs more focus in information organization.
 There have been several studies on classifying search results into a fixed set of categories. For example, [30,26,24] classify documents by sentiment polarity. The WISDOM project [1] represents a more sophisticated approach as it clas-sifies documents both by sentiment polarity and by source category. In both classification approaches, the system classifies a set of documents or sentences relevant to the users X  queries into different categories. However, because these approaches do not explicitly consider th e relation between document and query, their scope is limited. In order to handle a broader range of queries, for example, why question or yes-or-no questions, we need deeper semantic analysis.
To the best of our knowledge, the only o ther system that classifies and orga-nizes search results by agreement-conflict relations with the query is Murakami et al. [22]. They addressed the problem of information credibility analysis. For that purpose, they constructed a system that searches for agreeing and conflict-ing sentences for a given query. In this r espect, our system can be seen as similar in nature to their relation classification system. However, they do not address the task of visualizing and presenting to users the results of information organization, and their classification evaluation was limited by their small, closed dataset. In contrast, in this study, we focus on investigating how the state-of-the-art RTE technology performs on large-scale Web data, and we explore its feasibility as a backbone for information organization by implementing a end-to-end system including a user interface and visualization of information organization results and evaluating it in a large-scale usability study with over 100 participants.
Paul et al. [25] also address the task of classifying and summarizing docu-ments by agreement-conflict relations, and they develop a method of identifying representative viewpoints from each gr oup. However, their works assumes a col-lection of documents for a given controversial topic has already been gathered; they do not have any Web search integration or user evaluation.
 Another related project addressing the d etection of conflicting relation on the Web is Dispute Finder [7]. This project shows users who are browsing the Web a list of known conflicts whenever a disputed statement is encountered. Dispute Finder builds a database of disputed claims by allowing its users to identify disputed claims on the Web and link them to a trusted source of rebuttal. The goals of Dispute Finder and our system are similar, but Dispute Finder relies on crowd-sourcing to build its dispute database which limits its automation poten-tial, while we use deep natural language processing technology to automatically identify conflicts. Helping users make sense of the many opinions on the Web is an important and challenging task. In this paper, we presented an information organization sys-tem that uses state-of-the-art RTE technology to automatically recognize and classify Web texts that are relevant to u ser queries into agreeing and conflicting groups. In evaluating our system on a new, open data set that is representative of real world Web data, we found that current RTE technology, when coupled with classification confidence level-based scoring, provides sufficient performance to construct a usable system. In conducting a large-scale usability study, we found that our system stood up to the challenge of practical application. Study par-ticipants reported that looking at visualizations of the viewpoints on a query lead to a deeper understanding of the query, indicating that users were recep-tive to our approach. These results support the view that exposing lay users to different opinions reduces confirmation bias . In addition, user feedback also showed that there are still practical issu es in displaying viewpoint information and automatic query generation that n eed to be addressed to build a practical tool for information organization.
