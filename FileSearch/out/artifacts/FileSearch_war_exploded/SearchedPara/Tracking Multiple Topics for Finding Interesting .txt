 We introduce multiple topic tracking (MTT) for iScore to better recommend news articles for users with multiple interests and to address changes in user interests over time. As an extension of the basic Rocchio algorithm, traditional topic detection and tracking, and single-pass clustering, MTT maintains multiple interest profiles to identify interesting articles for a specific user given user-feedback. Focusing on only inte resting topics enables iScore to discard useless profiles to addr ess changes in user interests and to achieve a balance between resource consumption and classification accuracy. Also by relating a topic X  X  interestingness to an article X  X  interestingness, iS core is able to achieve higher quality results than traditional methods such as the Rocchio algorithm. We identify several operating parameters that work well for MTT. Using the same parameters, we s how that MTT alone yields high quality results for recommending interesting articles from several corpora. The inclusion of MTT improves iScore X  X  performance by 9% in recommending news artic les from the Yahoo! News RSS feeds and the TREC11 adaptive filter article collection. And through a small user study, we show that iScore can still perform well when only provided with little user feedback.

News filtering, personaliza tion, news recommendation An explosive growth of online news has taken place in the last few years. Users are inundated with thousands of news articles, only some of which are interesting. A system to filter out uninteresting articles would aid users that need to read and analyze many news articles daily, such as financial analysts, government officials, and news reporters. In [1], iScore is introduced to address how interesting articles can be identified in a continuous stream of news articles. Instead of applying the most na X ve approach for news filtering, which is to learn keywords of interest for a user [2-4], iScore tries to identify the multitude of characteristics that make an article interesting for a specific user. In iScore, a variety of features are extracted from each article, ranging from topic relevancy to source reputation. The combination of multiple features yields higher quality results for identifying interesting articles for different users than traditional methods, such as the Rocchio algorithm [5]. Despite incorporating other article features in addition to relevancy to topics of interest , iScore still performs poorly with users that have very general inte rests (as opposed to very specific interests). iScore addresses re levancy by using the output of classifiers (e.g., Rocchio) that maintain a single interest profile. Unfortunately, iScore suffers when a user has a set of interests that are orthogonal to one another, which cannot be accurately represented by a single interest pr ofile. In this paper, we extend iScore to address this shortc oming by extending the traditional Rocchio algorithm by using multiple profile vectors instead of one. This is a similar technique used in topic detection and tracking (TDT) [6], but applied to an online personalized news recommendation setting. Unlike in a TDT environment, where all new topics are identified and continually tracked by identifying their related articles, identifying interesting articles for a specific interest to a user; second, a user X  X  interest in a topic continually changes overtime. A topic that ma y have been interesting in the past may not be interesting in the future. Addressing these two distinc tions between TDT and news recommendation and the shortfall of the existing iScore system, we make the following contributions: In this paper, we extend iScore [1] to better handle multiple user interests. iScore is a recommendation system in a limited user environment. In addition to iScore , there are a variety of different news recommendation systems. Work by [7] ranks news articles and new sources based on several properties in an online method. They claim that important news articles are clustered. They also claim that mutual reinforcement between news articles and news s ources can be used for ranking, and that fresh news stories shoul d be considered more important than old ones. In our approach , we rank news articles based on various properties in an online method, but instead of ranking articles using mutual reinforcement and article freshness, we study a different variety of features. Additionally, when training our classifiers, we also take in to account freshness by considering the most recent news articles as more important than older ones. Other systems perform clustering or classification based on the article X  X  content, computing such values as TF-IDF weights for tokens. A near neighbor text classi fier [4] uses a document vector space model. A personalized multi-document summarization and recommendation system by [8] recommends articles by suggesting articles from the same clusters in which past interesting articles are located . Another clustering approach, MiTAP [9] monitors infectious disease outbreaks and other global events. Multiple information s ources are captured, filtered, translated, summarized, and categorized by disease, region, information source, person, and organization. However, users must still browse through the diffe rent categories for interesting articles. Unlike [8] and [9], the multiple topic tracking (MTT) presented here and used by iScore clusters news articles in an online fashion as documents arrive and as the user interacts with iScore. Instead of pre-computing cl usters of all doc uments, iScore only computes centroids of cluste rs of interesting articles as articles arrive on the document stream. In other words, the clusters are user-specific, as interesting articles differ from user to user. Furthermore, in MTT, each cluster, which represents a topic of interest, has an associated interestingness value which is continually updated. Using this topic interestingness and an article X  X  relationship with the topi c, MTT infers the article X  X  own interestingness. Also, unlike ot her cluster-based recommendation systems, iScore X  X  MTT metric di scards uninteresting or unhelpful clusters over time to improve th e quality of results and resource usage. Our work in iScore is closely re lated to the adaptive filtering task in TREC, which is the online iden tification of news articles that are most relevant to a set of t opics. The task is different from identifying interesting articles for a user because an article that is relevant to a topic may not necessa rily be interesting. However, relevancy to a set of topics of interest is a prerequisite for interestingness. The report by [10] summarizes the results of the last run of the TREC filtering task. In the task, topic profiles are continually updated as new articles are processed. The profiles are used to classify a document X  X  rele vancy to a topic. Like much of the work in the task, we use adaptive thresholds and incremental profile updates. In [11], the authors use a variant of the Rocchio algorithm, in which they represent documents as a vector of TF-IDF values and maintain a profile for each topic of the same dimension. The profile is adapted by adding the weighted document vector of relevant documents and by subtr acting the weighted vector of irrelevant documents. Other met hods explored in TREC11 include using a second-order perceptron, an SVM [12], a Winnow classifier [12], language modelling [13], probabilistic models of terms and relevancy [14], and the Okapi Basic Search System [15]. iScore X  X  MTT, like Rocchio and [11], represents documents as vectors of TF-IDF values but instead of maintaining a single profile, MTT maintains multiple prof iles to represent the distinct topics that the user is interested in and relates the topic X  X  own interestingness to the article X  X  interestingness. Other works, like ours, have leveraged multiple existing techniques to build better systems for specific tasks. For example, in [16], the authors combine two popular webpage duplication identification methods to achieve better results. Another example is by [17], which combines the results from multiple outlier detection algorithms that are a pplied using different sets of features. A closely related ensemble work by [18] combines multiple ranking functions over the same document collection through probabilistic latent query analysis , which associates non-identical combination weights with late nt classes underlying the query space. The overall ranking function is a linear combination of the different ranking functions. In c ontrast to [18], we combine functions that are not necessarily ranking functions in isolation. Each function is designed to capture a different aspect of interestingness and needs to be co mbined to generate meaningful scores for interestingness. MTT is another aspect of interestingness that is easily a dded to the iScore framework. Topic detection and tracking (T DT) identifies new events and groups news articles that discuss the same event. Formally, TDT consist of five separate tasks: (1) topic tracking, (2) first story detection, (3) topic detection, (4) topic linkage, and (5) story segmentation [6]. Many TDT systems, like [19], [20], and [21] are simply a modification of a single pass clustering algorithm. They compare a news story against a set of profile vectors kept in memory. If the story does not match any of the profiles by exceeding a similarity threshold, the story is flagged as a new event and a new profile is created using the document vector of the news story. Otherwise, the news story is used to update the existing profiles. Other work, such as [22], add simple sema ntics of locations, names, and temporal information to the traditional term frequency vectors used in previous work. Although we make use of a si milar single-pass clustering algorithm, there are several subtle differences between identifying interesting articles and TDT. Firs t, not all topics are of equal interest to a user. Instead of identifying all new topics and tracking all articles for those topics as in TDT, we focus on the specific users interests, which are under continuous evolution. Additionally, we use the interesti ngness of topics when evaluating the interestingness of news article s that belong to their respective topics. Furthermore, a user X  X  in terest in a topic continually changes over time. A topic that ma y have been interesting in the past may not be interesting in the future. Consequently, we discard old profile vectors that are no longer of interest to reduce resource consumption, to speed up document evaluation, and to improve the quality of results. Another closely related of work is in the discovery of evolutionary theme patterns (ETP) from text [23]. In ETP, documents are partitioned into possibly overlapping subcollections according to their publication time. The most prominent themes (or subtopics) are extracted from each subcollection. For any themes in two different subcollections, an ETP solution decides whether there is an evolutionary transition from one theme to the other. Th e general ETP problem is not restricted to operation within an online and continuous environment, so the solution posed by [23] is an offline data mining solution to discovering and clustering patterns and so is not directly applicable to discove ring interesting articles as they are published. Additionally, the solution posed by [23] does not learn which themes or topics are of interest to the user, and so all themes are maintained and are not useful for classifying the interestingness of an article. In ETP, the evolutionary relationships among themes at diffe rent times are also explicitly identified, which is not nece ssary for discovering the most interesting articles for the us er as they are published. In iScore, news articles are processed in a streaming fashion, much like the document processing done in the TREC adaptive filter task. Articles are introduced to the system in chronological order of their publication time. Once the system classifies an article, an interestingness judgmen t is made available to the system by the user. The article classification pipeline consists of four phases, shown extractors generate a set of feature scores F(d) ={f f (d),...,f n (d)} . In [1], we implemented several topic relevancy features, uniqueness measurements and other features, such as source reputation, freshness, subj ectivity, and polarity of news articles. Then a classifier C generates an overall classification score, or an iScore I(d) : In [1], we found that a na X ve Bayesian classifier can identify interesting articles well. Next, th e adaptive thresholder thresholds the iScore to generate a binary classification, indicating the interestingness of the article to the user. The adaptive thresholder tries to find the optimal threshold that yields the best metric result, such as F-measure (where  X  = 0.5) or TREC11 X  X  utility metric T11SU. In the final phase , the user examines the article and provides his own binary classi fication of interestingness (i.e., tagging) I  X  (d) . This feedback is used to update the feature extractors, the classifier, and the thresholder. The process continues similarly for the next document in the pipeline. Because of iScore X  X  extensibility, multiple topic tracking (MTT) is added to the system as a new feature extractor. Many information filtering algorithms are based on the Rocchio algorithm, which represents topi cs and documents as vectors. Each value of the vector is a TF-IDF value for its respective term [5]. A single profile vector p is maintained. For each document, the cosine similarity, or the cosine of the angle between the document vector d and the profile vect or is measured. The document is classified as relevant or interesting if the similarity is greater than some threshold. The profile vector is updated by adding the vector of interesting documents to the profile vector. There are variations of the Rocchio algorithm, such as subtracting irrelevant documen t vectors from the profile vector [11]. The Rocchio algorithm tries to find the single ideal query, or vector, that would find all interesting articles, by using the centroid of the cluster that would contain all interesting articles. However, because of the diversity in the set of interests just for a single user, finding a single ideal query is not possible [24]. If a user has a wide range of interest s, using one vector to represent his interests would dilute the sensitivity of the Rocchio algorithm. Figure 2 illustrates this problem. Although the cluster of all the interesting documents would c ontain interesting documents, it would also contain many uninteres ting articles due to its size. If the user is interested in many orthogonal topics, then the encompassing cluster would be much larger and would also contain many more uninteresting articles as well. Instead, in MTT, a set of more narrow queries or profile vectors that more accurately represent a user X  X  interests than a single vector is maintained. For example, in Figure 2, MTT maintains smaller topic clusters instead of the larger encompassing cluster, improving classification precision. In other words, a set of experts is generated and maintained (one for each specific interesting topic) instead of referring to a single general expert. Using specialized profiles instead of a single general profile reduces classification bias by focusing more on specific topics; at the same time, using multiple vectors keeps classification variance low. Also the traditional Rocchio algorithm and TDT algorithms do not take into account the different degrees of interest among different topics. By focusing on individual topics, MTT can learn the user X  X  level of interest for a specific topic and relate the topic X  X  interestingness to related articles; thereby, improving the quality of news recommendation results. By associating a level of interest for specific topics, MTT can also learn when a user X  X  interests have changed. Topics that were of interest in the past may no longer be interesting in the future. Topics that have grown to be uninteresting to the user can be discarded. In MTT, each document and profile vector is represented as a TF-IDF vector, where each value of th e vector is the TF-IDF value of the vector element X  X  corres ponding stemmed term. Terms are stemmed using the Porter algorithm [25] and stop-words are ignored. A set of profiles P is maintained, which is initially empty. Until an interesting article arrives on the document stream, each article is scored with a 0. When an interesting article does arrive, a new profile vector p 1 is created using the article X  X  TF-IDF vector and added to P . Each subsequent article on the document stream with a document vector d is processed as follows: As more documents are processed, it is possible that many profiles may be kept and main tained, making MTT expensive. However, there are two discard methods that can reduce resource consumption and improve the quality of results. The first method discards profiles whose topics are no longer interesting. Mentioned earlier, each profile vector has an associated precision for identifying interesting articles, which is defined as: In other words, the precision of a profile p is the proportion of articles that belong to p that are truly interesting. Profiles that have a precision less than the threshold t precision because the topic that the profile represents is no longer interesting to the user. The second method discards prof iles whose topics are no longer active or current. At most M profiles are maintained in memory. If there are already M profiles being maintained, when a new profile must be created, then an old profile must be discarded and the least recently used profile is selected for discard. A profile is considered  X  X sed X  when an inte resting article best matches the profile (i.e., when the profile is selected as p max ). iScore is implemented with an assortment of tools in Java. The system pipeline is implemented with the IBM UIMA framework [27], using classifiers from LingPipe [28], OpenNLP [29], and Weka [30]. We evaluate iScore against three da ta sets. The first data set is a collection of 35,256 news artic les from all Yahoo! News RSS feeds, collected between June and August 2006. The classification task is to identify which articles come from which RSS feed. The 43 RSS feeds considered for labeling are feeds of the form:  X  X op Emailed &lt;category&gt;  X , and  X  X ost Highly Rated &lt;category&gt; . X  Because user evaluation is difficult to collect and such data is often sparse, the Yahoo! news articles and their source feeds are used for their resemblance to user labeled articles. For example, RSS feeds such as  X  X ost Viewed Technology X  is a good proxy of what the most interesting artic les are for technophiles. Other categories, such as  X  X op Stories Politics, X  are collections of news stories that the Yahoo! political news editors deem to be of interest to their audience, so the feed also would serve well as a proxy for interestingness. The second data set consists of user taggings and articles from the web collected between August 2006 to January 2007. Users are asked to tag articles that they read as interesting or not interesting using a web browser plug-in. Web pages of the referring page of the tagged article are also downloaded to determine the articles that the user chose not read, which is considered as uninteresting. After manually discarding j unk web pages (i.e., non-news articles), a total of 13,281 web pa ges remain with six users who tagged at least 49 interesting artic les. Using this data set, the classification task is to identify the interesting news articles for each of the six users from each user X  X  own pool of articles that he had access to. Unfortunately, this data set is small compared to the other data sets, but it should provide some insight on the relative performance of classifiers on real-world data. The final data set comes from the TREC11 adaptive filter task, which uses the Reuters RCV1 cor pus and a set of assessor manual taggings for 50 topics, such as  X  X conomic Espionage. X  The corpus is a collection of 723,432 news articles from 1996 to 1997. Although the TREC adaptive filter work addresses topic relevancy and not necessarily intere stingness, the task is done in a similar online and adaptive fashion as in iScore, and the topics may serve as reasonable proxies for a set of users. We use precision, recall, and F-measure, where  X  = 0.5, which weights precision more than recall, for system evaluation: F-measure is 0 when the number of articles retrieved is 0. TREC11 X  X  T11SU is also used for comparing the performance of iScore with the work done in TREC11: For systems that retrieve no artic les, the system would have a T11SU score of 0.33. Resource consumption is measured as the number of profiles that is currently being maintained. The run-time and memory consumption of MTT is linear w ith respect to the number of profiles. Statistical significance tests are applied where appropriate using the t-test at p  X  0.1. To find good values for the operating parameters: t t consumption and the quality of results produced by MTT with various parameters for the  X  X olitics Top Stories X  RSS feed. For simplicity and to evaluate MTT in isolation, we use the pipeline shown in Figure 3 instead of the complete iScore pipeline. The adaptive thresholder optimizes for F-measure (  X  = 0.5). We first evaluate the effect of t cluster on MTT by varying t respectively. The results are shown in Figure 4a. As t increases, articles are discouraged from clustering. Consequently, the average number of profiles held increases as t Low t cluster values cause fewer clusters to be formed, causing MTT to behave similarly as Rocchio when t cluster is low. The figure also shows that any t cluster value greater than 0.6, there is no significant increase in the quality of results while there is an increase in resource consumption. From this observation, we use 0.6 for t for all subsequent experiments. Next we evaluate the effect of t precision on MTT by varying t respectively. Figure 4b shows that there is little variation in performance overall when t precision is varied. However, there is a slight increase in performance when t precision increases from 0.3 to 0.5. There is also a decrease in resource consumption in the same range. Overall, fewer profile vect ors are kept in memory but the profiles are more precise in identifying interesting articles when t performance slightly decreasing fo r any values beyond 0.5 with very little decrease in resource cons umption. Consequently, for all later experiments, we use 0.5 for t precision . Next we evaluate t classification on MTT by varying t As t classification increases, the average number of profiles held in memory increases. Profiles are discarded when they generate too many false positives due to the minimum precision discard mechanism. Higher t classification values make it more difficult for the profiles to generate false positives (while generating many more false negatives), so fewer profiles are discarded. Figure 4c shows that a good value for t classification is 0.4. Values less than 0.4 cause profiles to generate too many false positives and are consequently discarded, so fewe r profiles are kept, decreasing the number of topics that can be tracked. However, too high of a value for t classification will lead to too many false negative classifications, as shown in the decrease in recall in Figure 4c. Interestingly, there is also a decrease in precision for too high t classification values. This is most likely due to noise caused by anomalous taggings that would normally be removed when low precision profiles are discarded. It is also due to changes in user interests which are immediatel y addressed by removing low precision profiles as well. For all subsequent experi ments, we use Next we evaluate the effect of M , which is the maximum number of profiles kept in memory, while holding t t shows that that as the number of maximum profiles increase, the quality of results improve, with significantly higher precision. However, it is inconclusive to dete rmine if it is better to leave the number of profiles unbounded because the number of profiles kept in memory for  X  X olitics Top St ories X  is at most 500. It is difficult to determine the tradeo ff in resource consumption with performance, given the results in Figure 4d. A data set that spans a large period of time is likel y needed to determine a good M value. So for all subsequent expe riments, we leave the number of profiles kept in memory to be unbounded, or M =  X  . Finally, we evaluate the effect of  X  , which controls how much of an effect that misclassified uni nteresting articles have (compared to interesting articles), by varying  X  , while holding t t slight increase in performance when  X  =0.5. However, there is a significant change in memory consumption, as  X  increases. Since the profiles are actually the centroi ds of clusters of interesting documents, using a large  X  value, changes the natural document clusters. As more documents are pr ocessed, new clus ters must be generated since the natural clus ters no longer exist. However, using a small non-zero  X  value can help reduce the noise in the clusters and improve the classifi cation quality. For all subsequent experiments, we use 0.5 for  X  . A similar case study was performed for the  X  X echnology Top Stories X  RSS feed. Good values found for the feed are t cluster t varying  X  had no effect. The parameter configuration seems to be user-dependent. However, for simplicity, we use the good parameters found for the  X  X olitics Top Stories X  feed for all subsequent experiments. Given the results from the case study for finding good operating parameters for the  X  X olitics Top Stories X  RSS feed, we applied MTT with the same parameters to all the other RSS feeds. In this experiment as well, the adaptiv e thresholder optimizes for F-and  X  =0.5. The mean average results are shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6a, we compare the overall performance of various classifiers after processing 10, 000 documents, including Rocchio and the Rocchio variant from [11], which performed the best in the TREC11 adaptive filter task. The figure shows that MTT performs significantly better than the Rocchio variant, with a mean average F-measure (where  X  =0.5) of 0.500, performing 40% better. MTT also outperforms Rocch io by 82%. According to the t-test, MTT X  X  improvements over Rocchio and its variant are statistically significant ( p = 2.7E-11 over Rocchio, p = 1.6E-06 over the Rocchio variant). We also evaluate MTT when it is included in the complete iScore pipeline. We evaluate two iScore systems, one with the complete feature set from [1] and one with a reduced feature set with the highest correlated features to in terestingness. The reduced feature set contains all the features from [1] except for freshness, new n-gram anomaly detection, and n-gram and tokenized language modelling anomaly detection. Figur e 6a shows iScore with MTT has a similar F-measure performance as MTT alone, with iScore yielding greater recall and lower precision. Figure 6a also shows that the inclusion of MTT into iS core results in a statistically significant increase of 9% in F-measure ( p = 0.09). Closer examination of each individual RSS feed shows positive improvement for most RSS feeds in Figure 5. RSS feeds with a lower average number of profiles held in memory due to very few interesting articles are more likely to yield negative improvement. Figure 6b shows the performance of the classifiers over time as well as the mean average number of profiles held in memory. The F-measure dramatically increases after processing 10,000 articles. The figure also shows statisti cally significant improvements ( p &lt; 0.02 ) that MTT and iScore with MTT have over Rocchio, the Rocchio variant, and iScore without MTT. After processing 25,000 documents, there is a statis tically significant 10% increase in performance of iScore cause d by the inclusion of MTT ( p = documents) of iScore by including MTT for individual RSS 0.02), which is consistent to what was observed in Figure 6a. Although, it seems that MTT alone performs better than iScore with MTT after processing 25,000 documents, the t-test shows that that increase is not statistically significant ( p = 0.23) for both feature sets. The figure also shows that the average number of profiles held increases linearly as more documents are processed. This behavior is expected since new topics continually appear and the maximum number of profiles is left unbounded for these experiments so no unused interesti ng topics are discarded. Further study with a larger corpus is necessary to determine a good maximum, if any. In addition to the Yahoo! RSS feed articles, we also compare the performance of MTT and iScore with Rocchio and the Rocchio variant on a collection of web pa ges tagged by users using a web browser plug-in. In our experiments where positive user taggings are sparse, we find that the adaptive thresholder performs better when it optimizes for T11SU instead of F-measure, so in this set of experiments, the adaptive th resholder optimizes for T11SU. Also due to the scarcity of negative user taggings compared to the size of the entire data collection, we infer additional negative user taggings for articles that the user did not read but were accessible from the referring page of an article tagged by the user. Consequently, for each user, interesting news articles are predicted from a pool of articles consisting of articles that the user actually tagged and articles that were accessible from referring pages of tagged articles. We us e the same operating parameters found in our case study for the  X  X olitics Top Stories X  RSS feed. The results of the user study are shown in Figure 7. In Figure 7a, MTT has higher precision than the Rocchio variants but has much lower recall. As a result, MTT X  X  F-measure performance is lower than the Rocchio variants. iScore with MTT performs 10% better than Rocchio in terms of F-measure. And the inclusion of MTT improves iScore by 2%. However, the comparison of the results is difficult to determine because the t-test indicates that the comparisons are not statistically significant with p  X  0.25. More users are necessary to make a definitive judgment, which is likely to be similar to the statistically significant judgments made with the Yahoo! data set. Closer inspection of each individual user shows F-measure improvement to iScore for most users when MTT is included into iScore X  X  feat ure set, as shown in Figure 7b. Although a smaller and potentially noi sier data set, this limited user study shows that iScore with MTT can work well even with a limited number of user taggings. For the Yahoo! data set, each RSS feed has an average of 655 tagged articles. In contrast, this limited study, as shown in Fi gure 7b, has a much smaller collection of taggings with each user tagging an average of 95 interesting articles. Although iScore with MTT perfo rms better than traditional techniques, it performs poorer in this data set than in the Yahoo! data set, which is most likely due to the noise in the data collection caused by the inference of additional negative user taggings. Also the web pages cont ain peripheral information in addition to the news story, such as navigation menus and links to other web pages, whic h make processing the content of the news story more difficult. Although the TREC11 adaptive filter task is to retrieve all articles relevant to a query, regardless of its interestingness to a user, we want to see how well MTT and iScore performs against other adaptive filters from TREC11. MTT and the full iScore feature set are compared with the best filte rs from each participating group in TREC11 against the TREC11 X  X  RCV1 corpus in Figure 8. As in the user tagging collection, the taggings in the TREC collection are very sparse relative to the size of the collection, so the adaptive thresholder optimizes for T11SU as well. We use the same operating parameters f ound in our case study for the  X  X olitics Top Stories X  RSS feed. Figure 8a shows that MTT has an F-measure 37.8% better than the best performing filter in TREC11 [11]. MTT also yields higher precision and recall. When MTT is incorporated into iScore , F-measure improves by 9% but is not statistically significant ( p = 0.25). According to [1], features other than topic relevancy features are not useful for identifying interesting articles to the TREC topics. The addition of irrelevant features causes the statistically significant difference in performance between MTT alone and iScore with MTT ( p &lt; 0.01) while only improving iScore slightly when added as an additional feature. Figure 8b shows the performance of iScore and MTT along with the top three adaptive filters fro m Figure 8a. TREC only reports T11SU performance over time instead of F-measure, so T11SU is shown in Figure 8b. The figure shows that MTT performs much better over time than all the othe r classifiers. Like Figure 8a, Figure 8b does shows statistically insignificant improvement of 2% ( p = 0.31) for documents after time period 6. Comparing Figure 6b and Figure 8b, the resource consumption in the TREC data is much less than in the Yahoo! data. Despite the larger size of the TREC corpus, us er interests in the TREC data set are much narrower than that of the Yahoo! data so fewer profile vectors are necessary to represent the entire range of user interests. Interestingly, in the Yahoo! data set, MTT alone yields statistically similar F-measure performance as iScore using the implemented features from [1] along with MTT. MTT alone may be sufficient if precision is desired over recall. But if a balance of recall and precision is needed, then iScore with MTT would be better than MTT alone. Also, there are use cases where MTT may be insufficient. MTT excels at identifying new interesting articles for topics that have already been seen. However, MTT would fail at identifying  X  X lash point X  article s that discuss new interesting topics that are unrelated to the previously interesting topics. On the other hand, the iScore framework allows for future features to be added to the classification pipe line, such as those that would help identify  X  X lash point X  articles, in addition to MTT as another feature. The inclusion of MTT into iScore has improved the classification of interesting documents for most users and data sets by 9% overall. However, there is room for further study. More news articles from the Yahoo! RSS feeds are being collected, so that iScore can be evaluated over a la rger corpus (greater than 100,000 articles). In our case study, due to the size of the Yahoo! RSS feed used to evaluate MTT and the num ber of relevant articles in the TREC11 adaptive task, the resource usage behavior of MTT when the maximum number of profiles is varied could not be accurately determined. A larger Yahoo! RSS feed collection spanning a large time period would help determine a good value, if any. More user taggings of articles by volunteers are being collected to improve the quality of the user tagging data set as well. Additionally, in the presented expe riments, the parameters were static for all users. In our case study, it was shown that two different users can have two diffe rent near-optimal parameters configurations. Using the parame ter configuration found here as starting points and given the e xpected behavior of MTT for various parameters, optimal parame ters tailored for specific users with specific memory constraints and quality requirements can be dynamically learned as more documents are processed so that maximum performance for each user can be achieved with MTT. Multiple Topic Tracking (MTT), inspired by the Rocchio algorithm and single-pass clusteri ng algorithms used in topic detection and tracking, is shown to be an effective technique to classifying news articles as inte resting or not interesting for specific users. By explicitly and di stinctly tracking multiple topics of user interest and their degree of interestingness, MTT addresses the shortcomings of the Rocchio algorithm X  X  usage of a single query to find all interesting articles from across multiple topics and its inability to quickly adapt to changes in user interests. Through a case study for a single RSS feed, we found reasonably good operating parameters for M TT. Using these parameters, MTT and iScore with MTT is able to perform 40% to 82% better than existing Rocchio variants when recommending interesting articles from the Yahoo! News RSS feeds. For the TREC adaptive filter task, MTT overall performs 37.8% better the best adaptive filter from TREC11. MTT also outperforms the same filter over time as more documents are pr ocessed in terms of TREC11 X  X  T11SU metric. The inclusion of MTT can improve iScore X  X  performance by 9% overall. Although more users are necessary to make a more definitive conclusion on the performance of MTT and iScore in our small user study, iScore with MTT seem s to outperform Rocchio and its variant. Also through our limited us er study, we show that iScore can still work relatively well even with very few positively tagged articles.
