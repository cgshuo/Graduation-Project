 Well acceptance of relevance feedback and collaborative systems has given the users to express their preferences in terms of multiple query examples. The technology devised to utilize these user preferences, is exp ected to min e the semantic knowledge embedded within the se query examples. In this paper, we propose a video mining framework based on dynamic learning from queries , using a statistical model for topic prerogative feature selection. The proposed method is specifically designed for multiple query example scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed framework ha s been established with an extensive experimentation on TRECVid2007 data collection. The results reveal that our approach achie ves a performance that is in par with the best results for this corpus without the requirement of any textual data .

 Feature s election, Multimedia Retrieval , Multiple query examples, Performance evaluation , Result fusion. Handling multimedia retri eval using only visual features still remains a challenging research due to the well known problem of semantic gap. More than being able to retrieve semantically similar multimedia data, it is also important to satisfy the user need using the query example s supplied by the user , than focusing only on the semantic concept of the query . Therefore, e qually challenging sub -problems in multimedia search and retrieval are, (i) how to use query examples dynamically to improve results without any prior training and (ii) how to combine the results from different sources into a single list . Use of multiple examples, is a commonly adapted paradigm in content based multimedia retrieval systems especially in TRECVid search track [5] and is also believed to perform better [4] . Use of multiple examples implies that more diverse visual content correlated to the search topic is conveniently available, to achieve, if possible, the best results. Hypothetically , each ex ample is expected to retrieve varied results depending on the nature of the colossal collection. Irrespective of the collection, a user expects one final result list covering the idiosyncrasies of the examples. The core problem of generating the final list lies in devising a mechanism of combining the results originating from each relevant example to improve retrieval results within a search engine. In addition to the query examples, availability of many visual feature extractors, have given rise to the pro blem of dynamic ally selecti ng prerogative feature for a topic , to achieve best results. On the other hand, if all features are being used for retrieval, combining the results originating from different features, into a single ranked list is another researc h topic in multimedia retrieval. This paper proposes an automated approach to prioritize the visual features for a topic, using query examples . For this purpose we propose a correlation and t -distribution based statistical model. Two levels of result fus ion, one to generate a single list from the results of the query examples and second to generate a final list from the results obtained from different features are also proposed. The proposed method has been compared with that of the state -of-the -art metho ds reporting results of TRECVid 2007 data. The evaluated results are in par with the text and concept mapping methods [2] that yield best and benchmarking results for TRECVid 2007 data without the use of any textual data . The method proposed has two stages. The f irst stage is the prerogative fea tur e selection using multiple query examples and the second is the result fusion.
 For th e prerogative visual feature selection using the query examples , we design a statistical model as follows. Let  X  = {  X   X  . Let  X  = {  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  } be the set of visual features being used for the purpose of retrieval. Here, CL, EH and HT are the standard MPEG 7 standard Colour Layout, Edge Histogram and Homogenous Texture features and CH is a simple Color Histogram feature. Let  X   X  represent the feature matrix of  X  in feature s pace  X   X  X  X  . Given  X   X  for all  X   X  X  X  , we compute the following matrices and values. A distance matrix  X  computed using the best distance measure for  X   X  X  X  as given in [1] . A correlation matrix  X   X   X   X   X  is computed using equation ( 1),  X   X  =  X   X   X  X  X   X   X   X  Here,  X  and  X  are the feature vectors of queries  X   X  is the dimension of feature  X  . From the above matrices,  X  and  X   X  , the statistical values,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  , and  X  deviation of the matrices respectively are calculated. In addition to correlation matrices  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  respectively is also computed. Since the basic idea behind using many query examples for retr ieval is a mutual concession to retrieve more diverse results and support semantic retrieval, we argue that features having larger variance should be preferred for that topic. To be not biased to a single feature, we order the features based on the six values,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  , and  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  and lower the value of  X   X  feature  X  in fetching more distinct and diverse results. Depending on the prioriti sed features, combining the results from the features , and the query examples als o needs considerable attention. W e also adopt a query preprocessing to eliminate any redundant queries and use appropriate distance measures reported retrieval. A round robin fusion mechanism is used to merge results from individual queries as each query is treated to be equally important for a topic . Thus, we now have  X  result lists the features for a topic, select the best feature for a topic we use the above computed values ,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  ,  X  results from different features are the n merged in a linear fashion. An e xperiment was conducted on the TRECVid 2007 video collection. The collection comprised of 18142 shots with 24 topics and 4704 relevant shots. A total of 13 55 example images were used for querying. Four features CL, CH, EH and HT were extracted and feature specific distance measure were used for retrieval. Table 1 shows the results of various runs. Firstly each visual feature are used individually for retrieval and the corresponding result lists due to multiple queries for each feature resulted with the MAP as shown in rows CH, CL, EH and HT . The high level features provided by NIST for the same data were then us ed as an additional feature and the lists were merged with evidence from the HLF list. The HLF data was available only for 11 topics out of 24 topics. Column 5 of Table 1 shows the MAP for this fusion which improved the results drastically . Although one may feel that including all images with appropriate annotations as per the topics would enhance the MAP, it has to be noticed that t he results were elevated only becaus e the relevant shots were already retrieved in the top 1000 shots for different query examples and only got high weight with HLF and hence was ranked high in the final result generated from multiple query examples . In other words, the HLF worked as a reduc ed search domain for few topics. The results obtained for all four features were then combined together without any topic specific feature selection and a MAP of 0.0594 was achieved. Finally, the priority values for each topic was computed as explained in section 2 and the results from top three features combined with HLF for a topic were fused in a linear fashion. This resulted with a MAP of 0.0647. This result is comparable with the best results for T RECVid 2007 data as shown in Table 2 . Among the other methods in Table 2 , MS RA_* used textual data and concept mapping in addition to text based search, re -ranking and result refinement; NUSICT_3 combined visual features with text query for retrieval. Our method used visual features and high level features and shows very promising results which can be achieved with only visual features and concept mapping/annotation .

The feature selection mechanism for a topic uses the diversity in the visual features of the query examples and is modeled using correlation and t -distribution. The method makes use of only visual features and high level feature s and does not depend on prior learning and textual data. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement from a MAP of 0.0594 to 0.0647 due to topic specific feature selection . In comparison to the best results for TRECVid07 data, 0.088 the results obtained by our feature selection approach is 0.0647 that demonstrate s the advantage of exploiting the diversity in query examples.
