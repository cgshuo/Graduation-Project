 Man y research ef forts ha v e been de v oted to de v elop rob ust statistical modeling techniques for man y NLP tasks. Our fi eld is no w m o ving to w ards more comple x tasks (e.g. R TE, QA), which require to complement these methods with a semantically rich representation based on w orld and linguistic kno wledge (i.e. anno-tated linguistic data). In this tutorial we sho w s e v eral approaches to e xtract this kno wledge from W ikipedia. This resource has attracted the attention of much w ork in the AI community , mainly because it pro vides semi-structured information and a lar ge amount of manual annotations. The purpose of this tutorial is to in-troduce W ikipedia as a resource to the NLP community and to pro vide an introduction for NLP researchers both from a scienti fi c and a practical (i.e. data acquisition and processing issues) perspecti v e . The tutorial is di vided into three main parts: 1. Extracting w orld kno wledge fr om W ikipedia . W e r e vie w methods aiming at e xtracting fully struc-tured w orld kno wledge from the content of the online enc yclopedia. W e sho w h o w to tak e cate gories, hyperlinks and infobox es as b uilding blocks for a semantic netw ork with unlabeled relations between the concepts. The task of taxonomy induction then boils do wn to labeling the relations between these concepts, e.g. with isa, part-of, instance-of, located-in, etc. relations. 2. Le v eraging linguistic kno wledge fr om W ikipedia . W ikipedia pro vides shallo w markup annotations which can be interpreted as manual annotations of linguistic phenomena. These  X  X nnotations X  include w ord boundaries, w ord senses, named entities, translations of concepts in man y languages. Further -more, W ikipedia can be used as a multilingual comparable corpus. 3. Futur e dir ections . Kno wledge deri v e d from W ikipedia has the potential to become a resource as important for NLP as W ordNet. Also the W ikipedia edit history pro vides a repository of linguistic kno wledge which is to be e xploited. Potential applications of the kno wledge implicitly encoded in the edit history include spelling corrections, natural language generation, te xt summarization, etc. This tutorial is designed for students and researchers in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics. No prior kno wledge of information e xtraction topics is assumed.
