 1. Introduction
Lately, social media websites (e.g., YouTube 1 and Flicker online content sharing network websites has been observed in recent years. A large volume of content can be generated and diffused by users in these social media websites. For example, it was reported in 2012 that YouTube received 60 h of uploads tively recommend social media items. Great challenges on traditional recommendation techniques to provide personalized con-tent to users are seen, due to the dynamic behavior of users in social media websites and the volume of content they generate.
Traditional recommendation models assume user preference ratings are available and often suffer from the problem of  X  X  X ata generated content as a supplementary source to support personalized recommendation. Tag-aware recommender systems were  X  proposed to incorporate rich tagging information into traditional recommendation models and achieved good performance have also been explored and utilized to improve recommendation accuracy ( Li, Zhai, &amp; Chen, 2012; Wu, Chen, Yu, Han, &amp; Wu, 2013 ).

Recently, affective texts (such as reviews and comments) generated by online users have been given more attention and fruitful sentiment analysis works has begun to emerge rapidly ( Balahur, Hermida, &amp; Montoyo, 2011; Feldman, 2013 ). Some attempts have been made to integrate sentiment analysis results into recommendation generations. The majority of existing work combines sentiment analysis techniques with collaborative filtering techniques to conduct movie rating predication ever, in relation to the social media context, item recommendation is limited due to a lack of sentiment-awareness. To the best of the author X  X  knowledge, there are only two studies relevant to sentiment-aware item recommendation in social timent analysis results into the basic neighborhood-based collaborative filtering models. Advanced one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) models were not explored. Therefore, the combination of sentiment analysis with a recommender system is limited and more extensive experimental work is required.

In this paper, we develop a sentiment-aware social media recommendation framework, referred to as SA_OCCF, to tackle the key challenges highlighted above. Firstly, the affective text from user comments is explored and mined by our proposed ensemble learning-based sentiment classification (ELSC) method. Secondly, the derived sentiment feedback information by
ELSC is incorporated into the OCCF models and we formalize our sentiment-aware recommendation models (SA_OCCF) to improve social media item recommendation performance. The proposed methods and models are evaluated through com-prehensive experiments using the TED dataset. The results show that the proposed SA_OCCF models outperform the baseline methods using a variety of recommendation accuracy metrics.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as: (1) We propose a sentiment-aware social media recommendation framework, referred to as SA_OCCF, to recommend (2) An ensemble learning-based sentiment classification combining BOW features and lexicon-based features is proposed (3) To evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble learning-based sentiment classification method and the
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we survey related work on sentiment classification and recom-mender systems. The details of the sentiment-aware recommendation framework are introduced in Section 3 , while Sec-tion 4 presents the design and methodology used in the experiments. The results are analyzed in Section 5 . We conclude the work in Section 6 and discuss future research applications. 2. Literature review
Our work is related to two main research threads: (1) sentiment classification and (2) recommender systems. We review the pertinent existing literature in these two fields. 2.1. Sentiment classification
Sentiment classification has been studied since the late 1990s and has swiftly become an active research topic. It has pro-and natural language processing ( Boiy &amp; Moens, 2009; Feldman, 2013; Pang &amp; Lee, 2008 ). A number of researchers have investigated sentiment classification from various perspectives. In general, sentiment analysis is performed at different lev-2008; Feldman, 2013 ). The majority of work has been conducted to judge sentiment polarity at the document level ( Abbasi, ument level. The techniques used in sentiment classification are mainly classified into heuristic-based and machine learning methods ( Wang et al., 2014 ). Heuristic-based methods generally employ predefined lexicons and calculation rules to classify ple, Turney (2002) determined the semantic orientation of a phrase using its point-wise mutual information with predefined sentiment words, such as  X  X  X xcellent X  X  and  X  X  X oor X  X . The overall sentiment information of phrases was then aggregated and the sentiment classification task was achieved. On the other hand, machine learning approaches have received significant
Pang &amp; Lee, 2008 ). Through the construction of predictive models from labeled training datasets, these methods can model more features and adapt to changing inputs more robustly, given them an advantage in comparison to heuristic-based meth-ods. In a similar vein, a number of ensemble learning-based methods have been proposed to construct multiple classifiers and then yield the integrated classifier with overall performance. Such ensemble based methods have outperformed single machine learning techniques for sentiment classification ( Abbasi, Chen, Thoms, et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014; Wilson, Wiebe, &amp; Hwa, 2006; Xia et al., 2011 ).

Although most sentiment analysis addresses tasks in commercial settings, such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in analysis of affective text from social media websites ( Thelwall, Buckley, &amp;
Paltoglou, 2012 ). The  X  X  X entiStrength X  X  tool was proposed in order to analyze the level of sentiments in short informal text and it was proven useful to classify emotions in Myspace ( Thelwall, Buckley, Paltoglou, Cai, &amp; Kappas, 2010 ) and Twitter ( Thelwall, Buckley, &amp; Paltoglou, 2011 ). The SentiWordNet thesaurus was employed to detect sentiment for YouTube com-
Zhao, 2009 ), the SELC model (self-supervised, lexicon-based, and corpus-based) was proposed for sentiment classification in Youku, 4 a Chinese video sharing website. However, ensemble-based approaches for sentiment classification within video sification of online video comments and generate sentiment feedbacks to improve social media recommendation performance. 2.2. Recommender systems
Personalization techniques provide the ability to tailor content and services to individuals based on their preferences and tastes. A recommender system, as the primary tool of personalization, is required to match potential interesting content with a user X  X  expectations ( Adomavicius &amp; Tuzhilin, 2005 ). The preference ratings are assumed to be available and many tech-niques have been developed in recommender systems in order to derive improved performance ( Liu, Guo, &amp; Zhang, 2011;
Takacs, Pilaszy, Nemeth, &amp; Tikk, 2009 ). However, most recommenders cannot perform effectively when the user preference rich user generated content has been mined and utilized as a supplementary source to support personalized recommenda-tion. Tag-aware recommender systems have been attracted increasing attention since fruitful tagging information can be a novel music recommendation algorithm by using multiple social media data (e.g., groups, tags, etc.) and music acoustic-based content in the framework of a hypergraph model. Recently, affective text (such as reviews and comments) generated by online users has been considered, with some researchers integrating sentiment analysis results into the generation of recommendations. However, these studies are limited in scope and a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the sentiment information on recommendations is required. Table 1 presents selected previous studies in recommender sys-tems combined with sentiment analysis.

The majority of existing research has focused on movie rating prediction tasks by mining sentiment information from rated into a Multi-Relational Matrix Factorization (MRMF) algorithm. The results also demonstrated the advantages of the new recommendation method using sentiment features. Leung et al. (2011) inferred ratings from reviews and integrated them with a probabilistic model for movie recommendation. In ( Zhu, Xing, &amp; Liang, 2012 ), the sentiment rating matrix was inferred through review opinion analysis and an aggregated model combining user-based collaborative filtering (UCF), item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) and opinion-based collaborative filtering (OCF) was proposed to improve the predication accuracy. Heuristic-based methods were employed by all of these researchers to extract sentiment informa-tion from the review text. Recently, Peleja et al. (2013) used the Vowpal Wabbit (VM) linear classifier to extract sentiment ratings from reviews and combined explicit ratings with inferred unrated rating to predict users X  preferences. They con-ducted several experiments to verify the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis method and their proposed recommenda-tion method.

In the case of E-commerce websites, many commercial systems often show  X  X est bet X  recommendations rather than the predicted rating values. Currently, recommender system researchers are giving attention to the task of item recommenda-tion, which is also called top-N recommendation, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are the most appealing to users. Chen and Wang (2013) analyzed product reviews to extract feature-opinion pairs and then employed a novel clustering-based method to identify reviewer preference homogeneity. Finally, a recommendation method was also proposed based on inter-relevance preference between active buyers and reviewers. The performance was also demonstrated and seen to be excellent. In a different study, Aciar, Zhang, Simoff, and Debenham (2007) analyzed a user X  X  reviews by developing an ontology to mine the review text. The ontology measures the quality of several features within a product to create user recommendations.

In the case of social media websites, it is typical that only positive implicit feedback is available. For a user preference matrix, the portion of unlabeled examples is large and the matrix becomes extremely sparse. Due to this limitation, only a few papers have been published using sentiment analysis results from reviews in the generation of recommendations. rating matrix was generated for sentiment-based recommendation algorithms. In their systems, only traditional UCF and ICF methods were employed. In our work, we will place a heavier reliance on OCCF models. The method proposed by ( Pappas &amp;
Popescu-Belis, 2013b ) is more relevant to our work. They claimed that they employed sentiment analysis of user comments for OCCF recommendations, yet only a simple modified item-based CF was proposed and some recent advanced OCCF models were not explored. Furthermore, we propose an ensemble learning-based method for sentiment classification which also dif-fers from Pappas &amp; Popescu-Belis X  X  work. 3. Sentiment-aware social media item recommendation
Computational applications are pushing the boundaries of personal computing and beginning to facilitate social interac-of information technology concerned with the intersection of human and social studies connected through computer networks. Online users in these websites have generated a large volume of content which contains fruitful opinion data. In this study, we propose a sentiment-aware recommender system which employs sentiment analysis techniques to mine affective texts and leverage OCCF models to provide personalized media item recommendations. In Fig. 1 the recommenda-tion process is shown. The framework of the proposed recommendation method contains two primary modules: sentiment analysis for comments and OCCF recommendation models. The sentiment analysis component is employed to mine emo-tional comments and generate sentiment feedbacks to improve the recommendation performance. The OCCF models com-ponent will first user the preference feedbacks models and baseline OCCF models to conduct recommendations and then leverage sentiment feedbacks and SA-enhanced OCCF models before providing their recommendations. These two compo-nents are covered in detail in the following sections. 3.1. Sentiment analysis for comments
The goal of sentiment analysis for comments is to mine the affective texts and infer a user X  X  sentiment feedback for social media items. This task can be formally defined as follows: given a set of comments, a sentiment classifier model classifies each comment into one of two classes, positive or negative. In this study, we conduct sentiment classification using an ensemble learning-based method, which achieved best performance among many baseline methods in our previous study ing features and converting them into feature vectors, (2) leaning the appropriate classifier model using the vectors, and (3) selecting the proper ensemble strategy to enhance the classifier. Accordingly, each step is introduced in the following sub-sections. 3.1.1. Feature construction
The construction of features is an important part of machine learning methods for sentiment classification. From the being independent of each other ( Forman, 2003 ). To extract effective features, the comment text is first segmented using natural language processing (NLP) tools before various annotation methods are used. The Bag-of-Words (BOW) framework is considered as a bag of words and represented by a vector containing all the words appearing in the corpus. Furthermore, the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting method is used to represent words in this framework while unigram features are often generated to learn the classifiers. In comparison to BOW features, lexicon-based features have been proposed for sentiment analysis. SentiWordNet is a popular lexical resource used for opinion mining ( Esuli &amp;
Sebastiani, 2006 ). Ohana and Tierney (2009) classified the sentiment of reviews using five types of lexicon-based features which included overall document scores, score ratio to total terms, positive to negative score ratios, scores per document segment, and negation. We use BOW features and lexicon-based features for sentiment classification of comments, due to their unique properties. 3.1.2. Model learning
After the feature vectors (unigram features combined with lexicon-based features) are constructed, they should be nor-malized and fed into the classifiers for learning. Sentiment classification tasks have been investigated in a number of machine learning methods: Na X ve Bayes classifier (NB), Decision Tree classifier (DT), mutual entropy classifier (ME), support vector machines (SVM), etc. We choose all of these classifiers as the base learners in this study. Among them, SVM is a state-of-the-art data mining technique which has proven its performance in many applications ( Vapnik, 2000 ). It has a sound the-oretical foundation (statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization principle) and also has excellent learning ing in complex mathematical models. In comparison to ANN, SVM can capture the inherent characteristics of the data more concisely. 3.1.3. Ensemble strategy selection
Prior researchers have shown that ensemble based methods outperformed single machine learning technique for senti-learning paradigm where multiple learners are trained to solve the same problem ( Polikar, 2006; Zhou, 2012 ). In contrast to traditional machine learning approaches that attempt to learn one hypothesis from the training data, ensemble methods attempt to construct a set of hypotheses and combine them ( Liu &amp; Zsu, 2009 ). Taking into account our previous sentiment classification comparative study ( Wang et al., 2014 ), we choose the random subspace method to leverage both types of fea-tures for sentiment classification. The Random Subspace method is an ensemble construction technique proposed by Ho (1998) . In the random subspace, the training dataset is modified in the feature space rather than the instance space. The pseudo-code for the random subspace algorithm is given in Table 2 .

The random subspace method may benefit from using both random subspaces for construction and aggregation of the base classifiers. When the dataset has many redundant or irrelevant features, one may obtain a better base classifier in the random subspaces than in the original feature space ( Ho, 1998 ). The combined decision of such base classifiers may we also choose the AdaBoost ensemble-based method as the baseline. 3.2. OCCF recommendation models
In this section, we define the problem of item recommendation and then proceed to introduce two representative models, 2013b; Rong et al., 2008 ) have been concerned with Top N Item recommendation, and we will also consider this task in the framework of one class collaborative filtering. In this framework, OCCF is intended to recommend items of interest to users based on their available favorite items given that there are only positive implicit feedback examples (i.e. purchases, book-marks, views) in the available datasets. In this paper, we are interested in the recommendation of social media items to users u , the task of item recommendation is to provide a sorted list of top N items, L, based on the available user-item preference matrix R and user-item comment sentiment matrix S . 3.2.1. Baseline OCCF models
In memory-based CF methods, the recommendation score is computed based on the entire (or a sample of) the user-item algorithms. Neighborhood-based CF is one of memory-based CF models for recommender systems. The method typically includes the following steps: calculation of the similarities between two users or two items, finding the k most similar users or items and aggregating the neighbors X  ratings to generate top N most frequent items as suitable recommendations. Neigh-borhood-based CF models can also be classified into user-based CF (UCF) models and item-based CF (ICF) models. A UCF model provides recommendations by determining the most similar neighbors for a given user and then aggregating neigh-bors X  rating. This model can be formally defined as: where P ( u , i ) is the predicted rating of the given user u to an unrated item i , r the mean ratings of u and v respectively, Nr u 2 U is the set of nearest neighbors of the given user u and sw ( u , ilarity weight between user u and user v . The similarity weight sw ( u , similarity (Eq. (2) ) based on the preference matrix R .
Furthermore, the ICF model provides recommendations by finding similar items to the given user X  X  rated items and then calculating the weighted combination of their ratings. The model can be formally defined as: where r i is the mean rating of item sw ( u , v ) i , Nr i
Therefore, we have chosen the UCF and ICF models as our baseline models in the memory-based methods. We will introduce the SA-enhanced memory-based models by incorporating a user X  X  sentiment comment information in Section 3.2.2 .
Model-based CF methods attempt to learn complex patterns based on the training data (for example, preference matrix) and provide recommendations based on the learned models ( Su &amp; Khoshgoftaar, 2009 ). Matrix factorization (MF) techniques are typical model-based CF methods and have been successfully applied in movie recommendation context ( Bennett &amp;
Lanning, 2007 ). Many studies have empirically suggested that MF methods perform better than neighborhood-based meth-ods in rating predication tasks where the main goal is to reduce a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) ( Adomavicius &amp; Tuzhilin, by the learned latent user factors x u 2 R f and latent item factors y suggested direct modeling on the observed ratings and use of the Tikhonov regularization to avoid over-fitting issues. There-fore, the learning process is equivalent to solving the unconstrained optimization problem: where kk is the Euclidean norm of a matrix and k is used to regularize the model. This model has already demonstrated its
OCCF setting, the above model treat all missing values in R as negative examples (AMAN) where the response variables only take the value 0 or 1. Hereafter, we call this model AMAN_MF. However, this strategy is obviously limited since it does not cover the real world case that missing examples are likely to be positive ones. A better approach proposed by Rong et al. (2008) treat all missing values as weighted negative examples (wAMAN). The weights are used to control their relative con-tribution to the loss function:
Minimization of the function L ( x u , y i ) allows the parameters ( x method to solve the optimization problem. In the case of the wMAN model, a weighted ALS (wALS) was proposed in ( Rong et al., 2008 ) and used to solve the above low rank approximation problem mentioned above. The pseudo code of the wALS algorithm is given in Table 4 .

In this paper, we decide to use the AMAN_MF and wAMAN_MF methods as our baselines in the model-based methods. In the case of the wAMAN_MF method, we use the global weighting method to assign the weights. In Section 3.2.2 , we will incorporate user sentiment information into the wAMAN method to enhance the basic model. 3.2.2. SA-enhanced OCCF models
Social media websites provide online users with efficient and convenient methods of consuming media items while simultaneously recording large volumes of user generated content during their interactions. Users express their opinions and emotions of the consumed media using affective text in comments. Such affective information, as another kind of implicit feedback, can be exploited and combined with consumption feedback information to improve recommendation performance. In this paper, we leverage affective texts to utilize sentiment information in order to improve the OCCF recommendation performance. We incorporate sentiment information into the OCCF framework and generate two corre-sponding enhanced models: SA-enhanced neighborhood and SA-enhanced MF.

In the case of the neighborhood framework, the preference matrix R can be merged with the sentiment matrix S to learn the neighborhood-based CF models. The sentiment values of the comments can be considered as inferred preference ratings and are incorporated into the preference matrix R to generate a denser matrix R 0 . Using the matrix R 0 , previous neighbor-hood-based CF models must be modified: firstly, inferred ratings from the sentiment analysis performed over the comments must be considered in the model; secondly, the neighbors must be re-calculated with the additional inferred rating data. Therefore, the previous user-based CF method is modified as: where Nr 0 u denotes the user u  X  X  nearest neighbors calculated by the denser matrix R 0 , sw 0 ( u , between u and v based on the matrix R 0 and r 0 v i accounts for both feedback and inferred ratings from the comments. r 0 can be defined as: Similarly, we can introduce the modified item-based CF method which is defined as: where Nr 0 i is the set of nearest item neighbors from the given user X  X  rated items or commented items based on R 0 , and SA_NN models.
 For the MF framework, AMAN_MF and wAMAN_MF are two state-of-the-art baseline methods for item recommendation.
We leverage sentiment information in order to enhance the AMAN_MF method using the generated denser matrix R 0 . There-fore, the optimization problem in Eq. (4) should be learned and solved on the matrix R 0 (as defined in Eq. (9) ) as:
To enhance the wAMAN_MF method, we also consider missing examples as negative examples. Instead of using a global weighting scheme, we leverage sentiment information extracted from user comments to assign the weight for each negative example. We employ a new weight matrix W 0 to substitute the loss function of Eq. (5) and generate the following equation: where w 0 ui can be defined as: methods as SA_MF methods. 4. Experimental design 4.1. Datasets In order to evaluate the proposed sentiment-aware recommendation framework, we investigated the TED talk dataset.
TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design, which is a non-profit media organization that develops and curates global conferences, and represents an alternative to traditional channels for communicating ideas ( Heffernan, 2009 ).
TED.com 5 broadcasts TED Talks as video streams on their website. The talks are given in English and are usually transcribed and then translated into several other languages by volunteers. TED has become one of the most popular online lecture repos-
TED talks were viewed a total of one billion times in November, 2012. In recent studies, TED was used to educate teachers ( DaVia Rubenstein, 2012 ) and involve students in lifelong learning ( Banker &amp; Gournelos, 2013 ). The TED website also supplies an online repository of audiovisual recordings of popular scientific lectures. Under a
Creative Commons noncommercial license, the recordings and the metadata accompanying speakers are made available comments) indicators were used to examine TED videos in order to provide insights into the type and scope of their impact.
It was suggested that TED X  X  primary dissemination channel (website) is interactive through its comments, making it possible to identify engagement with the videos and the extent to which they generate discussion. In ( Pappas &amp; Popescu-Belis, 2013a ), TED content metadata (such as title, description and tags) were combined with user preferences to provide person-alized lecture recommendations. Since talk comments constituted a more implicit form of preference expression, they were exploited to augment the rating information for recommendation in ( Pappas &amp; Popescu-Belis, 2013b ). In our study, we pro-pose a sentiment classification method to extract sentiment information from user comments and leverage them in the OCCF recommendation settings.
 In our work, we have used the second version of the published TED dataset which was crawled on the TED website on September 10th, 2012. 6 The original dataset contained 12,403 users, 1203 talks, 134,533 favorites and 117,516 comments.
In order to validate the sentiment analysis component, we prepare the labeling dataset which contain positive and negative comments. Since we did not obtain the sentiment labels of the TED comments, we employed a similar strategy as was used tation, we distinguish three functional evaluative components according to Wiebe X  X  work (2004) : the source (i.e. the person states only. Three native speakers (two master students and one PhD student) were selected as annotators to judge the overall sentiment of 1000 comments, which were randomly selected from the TED dataset. We employed Fleiss X  kappa ( k ) metric to measure the inter-annotator agreement and the metric was found to be k = 0.69. As agreement was substantial, we used the entire set as ground truth to evaluate sentiment classification methods (cases of disagreements were reconciled by a majority vote). As a result, we obtained 584 positive comments, 325 negative comments and 91 neutral comments (including undecided comments).

In order to train and validate our proposed sentiment classification method, 300 positive comments and 300 negative comments were randomly selected to form the ground truth dataset. Finally, the learned sentiment classifier was employed across entire comment dataset and the sentiment feedback matrix was generated for item recommendation.

We chose users with at least 5 favorites in order to do 5-fold cross validation for item recommendation. The user com-ments were analyzed by the previous sentiment classification method to generate the sentiment feedback matrix. The result-ing data set had 5657 users, 1203 talks, 121,621 favorites and 21,076 comments. 4.2. Evaluation metrics
For sentiment analysis, the established standard measure, the average accuracy, is adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The definition of the average accuracy can be explained with a confusion matrix as shown in Table 5 . Formally, the average accuracy is defined as:
In the case of item recommendation, we treat it as a content retrieval system that recommends social media items to online users. The evaluation metrics, Precision@K (Prec@K), Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) ( Croft,
Metzler, &amp; Strohman, 2010 ) are employed to evaluate the recommendation accuracy of different methods. The Prec@K mea-sure only evaluates the ability to return overall relevant items. However, the MAP and MRR measures consider the rank information of relevant items in the recommendation list. They are defined as where K is the number of recommended items and (5 and 10 in this setting); N ranking list, | U | denotes the number of users, m j is the number of relevant items to the user j , P ( R recommended results from the top result until reaching item k , and Rank F user j . 4.3. Experimental procedure labeled comments are partitioned into ten subsets with similar sizes and distributions. The union of nine subsets is then used as the training set while the remaining subset is used as the test set, which is repeated ten times such that every subset has been used as the test set once. The average test result is regarded as the result of the 10-fold cross validation. The above process is repeated 10 times with random partitions of the ten subsets, and the average result of these different partitions is recorded. We measured seven approaches in the comparison: SentiWordNet, posed ELSC method.

In the item recommendation, we implement our SA-enhanced method and the baseline OCCF models in the literature for the performance comparison. They are listed as follows. (1) UCF: This method employs user similarities calculated from the favorite feedback matrix to provide recommendations. (2) ICF: This method employs item similarities calculated from the favorite feedback matrix to provide recommendations. (3) AWAN_MF: This method employs the matrix factorization technique for the favorite feedback matrix and uses the (4) wAWAN_MF: This method employs the weighted matrix factorization technique for the favorite feedback matrix and (5) SA_UCF: This method employs user similarities calculated from the combined feedback matrix to provide recommen-(6) SA_ICF: This method employs item similarities calculated from the combined feedback matrix to provide recommen-(7) SA_AWAN_MF: This method employs the matrix factorization technique for the combined feedback matrix and uses (8) SA_wAWAN_MF: This method employs the proposed weighted matrix factorization technique for the favorite feed-Of these eight methods, the first four represent baseline OCCF methods while the remainder represents SA-enhanced
OCCF methods. Furthermore, the first two of the baseline OCCF methods are neighborhood-based CF methods while the next two of are MF-based CF methods. 5. Results and discussions
We used the data mining toolkit WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) version 3.7.0 (with default parameter settings) for learning-based sentiment classification ( Hall et al., 2009 ). SentiWordNet 3.0 was employed as the implemented and the results were compared in the MyMediaLite recommender system library ( Gantner, Rendle, Freudenthaler, &amp; Schmidt-Thieme, 2011 ).

We determined the sensitivity of different algorithms before beginning the full experimental evaluation, and used the sensitivity plots to fix the optimum values of various parameters. These values remained fixed throughout the experiments.
To determine the parameter sensitivity, we used only the training data and further subdivided it into training and validation portions to perform our experiments. We argue that our experimental design is fair because: (1) we do not user any priv-ileged information from the test set in which results of all methods are reported; (2) all parameters are discovered in the same validation set. As a result, the neighborhood sizes of 40 and 70 were set for the UCF and ICF models, respectively, while the neighborhood sizes of 30 and 50 were set for the SA_UCF and SA_ICF models, respectively. We set the number of factors as 10 and total iterations as 30 for AWAN_MF and SA_AWAN_MF. The factors value, iteration value, and negative weight value were set as 20, 15, and 2 respectively for wAWAN_MF. The number of factors and iterations were learned to be 15 and 20 for SA_wAWAN_MF. Thereafter, the performance of the three sentiment classification methods and eight item rec-ommendation methods is reported in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Sentiment classification accuracy
The accuracy results of sentiment classification performed on talk comments are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be observed that the machine learning methods have superior performance to the Heuristic-based method, SentiWordNet, with the exception of DT. This may be due to the availability of the training data in addition to the BOW features and lexicon features are lev-eraged by the learning-based methods. The SVM method achieves the best performance among all machine leaning senti-ment classifiers. An ensemble-based method, SVM-Boosting, further improve the classification accuracy over SVM. This is consistent with our previous work investigating the performance contributions of ensemble methods ( Wang et al., 2014 ).
The best performance is achieved by our proposed ELSC method with a classification accuracy of 86.7%. This method can be employed to effectively extract sentiment information from talk comments to improve social media item recommenda-tion performance.

Therefore, the above sentiment classification results indicate that our ELSC method is capable of overcoming the chal-lenges associated with the special features of affective comments while providing reliable results to generate a sentiment feedback matrix in order to enhance item recommendation performance. 5.2. Item recommendation accuracy
For item recommendation, we split the user favorite matrix into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. More precisely, for with at least 10 favorite talks and one comment. The details of the sample size are shown in Table 6 .

In this sub-section, we present the results of the eight recommendation models utilized on the TED dataset ( Table 7 ). We will report results on the Neighborhood-based and MF-based models respectively, and explore the performance effects of incorporating comment sentiment information.

In the case of the Neighborhood-based methods, ICF generally performs better than UCF on the favorite feedback matrix as shown in Table 7 This is consistent with previous item recommendation research where it was attributed to the existence additional information improve the results significantly, where more than 15% MAP performance improvements have been achieved by the SA-enhanced neighborhood-based models (SA_UCF and SA_ICF). In particular, further improvements are obtained by the SA_UCF model since incorporating sentiment feedback information increases the matrix density and the cal-culated similarities between users become more trustful.

For MF-based methods, AWAN_MF performs worst since treating all missing examples as negative examples without weighting does not work well in the case of the highly sparse OCCF problem. Previous studies have shown that the weighted
MF methods perform well for OCCF while results in this study show that the wAMAN_MF model with a global weighting scheme just slightly outperform the ICF model. This result suggests that the MF model is not guaranteed to capture the rel-evant information between users and items by simply assigning a uniform weight in the negative examples. In comparison the neighborhood-based models performed more robustly across datasets since the relevant information from neighbor-hoods is easier to explain. Furthermore, SA-enhanced MF-based models have achieved better performance in terms of
MAP improvements (22.3% for SA_AWAN_MF and 26.0% for SA_wAWAN_MF). The sentiment feedback information demon-strates its effectiveness as additive evidence to the baseline model. Using sentiment feedbacks to determine the weights of the wAWAN_MF model, our proposed SA_wAWAN_MF model is able to get the best results.

Motivated by recent item recommendation research ( Bogers &amp; Van Den Bosch, 2011; Li, Zhai, et al., 2012 ), we propose a fused model by combining the rankings produced by the Neighborhood-based and MF-based models in order to overcome the limitations of the individual models. Data fusion has also been widely investigated in the information retrieval commu-nity. The CombMNZ aggregation method ( Fox &amp; Shaw, 1994 ) is one of the most popular fusion-based methods and is selected to combine the rankings produced by the Neighborhood and MF based models. The CombMNZ method uses not only the scores in each of the ranked lists in addition to number of the supporting evidence. We test this fused model on the TED dataset. The SA_UCF and SA_wAWAN_MF models are used as the two basic models for fusion since they are seen to have superior performance.
 In Table 8 , the fused model significantly outperforms other models in terms of all performance metrics. Specifically, the
MAP improvement (18.7%) of the fused model over SA_wAWAN_MF is encouraging and promising. Therefore, these results demonstrate that combining Neighborhood-based and MF-based models is very effective to improve OCCF accuracy. 6. Conclusion and future work
In this paper, we proposed a sentiment-aware recommender system for use in the social media websites. The proposed method leveraged sentiment information from user generated affective texts to improve OCCF performance. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on a real social media website (TED dataset) in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the pro-very effective to overcome the sparsity of OCCF. (2) Neighborhood-based models work robustly when the data matrix is very sparse, while MF-based models perform better when the data matrix is less sparse. (3) An ensemble model combining UCF and MF based models can further improve the prediction accuracy.

Several future research directions also exist for this study. Firstly, in this paper, only one type of social media websites (TED dataset) was employed to verify the proposed method. We will extend our method to other websites (such as Flicker) so as to improve its applicability and generality. Secondly, as a user X  X  online comments often have imbalanced sentiment class distributions, some more advanced classification methods will be explored to address these issues. Thirdly, we will and explore their applications on state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Finally, this paper adopted the CombMNZ technique as the rank aggregation method. More complex data fusion techniques can also be considered such as Condorcet fusion ( Montague &amp; Aslam, 2002 ) and other techniques that model score distribution ( Nandakumar, Chen, Dass, &amp; Jain, 2008 ).
