 A proposal summary for the EuroHCIR workshop at SIGIR2013. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval] : Search process. H.5.2 [ User Interfaces] : Interaction styles Human-computer interaction, information retrieval, HCIR. The purpose of EuroHCIR is to push the agenda of understanding the role that HCI has with IR systems, beyond Interactive IR. Alongside the popular American HCIR series, EuroHCIR aims to stimulate this focus in the large European community. While the previous two workshops have taken place at more HCI focused conferences (BCS-HCI and IIiX 2012), the particular purpose of running EuroHCIR2013 at SIGIR2013 is to better engage with the core IR community, on extended search scenarios like holiday planning, entertainment, and casual browsing. Engaging with the IR community is extremely time ly, amongst the context of the recent NII Shonan meeting on whole-session IR evaluation (organised by Dumais, Belkin, Sanderson, and Kando), and the similarly focused forthcoming Dagstuhl in 2013. HCIR, or Human-Computer Inform ation Retrieval, is a phrase coined by Marchionini in 2005 [1 ] and is representative of the growing interest in uniting both those who are interested in how information systems are built (IR community) and those who are interested in how humans search for information (HCI and Information Seeking). The two fields have both developed innovative techniques to support search, but their insights often do not bridge disciplinary borders. Five increasingly popular works hops and an NSF funded event brought focus to this multi-disciplinary issue in the USA; HCIR became a 2-day symposium in 2012. In Europe, we have had 2 increasingly successful workshops. EuroHCIR2013 builds on the worldwide momentum and focuses on the developing HCIR community in Europe.
