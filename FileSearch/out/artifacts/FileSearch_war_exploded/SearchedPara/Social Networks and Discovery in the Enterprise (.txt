 Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Informa-tion storage and retrieval]: Information search and retrie val General Terms: Algorithms Keywords: social search, enterprise search, social network Traditional information discovery methods are based on con -tent: documents, terms, and the relationships between them . In Web 2.0, people come into play as they create documents and tags in many forms. Personalized search, social graphs, content and people recommendation, are some of the tasks that can take advantage of this newly formed ecosystem.
The Social Networks and Discovery ( SaND ) platform is an aggregation tool for information discovery and analysis ov er social data gathered from Web 2.0 applications in the en-terprise. It leverages complex relationships between cont ent and people as surfaced through the social applications to un -leash the value of information. Its integrated index suppor ts combining content-based analysis and people-based analys is over a rich data foundation. Enterprise social data is easil y modeled and ingested into SaND , and can be further com-bined with data from external social applications. This demo will present three main functions provided by SaND : Social search: SaND supports search over the social data using a unified approach [1] in which all system entities (doc -uments, people, tags) are searchable and retrievable (See Figure 1). The search UI enables the searcher to get a wider view on the query topic through results from all entity types , while uncovering the relationships between the on-screen e n-tities.

Entity recommendation: SaND can be utilized to rec-ommend people and content for the searcher (Figure 2 shows the  X  X o You Know X  widget for people recommendation). People are recommended according to their  X  X ocial simi-larity X  relations with the searcher, e.g. organizational a nd friending ties, similar tagging activity and more. Similar ly, content that is related to people that are  X  X ocially related  X  to the searcher is recommended as valuable interesting data .
Personalization: Search results are personalized by con-sidering the relations of retrieved entities with the searc her. Entities are ranked according to their relevance to the quer y as well as according to their relationship strength with the searcher.
