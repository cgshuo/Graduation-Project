 ACM SIGKDD is the Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining. It is the 37 th and the newest SIG of the Association for Computing Machinery. The mission of SIGKDD is to help advance the science and to promote the rapid maturation of the KDD/DM field worldwide. SIGKDD will provide a forum for the exchange, debate, and dissemination of new ideas, results of research and development, and information among researchers, developers, vendors, and users of the technology. The KDD/DM technology consists of theories (methodologies, processes, and algorithms) and systems (software, hardware, and networked computers). In February 1998, I initiated a move to form an international society that will provide a  X  X ome X  for the KDD/DM field. The Steering Committee (SC) of the International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD Conference), consisting of 14 prominent scientists in the field who have served as the organizers of the technical programs of the conference, endorsed the initiative in March. The KDD SC agreed to have the society organized as a SIG of ACM. I prepared and submitted a formal Proposal to form a new SIG in April with formal endorsements of five members of the SC, who agreed to serve on the SIG X  X  Executive Committee. The five members of the SC are currently serving on the Board of Directors of SIGKDD, and include Usama Fayyad, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, Rakesh Agrawal, Daryl Pregibon, and Padhraic Smyth. After obtaining endorsements from all existing related SIGs (in particular, SIGMOD, SIGART, SIGIR, and SIGCHI), ACM approved the  X  X irst year X  budget and Bylaws for the new SIG in June. After a requisite number of signatures of ACM members who endorsed the formation of the new SIG has been obtained in July, ACM officially chartered SIGKDD on August 5 as a  X  X rovisionary SIG X . The SIGKDD Executive Committee (EC) is in place, consisting of Chair, Secretary/Treasurer, and four Directors. After the provisionary status, an election will be held to elect the EC. Under the SIGKDD Bylaws, the positions of the Chair and Secretary/Treasurer will each be contested by at least two candidates. The Director positions will be contested by one more than the number of Directors SIGKDD wishes to have. The election takes place in an odd-numbered year. Besides the EC, a Chair X  X  Advisory Board is in place. The Board consists of 9 remaining members of the original KDD SC. The role of this Board is to advise the Chair on all key issues of SIGKDD and their implementations. The two primary means of communication with SIGKDD members will be an annual international conference and a newsletter. With the gracious concurrence of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence ( AAAI), SIGKDD has SIGKDD will have the KDD-99 Conference proceedings (and perhaps all past KDD Conference proceedings) in the SIGMOD CD-ROM anthology which will also contain all past proceedings of the SIGMOD conference, VLDB (Very Large Data Bases) conference, PODS (Principles of Database Systems) conference, and perhaps also the IEEE Data Engineering conference and the European EDBT (Extending Data Base Technology) conference. A 7 CD-ROM set will hold all the pages of all these database conference proceedings, and the KDD conference proceedings. SIGKDD plans to distribute the anthology, free of charge, to all registered attendees of KDD-99 and all SIGKDD members. In order to bring the KDD Conference and smaller overseas conferences for the field closer together, SIGKDD has formed an International Liaisons Board. The Board consists of two prominent colleagues in Europe, and three in Asia. Discussions are underway to determine concrete means of collaboration between SIGKDD and overseas conferences. The SIGKDD EC has appointed a webmaster to create and maintain a website for SIGKDD ( www.sigkdd.org), besides the KDD Conference website. The website will be an important means of communicating key events, activities, and decisions of SIGKDD to members and the field as a whole. SIGKDD  X  s goal is to sign up 2,000 members and a fund balance of $200,000 by the end of 1999. The annual membership fee is $20. Membership in ACM is not a prerequisite for membership in SIGKDD. Member benefits include a subscription to the SIGKDD Newsletter, a discount in the KDD Conference registration fee, the SIGMOD anthology, and discounts in the annual conferences of all collaborating societies. Above all, members have opportunities to indirectly contribute to advancement of the KDD/DM field by making it possible for SIGKDD to implement many useful and exciting programs for its members and the field as a whole. I find the potential of the KDD/DM technology exciting, and, with your support, help, and advice, I am ready to give my time and put to use my 8-year experiences as Chair of ACM SIGMOD to help make SIGKDD a resounding su ccess. Won  X  t you join SIGKDD and work with us? Thank you. Won Kim April, 1999 Austin, Texas Ph.D. (  X  80) in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
