 The amount of available geo-referenced data has seen a dra-matic explosion over the past few years. Human activities now generate digital traces that are annotated with loca-tion data, enabling the collection of rich information about people X  X  interests and habits. This torrent of geo-referenced data provides a tremendous potential to augment recom-mender systems. The LocalRec X 15 workshop brings together scholars from location-based services and recommender sys-tems, and seeks to set out new trends and research direc-tions.

Driven by technological advances in hardware (positioning systems, environmental sensors), software (standards, tools, network services), and aided by various open movements (open, linked, government data) and the ever-growing trend of sharing for the greater good (crowdsourcing, crowdfund-ing, collaborative and volunteered geographic information), the amount of available geo-referenced data has seen dra-matic explosion over the past few years.

We received ten submissions and we selected seven papers that are shortly summarized in the following.

Del Carmen Rodr  X  X guez-Hern  X andez et al. [2] survey location-aware recommender systems (LARS). The authors describe LARS as a kind of context-aware recommender system that focuses on the spatial properties of the items that can be recommended; they discuss a number of studies that have been published, categorizing them as domain-independent (i.e., about generic spatial-ratings) and domain-dependent (recommending POIs, tourist routes, news, and shopping). The authors close with a comprehensive table of open chal-lenges in this domain, that range from acquiring location data, evaluation, and security issues.

Giannopoulos et al. [3] present an approach to the recom-mendation of categories for geospatial entities annotation that leverages knowledge of previously annotated entities. They identify features that represent geospatial entities and capture their relation with the categories they are annotated with. These features involve spatial and textual properties of the entities. They evaluate two different learning approaches (SVM and kNN) and show that the best algorithm (SVM) can generate high precision category recommendations.
Kumar et al. [4] argue that close geographical distance does not necessarily imply increased similarity in users X  pref-erences. This reasoning is in contrast to popular location-aware recommender systems that assume similarity decreases with distance. In the movie domain, the authors find that nearby locations are more similar than slightly more dis-tant one, but average similarity does not generally decrease as distance increases. In fact, there are many cases where the average similarity of locations separated by thousands of kilometers exceeds the average similarity of nearby loca-tions. Therefore, their approach is to cluster users taking into account the similarity, instead of the proximity, of their locations, which leads to accuracy improvements compared to proximity-based and randomized clustering.

Lamche et al. [5] design a context-aware recommendation system for mobile shopping. The goal is to employ user X  X  mo-bile context for recommending clothing items in shops close to her position. Compared to existing mobile recommender systems, the challenge is to deal with frequent updates on the items list. The proposed framework extends a critique-based recommender system with a pre and a post-filtering stage. During pre-filtering, items relevant to the user con-text are determined based on factors such as the distance to or the opening hours of a shop and time of the day. Post-filtering employs a nearest neighbor algorithm to select the best-fits out of the items returned by the core recommender.
Lu et al. [6] introduce a location recommendation frame-work providing personalized recommendations. The pro-posed solution combines results from various recommenders that consider different factors. In a nutshell, the frame-work estimates, for each individual user, the underlying in-fluence of each factor and aggregates suggestions from dif-ferent recommenders based on this estimation.
