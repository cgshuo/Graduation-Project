 1. Introduction
Quality management (QM) is a philosophy or a management approach comprising a set of mutually reinforcing principles, each of which is supported by a set of practices and techniques ( Dean and Bowen, 1994 ).

One of the main areas of research in QM has concerned about how the QM practices affect the firm performance. The quality performance model presents several routes by which QM practice has an impact on quality, operational and business performance.
QM proponents claim that the reduction of the manufacturing process variability due to the set of QM practices can enhance internal process quality and subsequently achieve product con-formance quality. Utilizing statistical process control is one of the typical approaches. Moreover, by considering customer oriented QM practices, other product quality dimensions will be improved.
Garvin (1984) defined product quality and showed how internal process quality and product quality performance can affect opera-tional and business performance. Two main aspects for the impact of quality on business performance, that is, the manufacturing part and the market part, have been proposed.

From the manufacturing perspective, within the manufacturing network, good internal process quality management means fewer scrap, defects and rework, and leads to a better operational performance (e.g. lower manufacturing costs, more reliable pro-cesses), and substantial production improvement. Identifying order winner and order quantifiers in turn bring improvement in business performance, which is also the reason why quality management in manufacturing is so important ( Sousa and Voss, 2002 ).

However, in practical manufacturing environment, it always happens that knowledgeable workers are usually confronted with uncertainty which is resulted from lack of information, lexical impression, incompleteness and inaccuracy of measurements. Such uncertainty is incurred by different level of quality problems.
To solve these vague and fuzzy quality problems, fuzzy theory was introduced.Withlargenumberoffuzzytoolsandtechniquesapplied in quality management system, the unavoidable fuzzy information can be solved and many improved outcomes can be gained.
This paper presents a comprehensive review of literature related to application of fuzzy theory technique in QM for distributed manufacturing system. A classification of framework is also presented. In Section 2, the research methodology is presented; Section 3 presents the classification method and the detailed explanation for the QM and fuzzy theory technique;
Section 4 shows the classification of articles with their distri-bution in this area; and finally, the conclusions, limitations and implications of the study are discussed.
 2. Research methodology
As the nature of research in fuzzy theory and quality manage-materials are scattered across various journals. Expert systems with the most common academic discipline for fuzzy theory research in
QM. Under this condition, the following online journal databases were selected to search for a comprehensive bibliography of the academic literature on fuzzy theory and quality management: Science Direct Emerald management xplore IEEE xplore Academic Search Premier Engineering Village ( Table 1 )
The literature search was conducted based on the words  X  X  X uality management X  X ,  X  X  X uzzy theory X  X  and  X  X  X anufacturing sys-tem X  X , which originally produced results approximately as follows:
The full text of each article was reviewed to remove those that were not actually related to fuzzy theory applied in quality management of manufacturing system. The selection criteria were as following:
Only those articles which clearly explained how the fuzzy theory technique could be applied to the mentioned manufac-turing quality management system were selected.

Only those articles that had been published in quality manage-ment, fuzzy technique and manufacturing system related journals were selected, as these were the most appropriate outlets for fuzzy theory applied to quality management of manufacturing system research and the focus of this review.
Conference papers, master X  X  and do ctoral dissertations, textbooks andunpublishedworkingpaperswereexcluded,as academicsand practitioners alike most often use journals to acquire information anddisseminatenewfindings.Thus,journalsrepresentthehighest level of research ( Nord and Nord, 1995 ). 3. Classification method
Quality management is the process of identifying and admin-istering the activities necessary to achieve the organization X  X  quality objectives. Quality management is focused not only on product quality, but also the means to achieve it. Quality objective is a statement of the desired result to be achieved within a specific time period. Objectives can be created to achieve stability or unprecedented new levels of performance which can be either short term or long term ( Juran and Gryna, 1993 ).
 Accordingto Juran(1988),Ahireetal. (1995),Harvey(1998)and
Pyzdek (2003) , quality management (QM) can be generally divided into four dimensions: 1. Quality planning, 2. Quality control, 3. Quality assurance, 4. Quality improvement.

These four dimensions can be seen as a sequent flow in a quality management system. When applying such quality management system into large distributed manufacturing system, the system will be highly complex whose behaviors are not well known and some approximate situations would happen. Hence, fuzzy theory is feasible to be implemented, which is very useful in two general contexts: (1) in situations involving highly complex system whose behaviors are not completely understood and (2) in situations where an approximate, but fast solution, is warranted. Fuzzy technique based on fuzzy theory can be applied in several aspects to help to solve the uncertain problems. Within the quality management area, each technique can perform one or more of the following functional model referring to the selected articles ( Mehrabi and Kannatey-Asibu, 2001 ; Melin and Castillo, 2007 and other references): 1. Fuzzy numbers 2. Fuzzy AHP 3. Fuzzy decision making 4. Fuzzy programming 5. Fuzzy data analysis 6. Fuzzy optimization 7. Fuzzy clustering 8. Fuzzy QFD 9. Fuzzy inference 10. Fuzzy control
A graphical classification framework on fuzzy theory technique applied in quality management of distributed manufacturing system is proposed and shown in Fig. 1 . It is based on a review of the relevant literature ( Mehrabi and Kannatey-Asibu, 2001; Melin and Castillo, 2007 ). For all the QM dimensions and fuzzy techniques, a brief description and some references for further details are discussed in the Sections 3.1 and 3.2. 3.1. Classification framework  X  QM dimensions
In this study, QM is defined as the process of identifying and administering the activities necessa ry to achieve the organization X  X  quality objectives through the sequent flow including quality plan-ning, quality control, quality assurance and quality improvement. 1) Quality planning establishes the design of a product, service, or process that will meet customer, business and operational needs to produce the product before it is produced ( Juran, 1970 ). The elements of quality planning involve a number of universal steps: 2)
Quality control is the process used by the operating forces as an aid to meet the product and process goals. It is based on the feedback loop and consists of the following steps: 3) Quality assurance is all those planned and systematic actionsnecessaryto provideadequate confidencethata product or service will satisfy given requirement for quality ( Hoyle, 1994 ). 4) Quality improvement aims to attain levels of performance which are unprecedented  X  levels which are significantly better than any past level ( Juran, 1988 ). Generally, the methodologies implemented in quality improvement are following the phases below: 1. Identify a business problem  X  something wrong with a product, 2. Establish a project 3. Measure and analyze the current process to establish precise 4. Generate and test theories as to the causes of the poor 5. Prove root causes of the poor performance 6. Develop remedial improvements-changes to the process 7. Establish new controls to prevent recurrence and to sustain 8. Deal with resistance to change 9. Replicate the result and start a new project ( Juran, 1988 ) 3.2. Classification framework  X  fuzzy theory technique
Within the context of QM, fuzzy theory technique is the tool to process the uncertainty in a complex problem. It can help guide decision making and forecast or assess the effects of decisions under approximate condition. 1. Fuzzy number: As an extension of a regular number which does refer to one single value, a fuzzy number refers to a connected set of possible values, where each possible value is assigned its own weight between 0 and 1. The weight is named by the membership function. A fuzzy number is a special case of a convex fuzzy set ( Hanss, 2005 ). As fuzzy logic is an extension of
Boolean logic (which has only  X  X es X  and  X  X o X , and nothing between them), fuzzy number is also an extension of real numbers. The incorporation of uncertainty on parameter, geometry, properties, initial conditions, etc., is allowed in fuzzy number X  X calculations.Whensolvingqualityproblemsinservice and engineering, linguistic information usually appears as an important output of the process. This information is definitely more difficult to measure throughout a classical mathematical function. As a result, fuzzy number is introduced. 2. Fuzzy AHP: The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the most commonly used multi-criteria decision making methods.
Fuzzy AHP, a fuzzy extension of AHP, was developed to solve imprecise hierarchical problems. There are many fuzzy AHP methods developed by various authors. Most of them propose systematic approaches to the alternative selection and justi-fication problem using the concepts of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical structure analysis ( Wang and Chen, 2008 ). The application of fuzzy AHP is always accompanied with fuzzy decision making. When analyzing whether an element has a significant effect on the output quality, it is necessary to 3. Fuzzy decision making: Decision making is essentially an can be made: fuzzy ordering, individual decision making, multi-ple-person decision making, multiple-objective decision making and fuzzy Bayesian decision method ( Sivanandam et al., 2006 ). 4. Fuzzy programming: Fuzzy programming includes both fuzzy linear programming and fuzzy non-linear programming. Fuzzy linear programming helps solve linear programming by using the fuzzy coefficient for objective functions and constraints stated as max = min f  X  x  X  X  ~ cx ; subject to ~ Ax u ~ b where the fuzzy terms are denoted by tilde ( Carlsson et al., 2009 ). In the real world, the constraints coefficients are typically imprecise numbers because of vague information, for instance, demands, available capacities, cost requirement and technological coeffi-cients. Similarly, fuzzy non-linear programming is regarded as using fuzzy parameters in non-linear programming problems. 5. Fuzzy data analysis: Data analysis is a process beginning with some existing data sets, which contain the information on the respective generated application. Fuzzy data analysis is using fuzzy technique to solve the data analysis problems. It is the application of fuzzy systems to the analysis of crisp data. In quality management system, the input data is not accurate or tampered to show the high conformance, as large amount of data are collected manually with checklist. Just because of the unavoidable fuzzy data, fuzzy data analysis is especially important in QM system. 6. Fuzzy optimization, QM system always tries to establish performance of methods regulatory guidelines, or even inspect each process to assurethat good quality managementpractices have been implemented. The final goal is to guarantee the quality of products and processes, and meanwhile to optimize the cost or the efficiency. With the existing fuzzy information in practical QM system, fuzzy optimization considers optimi-zation problems of the following form: max = min f  X  x  X  subject to x A X where f or/and X are defined by fuzzy terms. Then they are searching for a crisp x * which maximizes or minimize f on X ( Carlsson et al., 2009 ).

The results obtained from classical optimization methods involving deterministic variables exhibit various shortcom-ings. In particular, the effects of the uncertainty attached to input information is often ignored altogether or only taken into account to a limited degree. In contrast, fuzzy optimization considers uncertain parameters as fuzzy variables ( M  X  oller et al., 2004 ). Similar as fuzzy programming, fuzzy optimization means to get the theoretical optimal results. However, due to the fuzzy information, the final most satisfactory results are obtained in the fuzzy way. 7. Fuzzy clustering: Data clustering is the process of dividing data elements into classes or clusters so that items in the same class have high similarity, and items in different classes are dissim-ilar to one another. When monitoring the quality in a system, data clustering of different error disturbances or product quality levels can simplify the monitoring tasks. Depending on the nature of the data and the purpose for which clustering is being used, different measures of similarity may be used to place items into classes, where the similarity measure controls how the clusters are formed. Some examples of measures that can be used in clustering include distance, connectivity and intensity ( Iancu, 1999 ). In hard clustering, data are divided into distinct clusters, and each data element belongs to exactly one cluster. In fuzzy clustering, data elements can belong to more than one cluster and a set of membership levels are associated with each element. These indicate the strength of the associa-tion between that data element and a particular cluster. Fuzzy clusteringisaprocessofdeterminingthesemembershiplevels, and then using them to assign data elements to one or more clusters ( Bezdek and Harris, 1978 ). 8. Fuzzy QFD: QFD is a  X  X  X ethod to transform user demands into design quality, to deploy the functions forming quality, and to deploy methods for achieving the design quality into subsys-tems and component parts, and ultimately to specific elements of the manufacturing process. X  X  ( Akao, 1994 ). Fuzzy QFD proposed a fuzzy procedure to examine the sensitivity of the ranking of HOWs to the defuzzification strategy and degree of fuzziness of fuzzy numbers. All these works aim to determine a rating of the HOWs ( Shen et al., 2001 ). 9. Fuzzy inference system: Fuzzy inference system consists of a fuzzification interface, a rule base, a database, a decision-making unit, and finally a defuzzification interface. The two most important types of fuzzy inference method are
Mamdani X  X  fuzzy inference method (Mamdani and Assilian, 1975 ) and Sugeno or Takagi X  X ugeno X  X ang method of fuzzy inference process ( Takagi and Sugeno, 1985 ). The Mamdani X  X  fuzzy inference method is the most commonly used inference method. The Takagi X  X ugeno X  X ang method of fuzzy inference process method is also called as TS method. The main difference between the two methods lies in the consequent 10. Fuzzy control: Classical control aims to solve problems and terms of fuzzy if-then rules. In fuzzy control, fuzzy sets are employed to give a definition to the qualitative values of controller inputs and outputs including small error and large control action. Moreover, the continuous nature of human decision processes can be captured using fuzzy logic, which is definitelyanimprovementovermethodsbased onbinarylogic. 3.3. Classification process
Each of the selected articles was reviewed and classified referring to the proposed classification framework. The classifica-tion process comprises the following four phases: 1. Online database search 2. Initial classification by manual 3. Agglomerative nesting clustering analysis method applied for classification 4. Final verification of classification
The whole selection criteria and evaluation framework are shown in Fig.2 . First, the articles are selected from the mentioned database with the keywords  X  X  X uality management X  X ,  X  X  X uzzy X  X  and  X  X  X anufacturing system X  X . The journal articles are retained while conference papers, master and doctoral dissertations, textbooks andunpublishedworkingpapersareallexcluded.Afterthisstep,all the retained articles will be further selected by researchers for the topicscontent X  X  X hetheritiscorerelatedtoQMorFL X  X .Successively, agglomerative nesting method is carried on as clustering classifi-was obtained.

Agglomerative nesting (AGNES) is the hierarchical clustering method using the agglomerative approach. AGNES can be described as a bottom-up approach. It starts clustering with a small piece of data object representing an individual cluster, followed by merging a series of clusters together. The cluster will increase continuously until the conditions for termination are met. Basic steps for AGNES can be summarized as follows: 1. Initially, each cluster contains one object. Two most similar clusters are selected. 2. Two  X  X  X ost similar X  X  clusters are chosen at each step. 3. The dissimilarity between two clusters can be estimated in various ways: single-linkage, complete-linkage and average-linkage. 4. Thesteps2 and3willberepeateduntil everyobjectis inonecluster.

The distribution of articles classified by the proposed classifica-tionmodelisshownin Fig.5 . Table2 displaysthedetailedreference classifications.

From the hierarchical in Fig. 5 , it can be found among the four dimensions that the fuzzy technique covering 21.3% (13 out of 61) articles can be applied for quality planning mainly that includes fuzzy numbers (2 out of 13 articles, 15.4%), fuzzy AHP (1 out of 13 articles, 7.7%), fuzzy decision making (3 out of 13 articles, 23.1%), fuzzy optimization (2 articles, 15.4%), fuzzy QFD (1 article, 7.7%), fuzzy programming (2 articles, 15.4%) and fuzzy inference (2 articles, 15.4%).

While the fuzzy techniques with 26.2% (16 out of 61) articles such as fuzzy control (2 out of 16 articles, 12.5%) , fuzzy inference (5 articles, 31.3%), fuzzy decision making (4 articles, 25.0%), fuzzy data analysis (2 articles, 12.5%), fuzzy clustering (1 article, 6.3%) and fuzzy AHP (2 articles, 12.5%) can be used for quality control.
Quality assurance accounts for 18.0% (11 out of 61) articles which introduces fuzzy inference (4 out of 11 articles, 36.4%), fuzzy numbers (2 articles, 18.2%), fuzzy decision making (2 articles, 18.2%), fuzzy clustering (2 article, 18.2%) and fuzzy data analysis (1 article, 9.1%).

Finally,qualityimprovementcoversmostor34.4%(21outof61) articles. The involved fuzzy techniques are fuzzy optimization fuzzy numbers (5 articles, 23.8%), fuzzy inference (3 articles, 14.3%), fuzzy QFD (2 articles, 9.5%), fuzzy decision making (7 articles, 33.3%), fuzzy programming (3 articles, 14.3%) and fuzzy clustering (1 article, 4.8%).

Table 2 shows the detailed classification and distribution of referenceinformationoutlinedin Fig.5 .Wecanclearlyfindthatthe different fuzzy tools could be implemented in various QM dimen-sions. Among all this 10 fuzzy tools, fuzzy decision making (16 out of 61 articles, 26.2%) is the most commonly used fuzzy techniques followed by the fuzzy inference system (14 articles, 23.0%). 4.2. Fuzzy tools association based on QM related articles
From the distribution result of articles in Section 4.1, we have obtained the most commonly used fuzzy tool for QM dimensions and are still unclear about the association between each individual fuzzy
As mentioned in Section 3, the clustering analysis method can be used to analyze the association among set elements. In this section, the agglomerative nesting (AGNES) discussed in Section 3 is chosen to figure out the fuzzy tools association. AGNES begins with the dissimilarity matrix, so the dissimilarity matrix on fuzzy tools needs to be solved first.

For each individual fuzzy tool, a relationship with all the articles can be developed with binary value. We assume if a certain fuzzy
With the 10 fuzzy tools and 61 studied QM related articles, a big complex 61 10 binary value matrix is obtained. The procedure to calculate the dissimilarity is shown in the following example and Table 3 shows the frequencyoffourpossible combination of A and B : Example: For either A or B , its value can be only 0 or 1:
Therefore d  X  A , B  X  X  b  X  c a  X  b  X  c  X  d  X  1  X 
Based on formula (1), a 10 10 fuzzy tools dissimilarity matrix can be established as shown in Fig. 6 . Each number from 1 to 10 in the following matrixrepresents the certain fuzzy tool mentioned in Section 3, respectively.

Referring to the AGNES process, the smallest dissimilarity is chosen within the dissimilarity matrix, which means that the two most similar clusters are selected and then merged together.
Repeat the operation and the two current  X  X  X ost similar X  X  clusters are chosenand mergedat eachstep untilall objectsare inoneofthe
In Fig. 7 , the bottom 10 fuzzy tools are the extracted fuzzy techniques based on the 61 studied articles. From the bottom 10 fuzzy tools clusters to the top one cluster, the dissimilarities are increasing. From Fig. 7 , we can find that the fuzzy programming is always combined with fuzzy optimization. Similarly, fuzzy data analysisformsaclusterwithfuzzyinferencewhilefuzzyAHPforms programming and fuzzy optimization, fuzzy QFD as their fuzzy techniques may also be implemented together. Similar situation may occur for the cluster including fuzzy data analysis, fuzzy inference and fuzzy decision making, and the cluster consists of fuzzy AHP, fuzzy control and fuzzy clustering shown at level 2.
From level 3, it can be easily found that the 4 fuzzy tools (fuzzy programming, fuzzy optimization, fuzzy QFD and fuzzy number) tools. Finally, the level 4 shows all the fuzzy techniques merged together are applied to the 61 studied QM related articles. dimensions The distribution of articles by year of publication based on four are fluctuant since 1995 but with an increase trend recently on quality planning, quality assurance and quality improvement.
Especially for quality improvement, the publications increase largely. While for quality control, the related publications increase articles by year of publication in quality management is increasing. Fuzzy
Infere nce 5. Conclusion, research implications and limitations
Because of the unavoidable uncertainty and fuzziness in the real manufacturing quality management system, fuzzy tools play a significant role in quality planning, control, assurance and improvement. This paper identified 61 articles related to applica-tion of fuzzy theory based quality management in distributed manufacturing network. It aims to give a research summary on the application of fuzzy theory in the QM domain of manufacturing.
This literature review provides rational valuable insights and a systematicclassificationonthissubject.Theresultsobtainedinthis review have several significant implications:
Theclassificationmethodisagenericwayappliedforliteratures which created a classification model that makes the whole process clear and direct.

This project begins the classification work with four QM dimensions, and then extracts out ten mainly used fuzzy tools from reviewed articles: fuzzy numbers, fuzzy AHP, fuzzy decisionmaking, fuzzyoptimization,fuzzyQFD, fuzzyprogram-ming, fuzzy inference, fuzzy control, fuzzy data analysis and fuzzy clustering.

From the classification results, it is not difficult to find that research on the application of fuzzy theory based quality management in distributed manufacturing network will keep on increasing in the future according to the distributions of past articles by year of publication. Among the four QM dimensions, only quality control part shows a decrease trend, which some-how implies that the technique and knowledge on this part has reached a relatively high level and stays in a stable state.
The reviewed articles are classified by four QM dimensions, and the classification result shows that quality improvement dimen-sion accounts for the majority of all studied articles. Compared with the relatively stable technique on quality control part, there is much more room for quality improvement domain to advance.
Consequently,mostfutureworksareexpectedtofocusonquality improvement with fuzzy decision making.

This paper has made another contribution by applying cluster-ing analysis method into fuzzy tools association analysis. With the introduction of the dissimilarity concept, a hierarchical tree is built and makes it easy to find the relation between the domains. Especially for understanding the correlation with various similar knowledge domains, the proposed hierarchical tree presents a guide map.

This study might have some limitations. Initially, the articles searched were limited to 5 popular online databases, and all other journals were excluded. Simultaneously, non-English publications were not taken into consideration. It may overlook some outstanding works in other languages. What X  X  more, the review was only focused on a sample of 61 selected articles which cannot guarantee covering all the aspects of the topics to be studied. However, our analysis to form a dendrogram to illustrate how the articles and levels of ing methods. This study contributes to a novel approach for reviewing the articles systematically and provides a guideline for future researches in adopting fuzzy logic to quality management.
