 A: More results on biomedical image data sets Figure 7 (a) shows the two dimensional representation of re-weighted Fly-FISH image samples (source) and the query images selected from the BDGP data set (target) by following the two stage strategy 2S-TAL . Figure 7 (b) shows the re-weighted Fly-FISH images and the query set selected from BDGP data set by the proposed joint optimization framework JO-TAL . Fig-ures 7 (c) and 7 (d) show the results for the cases with BDGP as the source and Fly-FISH as target or test data set. We observe similar results as with synthetic data. The proposed method is able to select comple-mentary instances from the two data sets. Please refer to Figure 7 (b), we clearly see that the source domain instances that got higher weight combined with the selected target domain instances, better represent the distribution of the target domain data than the dis-tribution represented by the corresponding instances in Figure 7 (a), which are selected based on 2-stage strategy 2S-TAL . Similar results are also observed for the cases shown in Figure 7 (c) and Figure 7 (d). B: More results on Sentiment Analysis data set Figure 8 shows the comparative performance of JO-TAL on Sentiment Analysis data set. The first and second names in the title of the figures refer to the source and target domain respectively. Figures 8 (a) and 8 (b) show the results with electronics and book data sets as source domains, while documents belong-ing to the category of dvd forming the target domain, respectively. We observe that for both cases JO-TAL and JO-TAL-Ent performed better than 2S-TAL by 7% to 10% 3 . We also observe that incorporation of transfer learning has improved the classification ac-curacies on dvd data set by 13% and 8% with elec-tronics and book as source domain data, respectively. This can be explained by the MMD values, which are 0 . 0321 and 0 . 0290 for book vs. dvd and electronics vs. dvd data sets respectively. Lower MMD value be-tween electronics and dvd, signify more relatedness in the data distribution than in the case of book vs. dvd. We observe very similar phenomenon in Figures 8 (c) and 8 (d), with electronics as target and book and dvd being the source domains respectively. In both the cases, JO-TAL and JO-TAL-Ent performed bet-
