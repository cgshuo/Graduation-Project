 My group mainly works on data mining applications in Internet products including the search engine. We study two types of data, Web data and user logs. First, the Web data includes different entities (e.g. websites and web pages), edges between entities (e.g. hyper links), and content (e.g. text and rich -media). Second, use logs contain various user behavior information produced by users when they are using the search engine or other Internet products. These two types of data have different properties, but are correlated and complementary. We build a compl ete view of the data, mine the most valuable knowledge from the data, and improve our various products, e.g. the Baidu search engine. The Web provides a broad data mining ap plication platform, and poses new challenges for the data mining community.  X  Multi -source data mining: the data source can be of websites,  X  Heterogeneous data mining: we have to mine knowledge
