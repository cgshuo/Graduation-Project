This leads to an upper bound on the log-partition function: where Computing the above quantity is in general NP-hard. Starting with the expression semidefinite program: The corresponding bound on the log-partition function, referred to as the maximum bound, is The complexity of this bound (using interior-point methods) is roughly O ( n 3 ) . omitted in this paper. Indeed, for every symmetric matrices Q, R we have the sub-gradient inequality 2.2 The cardinality bound This defines a partition of { 0 , 1 } n , thus where, for k  X  X  0 , . . . , n } , c k = |  X  k | , and Computing  X  k ( Q ) for arbitrary k  X  X  0 , . . . , n } is NP-hard. Based on the identity and using rank relaxation as before, we obtain the bound  X  k ( Q )  X   X  k ( Q ) , where We define the cardinality bound, as computed via n semidefinite programs of the form (9). Hence, its complexity is roughly O ( n 4 ) . Problem (9) admits the dual form problem (10). In fact, we have The above expression can be directly obtained from the following, valid for every  X ,  X  : ranges  X  k are constant, the cardinality bound is also exact.

We have the bound In the same fashion as for the quantity  X  k ( Q ) , we can express  X  k ( Q ) as where  X  min ( Q ) := min where we have used the fact that , for every symmetric matrix R , we have absolute error between Z ( Q ) and Z card ( Q ) is bounded as follows: We summarize our findings so far with the following theorem: Theorem 1 (Cardinality bound) The cardinality bound is 3.1 Tractable formulation that problem, referred to as the pseudo-maximum likelihood problem. This problem can be cast as the c k  X  X  and replace them by  X  k := 2  X  n c k  X  [0 , 1] . 3.2 Dual and interpretation When Q = S n , the dual to the above problem is (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the distributions q,  X  : We obtain the equivalent (non-convex) formulation marginal polytope, the other is to find an upper bound on the entropy function (4). First observe that we can express any distribution on { 0 , 1 } n as where Note that the functions p k are valid distributions on { 0 , 1 } n as well as  X  k . problem (3) as where X k  X  X  are the second-order moment matrices with respect to p k : d ( X k ) = x k , 1 T x k = k , 1 T X k 1 = k 2 , where x k is the mean under p k : This process yields exactly the constraints of the relaxed problem (14). since each p k has support in  X  k , its entropy is bounded above by log |  X  k | , as follows: which is, up to a constant, the objective of problem (14). 3.3 Ensuring quality via bounds on Q We consider the (exact) maximum-likelihood problem (2), with Q = { Q = Q T : k Q k 1  X   X  } : and its convex relaxation: problem, (16).
