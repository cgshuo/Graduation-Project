 1. Introduction more and more attention in the past ten years ( Chicurel, 2002 ;
Debeir et al., 2005 ; Mans fi eld et al., 2005 ; Chen et al., 2006 ; Yang et al., 2006 ). Its signi fi cance surges mainly due to its potential in achieving new and high-throughput way to conduct drug discov-ery and quantitative cellular studies. However, cellular analysis poses many challenges to those existing techniques because of severe image noise and clutter, cell shape deformation, and image contrast change. It is obvious that manual analysis of these images is a tedious process involving many efforts of human inspection.
Sometimes, it becomes impossible for an expert to accurately follow many different events over a long sequence, especially when it requires tracking a large number of cells during long period of time in order to obtain robust results. Thus, the lack of an automated system becomes the bottleneck of studying the cell cycle process in a systematic and quantitative manner.
 groups of automated or half-automated cell tracking techniques, i.e., model propagation based method, detection based method, and multi-object Bayesian probabilistic method. In terms of model propagation based methods, active contours ( Zimmer and approach has successfully solved various optimization problems inspired by ants clustering corpses to form cemeteries and sort the larvae into several piles, another type of ant-related algorithm, i.e., ant-based clustering method, is also developed on the swarm level and promising results are achieved for various data sets ( Deneubourg et al., 1991 ; Lumer and Faieta, 1994 ; Kanade and Hall, 2007 ). For instance, the ant behaviors of picking up and dropping items are modeled with a certain probability according to similarity or dissim-ilarity measure of local density of items ( Deneubourg et al., 1991 ; Lumer and Faieta, 1994 ). In Kanade and Hall, (2007) , Kanade et al. develop a fuzzy ants and clustering algorithm in which ants are combined with the fuzzy C-Means algorithm to fi nd the cluster centers in feature space.

As we observe in natural ant colonies, the movement of each ant is usually stochastic and non-linear, and similarly, each cell also travels in an irregular way and exhibits non-linear dynamic behavior in cell image sequences. As a result, the paths of individual ants are somewhat analogous to the tracks of individual cells. Motivated by these similarities, a novel parameter estimate algorithm, which models ant stochastic searching behavior for effective clustering but differs from the optimization idea of tradition ACO algorithm, is proposed to track multi-cells in various scenarios. In contrast to aforementioned cell tracking approaches, our algorithm fi rst uses the swarm intelligence, i.e., ant colony system, to deal with the problem of cell tracking, and moreover, it is expected that our approach could achieve better performance, since it belongs to the category of probabilistic method and is also characterized by  X  track-before-detect  X  technique. More speci fi -cally, to approximately locate cell distribution region in each frame, a kernel density estimation background subtraction technique is presented to generate the initial distribution of ant colonies; afterwards, to guide ants of the same interest to cluster together, the multi-colony reconstruction is p roposed using heuristic informa-tion such as histogram similarity and pheromone fi eld; fi nally, to jointlyestimatethestateofeachcellanddeterminetheidentityof each colony, we develop a fast ant clustering algorithm for determin-ing the number of cells and their individual locations, and then the cell label management strategy is proposed for ant colony corre-spondence between consecutive frames.

This paper is organized as follow. We fi rst present the approx-imation description of multi-object posterior density in Section 2 .In Section 3 , our ant-based algorithm is then proposed, which utilizes priori colony distribution block, multi-colony reconstruction block, and cell labeling and state extraction block sequentially. The experiment results on various cases are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, and discussions are detailed in Section 4 . Finally, conclusions are summarized in Section 5 . 2. The posterior multi-object density description For tracking n objects, we denote the multi-object state by X z  X  k  X  denote the image observation comprising an array of m pixel values, and z  X  1 : k  X  is de fi ned as cumulative image sequences up to
It uses pixel intensity as the basic feature for modeling the background, and keeps a sample of intensity values for each pixel in the image and further uses this sample to estimate the density function of the pixel intensity distribution. The main concern of this approach when applied to real problems is computational cost, but it is preferred and utilized in our studied cell image sequences since most cells move in a relatively slow way. In the following, such non-recursive technique is further improved to achieve more robust and reliable initial distribution of ant colonies.

Furthermore, the use of chromaticity coordinates enhances the insensitivity to small changes in illumination that usually occurs in cell imaging techniques.
 consecutive set of images in every k 0 frames. The set will be updated by removing the left oldest image from the set and appending the most recently recorded image to the right of the set. Therefore, the kernel density estimate of the probability that the i th pixel belongs to the background is calculated as follows:
P  X  ~ z i  X  k  X  X  X  1 N  X  N where d i  X  k  X  denotes one of three chromaticity coordinate compo-s d ; i  X  k  X  describes the intensity spread of Gaussian kernel function.
Since s d ; i  X  k  X  is sensitive to the quality of background subtraction, different values are taken for different pixels in general. In addition, different kernel bandwidths are used for chromaticity coordinates as well. In the k thimageframeofthevideo,wede fi ned the bandwidth of pixel i in the d ( d  X  r ; g ; I ) color coordinate as follows: s d ; i  X  k  X  X  median where d i  X  N  X  1  X  X  d i  X  k  X  ,andmedian j U j denotes the median absolute deviation.
 existing ant colonies, a novel and fast pheromone driven multi-colony reconstruction algorithm is developed as below. 3.2.1. Environment
Theenvironmentwhereantsoperateisthecurrentcellimage, and denoted by a tuple  X  P ; N  X  ,where P is a fi nite set of image pixels, and N D P P is a propagation relation among pixels. For instance, the set of neighborhoods of a pixel p A P is de fi ned as N  X  p  X  X  f q
A P : pNq g .Withthisenvironmentde fi nition, a cell image can be rede fi ned as a graph of pixel agents (thereafter called position agents, in short PAs), while ants in the image frame are moving only on PAs according to decision probability to fi nd locations where cells appear. Fig. 4 illustrates the above environment and ant moving constraints. Each position agent (PA) has at most four directly connected neighbors, for instance N  X  p  X  X  i ; j ; k ; n ,andeachPAsimultaneously belongs to at most four sets of neighbors, for instance i A N  X  p  X \ N  X  l  X \ N  X  o  X \ N  X  m  X g . We assume that each ant located on a given PA could move to only one of its neighbors at a time, but each PA could be visited simultaneously by several ants. 3.2.2. Pheromone
In our algorithm, there are three factors that affect the evolu-tion of pheromone in the above environment. Firstly, pheromone deposits from multiple ants can be aggregated and fused, and the intensity of pheromone is updated accordingly. Secondly, phero-mone deposit performs evaporation over time, and it simulates the memory ability of ant individuals. Finally, pheromone diffusion is modeled to build a connection within neighboring ants, and it disseminates information for access by neighboring agents. As a result, the pheromone level on each PA changes over time and a dynamic pheromone fi eld is established as a whole.

As implicated above, there are two issues to be addressed, namely, how to model the pheromone of each PA evaporating at a time, and how to describe the pheromone of each PA diffusing at a time. To do so, we introduce two parameters E and D ,where E is an evaporation rate of pheromone, and D is a diffusion rate of pher-omone. Thus, the evolution of pheromone is formulated as follows:  X   X  t  X  1 ; p  X  X  E U  X   X  t ; p  X  X   X  where  X   X  t ; p  X  denotes the intensity of pheromone at PA p at the t th iteration, r  X  i  X   X  t ; p  X  describes the amount of pheromone deposited by ant i at PA p at the t th iteration, and q  X  t ; p  X  models the propagation input at the t th iteration to PA p . Unlike the traditional ACO algorithm, the propagation term of q  X  t ; p  X  is considered to keep intensity continuity in the pheromone fi eld, and its evolution form is de fi ned as follows: q  X  t  X  1 ; p  X  X   X  remain its original PA. Such strategy contributes to neglecting the effect of ants that are wrongly placed at some PAs produced by false alarms, because the pheromone on these agents continues to evaporate without effective reinforcement as iteration evolves. largely on the similarity degree information of its neighbors, and the corresponding de fi nition of the similarity degree plays an important role in ant's decision, we assume that each ant has a memory of cell histogram and can sense and calculate the differ-ence between the region represented by any given PA and the prior cell blobs. Therefore, for the region histogram u p represented by PA p , the corresponding likelihood score is computed as follows: where  X  p lies in the range of 0 and 1,  X  and  X  are the adjustment coef fi cients designed for achieving better likelihood difference comparison, and g p is de fi ned as below: g p  X  1 j T f 0 gj  X  where ~ u i  X  j  X  denotes the value of the j th element of ~ u i in prior cell blob template pool, n is the total number of elements in a 3.3. Cell labeling and state extraction
Once the implementation of multi-colony reconstruction block is fi nished, the multimodality of pheromone, i.e., the pheromone fi eld, is established to be utilized to extract cell state in the following. In addition, the layout of ant colonies is formed with each ant being located on a PA with known pheromone level.
During the phase of ant colony reconstruction, as implicated in Eq. (11) , the behavior of each ant is determined by both the pheromone and the similarity measure, but depends mainly on similarity measure. However, in our approach, we assume that the stable pheromone fi eld is static, and the decision of each working ant relies only on the neighboring pheromone level. To do this, we fi rst randomly select a PA ~ z i  X  k  X  among these ant-occupied PAs, and then the corresponding occupied ant is copied and further move to another PA ~ z j  X  k  X  according to the probability P  X  four neighbors j N  X  ~ z i  X  k  X  X j r 4. Note that, due to the assumption of stable and static pheromone fi eld, we have removed the iteration index in Eq. (14) .
 continue to move according to Eq. (14) . Otherwise it will stop at PA ~ z  X  k  X  , then a new cluster center is declared. Table 2 describes our proposed fast ant clustering method, which is a variant and improved version of Ghosh et al. (2008) .

As indicated in Step 3, once a new cluster center, i.e., Z ~ i ,is generated, the partial ant-occupied PAs and ant colonies are clustered threshold equivalent to the average radius of cells of interest). Other ant-occupied PAs and ant colonies whose both pheromone levels and  X   X  Z i  X  X  assigned to the same cluster.

It is noted that not all ants are copied and execute the Steps 1 and 2, and moreover, both the intensity of each PA and the identity of each ant remain unchanged during the whole ant searching process. In addition, only one pass is executed for all PAs in the above algorithm, which results in lower computational complexity. The merging algorithm is performed if two clusters are located too closely with each other, and the prune algorithm is also done if the number of ants in each cluster is beyond the permitted range.
Cell labeling management is an indispensable step to characterize the feature of each cell in cell motion analysis. In our algorithm, we
According to the above de fi nitions, q i describes the proportion of one-step evolution of moving ant colonies, while P i denotes the updated posterior probability based on unidenti fi ed colonies, and proposed algorithm can automatically track cells with different dynamics and shapes, as illustrated in Fig. 8 (a). Fig. 8 (b) gives the position estimates of each cell in each frame in x and y -directions, respectively. In addition, our algorithm can track newly entering cell 3 in the 35th frame instantly. Fig. 9 presents the birth ant colony positions in selected frames after the prior colony distribu-tion block. It can be seen that these ant positions are the mixture of generated irregularly clutter points and partially cell outline points and they will be further processed, together with the one-step prediction of previous ant colonies, by the multi-colony reconstruction block. Fig. 10 illustrates the resulting multi-modal pheromone fi elds of selected frames after 30 iterations, and our algorithm can accurately describe the pheromone fi eld even in the case of two close cells (from frames 19 to 29). Fig. 11 (a) each cluster center is extracted to be the positions of cell of interest, as shown in Fig. 8 (b). It is noted that each cluster covers well the corresponding cell outline, and the maximum number of ants in each cluster is smaller than 250, which could help to save computation time.
 quantitatively compare our algorithm with two other methods, i.e., visual tracking via kernel density estimation (KDE) ( Elgammal et al., 2002 ) and the multi-Bernoulli fi ltering method in Hoseinnezhad et al. (2012) . Thus, the fi rst two measures are introduced, namely, false negative rate (FNR) and false alarm rate (FAR). The two rates are de fi ned as the total number of cells that are missed and the total number of non-existing cells that are tracked, both normalized over all total number of true cells over all image sequences. Another two measures are also introduced for our cell label management strategy, namely, label switching rate (LSR) and lost tracks ratio (LTR). The LSR is the number of label switching events normalized over total number of ground truth close tracks events (considering 10 events from frames 20 to 29 in case 1). The lost tracks ratio is the number of tracks lost normal-ized over total number of ground truth tracks. We record all false negative reports, false alarm reports, label switching reports, and tracks lost reports in each frame over 100 Monte-Carlo simula-tions, and the averaged FNR, FAR, LSR, and LTR are computed as illustrated in Table 4 . The comparison results demonstrate that our algorithm performs better than the KDE method in Elgammal et al. (2002) and the multi-Bernoulli fi ltering method in Hoseinnezhad et al. (2012) . Furthermore, we fi nd that both the false alarm and label switching reports often happen between frame 19 and frame 27.

In terms of case 2 , Fig. 12 presents an example of successfully tracking results. It could be seen that our algorithm can track at most 7 cells in poor image sequences, and partially entering (such as cell 5 entering in frame 2, cell 6 entering in frame 12, cell 7 entering in frame 18) and disappearing cells (such as cells 1 and 6 in frame 13) are tracked as well. Figs. 13  X  15 present, respectively, the birth ant colony positions in the prior colony distribution block, the resulting multi-modal pheromone fi eld in multi-colony reconstruction block, and the ant cluster distribution (where the of  X  could result in the intersection of different ant clusters, although two separate but neighboring peaks are obtained.
Fig. 16 (a)  X  (c) gives the results when ant's decision mainly depends on exploration due to smaller  X  with  X  j A  X  0 ; 1  X  . Although there are some intersections between ant clusters, we could successfully eventually results in dif fi culty in clustering step. Diffusion rate D controls not only the yielding shape of pheromone multi-modal fi eld, but also the tracking performance. A smaller D can easily cause track loss, while a bigger D can enhance the chance of interactions between neighboring clusters, which probably leads to false tracking such as cell label switching. Fig. 17 (a) plots the tracking results with a smaller value of D , where cell 1 is terminated while new  X  cell 3  X  is wrongly initiated and tracked. Fig. 17 (b) and (c) gives the desirable results with appropriate values of D  X  0 : 6 and 0.8. Fig. 17 (d) shows that the chance of interaction between ant clusters increases, and cell label switching occurs accordingly. As implicated in the above discussion, a E  X  0 : 6. 4.2.3. Other issues
Another main issue in various ant-based algorithms is the computational speed or burden, Table 6 illustrates the comparison statistic results among various methods. It can be observed that, although our algorithm runs relatively slowly, its computation speed is still far less than the sampling interval (4 min in case 1 and 3 min in case 2), and it is quite suitable for automated cell tracking in our studied image sequences. To view the evolution of pheromone in a given frame, Fig. 18 plots the maximum value in the pheromone fi eld at each iteration with MaxIter  X  500. It can be seen that the pheromone level in each frame is fi nite and limited, as stated in Lemma 2 , which is fundamental to reliable extraction of multi-cell states. 5. Conclusions
In the fi eld of cell tracking, multiple cells undergo different changes in shape and size, number, dynamic, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel robust ant-based multiple cell tracking algorithm for low-contrast image sequences. To probabilistically locate cell distribution region in each frame, we fi rst use the prior colony distribution block to generate initial ant colony distribution. To guide ants of the same interest to cluster together, the multi-colony reconstruction block is then implemented to build the multi-modal pheromone fi eld. Finally, the cell labeling and state extraction block is proposed to jointly estimate the state of each cell and determine the identity of each colony. According to the experiment results, our algorithm could track all cells in each frame with favorable FNR, FAR, LSR and LTR. Furthermore, our algorithm in essence belongs to the category of track-before-detection (TBD) fi lters, and it could give better tracking perfor-mance than the multi-Bernoulli fi ltering method, which is recently known as a novel and robust TBD tracker.
