 customer service. Many companies have developed e-Commerce web applications to operator. It is not only to provide the services for those who do not have access to the wireless/mobile phone. The aim of the project is to develop a dynamic and interactive voice user interface using the same business logic and backend database without the customers and ease the burden on the call centers. VoiceXML is a markup language for creating voice-user interfaces. It uses Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and/or touchtone (DTMF keypad) for input, and pre-recorded audio and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis for output. Current voice interfaces to the web are of two types: voice interface to screen display and voice-only interface. The dynamic voice interface presented in this paper is a voice-only interface that uses a telephone as an input and output device. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the addition of a dynamic voice interface to an existing web application using the VoiceXML and ASP technologies. Technically of a three-tier system architecture as illustrated in Fig. 2. 
In order to demonstrate the overall process, a typical e-Commerce storefront is chosen from one of Microsoft ASP .NET sample applications as shown in Fig. 3. can then update the quantities and add more products. At the shopping cart, the user can re-calculate the total cost and move on to the final checkout. and playback a dynamic audio as output. There are two servers involved in the process. First VoiceXML serv er accepts the user input and converts it as a request to the web server of the existing website. Then the web server processes the request and generates a dynamic response in VXML format using the existing system database. user. In this project, BeVocal.com developer caf X  is chosen as VoiceXML server and Microsoft IIS as Web Server. It is known from previous research that the VXML dynamism, Microsoft ASP technologies are used to generate the dynamical responses VXML-enabled application is illustrated in Fig. 4 . 4.1 Start Menu Once a user calls GrocerToGo, the system greets the user first. Then system prompts the three different categories to the user: Based upon the user X  X  selection from the system directs the user to a specific category such as milk or soda or cereals. 4.2 Shopping from the existing database are prompted to the user. The following is the interaction between the user and the server computer: 4.3 Checkout Once the user finishes shopping, the system calculates the total cost for the user and directs the user to the checkout. The equivalent voice communication is below: The proposed dynamic voice interface has been successfully designed, implemented and demonstrated for an existing e-Comm erce web application. This has been achieved by using Voice XML server BeVocal.com and Microsoft IIS Web Server. The developed dynamic voice system has a fully working voice interface and contains similar functionalities to those of the existing web application. It provides a prototype provide powerful dialog capabilities to build advanced speech applications that can be enable the developer to create more powerful, maintainable and portable voice applications in the future.
