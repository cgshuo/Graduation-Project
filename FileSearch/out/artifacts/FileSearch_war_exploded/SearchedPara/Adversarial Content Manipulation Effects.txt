 W e address a question that has been somewhat overlooked throughout the transition from classical ad hoc retrieval to Web search: how is the performance of classical retrieval ap-proaches affected by the presence of content manipulation? Our initial experiments have shown that the relative perfor-mance patterns of some classical retrieval strategies might change in the transition from non-manipulated to manipu-lated corpora. A natural future venue to explore is how to mix these strategies and make (some of) them more robust under presumed content manipulation conditions.

C lassical ad hoc (query-based) retrieval approaches fo-cus on the document content for determining relevance to queries. On the other hand, the abundance of informa-tion over the Web has driven the utilization of additional information sources such as anchor text [9] and hyperlink structure [2]. Such information sources can potentially help search engines to cope, for example, with the adversarial na-ture of Web search. That is, the fact that some Web-page creators manipulate the content of pages so as to have them ranked high in response to popular queries, even if the pages do not pertain to the expressed information needs. How-ever, as is typical in adversarial settings, manipulation with respect to these additional information sources, e.g., artifi-cial creation of hyperlinks, has emerged [4]. Indeed, various forms of manipulation have been acknowledged as among the main challenges that search engines have to address [5]. Naturally, then, there is a large body of work on automati-cally detecting and handling different forms of manipulation [1, 3].

Throughout this ever evolving process of an adversarial search setting, a highly interesting question has been some-what overlooked: how do classical retrieval methods that depend solely on the content of documents and some corpus-based term statistics perform in the presence of content manipulation? Intuitively, such approaches, which heavily rely on within-document term-frequency information, can b e easily  X  X islead X  by the simplest form of manipulation  X  keyword stuffing of popular query terms [4]. Indeed, early experiments in the Web setting have shown that the per-formance of classical retrieval methods is inferior to that of Web search engines that utilize, among others, hyperlink information [10].

Our initial experiments have shown that the relative per-formance patterns of some classical retrieval strategies can change in the transition from clean (non-manipulated) cor-pora to corpora containing content-manipulated documents. More specifically, we contrasted standard document-based retrieval with (i) passage-based document retrieval [7], (ii) cluster-based document retrieval [8], and (iii) pseudo-feedback-based retrieval [6].

There are numerous research challenges that rise from our findings. For example, improving the performance of (some of) these classical retrieval methods under presumed con-tent manipulation conditions, and combining the different strategies and making them more robust to content manip-ulation. Developing new content-based retrieval methods that are resistant to manipulation and are better suited for the adversarial nature of the Web is another interesting re-search direction.
