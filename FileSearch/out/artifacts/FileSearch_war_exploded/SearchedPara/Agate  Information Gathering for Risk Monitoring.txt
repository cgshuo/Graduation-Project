Internet sources provide new ways to acquire information about risk and to follow up the evolution of natural disasters in real time. We will present first, an architecture dedicated to unstructured information processing. Then, we will show how the spatial and temporal representation extended with semantic properties answers information ambiguity problem. Agate platform was evaluated by a non-governmental orga-nization which filtered alerts according to types of disaster and their locations.
Agate platform is based on WebLab [2] service oriented architecture. We developed services based on open source components to build a custom semantic processing chain from Information Retrieval and Natural Language Process-ing algorithms.

Focused Crawling: Raw information is acquired through real time web sites crawling. To gather up-to-date informa-tion, we retrieve data from syndication feeds (RSS) avail-able on generalist sites. This method offers a standard way to access information from various sites (blogs, forum and news). Feeds are composed of structured metadata (source, date. . . ) and raw text.

Entities Extraction: We defined a GATE X  X  pipeline [1] to extract any valuable piece of information in our context i.e. casualties and implied organisations, property dam-ages and events with spatial and temporal information. . . in order to maximise the precision. These pieces of infor-mation are added to those extracted from the RSS feeds metadata. Thus structured information is extracted from raw text:  X  Dozens of houses near Manshiyet Nasser shanty town east of Cairo were destroyed by boulders and rocks  X .
