Come to share your experiences and learn from others! The Information and Computer Science Department at the University of California at Irvine is pleased to announce the introduction of a Masters degree in computer science with a KDD specialization. Students can choose from a curriculum including courses in data mining, database modeling, machine learning, information retrieval, probabilistic learning, and multivariate statistics. Participating faculty in this program include Padhraic Smyth, Sharad Mehrotra, Michael Pazzani, Dennis Kibler, and Bob Newcomb. The goal of this MS specialization is to educate students in both the fundamental principles of computational methods for modeling data as well as a providing a broad foundation in emerging methods for knowledge discovery and data mining. In addition to the coursework, numerous opportunities exist for students to participate in research projects with participating http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gc ounsel/masterreqs.html for further details. Data mining at the University of Wisconsin-Madison received a boost this month from Microsoft Corporation. The research division of the company based in Redmond, Washington, awarded the Computer Sciences Department a four-year grant, valued at approximately $720,000, to establish a Data Mining Institute to study the hidden potential of huge databases. "This grant is part of our overall commitment to collaborating with major academic institutions and fostering the growth of important new cross-disciplinary areas like data mining," said Jim Gray, senior researcher for scalable servers at Microsoft Research. "UW-Madison is one of the top academic database research gr oups in the world, and we X  X e delighted to be working with this premiere group of scientists." "Data mining has received a great deal of attention among large corporations and industrial research labs for years," said Usama Fayyad, senior researcher in data mining and exploration for Microsoft Research. "I X  X  excited to see one of the top universities in database systems form a Data Mining Institute bridging several disciplines. I hope to see many more computer science departments establish formal academic programs in data mining." The DMI will be directed by Olvi Mangasarian and Raghu Ramakrishnan and will also have Jeff Naughton and Michael Ferris as principal investigators. Around six PhD students will be supported while doing their research in data mining. It is anticipated that the unrestricted nature of the grant will enable DMI researchers to investigate higher-risk problems and to work with a broader range of application experts. The goals of the UW-Madison DMI are to bring together the powerful tools of the database and the mathematical programming communities to harness and extract knowledge from the vast store of data that is being accumulated by i ndustrial, research and internet organizations. Ramakrishnan said the university is especially equipped to work on real-world applications with enormous databases. Very large-scale applications already exist. Companies specializing in credit card fraud reduction have programs that can analyze millions of daily credit transactions. The search programs are trained to flag peculiarities that might suggest theft, such as changes in location or types of purchase. The World Wide Web will be the catalyst for much broader data mining applications, said Ramakrishnan, since it provides the ultimate publicly accessible database. Mining the Web is different from conventional key word searching, since the programs are designed to find patterns or trends across different subjects. One exciting example at UW-Madison is a breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis tool developed by UW-Madison computer sciences professor Olvi Mangasarian and Medical School colleagues. The data mining program analyzes tumor size and fine-needle aspirate samples to estimate cancer-free periods for patients. The program recently mined a National Cancer Institute database of more than 40,000 breast cancer patients, helping the program achieve more reliable results. The goal is to provide a non-invasive option for prognosis. Patients currently have to undergo a painful removal of lymph nodes under their arm to r eceive an accurate prognosis, said Mangasarian. Ramakrishnan plans to exploit systematic data evolution to achieve significant performance improvements in incremental maintenance of data mining models, and to "monitor" the changes in data characteristics as the database evolves. As organizations collect and maintain ever-larger data sets over time, describing operations conducted at several locations, they want to know how trends evolve over time and how trends vary by location. Ramakrishnan will investigate efficient algorithms for the answering these questions. In developing algorithms, the approach will be to consider how these algorithms impact the underlying data management systems, and how they can benefit from existing query processing capabilities. Naughton X  X  principal interest in data mining is to study how relational database systems such as Microsoft SQL-Server and OLAP tools such as Microsoft Plato can be more tightly integrated with data mining techniques. Among the tasks to be considered are (a) how can the existing capabilities of systems like SQL-server and Plato be exploited for data mining purposes, (b) how can systems like SQL-server and Plato be extended to better support data Mining, and (c) how can the results of a data mining session be incorporated back into these systems to enable further interactive analysis. Mangasarian plans to work on generalized support vector machines (GSVMs) which are key to data discrimination in very high dimensional feature spaces that ca nnot easily be handled by other techniques. GSVMs separate data by a very general nonlinear surface i nduced by an arbitrary kernel and simplified by parameter suppression. Linear programming chunking and successive overrelaxation algorithms for massive data discrimination will be further extended beyond the 10-million datasets currently processed. These approaches will be applied to various datasets and particularly to medical ones such as the National Cancer Institute SEER Database of over 40,000 breast cancer cases which has already been mined for practical survival curves. Ferris plans to efficiently use vast amounts of computing resources to solve very large-scale mathematical programs generated by data mining problems. The principal aim of his research has been the development of tools that enable applications experts to formulate and solve such optimization problems on a metacomputer. In order to make many optimization techniques practical, they need to be carried out in parallel. Rather than require a large parallel computer, Ferris will utilize metacomputer, a confederation of heterogeneous computing resources including, but not limited to, supercomputers, workstations, and specialized machines connected through a network. The tool developed for concurrently solving optimization problems exploits one vast, and largely untapped, part of this metacomputer, a pool of pre-existing,  X  off-the-shelf'' workstations via Condor. Ferris also plans to work on modeling languages such as GAMS and AMPL in conjunction with the Condor distributed computing system to solve extremely large data mining problems. The University of California, Irvine KDD Archive is a new online repository of large data sets encompassing a wide variety of data types, analysis tasks, and application areas. The primary role of this repository is to serve as a benchmark testbed to enable researchers in knowledge discovery and data mining to scale existing and future data analysis algorithms to very large data sets. This repository is currently under construction and is still in a preliminary form. This work is supported by a grant from the Information and Data Management Program at the National Science Foundation and is intended to extend the existing UCI Machine Learning Database Repository by several orders of magnitude.

Research publications and Ph.D./M.Sc. theses can be downloaded from there as well. The CViz tool for cluster visualization and analysis has recently been updated on the Alphaworks web site. CViz allows the analyst to visualize high dimension data sets by clustering the examples drawing scatter plots along the planes defined by the cluster centroids. These scatter plots can then be dynamically rotated. This version of CViz can take raw text input files and cluster each line of the file as a text example.
