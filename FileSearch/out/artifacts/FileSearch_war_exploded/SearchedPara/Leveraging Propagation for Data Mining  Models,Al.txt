 Can we infer if a user is sick from her tweet? How do opin-ions get formed in online forums? Which people should we immunize to prevent an epidemic as fast as possible? How do we quickly zoom out of a graph? Graphs X  X lso known as networks X  X re powerful tools for modeling processes and situations of interest in real life domains of social systems, cyber-security, epidemiology, and biology. They are ubiqui-tous, from online social networks, gene-regulatory networks, to router graphs.

This tutorial will cover recent and state-of-the-art research on how propagation-like processes can help big-data mining specifically involving large networks and time-series, algo-rithms behind network problems, and their practical appli-cations in various diverse settings. Topics include diffusion and virus propagation in networks, anomaly and outbreak detection, event prediction and connections with work in public health, the web and online media, social sciences, hu-manities, and cyber-security.
 Graph Mining; Propagation; Dynamical Processes; Diffu-sion; Cyber Security; Public Health; Social Media Target Audience: The target audience is data mining, data management, data science researchers and practition-ers in both academia and industry, who desire to learn more about models and tools based on propagation-like processes involving large datasets. There will be special emphasis on the cross-disciplinary aspect of the concepts and tools in-volved.
 Relevance: The topic is very interdisciplinary, with con-nections to many high-impact areas X  X ublic health and epi-demiology, systems biology, social sciences and humanities, cyber security, viral marketing and social media X  X ence this tutorial would be of interest to a broad cross-section of the KDD audience. Some of the numerous applications in-clude disease modeling, trend forecasting, information cas-cade prediction, protest forecasting, data visualization, rec-ommendation systems, social networks, and data compres-sion. Due to the explosion in the availablity of large datasets, the emphasis of this tutorial will be on recent progress span-ning novel algorithms, techniques, and new applications. Prerequisites: For maximum benefit, the expected pre-requisite is an undergraduate degree in computer science or a related field. However, the tutorial X  X  emphasis is on the intuition behind the results and tools so that data science re-searchers and practitioners can broadly digest the concepts.
The tutorial consists of three parts overall (the intended total duration is 3hrs, with a 0.5hr break). The tutorial webpage is at: http://www.cs.vt.edu/  X badityap/TALKS/ 16-kdd-tutorial/.
In this part, the goal is to understand various fundamen-tal propagation models and learn about properties of such processes (like epidemic thresholds), in a variety of settings, e.g., static networks, single viruses, dynamic networks, and multiple competing contagions. We will also demonstrate how many such processes share underlying similarities core problems. We will particularly review recent analytical re-sults based on these models and their practical implications.
The flow will be:
In this part of the tutorial we will focus on state-of-the-art inference and optimization algorithms for multiple set-tings introduced in Part 1 such as: immunization, influence estimation, cascade network inference, influence maximiza-tion, and reverse engineering epidemics. The focus will be on how to design algorithms on general arbitrary networks, with effective guarantees and which scale up to networks of millions and billions of nodes. The algorithms use a variety of techniques including stochastic optimization, submodular optimization, survival theory, and the minimum description length principle.

The flow will be:
In this part, we will focus on numerous applications, in-volving the use of propagation to solve different problems in various domains from graph mining, meme-tracking, tweets trends, predicting malware attacks (cyber-security), civil un-rest forecasting, disease forecasting, spatio-temporal fore-casting, and filling-in missing data. Here we also intend to show demos of some of our tools such as graph summariza-tion and flu-trend prediction.
