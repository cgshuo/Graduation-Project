 In the past, leading newspaper companies and broadcasters were the sole distributors of news articles, and thus news consumers simply received news articles from those outlets at regular inter-vals. However, the growth of social media and smart devices led to a considerable change in this traditional relationship between news providers and consumers. Hundreds of thousands of news articles are now distributed on social media, and consumers can ac-cess those articles at any time via smart devices. This has meant that news providers are under pressure to fin ways of engaging the attention of consumers. This paper provides a novel solution to this problem by identifying attractive headlines as a gateway to news articles. We firs perform one of the firs investigations of news headlines on a major viral medium. Using our investigation as a basis, we also propose a learning-to-rank method that suggests promising news headlines. Our experiments with 2,000 news arti-cles demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately identify attractive news headlines from the candidates and reveals several promising factors of making news articles go viral.
 I.2.7 [ Artificia Intelligence ]: Natural Language Processing News headlines; virality; social media; learning to rank
In the golden era of mass media, leading news outlets and TV broadcasting stations played a central role in publishing and dis-tributing news articles. News consumers simply received and di-gested news articles from those outlets at regular pre-define inter-vals, according to the broadcast schedule of news programs. The emergence of the internet gave news providers a new channel for distributing news articles, and it also generated new opportunities for consumers to access news articles whenever they used their PCs. However, leading news outlets continued to dominate the c market, and the relationship between news providers and consumers has remained unilateral.

However, the wide-spread use of hand-held devices such as smart-phones and tablets has completely changed the way of accessing news articles. Consumers can check news articles whenever they want through such hand-held devices. At the same time, the re-sources and platforms for publishing and distributing news articles have also shifted from the officia sites of leading news outlets to social media. Any type of news article published by any news provider has a potential to go viral across social media. This has led to a considerable change in the traditional relationship between news providers and consumers. Consumers have no choice but to select news articles so that they can read within a limited amount of time, and news providers are under pressure to fin ways of en-gaging consumer attention.

The change in relationship shown above also encouraged the commercial growth of new types of social platforms such as cu-ration, aggregation, and viral media. Those platforms employ var-ious strategies to steer consumers towards their news content. For example, Upworthy, a major viral medium, proposes ten ways to make content go viral [4], including web designs, impressive im-ages, and optimization for target social platforms. Another viral medium, Buzzfeed, introduces A/B testing to fin promising sto-lines are the most significan factor in terms of providing a gateway to news articles, and greatly influenc our impression of news ar-ticles. Upworthy recommends us to write 25 headlines and to test the best ones. However, the process of generating and identifying attractive news headlines relies heavily on seat of the pants work by highly skilled editors and curators.

Our ultimate goal is the fully automatic generation of attractive headlines for news articles that have the potential to go viral on social media. As the firs step towards this goal, we now focus on the problem of suggesting a promising headline from a given set of hand-crafted candidate headlines. This will contribute to the quantificatio and visualization of the virality of news headlines that might be considered difficul to measure and even to assist the editors and curators working for news providers.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We begin by performing one of the firs examinations of viral media data. In particular, we analyze the relationships between (a) news ar-ticles published on a major viral medium, (b) tweets as Twitter-focused news headlines posted by the officia Twitter account and (c) retweet/favorite counts as a tractable measure of virality. This investigation reveals promising factors that boost the virality of headlines. (2) Based on the investigation, we propose a learning-to-rank approach to the problem of suggesting attractive news head-lines. Given a news article ("a query" in the learning-to-rank frame-work) and headline candidates ("documents"), our method ranks candidates in descending order of estimated virality ("relevance"). We evaluate the performance of the proposed method with a large corpus, and reveal which factors actually helped to boost virality.
The spread of social media use on news outlets, the emergence of data journalism and the rise of automatic news aggregation imply a new trend for the seamless integration of news media, social media and data mining. Interdisciplinary work across news media, social media and data mining is becoming a hot research topic. Tsagkias et al. [14] developed a method of constructing queries to discover tweets that implicitly refer to a target news article. Moniz et al. [12] used a regression technique to estimate future tweet counts of news events and to re-rank news articles. Castillo et al. [1] presented a study of the life cycle of news articles posted on social media. However, all the above researches focused mainly on social messages posted by news consumers, and research and discussion from the perspective of news providers has been largely neglected. This paper is unique in that we explore ways of distributing news articles on social media via data mining approaches.

Several studies tried to quantify and predict content virality. Suh et al. [13] and Diakopoulos et al. [3] independently investigated which factors contribute to the virality of Twitter messages posted from major news outlets from sociological standpoints. Guerini et al. [5], Deza and Parikh [2] tried to understand the virality of image content. However, all the above studies focused only on the effect of content (Tweets or images) on virality, and relationships between content (Tweets) and hyperlinked destinations (news articles) have yet to be explored. In contrast, this paper tries to reveal the source of virality from headlines themselves and the relationships between headlines and news articles. We firs investigate a corpus of viral media data. We chose The Huffingto Post (Japan Edition) as the target news outlet. The of-ficia Twitter account @HuffPostJapan produces tweets an average of 40 tweet posts per day. Every tweet consists of a description and a link to an article, and every article is linked to an average of three officia tweets with different descriptions. We believe The Huffing ton Post to be one of the best subjects for investigating relationships between news articles, their descriptions and the power of virality, since side effects caused by the accounts can be removed.
We crawled news articles published by The Huffingto Post and tweets posted by their officia account in September and October 2014, and manually investigated the obtained corpus. The number of tweets we used is 858 (almost half of all the tweets posted in this period) and the number of articles contained in those tweets is 276. First, the main text, the time stamp, links to images, the retweet and favorite count are extracted from every tweet. We observe that only 5% (40 tweets) obtain 100 RT+fav counts and 85% (732 tweets) have less than 50RT+fav counts. The maximum RT+fav count is 703, and the minimum is 0. Next, the main text is split into a header noted in brackets and the content. The content is further segmented into morphemes. Then, meaningless parts are removed such as postpositions and symbols.

Of all the tweets, 1/3 (285 tweets) contain links to image con-tents, and many of them were the firs tweet for a news article. We also found that tweets with images tend to get higher RT+fav count. In fact, all but one of the top 50 tweets of the RT+fav count con-tain images, and only one tweet with an RT+fav count of less than Table 1: Extracted features (b: binary, i: integer, r: real value) f ve contains an image. This indicates that the presence of shared images contributes greatly to increased virality.

We also check the firs appearance in an article of words used in a tweet. We found that less than 50% (43.3%) of words firs appeared in the firs paragraph. In most of leading newspapers, headlines are constructed from the content of the firs paragraph of the article. However, this is not in the case with The Huffingto Post. We also found that there are many examples of re-phrasing, paraphrasing and abbreviations (28%, 539 words) in tweets. This implies that it is insufficien simply to extract certain features with low-level keyword matching and we should introduce some sophis-ticated techniques that take the meaning of the word into account.
We also observed that several tweets with large RT+fav counts include certain surprises or curiosity gaps in relation to the usage of words and phrases. Upworthy also noticed that social headlines require a curiosity gap [4]. We have to understand the meanings of words and phrases in some ways and combine them so as to generate curiosity gaps and surprises.
Having analyzed the characteristics of viral media as they oper-ate today, we also hope to build a method that identifie attractive news headlines from candidate hand-crafted sentences.

Our method consists of the following three steps: (1) Feature ex-traction: This step extracts a feature vector x c  X  X  N from a given candidate headline h c , the corresponding news article a eral additional pieces of meta information m c related to posting time and user statistics. (2) Model training: This step obtains a model f : R N  X  X  that produces an estimated degree v c  X  X  of virality from a given feature x c  X  X  N . A model can be trained with triads { ( x c ,a c ,v c ) } c =1 , 2 ,...,C tr of a feature vector x corresponding news article a c and the ground-truth degree rality. A naive solution to this problem is the regression of the de-gree v c of virality from a given feature x c . However, this strategy is not appropriate since virality can be affected by both the candidate and the corresponding article. Instead, we adopt a learning-to-rank approach, which is frequently used for information retrieval. In this framework, we can consider a news article to be "a query" and can-didate headlines as "documents" that must be retrieved and ranked. (3) Candidate selection: This step selects the best headline the high estimated degree of virality from a set of candidate head-lines {  X  h c } c =1 , 2 ,C te with the help of the trained model.
In the following, we describe feature extraction in detail. We assume Twitter as the target social platform, and assume that every candidate headline (hereafter candidate ) will be posted as a tweet with a link to the corresponding news article. Table 1 outlines the features we propose in this paper. As shown in this table, all the features can be categorized into six feature groups: Image, Time, Keyword, Structure, User and Distribute.

Image : shared images Major viral media have noticed that shared images (images attached to a headline) are essential to gain a high click-through rate [4]. Meanwhile, a previous paper [6] pointed out that we cannot estimate the click-through rates from image contents even with gold-standard features. Thus, we defin a binary feature Image representing the presence of image links.

Time : time stamps of headlines and articles Many previous stud-ies have indicated that posting time of candidates highly contributes to virality. We defin the following three types of features related to posting time: (1) Time-diff : Negative logarithm of the difference between the time stamp of a candidate and that of the corresponding article. (2) Time-period : Time slots, every slot define a single bi-nary feature: Midnight (1-5am), morning (6-8am), AM (9-11am), noon (12am-1pm), PM (2-4pm), evening (5-7pm), night (8-12pm). (3) Time-weekday : We defin a binary feature representing week-days or weekends.

Keyword : specifi / predefine keywords We observed in the in-vestigation that low-level keyword matching might not help to boost virality. To validate the hypothesis, we select the following 24 key-words that were frequently used in the top tweets of the RT+fav count and defin a binary feature Keyword-predefine for each key-dark side, true picture, what is, fact), methods (theory, how to, method, know-how), surprise (awesome, brilliant, amazing, won-derful, surprising, shocked), special (customized, special, reserved, contained in a headline and defin a single integer feature Keyword-publisher . As the last feature, we count the number of common nouns and proper nouns contained in both a candidate and the firs paragraph of the article and defin a single binary feature Keyword-paragraph for each count.

Structure : structure of candidate headlines Our investigation in-dicated that brackets are often utilized at the beginning of tweets to drive the attention of readers and to emphasize the keywords or key phrases noted in the brackets. We here defin a binary feature Structure-header representing the presence of leading brackets and four other binary features Structure-keyword representing the pres-ence of pre-define keywords (new, updated, picture, breaking) in the brackets. Another type of feature can be define from the order of words. We defin f ve binary features Structure-front represent-ing whether the firs word is (1) a common noun, (2) a pronoun or (3) a proper noun and the second word is (4) a common noun or (5) a proper noun. We use Mecab [9] to split Japanese sentences into morphemes and to obtain a word class for every morpheme. We also defin another single binary feature Structure-title that repre-sents whether a candidate contains the title of the corresponding article or not, since the title of a news article might not be the most suitable as a viral headline. For the same purpose, we defin an-other real-valued feature Structure-distance as a negative logarithm of Levenshtein distance between a candidate and the article title. In addition, as the net slang "tl;dr" suggests, social media users tend to skip long messages. We thus introduce two real-valued features Structure-length , each representing the negative logarithm of the total number of words and characters in a candidate.

User : user statistics We also defin four real-valued features User based on user statistics for social platforms: logarithms of (1) the ticle HTML. number of followers, (2) the number of following users, (3) the number of lists and (4) the total number of posts.

Distribute : distributed representation of words As mentioned in our investigation, taking the meanings of words into account is es-sential. For this purpose, we exploit a distributed representation [11], which learns a model for embedding a word w in a multi-dimensional vector y ( w )  X  X  M representing certain conceptual relationships. A simple similarity measure s : R M  X R M  X  X  such as a cosine similarity works well to compute a conceptual similarity, and simple vector operations such as addition and sub-traction while also preserving conceptual relationships. We use word2vec [11] to obtain distributed representations and Wikipedia as a corpus. We firs defin the following four types of features Distribute-similarity related to the similarity of words or phrases: (1) Similarity between a pair of most similar nouns. where g ( h c ) is a subset of a candidate h c that contains only nouns. (2) Similarity between a tweet and the title t ( a c ) of the correspond-ing article a c . (3) Similarity between a tweet and a set k ( a c ) of article keywords. (4) Similarity between a tweet and the firs paragraph of the article. This is computed almost the same way as the second one.
Our investigation also indicates that social headlines might re-quire surprises or curiosity gaps. We try to explore these types of abstract concepts through a distributed representation. We defin the following three types of features Distribute-gap : (1) Negative similarity between an outlier and all the others in a candidate. We firs select an outlier word o ( h c ) (resp. noun o ( g ( h c )) ) from a candidate h c , and then compute the similarity between the outlier word (resp. noun) and the others. (2) Negative similarity between the outlier and the pair of the most similar nouns. (3) Negative similarity between the outlier word (resp. noun) and the word (resp. noun) furthest from the outlier. To evaluate our proposed method, we crawled Twitter posts through Figure 1: Experimental evaluation results. All: our proposed method, All SVR: direct regression of virality with the same features as our method, Random: random prediction, others: ranking with individual feature groups. 2015). From the tweets, we extracted those that (a) contained a link to an article in The Huffingto Post Japan, (b) were retweeted or favorited by someone, and (c) found other tweets with the link to the same article, resulting in a total of 24,000 tweets. Concur-rently, we retrieved articles of The Huffingto Post Japan contained in those tweets, which provided us with 2,900 articles. We adopted the sum of the retweet and favorite counts as a measure of virality. We use the normalized discount cumulative gain (NDCG@ k , a predefine integer) for evaluating ranked results. We compared the proposed method with (1) random prediction for reference, (2) a learning-to-rank method with individual feature groups, and (3) a regression method with all the features. We used SVMrank [7] with linear kernels to train learning-to-rank models and SVMlight with linear kernels to train regression models. We randomly chose 90% of the tweets as training data and the remaining 10% as test data. We trained models on the training data and tuned the SVM hyper-parameters with 9-fold cross validation, and obtained evalu-ation results for the test data.

Figure 1 summarizes the result. We observe that our method is the best performer with NDCG@1=0.451 and NDCG@3=0.605.
 We also fin that the proposed learning-to-rank approach outper-formed a regression approach (NDCG@1=0.445, NDCG@3=0.603). Several individual feature groups such as Picture , Structure and Distribute also worked reasonably well, and the feature group Key-word yielded poor performance. This supports our hypothesis that low-level keyword matching does not make sense and taking the meanings of words into account is essential.

To explore which factors actually helped to boost virality, we investigated the weight of the features in the leaned linear mod-els. Figure 2 shows the features yielding the top 10 and bottom 10 weights. This result indicates that (1) we should post headlines as early as possible, (2) article titles might not be appropriate as news headlines for social media, (3) headers consisting of brackets and special keywords such as "breaking" and "new" drive the attention of readers, and (4) there should be as few as possible characters in headlines. We also see that the feature group Distribute yielded larger weights, which again supports our hypothesis that taking the meanings of words into account is essential. Interestingly, user statistics such as the number of followers, friends and lists had a detrimental effect on virality.

We have proposed a novel approach for suggesting attractive headlines for news articles for social media. Our investigation of viral media data revealed several promising factors that might boost the virality of news headlines. Based on our investigation, we proposed a novel learning-to-rank approach for the problem of selecting attractive news headlines from a given set of hand-crafted candidate headlines. Experiments with a corpus consisting of Twit-ter posts and linked news articles showed the effectiveness of our proposed method. The promising result provided by the proposed method is simply the firs step to our ultimate goal, namely fully automatic generation of attractive headlines of news articles. Much future research can be done in this aspect. We are especially inter-ested in developing more effective features, applying our method to other news outlets and generating candidate tweets automatically. [1] Castillo et al.
