 This paper describes research focused on understanding the relationships between operatio nal knowledge about how online collective action systems work and participation in those systems. Specifically, I use qualitative in terviews to examine knowledge about online systems that form public goods, questioning whether the notions of public goods and so cial dilemmas are relevant and meaningful for individuals ma king real-world participation decisions. This paper also desc ribes concurrent experimental research focused on explori ng the relationship between knowledge about one X  X  own and others X  competence to contribute to collective goals as a factor in participation decisions.

Millio ns of individuals work together to aggregate, annotate, and share digital text, audio, images, and video. Increasingly, innovation in interactive web technologies has been based on ha rnessing the efforts of millions of web users. In this environment, promoting and sustaining participation is key. Online collective action systems have already been successful in a wide range of domains, from encyclopedic knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia) to media sharing (e.g. Flickr, YouTube) and distributed work (e .g. Mechanical Turk, Project Gutenberg). Despite their scal e and popularity, however, online collaborative systems have succee ded largely on the basis of a low level of participation. By one measure, for example, just two percent of Wikipedia users account for 75% of participation [8]. What might be possible if partic ipation moved from 2% to 10%  X  or even 50%? A key first step to understanding a nd promoting participation is to examine motivations for participation. In my research I interrogate motivations with the understanding that an individual X  X  motivation depends in part on what he knows about how a given system works. While economists have long investigated incomplete information about goods in the market, they have less frequently addr essed the question of what individuals know about how ma rket itself operates  X  of operational knowledge . Users are likely to come to online collective action with different levels of operational knowledge. Existing research has done little to reveal levels of operational knowledge in online collective ac tion systems, or how that knowledge may influence per ceptions, motivations, and behaviors. Traditional discourse on collective action, for example, identifies just two categories of individuals: those who participate and those who free ride. However, the assumption that those who free ride do so with full knowledge of their range of options is un-supported. While there are many reasons that individuals do not contribute to Wikipedia, for example, a comm on one may be that they do not know how to do so. It is easy to ima gine a scenario in which a less knowledgeable individual performs a web search and, clicking on that individual reads the entry and notices several typographical errors, but does not fix them beca use she does not know that the system allows her to, she is not a free rider  X  the traditional notion requires an informed decision  X  and yet she is not a contributor. Acting with incomplete operationa l knowledge, this individual is un-accounted for by the traditional model. This example illustrates a key underlying assumption in this research: in order to meaningfully investigate motivations for participation in online collective action, we must take into account individual levels of operational knowledge. One key aspect of a system X  X  opera tion is the set of constraints on who can participate and who can partake of the product of collective effort. Many online systems such as Wikipedia form public goods. They are freely available to everyone (i.e. they are non-excludable) and one person X  X  use of them does not diminish the amount available to others (i.e. they are non-rivalrous). This structure presents a social dilemma that can set individual and group outcomes against each other. An individual X  X  most profitable option in a public good s ituation may be to free ride on the efforts of others, making use of the collective product without ever contributing. Yet if everyone made that same individually rational decision, the public good would not be provided for anyone. The concepts of public goods and social dilemmas are useful for summarizing and analyzing the structure of collective action systems. In previous research, I have examined the nature of online collective action systems such as blogs, YouTube, Wikipedia, or Project Gutenber g as public goods, and discussed the influence of these structures on motivations and incentives for participation [1, 5, 6]. These systems comprise some of the most popular and useful resources on the web today. In my current research I take the concepts of public goods and social dilemmas as a starting point for a mixed-methodological investigation. Though they are anal ytically valuable notions that have been extensively used in a variety of fields, comparatively little research has attempted to understand knowledge about and perceptions of public goods and social dilemmas in real-world contexts. If we are to argue that the structure of collective action influences individual behavior, we must first uncover what individuals really know and be lieve about those structures. The qualitative phase of this research will be aimed at understanding the notions of public goods and social dilemmas from the point of view of potential participants. Using a series of qualitative interviews, I will address questions such as:  X  How much operational knowledge about online collective  X  How do knowledge and perceptions of online collaborative  X  What types of knowledge an d assumptions about other I will use interviews to gather meaningful, in-context narratives and ideas as they relate to operational knowledge and participation. I will also use a series of labor atory experiments to explore the relationships between specific types of operational knowledge and participation. I will focus on a particular type of operational knowledge: knowledge that relates to competence. One feature of the individual referenced in the above Wikipedia example is that he lacks re levant knowledge about how to contribute. In other words, he lacks competence, where competence is defined as having sufficient knowledge or skills to act effectively in a given context. Perceptions of competence reflect beliefs about one X  X  own ability or the ability of others to contribute to the public good. Once we challenge the assumption that all individuals are fully and equally competent, perceptions of competence become essential influences to behavior in social dilemma situations. Precisely how perceptions of competence figure into decisions to contribute or free-ride in online collective action is the main focus of the experimental portion of this research. The experimental phase will addr ess two primary goals. First, it will test two hypotheses: (1) individuals contribute more in collective action situations when they believe that they are highly competent, and; (2) they contribute more when they believe that they are more competent than other group members. Secondly, the experiments will explore attitudes that mediate the relationship between competence information and behavior. I will test three arguments that explain the relationship between competence information and contribution: While researchers have begun to tu rn their attention to questions of motivation and incentives in specific real-world systems, there is a need for basic research to understand the antecedents of participation. Operational knowle dge is a key element of that basic understanding. From a theo retical point of view, this research will add valuable qualitative and quantitative evidence to our understanding of participation decisions. In particular, I hope to reveal the key importance of operational knowledge in real-world settings. In an applied sense, the research will facilitate the informed design of incentives that can use feedback and information about the structure of online collective action to promote participation. By recognizing the potential influence of operational information for potentia l contributors, designers may learn to target feedback in the most efficient and productive manner to improve participation. 1.
