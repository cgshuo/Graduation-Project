 This study examines dating strate gies in Social Networking Sites (SNS) and the features that help participants achieve their dating goals. Qualitative data suggests the SNS feature, the friends list, plays a prominent role in finding potential dates, verifying credibility, and validating ongoing relationship commitment levels. Observations of how study participants use the friends list may provide design implications for social networking sites interested in facilitating romantic connection among their users. More broadly, this research shows how subtle user-interface design choices in social compu ting software can have a profound effect on non-trivial activities like finding a life partner.

 Design, Human Factors Social networking sites, online dating, internet dating, MySpace, Friendster, friends list, top friends This paper investigates how pe ople use SNS for dating. What features unique to SNS do people use in their dating strategies? Why do people choose to date on SNS rather than online dating sites? What are their behaviors and perceptions of dating on SNS, and how are these different from online dating sites? Using qualitative data from twelve intervie ws, we examine the strategies participants use to find potential dates, verify credibility, and validate ongoing relationshi p commitment levels. The primary focus of this paper is on the friends list and how it influences dating strategies on SNS. Dating in online environments has been reported ex tensively in past papers [10, 11, 12]. We reference existing literature for SNS history, feature functionality, and concepts that may explain SNS dating behavior such as identity, self-representati on and social capital. While there are many SNS today, the study data come from two well-established sites with critical mass and widespread popularity: Friendster and MySpace. The friends list is the public displa y of one X  X  entire social network in which the connections are reciprocated. A friends list can be comprised of hundreds of friends, but only a subset of these friends appear on the front page of a member X  X  profile. This selective display of friends is called  X  X y Friends X  in Friendster (Figure 1) and  X  X op Friends X  in MySpace (Figure 2). For simplicity, we refer to the selective display as Top Friends for either site. Top Friends is an area of a member profile that displays a select group of friends arranged in the order the member chooses. Because only a finite number of friends can be Top Friends, being included in Top Friends is perceived to be an expression of how important their friendships are. People have been searching for l ove on the web using dating sites such as Match.com since 1995. With the entry of dating sites like Yahoo! Personals in 1997 and eHarmony in 2000, among many others, 16 million adults used online dating sites in 2005 [21]. But not as many people are using online dating sites in recent years. Ten percent of internet users vis ited at least one online dating site in 2006, down from 16% in 2005 and 21% in 2002 [2]. An industry expert, David Evans of On line Dating Insider, attributes the traffic decline to the increasing popularity of SNS [14]. According to Hitwise, social networking traffic increased 11% from January 2007 to February 2007 [26]. Not all online dating experts agree. Nate Elliott of JupiterResearch does not blame his industry X  X  decline on SNS.  X  X ocial networking isn't the culpr it. Online dating sites need to offer more special discounts to lure visitors back. X  He believes people who date on SNS are not the people who would pay for a subscription on a dating site [2]. To understand how online dating and social networking are related, we provide a brief history of Friendster. In 2002, Jonathan Abrams launche d Friendster as a dating site. Perceived as the first widely a dopted SNS, Abrams X  premise was that people would rather date thei r friends X  friends than strangers. He wanted to take the  X  X leaze factor X  out of online dating.  X  X  wanted to create an alternative for people who prefer a different approach. There X  X  a social context. It's collaborative. You don't use a pseudonym. It's not as a nonymous." Friendster became an online hangout phenomenon with 2 million subscribers within 7 months [20]. People created profiles in Friendster and invited their friends. Once they had a network, they broadened it by looking up old friends and adding new people they met offline. Although Abrams established Friendster primarily as a dating site, it was the social networking component --the ability to browse others X  friends list and see to whom they were connected --that users found compelling [20]. boyd discusses how people were indeed dating through their connections, but they were also interested in connecting to new people they woul d never meet offline. In order to connect to a more diverse group of people outside of their network, members soon began creating fake characters, celebrities, icons, and bands, which came to be known as  X  X akesters. X  One such Fakester was the television character Homer Simpson.  X  X ri ending X  Homer Simpson (adding him as a friend) was not only connecting to other people with a shared interest in the show (and to their friends), but it was telling the Friendster community something about who you are [4, 5]. However, adhering to the origin al purpose of Friendster (meeting and dating people your friends know), the creators deleted the Fakesters X  accounts, severing the social networks that were connected through them [4]. MySpace launched in 2003 with emphasis on social networking rather than dating. Unlike Friendster, MySpace imposed no restrictions on who created profiles. People found ways to hack the code to make their profiles more expressive. When they changed the layout, colors, styl es, and added music and video, MySpace let them [4, 5]. Celebrities, icons, and bands whose profiles were deleted on Friendster created profiles in MySpace. Bands, in particular, played an important role in MySpace from the beginning. Small, local bands finally had their own website where they could showcase their music, share concert dates, and grow their fan base. Millions of new members joined MySpace, attracted to the music of indie bands, the ability to download their music for free, and the opportunity to interact with them [4, 6]. On leaving Friendster for MySpace, a participant commented: When she first joined MySpace in 2005, Annie spent much of her time looking for new music and planning to see local bands. Today, she uses MySpace as an extension of her social life. She logs in several times a day, rep lies to messages, leaves comments, reads blogs, and less frequently, updates her profile with new photos. Most people remember MySpace having its origins in music, but today, it is a site that people join because it seems everyone is on it. MySpace has over 160 million profiles (www.myspace.com) and is the numbe r one visited SNS site that accounts for 80% of all SNS traffic [28]. With so many people hanging out in one place, it is easy to see how people are using it to date. In order to study dating behavior on SNS, we interviewed twelve people who used Friendster or MySpace for dating. Other participant criteria included age (older than 18), length of membership (more than three months), time spent on SNS per week (more than 2 hours), and life stage (post college or currently not in college). Eight women a nd four men who met the above criteria became the purposeful sampling group. We used several methods to recruit participants with varied levels of success: direct messaging through Friendster and MySpace, posting a notice on Craigslist, word of mouth [1], and snowball sampling [16]. Not surprisingly, word of mouth personal introductions from friends of frie nds proved most effective. Because there has been little research on the topic of dating behavior on SNS, we took an inductive approach by allowing themes to emerge from the data rather than starting with a hypothesis [16]. The interview was semi-structured with open-ended research questions about pa rticipants X  SNS dating history, such as how they meet potential dates, assess compatibility, determine credibility, and develop the relationship. All participants allowed us to access to their profiles on Friendster or MySpace during our interviews (which sometimes meant adding the authors as a friends because their profiles were set to private). We encouraged participants to share other relevant thoughts pertaining to dating on SNS. Eight participants who used online dating sites in the past frequently compared dating experiences and perceptions of both sites. We conducted ten telephone and two in-person interviews that were 60 to 90 minutes long. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Of the twelve participants inte rviewed, eight were female and four were male. They were from ur ban areas of five states. Their SNS memberships varied from 6 months to 3 years and dating experiences on SNS ranged from dating one person to four people. Seven participants had al so used fee-based online dating sites in the past. The age ranged from 26 to 36, and 30 was the mean. We excluded undergraduate stude nts who have a ready-made social network  X  classmates at sc hool who, if engaged with SNS, are more likely members of Facebook. According to boyd, their SNS participation differs from a dults X  participation in SNS. Students prefer to socialize with people they know while adults find value in socializing with stra ngers [5]. Lampe, Ellison, and Steinfield agree that students use SNS such as Facebook to learn more about people they meet offlin e, and are not likely to use the site to initiate new connections [22]. A female participant explained the reason she joined Friendster: Stephanie described the difficulty of making friends without the context of college and hoped to m eet new people using Friendster. The study sought participants past the school life stage who did not depend on the school social network and were regularly engaged in meeting new people on SNS to expand their social connections. The interview data offers insights to how people use SNS for dating. Specifically, the paper examines how the Top Friends influences dating strategies in four areas: 1) self presentation, 2) finding dates and determining credibility, 3) evaluating relationship status and commitmen t levels, and 4) maintaining relationships after the romance is over. Erving Goffman wrote that audience and context influence how people present themselves [17] . This notion of audience and context resonated with particip ants who had used both online dating sites and SNS for dating. They spoke of mediating their identities to accommodate the two audiences and contexts. Participants described the differe nces in their self presentation strategies given the following; when performing for a singular audience of potential dates in the context of online dating where reliability of identity cannot be verified by others, and when performing for a varied audience of friends and potential dates in the context of social networking where reliability of identity can be verified by others. Profiles from online dating sites and SNS display similar information; demographic deta ils (age, location, gender), photographs, description of who they are and who they would like to meet. This collection of in formation provides a picture of Marc, a 27 year-old runner whose favorite painter is William Blake. Marc has carefully crafted the cues he is giving and giving off [17]. The reference to Blake as a painter rather than a poet inadvertently gives off the impr ession that he has discerning appreciation for the humanities. A photograph of Marc at the Marine Corp marathon directly gi ves the information that he is physically fit. But is he really who he claims? What incentives does Marc have to ensure the impression he gives is a true presentation of him? How accurately Marc portrays himself is influenced by audience and context. Members of onlin e dating sites construct their identities by carefully analyzing the cues they give off [10]. Even with the best intentions to present an accurate impression, it is easy to prevaricate when the audience is composed of strangers. Members of SNS construct their identities for an audience of people they know; knowing friends will read the profile description encourages honesty in self presentation [9]. Participants who have used online dating sites and SNS commented how the Top Friends influenced their profiles: Participants did not perceive the differences of their profiles as misrepresentation, but rather as identity management that must be negotiated for the two distin ct audiences and contexts. Participants felt they needed to be  X  X eal X  or authentic in their SNS descriptions or risk ridicule from their friends. In effect, SNS friends encourage honesty, thereby increasing reliability of participants X  identities. The participants report two reasons for searching profiles on SNS. First is to support or expand existing connections by looking for people they know offline. Second is to meet new people they normally would not meet offline. Lampe, Ellison, and Steinfield refer to this type of searching as social browsing [22]. In the context of dating, participants act as social browsers, searching for new people they want to meet offline. One participant talked about meeting new people on MySpace:  X  X  X  X e always dated a lot before MySpace, so it X  X  not like I solely depend on it. But MySpace lets me meet a whole bunch of different people I wouldn X  X  meet everyday. It X  X  definitely expanded my horizons. X  She added she would have never met her current boyfriend offline even though they share an interest in science fiction. When asked about how they look for dates on SNS, participants described social browsing in tw o ways. Several participants browsed through their friends list, allowing interesting profiles to lead to others. Others searched by criteria, specifying characteristics they were looking for. Adding keywords filtered the results further, yielding a sm aller number of potential dates. Searching by criteria in SNS works the same way for online dating sites. To understand more a bout searching by criteria, see Fiore [11]. This section describe s how the friends list is used to look for dates. Six participants met their dates while browsing through Top Friends. Blake recalled the connection was two degrees apart (they shared a friend in common). Blake is a musician who checks his MySpace profile several times a day. He receives many messages from fans as well as from women who are romantically interested in him. Blake says he is selective in his responses, sometimes not replying at all. He often dismisses generic messages, like the one he received from a woman who complimented,  X  X ou have nice eyes. X  Jeanine X  X  message was just as generic.  X  X  like your jacket, X  she wrote, referring to a photo of him wearing a vintage jacket from the 1920s. Blake had heard the exact line before and found it unoriginal. But Jeanine knew Meg, and Meg was in his band. He and Meg had been playing together for two years. They loved jazz, collaborated on new music, and supported each other outside of the band. Blake trusted Meg; she had social capital. Even though the messages,  X  X ou have nice eyes, X  and  X  X  like your jacket X  were similarly uninteresting to him, Blake decided to respond to Jeanine because of her connection to Meg. Other participants met through connections more than two degrees apart, meandering from one profile to the next, allowing photos, comments, and interesti ng descriptions guide which profile to explore. Stephanie elaborated on her brow sing habits on Friendster. Prior to meeting Thomas, she actively looked for dates by using the search page. She had a search strategy that cast a wide but selective net so she can see th e all possible prospects who still met her criteria. She selected different combinations of desirable attributes, sometimes with or w ithout keywords. Disappointingly, she found no profiles worth pursuing in the eight months she had been a Friendster member. At the time, the epicenter of Stephanie X  X  social life was a neighborhood bar called the Standard . It was her  X  X hird place, X  a comfortable hangout where she was a regular [27]. The day Stephanie saw Thomas X  profile; he r starting point was a message from a friend from the Standard. Many clicks later, she stumbled upon Thomas X  profile. He was wearing a costume, and his headline reflected a sense of hum or she found attractive. Even though Thomas was many degrees away, her fondness for the Standard and Thomas X  X  loos e connection to it made him interesting. The tie through the Standard was enough for Stephanie to send Thomas a me ssage, the first contact she initiated on Friendster. At the time of submission of this paper, the couple reported they were still dating. When assessing the credibility of a profile, participants scrutinized the person X  X  interactions with his or her friends. They felt that understanding friendship c onnections can help determine the person X  X  credibility. A female participant said,  X  X ou can tell so much from looking at their fri ends. This guy messaged me. All his friends were girls in bikinis. He X  X  not all that cute, but all his friends are girls in bikinis? He wa sn X  X  interested in me. He X  X  just collecting faces. I X  X  like, no, you can X  X  have my face. X  She decided he was not credible because of the superficial connections to women who were not substantial friends. Connections can also be thought of as ties between friends. Participants looked for evidence of strong ties that signaled close strength was first described by the sociologist, Granovetter, who wrote that strength of a tie is a combination of characteristics such as frequency, trust, support, and reciprocity [19]. Participants looked for these characteristics when evaluating potential dates. Blake gave examples of a strong tie and a weak tie. Blake X  X  strategy for determining credibility was to examine all points of interaction between friends, including the comments they leave for each other on the main page as well as the comments on individual photos. A ge neric, impersonal message is with characteristics of trust and support. Another participant had a similar approach to assessing a person X  X  credibility, but she was more attentive to weak ties: Annie first talked about the signs that indicate strong ties, such as having a mix of men and women as friends who have similar tastes (fashion and beer), evidence they socialized offline (photographs taken together), and high activity of commenting from them. She pointed out the signs that indicate weak ties, such as having only one friend, To m Anderson, a cofounder of MySpace who is automatically added to all new member profiles. Tom as the only friend is an indi cation of a new member who has not added personal friends. Othe r signs of weak times include infrequency of comments from the same friends, indiscriminate acceptance of friend requests, and no photographs taken with friends. Annie X  X  conclusion that absence of strong ties signaled absence of credibility was echoed by her questions,  X  X ho are you? What are you about? X  Once participants began dating people they met on Friendster or MySpace, they referred to Top Fr iends to better understand their ongoing relationship status. They looked for two cues; reciprocity (am I in your Top Friends?) and symmetry (you are number one in my Top Friends. Where am I on yours?). Participants not only expected to see their profiles on their partners X  Top Friends, but they also expected to occupy a similar position on it. As one female partic ipant stated,  X  X he Top Friends tells me where I stand. X  She placed her boyfriend of four months in the number one position of her Top Friends. She was pleased to be number two on his. When aske d about the discrepancy, she said the number one position was given to his younger sister, a gesture she found very sweet. Be ing second after his sister was understandable and acceptable.  X  X ut if some other woman who is not family is ahead of me, that would take some explanation, X  she added. Marc dated a woman he met through MySpace for several months. A few weeks into their relationship, she moved him from the first row to the last row. Marc understood this order change to mean she was losing her affection for him. Although Marc did not remember the exact position he occupied on her Top Friends, he was awar e that she had moved him down significantly. Marc said the change occurred when they were in the  X  X ffy phase, X  and he knew  X  X t was going downhill. X  Despite his own demotion, he kept her at number two on his Top Friends. He considered moving her down but did not want to give the impression that he  X  X ared that much or even noticed the whole Top Friends thing. X  When the relationship ended a few weeks later, they removed each other from their respective Top Friends. Beth questioned her boyfriend X  X  commitment level when he took her off his Top Friends complete ly. She was surprised to find Brad had replaced a few people in his Top Friends with women she did not know. In her place was a much younger woman posing seductively. Beth commented Brad X  X  actions gave her a glimpse into a part of him she did not like. She was saddened that he was becoming  X  X ne of those guys who thinks ha ving hot girls on his Top Friends is cool. X  Brad caused a great deal of tension in their relationship because his Top Friends did not show reciprocity when Beth was looking for verification of his commitment to her. Most participants added their partne rs as friends when they started dating. When the relationships became more exclusive, participants promoted their part ners to Top Friends. However, Blake, the musician, did not prom ote Jeanine to his Top Friends. Blake X  X  decision not to put Jeanine on his Top Friends was a deliberate articulation of the importance of friendships over girlfriends. Blake X  X  Top Friends is truly reserved for his top friends. Of the twelve participants interviewed, six were still dating the same partners in March 2007. The participants, whose romance did not last, spoke of the positive and negative effects of remaining connected through Top Friends. Participants who spent time getti ng to know their dates before meeting in person found that maintaining the connection to each other eased the awkwardness of the break up. Several participants spoke of communicating with peopl e for up to two months before the first date. While they were interested in dating and did not want to  X  X lay email tag forever, X  they did not want to feel pressured into meeting too soon. Craig talked about how the four weeks he and Gina spent getting to know each other allowed them to stay friends after they broke up. During the long acquaintance period, Craig and Gina communicated electronically, sending and receiving lengthy emails and engaging in marat hon instant messaging sessions. By the time they met for the first date, Craig knew that Gina drank grape Kool-Aid until college, hate d her braces so much she pried them off, and thought about moving to Seattle to be closer to her mom. The dinner conversation was easy and fun, similar in tenor to their emails. On their fifth date, Gina told Craig that she thought of him as her good-looki ng cousin. Craig was crushed because he had grown to like Gina more since they started dating. His resolve not to contact Gina cr umbled within a day; he missed the daily emails from her. He sent a message to Gina on Friendster,  X  X  better be the best looking cousin you have, X  to which Gina responded,  X  X  only ha ve girl cousins. X  Their easy repartee was possible from the four weeks they spent getting to know one another prior to dating. They built up enough social capital that when romance did not work out, they were able to fall back into their pre-date friendshi p. Craig and Gina continued to communicate by email and remained on each other X  X  Top Friends for about a year. When Craig started dating someone seriously, he and Gina gradually lost touch. Contrary to Craig X  X  experience, when Beth and Brad broke up, she removed him from her Top Frie nds. She even deleted him as a friend, knowing MySpace will erase all evidence of their interaction with each other on the site. She was taking all possible measures to erase Brad from her MySpace profile. Beth complained the difficult part about breaking up on MySpace was no matter what she did to disc onnect from him, they were stubbornly connected through the friends they had in common. Through these friends, Brad was always available, only one degree away. The connection made him too acce ssible, and Beth found herself  X  X hecking up X  on Brad by looking for changes to his profile, blog entries, photos, and Top Friends. As part of the checking up activity, she browsed their mutual friends X  profiles, looking for comments from Brad to help her piece together what he has been doing recently. Beth admitted using the connections to engage in game playing that often accompanies break ups. She wrote carefully crafted comments on mutual friends X  profiles hoping to get Brad X  X  attention. As Beth shared her story, she remembered a friend teased that Beth was  X  X n the verge of having a Glenn Close moment 3 on MySpace. X  The comparison of Beth X  X  behavior to the Glenn Close character X  X  alarmed her greatly. A three-week break from MySpace helped her move past Brad. When Beth returned to MySpace, she decided not to communicate with their mutual friends. Their connection to Brad might resurrect memories of their painful breakup, or worse, her behavior. Participants repeatedly referred to dating on SNS as a  X  X atural X  way to meet people. The notion of intention played a role in why participants found dating on SNS natural. The intention of SNS is to connect to existing friends and meet new ones X  X wo social activities people engage in real life. SNS provides the social context for people to meet in ways they would in the real world. They meet potential dates through fellow band mates, like Blake, or through a local bar, like Stephanie. The feature in SNS that provides the social context is Top Friends. Similar to how friendships exhib it strong ties offline, strong ties are more explicitly expressed in SNS because every interaction among friends is displayed for ot hers to see. Participants instinctively look to these inter actions to help them assess the compatibility of dating prospects through all aspects of relationship development. Designers of social networking sites may be surprised at the extensive use of the Top Friends feature for self presentation and evaluation of potential dates. Participants who date people they meet on SNS struggle to express what their partners mean to them on Top Friends. Many find themselv es altering their Top Friends choices to meet the expectations of their partners. Participants have friends in various social circles who are meaningful in different ways. Offline, these friendships may be articulated privately with appropriate degree of affection. Online, the friendships are public and unnuanced. Top Friends does not currently distinguish the friendshi ps from romantic relationships, and participants are left to reply on basic cues such as the order and length of time they stay on their partners X  Top Friends to understand their relationship standing, User-interface design choices in social computing software can have a profound effect on non-trivial activities like finding a life partner. For example, is a friends list alphabetical, or is the order determined by the user? This may seem at first glance like a low-level detail, but we have found th at people pay attention to such details and use them to convey a surprising amount of meaning. In this research, we observed in detail how subtle interface design choices influence self presenta tion, finding dates, determining credibility, evaluating relationship status and commitment levels, and maintaining relationships af ter the romance is over. As designers, we must meet the ch allenge of improving the design features to help users negotiate and express the subtleties of meaningful relationships. [1] Babbie, Earl.
