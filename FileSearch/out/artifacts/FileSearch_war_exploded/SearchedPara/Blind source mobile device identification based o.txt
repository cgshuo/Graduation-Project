 fi cients (MFCCs) extracted from speech recordings has been proven to be fi cients to extract intrinsic mobile device features from near-silent 1. Introduction
A UDIO forensics has recently received considerable attention because it can be applied in different situations that require audio authenticity and integrity ( Kraetzer et al., 2012 ). Such situations include forensic acquisition, analysis, and evaluation of admissible audio recordings as crime evidence in court cases. Digital audio technology development has facilitated the manipulation, proces-sing, and editing of audio by using advanced software without leaving any visible trace. Thus, basic audio authentication techni-ques, such as listening tests and spectrum analysis, are easy to cross over. Authenticity of audio evidence is important as part of a civil and criminal law enforcement investigation or as part of an of fi cial inquiry into an accident or other civil incidents. In these processes, authenticity analysis determines whether the recorded information is original, contains alterations, or has discontinuities attributed to recorder stops and starts. Current approaches used to de fi ne audio recording authenticity are based on artifacts extracted from signals, which consist of (a) frequency spectra introduced by the recording environment (i.e., environment-based techniques), (b) frequency spectra produced by the recording device (i.e., device-based techniques), and (c) frequency spectra generated by the recording device power source (i.e., ENF-based techniques) ( Maher, 2009 ). The performance of environment-based techniques ( AlQahtani and Al Mazyad, 2011; Muhammad and Alghathbar, 2013 ) depends on the presence and the amount of foreground speech, background noise and environmental rever-berations. Moreover, advanced audio forgery software counterfeit the environmental effects without leaving any trace in the original fi le, which is a disadvantage of the environment-based techniques. Although ENF-based techniques ( Cooper, 2011; Ode Ojowu et al., 2012 ) provide high accuracy and novelty, they have limitations because ENF is only sometimes embedded in the recordings. A special case is when the appliance is battery powered and locates outside the coverage of the electromagnetic fi eld that is generated from the electric network. Even if the ENF pattern is detectable on the audio evidence, this method requires the ENF archive that is only available for limited areas.

In terms of device-based techniques, previous works focused on identifying the source of the recording devices. Nevertheless, the potential of the device-based techniques is hardly limited to this scope. Device-based techniques have been studied in three different directions: (a) identi fi cation of computer-generated audio from the original audio recording fi le ( Keonig and Lacey, 2012 ); (b) identi fi cation of the source brand, model, or individual acquisition devices that were used, such as telephone handsets, microphones ( Garcia-Romero and Epsy-Wilson, 2010; Panagakis and Kotropoulos, 2012 ), and cell phones ( Hanil X i et al., 2012 ); and (c) identi fi cation of the call origin to determine the network that was traversed (i.e., cellular, VoIP, and PSTN) and detailing the fi ngerprint of the call source, such as through a speech coder ( Balasubramaniyan et al., 2010; Jenner, 2011; Sharma et al., 2010 ). technique, namely, the identi fi cation of the brand, model and individual mobile devices used by using the audio recording. This particular focus makes this paper similar to studies on blind source camera identi fi cation by using digital images ( Kharrazi et al., 2004; Celiktutan et al., 2008; Swaminathan et al., 2007 ). For example, Swaminathan, et al. (2007) de fi ned feature-based image source camera identi fi cation as a blind method that can identify internal elements of a digital camera without having access to the camera. Although the methodology is similar, the adaptation of image forensic techniques in audio forensics introduces more challenges. These challenges are due to the different audio con-tents such as the human voices, footsteps and musical instru-ments. Secondly, the recorded audio may be a live record, playback record or call record. Hence, the audio signal processing chain may contain more than one acquisition devices that leave their intrinsic artifacts on the recorded audio. However, in terms of image forensics, usually one acquisition device (i.e. scanner, digital camera) generates the image.
 to identify the brand/model and individual mobile devices used where their VoIP conversation is received and recorded by a stationary device based on entropy  X  Mel-frequency cepstrum coef fi cient (MFCC) features. In addition, the suggested techniques can be extended to other types of communication devices and networks. A call recording signal is a mixture of an audio processed from a mobile device and transmitted to a stationary device with the audio processed from the stationary device and transmitted to the mobile device. This audio signal includes the intrinsic artifacts of its corresponding transmitting and recording ends. The mobile device artifacts are caused by its frequency response multiplied by the spectrum of the original audio signal and delivered through calls traverse cellular, PSTN and VoIP network. The frequency response of the acquisition devices is de fi ned based on the fact that for different electronic components, every realization of an electric circuits produces speci fi function ( Hanil X i et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the control environ-ments are applied to the recording setup to perform silent, speechless conversation. This setup eliminates the in fl uences by environments and the speakers. However because MFCC features are well known to model the context of the audio signal (e.g., speech), for silent recording we use the entropy of Mel cepstrum coef fi cients to intensify the energy of MFCCs. The experimental setup evaluates the feasibility of entropy  X  MFCC features against other statistical moments of MFCCs through different types of classi fi er and clustering techniques that are usually used in machine learning applications [e.g., support vector machine (SVM), na X ve Bayesian, and logistic regression].
 discusses related works. An overview of the source mobile device identi fi cation scheme is introduced in Section 3 and the overall methodology is described in Section 4 . Section 5 details the experimental setup and results. Finally, Section 6 explains further implications of the practical study, its limitations, and future applications. 2. Related works ef fi cient device identi fi er that determines the brand/type of the device used in processing the audio signal before recording. A considerable amount of research has been conducted on identify-ing the source recording devices, but to our knowledge, no forensic research has been performed to identify the transmission device from a recorded call. Most of the existing works in media forensics use multimedia data mining techniques as tools to identify the source devices. In general, multimedia data mining includes four steps: data preparation, feature extraction, feature analysis and decision making. However, no direct performance comparison is possible amongst existing methods. The reason is, methods and techniques adopted for each step differs with respect to the device type, the nature of the audio material, and the application scenario. Hence, Table 1 presents an overall perfor-mance of existing device-based techniques based on different audio features and machine learning techniques. This observation allows to identify the present state of the source acquisition device identi fi cation approaches in audio forensics, discover their con-tribution toward optimization and propose new directions. phones are the three main devices for identi fi cation. Previous works have mainly detected audio features in any of the following three categories: time domain, frequency domain, and Mel-cepstrum domain. Time domain features, such as zero-crossing rate and short-time energy ratio, are computationally light fea-tures, but they contain irrelevant data for classi fi cation ( Ghosal et al., 2009 ). Frequency domain features are useful particularly in speech-processing fi eld, for instance the linear signal variations induced by the transfer function of the speaker's vocal tract ( Shen et al., 1996 ). However, they show de fi ciency when non-linear signal variations known as convolutions exist in speech signals (i.e. transfer function of the speaker's vocal tract and the micro-phone device) ( Ye, 2004 ). Convolutions exist when convolved signals in the time domain are represented as a product of the Fourier transform function in the frequency domain. The Mel-cepstrum domain features such as MFCC, are of great concern because convolved signals are represented by a summation in the Mel-cepstrum domain ( Beigi, 2011a ). In terms of evaluation, all previous studies used an inter-device identi fi cation approach. However, intra-device identi fi cation requires more discriminant features and was only implemented in Kraetzer et al. (2011, 2012) and Hanil X i et al. (2012) . Identi fi cation accuracy is widely used as a metric for evaluation of machine learning techniques. The majority of methods evaluate the performance of the classi fi ers by using identi fi cation accuracy (ACC). ACC is determined based on the total number of true positive (TP) and true negative (TN) classi instances to the total number of instances.

Kraetzer et al. (2007) published the fi rst practical evaluation on microphone and environment classi fi cation. They used the com-bination of time-domain and Mel-cepstrum domain features in the classi fi cation by using Na X ve Bayesian classi fi er. Buchholz et al. (2009) focused on microphone classi fi cation through the histo-gram of Fourier coef fi cients and extracted the coef fi cients from near-silent frames to capture microphone properties. Kraetzer et al. (2011) developed a suitable context model for microphone forensics by using the feature extraction tool in Kraetzer and Dittmann (2010) . The model also utilised classi fi er benchmarking, and the audio fi les in Kraetzer et al. (2007) and Buchholz et al. (2009) . This study developed towards better generalization, when Kraetzer et al. (2012) constructed a new application model for microphone forensic investigations with the aim of detecting play-back recordings. In addition to microphone classi fi cation, Garcia-Romero and Epsy-Wilson (2010) proposed an automatic acquisition device identi fi cation by using landline telephone handsets and microphones. Panagakis and Kotropoulos (2012) proposed random spectral features and labeled spectral features (LSF) from speech recording for landline telephone handset identi fi cation. They also argued the robustness of these features over MFCCs and improved the accuracy of the identi fi cation by using sparse representation-based classi fi cation (SRC). Hanil X i, et al. (2012) proposed a cell phone identi fi cation method that uses MFCC features from speech recording in the classi fi cation by using SVM classi fi er with general-ized linear discriminant sequence (GLDS) kernel.

The related works sometimes use time domain features in combination with frequency domain and Mel-cepstrum domain features ( Kraetzer et al., 2007, 2011, 2012 ). However, Kraetzer et al. (2011) proved that time domain features contribute little to classi fi cation accuracy. In Buchholz et al. (2009) ) and Panagakis and Kotropoulos (2012) , high classi fi cation accuracy was achieved by using only frequency domain features. This fi nding proves that the performance of these features is almost identical to that of Mel-cepstrum domain features when convolved signals are elimi-nated. Buchholz et al. (2009) eliminated the convolution produced by speech signals by fi ltering Fourier coef fi cients above the near-silent threshold. Panagakis and Kotropoulos (2012 ) applied unsu-pervised and supervised feature selection to minimize the inter-ference caused by signal variations attributed to speech signals. Mel-cepstrum features commonly perform best amongst existing methods. Because convolved signals are represented by the summation in Mel-cepstrum domain, they produce inherent invariance toward linear spectral distortions. MFCC features has been proven as the most effective features in cell phone identi tion ( Hanil X i et al., 2012 ), however, Panagakis and Kotropoulos (2012) proved their lack of robustness in speech recording. This is because MFCC features are very well known to model the context of an audio recording but in the case of a speech recording, these features are contextualized by the speech characteristics.
This paper proposes a new method to eliminate the effects of speech contents by extracting the entropy of MFCC features from near-silent segments. Aside from reducing the dimensionality of MFCCs, we take advantage of the fact that entropy maximally concentrates the energy of MFCCs in silent frames because of its ability to measure the amount of choice or uncertainty ( Nilsson, 2006 ). This approach accounts for the uncertainty over the data induced by the device frequency response. Hence, entropy cap-tures mobile device speci fi c features from Mel-cepstrum spectrum of the signal fl ow from source to recipient. The recipient is the stationary device that uses the wireless coverage to communicate through VoIP call to the different mobile devices and record the call. Thus, the recorded transmitting signal contains the intrinsic artifacts of the mobile devices. With this motivation, we propose a technique for source mobile device identi fi cation by using VoIP communication based on an entropy  X  MFCC feature set. This technique is extendable to real-time call recording scenarios by using speech removal algorithm prior to feature extraction. 3. Source mobile device identi fi cation scheme
The proposed scheme includes four sections. Section 3.1 dis-cusses the data preparation step through precise preprocessing algorithms. Preprocessing increases the quality and quantity of the data instances to achieve high performance ( Bhatt and Kankanhalli, 2011 ). Section 3.2 describes the feature extraction process including the computation steps of MFCC features and the entropy of MFCC features. Sections3.3 and 3.4 detail supervised and unsupervised learning methods that were implemented for classi fi cation and clustering, respectively. The complete steps of the proposed source mobile device identi fi cation scheme are shown in Fig. 1 . 3.1. Data preparation
The audio fi les were recorded in two-channel stereo. To capture the nature of audio signals from both channels, we used channel's sum. The data preparation algorithm enhances the audio signals through minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based noise power estimation approach, as proposed in Gerkmann and Hendriks (2012) . Spectral enhancement aims to remove the non-stationary noise corruptions produced by the environment. This method was originally proposed for speech enhancement to reduce the additive noise without reducing speech ineligibility. The method uses speech presence probability (SPP) approach with fi xed non-adoptive a priori SNR. This value is selected based on the SNR that is typical in speech presence. The key advantage of this enhancement technique is its low overestimation of the spectral noise power and an even lower computational complexity. Fig. 2 compares the power spectrum envelopes of the near-silent signals prior and after enhancement. The signals are recorded calls between the stationary device and two different units of Samsung Galaxy Note. The signal-to-noise (SNR) levels of the recordings prior to enhancement are 0.84 and 16.33 dB, respectively. Thus, the signals become more distinct when noise is eliminated. Afterwards, we split the enhanced signals into 40 over-lapping short audio frames of length 2500 samples. The short audio frames are the data instances for feature extraction. The experimental results in Section 5 will provide justi fi cation on the choices made during data preparation. 3.2. Feature extraction such as fi lter, sampler, A/D converter, encoder, and channel encoder, produce the overall transfer function of the device. The signal variations due to this transfer function leave their intrinsic artifacts on the audio delivered through VoIP network to a stationary device that records the received signal. 3.2.1. Motivation extraction. However, to prove our motivation for this suggestion, let's assume that the audio delivered to the recording stationary contains speech. The spectrum of the speech signal x ( t ) represents the original input signal in the time domain, where t stands for time,  X  is the time period and h ( t ) denotes the device frequency response, thus the received signal from both sides of the call y ( t )is given by y  X  t  X  X  X  x n h  X  X  t  X  X   X  convolutional distortion that allows for determining the intrinsic artifacts for identifying the devices. The Fourier transform of x ( t ) and h ( t ) in terms of the angular frequency  X  is de fi ned as x ( h (  X  ) where the convolution of two functions in (1) is the product of their individual Fourier transforms and is represented as Y  X   X   X  X  F f X  x n h  X  X  t  X g X  X  X   X   X  H  X   X   X  :  X  2  X 
This indicates that each device leaves its intrinsic fi ngerprints on the overall recorded speech by modifying the spectrum of its corresponding speech signal. Hence, the method transfers the signal to cepstrum domain to eliminate the non-linearity in (2) by computing the logarithm of its Fourier transform. This can be as written as log  X  X  X   X   X  H  X   X   X  X  X  log  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  log  X  H  X   X   X  X  X  ^ where the cepstrum of x  X  t  X  and h  X  t  X  denoted as ^ x  X  t  X  and feasibility of MFCCs in speech/speaker identi fi cation as well as acquisition device identi fi cation is due to this transformation. features for cell phone identi fi cation, while the cell phones recorded the input speech as an ordinary tape recorder to eliminate comple x ity. Alternatively, our recording setup eliminates the in fl uences of the stationary device, speakers and speech content by transmitting silent sound from different mobile devices one at a time and recording the received signal with the same stationary device. However, in the absence of speech, the context of the signal is reduced as well as the values of MFCCs. Thus, we propose to use the entropy of the Mel-cepstrum output to intensify the energy of MFCCs. This is because the fl at distribution of silence induces high entropy values.
 identi fi cation accuracy rates by logarithmic transformation of features in additive form, whereas in our work, the results in
Table 5 of Section 5 shows that the identi fi cation accuracy rates for additive form compares well with the multiplicative form. It is evident that the absence of speech and the concentration on noise-like signals increase the robustness of the device identi tion approach. Furthermore, this work proves the feasibility of the entropy of MFCCs over normalized versions of MFCCs based on the Power Spectrum (dB) experiment results given in Table 4 of Section 5 . The feature extraction algorithm includes three stages (a) computing the MFCCs, (b) the entropy of MFCCs, and (c) scaling the entropy MFCC features. 3.2.2. MFCCs
MFCCs are one of the most attractive features of cepstrum domain and convey signi fi cant information about the structure of a signal. Thus, these features are widely used for speaker and speech recognition ( Beigi, 2011a ). The MFCCs are determined by computing the inverse discrete cosine transform of the short-time Mel frequency log spectrum of the signal, as given by c where l c n is the n th MFCC coef fi cient for the l th frame, M is the total number of triangular fi lters for m  X f 1 ; ... ; M g in the fi lter bank, l C m is the log spectrum output for the l th frame of the signal and the m th fi lter coef fi cients. In addition, the coef fi cients a m are determined as a  X 
The log energy (average log energy of audio frames), and the fi rst and second derivative of MFCC coef fi cients could also be included in MFCC feature vector. However, preliminary results show less contribution of the log energy, as well as the fi second order cepstral coef fi cients in achieving the identi accuracy rates. We can consider these features in the future for larger number of training and testing data sets that are collected in real-time basis. Thus, in this work, we used 12 MFCCs, where the Mel-cepstrum output consists of one frame per row and each frame includes 12 coef fi cients. 3.2.3. Entropy
Entropy intensi fi es the energy of MFCC outputs. Fig. 3 illus-trates the MFCC output l c n and its entropy, where N is the total number of frames. The feature extraction approach computes the entropy of MFCC vectors in two stages; fi rst it computes the probability mass function (PMF) of the MFCC coef fi cients and then, it computes the entropy H by using H  X   X  N where l p n is the PMF of the n th MFCC coef fi cient in frame l ( Beigi, 2011c ). 3.2.4. Scaling The last and important step after feature extraction is scaling. This step is important for increasing computational time and the classi fi er performance. In this work, we have scaled all data instances in the range [0, 1].

After extracting the features, we can visualize the ability of features to differentiate between mobile device classes through histogram. The histogram in Fig. 4 visualizes the differences between mobile devices of different models by using the 12 entropy  X  MFCC features that were extracted from 1000 data instances from each mobile device. For further investigation, we selected four different pairs of mobile devices and examined the average squared Euclidean distance between their entropy and MFCC feature vectors in Fig. 5 . The result of this measurement indicates the considerable distances between feature vectors corresponding to pairs of mobile devices of exact model, therefore justifying the effectiveness of entropy  X  MFCC features in differen-tiating individual mobile devices. 3.3. Supervised learning methods
Classi fi cation is known as a supervised learning method ( Bhatt and Kankanhalli, 2011 ). Multiclass classi fi cation problems can be implemented through different classi fi cation techniques. However, to determine which approach is the most ef fi cient for a particular problem, systematic methods are required to evaluate how differ-ent methods work and to compare these methods with one another. We selected fi ve different classi fi ers based on their appearances and high performance in related works compared in Table 1 . Because LIBSVM ( Chang and Lin, 2011 ) can perform well whenever applied to pattern recognition approaches, the LIBSVM wrapper is used to evaluate the features by using a multi-class SVM classi fi er with a radial basis function ( RBF ) kernel. We employed other classi fi ers including Na X ve Bayesin, linear logistic regression, Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron), and Rotation Forest as implemented in data mining tool WEKA ( Hall et al., 2009 ).

In our experiments, the total training and testing data sets for all classi fi ers were selected by using 10-fold cross-validation. The dataset was divided into 10 parts, where each experiment uses one-tenth of the data for testing and the remaining nine-tenth of the data for training. Both training and testing data consist of an equal number of data instances from each class. 3.4. Unsupervised learning methods
Unsupervised learning method is the general term for cluster-ing algorithms. In this case, no class exists for the prediction, and the data instances are divided into groups based on the relation-ships between features, such as distance-based similarity mea-sures, as well as hierarchical and incremental relationships ( Xu and Wunsch, 2005 ). We selected density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) ( Hao et al., 2011 ) and expectation-maximization (EM)-based clustering ( Abbas, 2008 ) algorithms because they evaluate performance with reliable para-meters that enable comparison. 4. Methodology
Audio signals were sampled, quantized, encoded, compressed, and then encapsulated into VoIP packets in a transmission channel. The VoIP packets were transferred to the destination gateway by using peer-to-peer signaling protocols (H.323, SIP), and voice information was recovered through the packets. Fig. 6 illustrates that the DSP performs the fi rst four processes in the transmitting gateway; each step is detailed in Wallace (2011) .In this setup, the stationary device records its VoIP calls to mobile devices, while the recording environment is silent and no conversation is made between two parties. The stationary device records signals in MP3 format by using Skype Recorder v.3.1 ( MP3
Skype Recorder v.3.1 ). This setup was used for collecting 25 recording fi les with respect to each mobile device. The mobile devices were of different brands and models, as listed in Table 2 .
Fig. 1 shows the data preparation approach splits each recording into 40 instances with a length of 0.35  X  0.42 s, which results in 1000 instances for each mobile device.

The experiments evaluate the feasibility of the source mobile device identi fi cation method through classi fi cation accuracy, robust-ness, and computational ef fi ciency. This process justi fi made to handle data sets, features, training and testing instances, classi fi cation, and evaluation technique. The fi rst experiment focused on the data preparation approach. The second experiment employed the most common combinations of statistical moments of MFCCs, such as mean, standard deviation, v ariance, skewne ss, and kurtosis ( Beigi, 2011b ). By modifying the feature extraction algorithm in Fig. 1 .  X 
Mean-MFCC,  X  X  Stdev-MFCC,  X  X  Var-MFCC,  X  X  Skew-MFCC,  X  and MFCC  X  were employed. These feature sets are popular among works on musical instrument classi fi cation ( Senan et al., 2011 ), as well as speaker veri fi cation ( Kinnunen et al., 2012 ), ( Alam et al., 2011 )and identi fi cation ( Molla and Hirose, 2004 ), and were thus adopted for comparison with entropy  X  MFCC features. The remaining experi-ments determined the classi fi cation performance for individual mobile device models and brands, respectively.

In all experiments, the performance was evaluated at the data instances basis by using classi fi cation and clustering methods. The classi fi cation was evaluated based on the following metrics and parameters, as detailed in Witten et al. (2011) : (1) Identi fi cation accuracy ( ACC )  X  Correct classi fi (2) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) : determines the cost of (3) Root mean squared error ( RMSE ): computes the square root to (4) Mean absolute error ( MAE ): treats all sizes of error evenly (5) Root relative squared error ( RRSE ): computes the total squared (6) Relative absolute error ( RAE ): considers the total absolute error, Selected metrics and parameters appear in abbreviated form in Tables 3  X  5 and 7 . Alternatively, the performance was measured by using clustering algorithms. However, obtaining the following metrics and parameters is sometimes dif fi cult, as detailed in Witten et al. (2011) . 1) Incorrectly clustered instances : number of instances assigned incorrectly to the clusters 2) Unclustered instances : number of instances that are not assigned to any cluster 3) Log likelihood ( LL ): measures the goodness of fi t; a larger value indicates that model fi ts the data better. 4) Minimum description length ( MDL ) metric : determines the MDL score for k parameters and N instances as detailed in Hao et al. (2011) , MDL Score  X  LL  X  k = 2 log N :  X  11  X 
For n independent features, there are 2 n parameters correspond-ing to their mean and standard deviation. The MDL score is smaller for strong clustering techniques. Nevertheless, this value increases abbreviated form. 5.1. Experiment on data preparation approaches enhancement technique as described in Section 3.1 against data instances prepared from the original audio signals to justify the choices made against its alternatives. All 21 mobile devices were employed with 1000 data instances from each to evaluate the performance of the fi ve classi fi cation algorithms through 10-fold cross-validation; the results are listed in
Table 3 . The clean data instances obtained the best perfor-mance with 99.91% identi fi cation accuracy and root relative squared error of 4.37% by using the na X ve Bayesian classi
The result shows that the envir onmental noise distortions in the original data instances slightly reduce classi fi cation accu-racy to 99.80% with respect to the clean data instances.
Although the effect of de-noising on classi fi cation accuracy is minimal, it increases the computational time particularly for the linear logistic regression model. This fi nding also suggests the robustness of the entropy  X  MFCC features against environ-mental noise distortions. 5.2. Experiment on entropy  X  MFCC features of entropy and MFCCs in identi fi cation performance as dis-cussed in Section 3.2 . To justify our choices on entropy, we compared the performance of entropy  X  MFCC features for source mobile device identi fi cation with other statistical moments of MFCCs, as adopted in Senan et al. (2011) ,
Kinnunen et al. (2012) and Molla and Hirose (2004) .Asa result, fi ve feature sets of  X  Mean-MFCC  X  ,  X  Stdev-MFCC,
MFCC,  X  X  Skew-MFCC,  X  and  X  Kurt-MFCC  X  were computed. The various moments of MFCCs were concatenated to a single feature vector. This feature vec tor contains 60 features that were reduced to 48 by using best-fi rst search method. The best-fi rst method traverses the feature space to fi nd the best subset by evaluating each one through the SVM classi fi er. This search method uses Greedy hill climbing with backtracking algorithms ( Goldberg, 1989 ). The experiment evaluates the performance of all feature sets by using fi ve classi fi cation and two clustering algorithms via 10-fold cross-validation. In the second part of the experiment, we eliminated the logarithmic transformation of MFCCs from (5) to compute the DCT of MFBE (discrete cosine transform of Mel-fi lter bank energies). The identi fi cation performance based on DCT of MFBE was obtained and compared against entropy  X  MFCCs. This comparison was to study the effect of frequency domain features with multi-plicative components on identi fi cation performance. 5.2.1. Performance comparison in classifying mobile devices based on entropy  X  MFCCs and statistical moments of MFCCs
Table 4 reveals the classi fi cation results for different statistical moments of MFCCs, the combined feature set and its best-fi selected features. The highest accuracy rate was always determined when the feature set was used in rotation forest classi fi classi fi er achieved an accuracy of 95.10% for  X  Mean-MFCC set. Meanwhile, for most classi fi ers, the highest accuracy rate was obtained with combined feature set. However, feature selection produces small improvement in classi fi cation accuracy. This result was compared against the performance of the entropy  X  MFCC features as appeared in Table 5 .Theentropy  X  MFCC feature set always outper-forms statistical moments of MFCCs with higher accuracy rates. This outcome agrees with the comparison of ROC curves that were obtained from these feature sets. Fig. 7 compares the overall ROC curves of the Rotation Forest classi fi er among all feature sets and label class. The ROC area for the entropy  X  MFCC features was close to one, but the value was smaller for other feature sets. This fi that for entropy  X  MFCCfeatures,thefalsepositiverateisclosetozero, and the true positive rate is close to one. Moreover, the ROC area for the  X  AllSet  X  features that were produced with the combined statistical moments of MFCCs was signi fi cantly smaller than the entropy Overall, because in near-silent segments, fewer contents exist to be modeled by MFCCs, their value was not large enough to represent the strong discrimination among mobile devices. Meanwhile, entropy intensi fi es the value of MFCCs in near-silent segments and increases the classi fi cation accuracy. Fig. 8 illustrates the classi for Entropy  X  MFCC feature set, where vulnerability is the performance reduction due to replacing  X  Entropy  X  MFCC  X  with  X  Stdev-MFCC can be seen, the Rotation Forest and SVM classi fi er exhibited the lowest increase in error rates. This observation suggests the robustness of both classi fi ers against loss of accuracy rates. Na X ve Bayesian est computation time but with the lo west robustness. Rotation Forest achieved the second-best identi fi cation accuracy and the best robust-ness, but the computation time was c onsiderably slower. Moreover, the performance of the SVM classi fi er was comparable with the Rotation Forest classi fi er. 5.2.2. Performance comparison in classifying mobile devices based on entropy  X  MFCCs and entropy  X  [DCT of MFBE]
Table 5 shows the performance of the entropy  X  MFCC feature set against entropy  X  [DCT of MFBE]. The result shows both feature sets performed comparably. This is because entropy intensi the energy of the silent segments and moreover, by extracting the features from near-silent segments, convolution due to speech segments is eliminated. The result proves the contribution of entropy in the improvement of the performances of both MFCCs and DCT of MFBE features that was proposed in Hanil X i et al. (2012) for cell-phone identi fi cation. In this work, Hanil X i et al. determined that DCT of MFBE features reduces the accuracy rates for identi fi cation. 5.2.3. Performance in clustering mobile devices based on entropy  X  MFCCs
This experiment re-evaluates the performance of all feature sets with probabilistic-based (EM) and nearest-neighbor-based (DBSCAN) algorithms. However, only the entropy  X  MFCC feature set can diverge to assessable results. Table 6 summarizes the results by using DBSCAN clustering based on the entropy  X  feature set with a minimum neighbor distance of  X   X  0 : 4 and minimum cluster size of 200. This algorithm identi fi ed 21 clusters with respect to the total mobile devices with only one incorrectly clustered instance. However, 880 instances out of 21,000 instances were unclustered. The EM algorithm inserts the number of clusters beforehand and then determines incorrectly clustered instances, LL, and MDL metrics. Thus, 4841 instances out of 21,000 instances were incorrectly clustered. Smaller MDL indicates strong cluster-ing techniques. DBSCAN assigned more instances to its correct cluster, which makes it the better choice. 5.3. Intra-mobile device identi fi cation by using SVM
Source mobile device identi fi cation in previous experiments performed well with the SVM classi fi er in terms of identi accuracy, robustness, and computational ef fi ciency. This experiment analyzes the identi fi cation accuracy of individual mobile devices based on the entropy  X  MFCC feature set and SVM classi fi confusion matrix in Table 7 shows the correct and incorrect classi fi ed instances in diagonal and non-diagonal cells, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method can distinguish among mobile devices of the same model, such as Galaxy Note 10.1 (A,B), Galaxy Note II (A  X  C), and iPhone 5 (A,B). Minimal misclassi fi occurred among mobile devices of different models and brands, which may be a result of signal loss during Skype communication.
Overall, the performance was satisfactory for ideal environments, which indicates a promising result when employing entropy features in real-world scenarios. 5.4. Inter-mobile devices identi fi cation brand in one class. Five classi fi cation algorithms were used among six classes with 10-fold cross-validation for the evaluation of the entropy  X  MFCC features. Table 8 shows that the Rotation Forest classi fi er performed better than all the other classi fi mobile device identi fi cation. Furthermore, for most classi overall performance slightly improved with respect to the classi-fi cation results based on models. However, in terms of Na X ve
Bayesian classi fi er, the classi fi cation accuracy was reduced from 99.99 to 99.69% and the error rates were increased. Meanwhile, SVM classi fi er achieved comparably close accuracy rates with
Rotation Forest, but its computation time was faster. Thus, the experiment revisits the performance of the SVM classi fi er for each particular brand. Table 9 shows the confusion matrix that resulted from 10-fold cross validation by using a six-class SVM classi
The last row of the confusion matrix is the number of predicted instances and the last column is the total number of instances with respect to each class. The larger misclassi fi cations exist among Samsung and Apple with 9000 and 7000 data instances in each class respectively. An average identi fi cation accuracy of 99.75% was achieved for inter-mobile device identi fi cation, which is approximately similar to the results for intra-mobile device identi fi cation by using the same classi fi er. 6. Discussion
Prior work has focused on source recording device identi fi tion from both speech and non-speech recording. Hanil X i et al. (2012) , for example, used cell phone devices as an ordinary tape recorder to collect speech recordings. Although these studies proved that the MFCCs extracted from the speech recording is the most effective feature set to capture device speci fi the results lack evaluation on the robustness of MFCCs. This is because MFCC features are contextualized by the speech contents, speaker's characteristics and environment. In this study, we improved the robustness of MFCCs by computing the entropy of MFCCs from near-silent segments for the prototype of source mobile device identi fi cation.

We found that by using all selected classi fi ers, entropy feature set exhibits high performance against statistical moments of MFCCs. Meanwhile, by using near-silent segments, even the combi-nation of entropy with frequency domain features performed well for source mobile device identi fi cation. These fi ndings proved the signi fi cance of eliminating convolution due to speech signals. Furthermore, in terms of classi fi ers, Rotation Forest and SVM classi fi er achieved the best performan ce with respect to the classi-fi cation accuracy, robustness and computational ef fi ciency. Some aspects of the proposed method compares well with existing research on acquisition device identi fi cation ( Kraetzer et al., 2007, 2011, 2012; Buchholz et al., 2009; Garcia-Romero and Epsy-Wilson, 2010; Hanil X i et al., 2012; Panagakis and Kotropoulos, 2012 ). How-ever, our method adds an advantage to the previous approaches in the following ways: (a) entropy  X  MFCC features are extracted from near-silentframes,(b)entropyofMel-cepstrumoutputintensi fi the energy of MFCCs for near-silent frames, and (c) blind identi tion of mobile devices over the call. This study therefore indicates that entropy  X  MFCC features identify the distinguishing pattern in mobile devices of even the same model.

Most notably, this study is the fi rst to identify traces of the source transmitting devices by detecting the near-silent segments in a recorded conversation. We found evidence to suggest that our prototype can identify different source brand/model and indivi-dual mobile devices in a more practical experimental setup by using communication through any type of service provider, such as cellular, VoIP, PSTN, and their combinations and subsets. However, some limitations are worth noting. Although we found promising results based on silent recording, the proposed method was not reassessed based on speech recording. Future work includes a follow-up work designed to evaluate the accuracy when speech is recorded by the mobile device without transmission and when the experimental setup in Fig. 6 is implemented. This way it would be possible to determine the effects of speech contents and speaker characteristics on identi fi cation accuracy. In addition we can perform quantitative comparison with current state-of-the-art approaches.
