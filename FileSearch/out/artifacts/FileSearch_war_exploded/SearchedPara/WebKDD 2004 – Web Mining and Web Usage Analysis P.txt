 Computer Engineering and Computer Science department Speed School of Engineering In this report, we summarize the contents and outcomes of the recent WebKDD 2004 workshop that was held in conjunction with the 10th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Di scovery and Data Mining (KDD 2004), August 22-25, 2004, in Seattle, Washington. We also reflect on the trend in participation levels in the WebKDD series of workshops over the last six years, and indicate new directions in We b mining research as reflected in the latest workshop. Web mining, profiling, personalization, click-stream analysis recommender systems. The birth of the World Wide Web in the nineties and the dot.com bubble that followed have contributed to an initial proliferation of research and in terest in Web mining. Despite the  X  X ot.com crash, X  interest in Web mining both in the research community as well as in industry has persisted and flourished. In particular, in the last few years we have witnessed an increasing level of participation in the WebKDD workshops [12-16] (see Table 1). Figure 1 shows the number of submissions, a r easonable gauge for the active interest in Web mining, which is displayed for each year since the beginning of WebKDD in 1999. The submission trend closely follows the boom in this area that followed the .com bubble from 1999 to 2000, while reflecting the burst in this bubble soon after this period, sinking to its lowest level in 2001. Subsequent years witnessed a reversal in this sharp decrease, hinting at a recoveri ng interest in Web mining. The Web is a live environment that gestates and drives a wide spectrum of applic ations in which a user intera cts with a compan y, a governmental au thority , a non-g overnmental organization or other non-prof it institution or other users. Us er preferen ces and expe cta tions , toge ther with us age patterns, form the basis for per sonalized, us er-f riendly and business-optim al services. Ke y W eb busine ss metrics enabled b y prop er data captur e and processing are essential to run an effective business or se rvice. Enab ling technolog ies includ e data mining, scalab le wareho using and preprocessing, sequence d isco very, real time processing, document classification, user modeling and quality evalu ation m odels for them . Recipi ent t echn ologies that demand for us er profiling and usage p atter ns includ e recom mendation s ystem s, W eb anal yti cs applic ations , application ser vers coupled with conten t management systems and f raud detectors . Furthermore, the inherent and increasing heterogeneity of th e Web has req uired Web-bas ed applications to more effec tive ly int egrate a vari ety of types of data acr oss m ultiple channels and fr om different sources . The d evelopm ent and application of Web mining tec hniques in the context of Web conten t, Web usage, and Web structure data has alread y resulted in dra matic im prove ments in a var iety of Web appli cat ions , fro m search engi nes, Web agents, and content management s ystems, to Web analy tics and per sonalization services . A focu s on techniques and archi tectur es for m ore effective integr ation and mini ng of conten t, usage, and next gener ation of more use ful and more intelligen t applications. WebKDD 2004 is the six th of a successful series of workshops on knowledge discover y on th e Web. The WebKDD' 04 workshop continu ed its tradition of serving as a bridge betwe en acad em ia and in dus try by bringi ng together pract ition ers and researchers fr om both areas in order to foster the exch ange of ideas and the dissemination of em erging soluti ons for intell igent Web-based applications using Web usag e, stru ctur e and conten t mining 28 papers were submitted to WebKDD 2004 and were WebKDD 2004 program committee. Due to the keen com petition , onl y 10 p apers wer e accep ted for the workshop. Two of the accepted p apers, with primar y topics relating more directl y to the S emantic W eb, were s elect ed to be presented in a j oint session with a new workshop, the KDD Workshop on Mining for an d from the Semantic Web (MSW 04). The joint session also includ es a n addition al paper subm itted and accep ted at the MSW 04, for a total of three pap ers in this session, whi ch brings togeth er topics of inter est common to both th e WebKDD 2004 and MSW04 workshops. The workshop papers ar e available at http://may a.cs.d epaul.edu/w ebkd d04/ . According to the topi cs, the p apers were group ed into four categories th at would form the structure of th e workshop sessions . Thes e cat egories ar e (i) Web Us age Anal ysis and User Modeling, (ii) Web Personalization and Recommender Syste ms, (iii) S earch Engine P ersonaliz ation, and (iv) Semantic Web Mining. We would like t o thank the au thors of all subm itted papers . Their creativ e efforts have supported the competitive techn ical program of WebKDD 2004. We would also like to express our gratitud e to the m embers of the program commi ttee for t heir vi gilant a nd time ly re views. The workshop attracted an aud ience consisting of between 30 and 55 particip ants. In additio n to several people from acad em ia, the workshop attrac ted sever al p articipan ts from the industr y including Microsof t, Amazon, AT&amp;T, Google, SAS, DaimlerChr ysler , Accen ture, bu y.com, sh opping.com, and a few oth er dot.com compan ies. Th e paper p resentations were s egm ented into four are as accord ing to their m ain topics, leading to the following sessions. The f irst thr ee papers deal with Web Usage Analysis and User Modeling . In Sequential Analysis for Learning Modes of Browsing [6] , Hooker and Finkelman present a mathem atic al fr am ework for direct ly learn ing a user X  X  m ode of browsing du ring a given se ssion. This framework is testing . Th ey d emonstrate its feasibil ity and u tili ty in the contex t of click-stream dat a an d explore the rang e of models and variations that this fra mework ma kes a vailable. In Mining Temporally Evolving Graphs [5 ], Desikan and Srivastava addre ss the lim ited  X  X  ata-centr ic X  po int of view of most previous Web Mining research b y ex amining anoth er dimension of Web Mining , nam ely th e temporal dimension. They high light the signif icance of stud ying th e evolv ing nature of W eb graphs , and cl assify th e app roach to such problems at three levels of an alysis: single nod e, sub-graphs and whole grap hs. They prov ide a framework to approach problem s in this kind of anal ysis and identif y interest ing problems at each level. In A Formal Model of the ETL Process for OLAP-Based Web Usage Analysis [8], Maier addresses the laborious and time-consuming task of populating a data warehouse, to be used for sophisticated analysis of the Web channel in a multi-channel environment of an organization. To this en d, is proposed a logical object-oriented relational data storage model, which simplifies modeling the ETL process and supports direct deployment within a WUSAN (Web USage ANalyis) system. Three papers focus on Web Personalization and Recommender Systems . In Using Distinctive Information Channels for a Mission-based Web Recommender System [7], Li and Zaiane advocate the use of additional information channels such as the content of visited pages and the connectivity between web pages, as an alternative to using only one information channel, namely the web access history. They propose the concept of  X  missions  X , which are identified by different channels, to help in better modeling users X  concurrent information needs. The combination of three channels is shown to improve the quality of the recommendations. In Complete this Puzzle: A Connectionist Approach to Accurate Web Recommendations based on a Committee of Predictors [10], Nasraoui and Pavuluri present a Context Ultra-Sensitive Approac h to personalization based on two-step Recommender systems (CUSA-2-step-Rec) . The approach relies on a committee of profile-specific neural networks. Similar to the task of completing the missing pieces of a puzzle, each neural network is trained to predict the missing URLs of several complete ground-truth sessions from a given profile. The approach outperforms nearest profile and K-Nearest Neighbors based collaborative filtering. In Collaborative Quality Filtering: Establishing Consensus or Recovering Ground Truth? [11], Traupman and Wilensky present an algor ithm based on factor analysis for performing collaborative quality filtering (CQF). Unlike previous approaches to CQF, which estimate the consensus opinion of a group of reviewers, their algorithm uses a generative model of the review process to estimate the latent intrinsic quality of the items under review. The results of their tests suggest that asympt otic consensus, which purports to model peer review, is in fact not recovering the ground truth quality of reviewed items. Two papers deal with Search Engine Personalization . In Spying Out Real User Preferences for Metasearch Engine Personalization [4], Deng, Chai, Tan, Ng, and Lee propose a learning technique called " Spy Naive Bayes " ( SpyNB ) to identify the user preference pairs generated from clickthrough data. They then employ a ranking SVM algorithm to build a metasearch engine optimizer. Their empirical results on a metas earch engine prototype, comprising MSNSearch, Wisenut and Overture, show that, compared with no learning, SpyNB can significantly improve the average ranks of users' clicks. In Personalizing PageRank Based on Domain Profiles [1], Aktas, Nacar, and Menczer introduce a methodology for personalizing PageRank vectors based on URL features such as Internet domains. Users specify interest profiles as binary feature vectors where a feature corresponds to a DNS tr ee node. Then, given a profile vector, a weighted PageRank can be computed, assigning a weight to each URL based on the match between the URL and the profile features. Preliminary results show that Personalized PageRank performed favorably compared to pure similarity based ranking and traditional PageRank. Finally, three papers form the core of the joint session on Semantic Web Mining . The first paper was submitted and accepted by the MSW04 workshop, while the last two papers were submitted and accepted by the WebKDD 2004 workshop. Bloehdorn and Hotho, in Boosting for Text Classification with Semantic Features [2], propose an enhancement of the classica l term stem based document representation through higher se mantic concepts extracted from background knowledge. Boosting, a successful machine learning technique is used for classification, and comparative experimental evaluations show consistent improvement of the results. Meo, Lanzi, Matera, and Esposito, in Integrating Web Conceptual Modeling and Web Usage Mining [9], present a case study regard ing the application of the inductive database approach to the analysis of Web logs and to enable the rapid customiza tion of the mining procedures following the Web developers X  need. They integrate the user request information with meta -data concerning the Web site structure into rich XML Web logs, called  X  conceptual logs  X , produced by Web applications specified with the WebML conceptual model. Then, they apply a data mining language (MINE RULE) to conceptual logs in order to identify different types of patterns, such as recurrent navigation paths, page contents most frequently visited, and anomalies. In Discovering Links between Lexi cal and Surface Features in Questions and Answers [3], Chakrabarti presents a data-driven approach, assisted by machine learning to build question answering information re trieval systems that return short passages or direct answers to questions, rather than URLs pointing to whole pages. Learning is based on a simple conditional exponential model over a pair of feature vectors, one derived from the question and the other derived from a candidate passage. Using this model, candidate passages are filtered, and substantial improvements are obtained in the mean rank at which the first answer is found. The model parameters distill and reveal linguistic artifacts coupling questions and their answers, which can be used for better annotation and indexing. The WebKDD X 04 workshop helped bring to light several interesting future directions and challenges in the area of Web mining. In particular, we note an increasing interest in exploring Web mining and Web da ta along three dimensions: temporal , breadth , and granularity . Some of the emerging directions include: -mining evolving usage patterns -mining usage patterns at higher level concepts such as -considering usage data at in creasing levels of detail or -developing formal models for warehouses that can -developing user-friendly systems based on previously -mining huge amounts of data or scalability -exploring innovative ways to model web usage by We are grateful to past WebK DD organizers, in particular Jaideep Srivastava, Osmar Zaiane, and Myra Spiliopoulou, for providing us with some of th e previous year statistics.
