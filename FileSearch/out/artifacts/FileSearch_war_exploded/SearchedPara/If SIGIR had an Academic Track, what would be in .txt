 It used to be the case that very little industry research was presented at SIGIR. Now the balance has radically changed  X  many accepted papers have industry authors and many rely demic member of the SIGIR community has light-heartedly proposed the creation of an Academic Track.

Behind the levity lies the important question of how a re-searcher can make a meaningful contribution to the field, in the absence of petabyte-scale sets of documents and massive user-interaction logs. Theoretical contributions can revolu-tionize thinking, but have greatest impact when applicable in practice, and when empirically validated.
 In my years at Funnelback and more recently at Microsoft I have been very aware of high-impact but not-well-solved IR problems involving relatively tiny datasets. Many of them are characterized by sparsity of user interaction data and are hence not well-suited to simple machine learning approaches or to large scale A/B testing. My talk will illustrate and at-tempt to characterize these problems and to suggest fruitful areas for academic research.

If time permits, I will mention some areas in which aca-demic research has contributed to current large-scale indus-try practice.

 David Hawking is an applied sci-entist in the Relevance &amp; Intent group of Microsoft. He is based in Canberra and works on Bing.

David has been an IR re-searcher since 1991 and, among other things, has worked on par-allel IR, distributed IR, term proximity models, efficiency, au-tomatic assessment of health webpage quality, evaluation, test collection development, web IR and enterprise search. In 1998 he left the Australian National University to continue his research at Australia X  X  largest research organization CSIRO. CSIRO X  X  industrial focus led to the commercialisation of the team X  X  research and eventually to the spinning off of the Funnelback internet and enterprise search company in late 2005. David joined the spinoff as Chief Scientist in 2008 and worked in that role until joining Microsoft in 2013. David continues as an adjunct professor at the Australian National University and has graduated nine PhDs. He has authored around a hundred publications in the IR area (see david-hawking.net/publications.shtml ) and twice served as program chair for SIGIR. He chaired the Industry Track at SIGIR 2014 and was Web Track coordinator at the in-ternational Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) from 1997-2004. In this role he was responsible for the creation and distribution of widely used text retrieval test collections. He holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Neuch X a-tel (Switzerland), the 2005 Chris Wallace award (Australa-sia) for computer science research and the 2012 Tony Kent Strix award (jointly with Doug Cutting).
