 1. Introduction
Information retrieval is a complex activity involving interactions between users and the systems that provide the infor-mation. However, users have many factors which may influence their effective use of the information retrieval (IR) systems; for example, users experienced with information retrieval may make better and more effective use of an IR system as com-pared to less experienced users. Users of IR systems also employ a variety of cognitive processes when they retrieve, includ-ing learning, comprehension and speed in spotting information. All these factors contribute to user X  X  effectiveness of the ness despite searching the same system and the same tasks.
 There have been a few attempts to investigate the correlation between user effectiveness and system effectiveness (e.g. Kantor, 2008 ); however these studies did not establish any direct correlation, finding only that improvements in IR system effectiveness (as quantified by IR effectiveness measures) do not always translate into a direct benefit for end users (as mea-sured by the number of relevant documents obtained and the time taken to save the first relevant document). However, it must be noted that the assessment procedures used in these studies did not take into consideration variation in personality and cognitive characteristics among users; instead, these studies used analytical techniques which assumed that all users exhibited the same or similar characteristics. However, Marchionini (1995, p. 75) refuted such an assumption, asserting that systems be designed and evaluated based on a clear knowledge of the targeted user group X  X  characteristics and their search tendencies. Therefore, any comprehensive user evaluation protocol requires not only examining how users interact with retrieval systems in the context of a specific search task, but also a holistic view of the elements which compose the users X   X  entire information-seeking experience. This is also described more recently in Ingwersen and J X rvelin (2005) . It is not suf-ficient, therefore, to merely seek to establish a correlation between user effectiveness and system effectiveness; it is also important to analyze the user as a complex individual entity with a unique repertoire of cognitive skills and motivations which directly affect the execution and outcome of any search task.
 tor of information-seeking success in information systems ( Downing, Moore, &amp; Brown, 2005 ). The importance of examining the entire information-seeking experience of the user (e.g. knowledge, capabilities, expertise, search experience and search-ing behaviour) when evaluating an IR system was recommended by several researchers (e.g. Harman, 1992; Kim &amp; Allen, 2002; Salton, 1992 ).
 information environments that relied heavily on navigation (e.g., hierarchical databases, the World Wide Web, FirstSearch, etc.). For example, Allen (1992) required users to search for references for a term paper using a standard CD-ROM based in-dex. Palmquist and Kim (2000) required users to carry out factual 2 and topical 3 search tasks on a University Web site. Kim and Allen (2002) assigned participants two search tasks of different types: a known-item 4 search and a subject search 5 task.
Juvina (2004) used web navigation tasks. Downing et al. X  X  (2005) study required each participant to search for information related to five tasks using FirstSearch software. These tasks included one neutral search, two business oriented tasks, and two biology oriented tasks. The main focus of a number of studies was investigating effects of task on information search behaviour. Therefore, this paper is designed to investigate the effect of user characteristics on effectiveness while searching for the less examined recall-oriented task  X  X o identify as many relevant documents X  for a given set of topics. Furthermore, the Web search.

Section 4 presents the results on the effect of user character-istics on user effectiveness and Section 5 presents a discussion and the conclusion of this work. 2. Definition of user characteristics and related research ( Egan, 1988; Nielsen, 1993 ). Some of these factors were closely related to user characteristics/traits such as motivation, and experience in various aspects such as computing, librarianship, and skills in searching for information. Marchionini (1995) explained that every individual has a unique set of IR skills; he described these skills, experiences and resources as a  X  X ersonal information infrastructure X  (p. 11). The infrastructure concept consists of three components: domain, system, nitive skills. 2.1. Experience Wippern (1990) found that end users (doctoral students) retrieved fewer items than experts (skilled librarians). Lancaster,
Cheryl, Mary, Laura, and Yuen-Man (1994) compared the results of searches completed by librarians with those done by end users; they found that librarian searches tended to be higher quality (i.e., fewer errors and higher recall). Haynes, Walker,
McKibbon, Johnston, and Willan (1994) compared the search results of clinicians and experienced librarians and concluded that clinicians achieved fewer precise results. The librarians tended to conduct focused successful searches. Saito and Miwa (2001) found that experience affected information seeking behaviour on the Web; significant differences between expert and novice users were found in relation to time spent on task completion.
 students performed three tasks, each designed to observe their performance in locating Web sites and finding information browsing skills. Students with higher levels of Web experience displayed superior searching, requiring less time, producing more correct responses, and engaging in fewer actions. 2.2. Users X  cognitive skills
In addition to search experience discussed above, cognitive factors may potentially influence the effectiveness of the logical reasoning, verbal comprehension, and spatial scanning) on their searching effectiveness. Allen (1992) found that cog-nitive speed and cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning and verbal comprehension influenced information seeking in a CD-ROM bibliographic search task. He concluded that users who scored higher on standard tests of perceptual speed per-formed higher quality searches than those who score lower on these tests. Palmquist and Kim (2000) studied the effects performance of novice searchers, the influence was greatly reduced for those searchers who had substantial experience searching on-line databases. Novice searchers with low cognition tended to spend more time and visited more links for retrieving relevant information than those with higher cognition. Papaeconomou, Zijlema, and Ingwersen (2008) followed up the Palmquist and Kim research with a small study on search and learning style.

Participants with online search experience, yet low cognition, tended to visit a lower number of links for retrieving rel-evant information than those with no online search experience. Downing et al. (2005) also examined the effect of spatial scanning in a hierarchical database system. They concluded that individuals with low spatial scanning took longer to find the first relevant article and obtained fewer relevant articles than those with high spatial scanning. Kim and Allen (2002) also found that in web search engines, cognitive abilities (analytic cognitive styles) influenced the number of tasks com-pleted, the number of sites visited, the number query terms issued and the number of bookmarks made. 3. Experiment methodology
Our study was designed to investigate the effect of user characteristics (e.g. search experience and cognitive skills) on their effectiveness. A large heterogeneous group of users with different characteristics were recruited and were asked to search for a given set of topics; then their effectiveness was compared against their characteristics.

The TREC 7 test collections were used as a vehicle for providing a better understanding of retrieval evaluation since 1992 ness while searching TREC test collections. This is an important omission as a number of studies were conducted on TREC data examining the correlation between test collection based effectiveness scores and user performance (e.g. Hersh et al., 2000 ; Turpin and Hersh, 2001 ; Allan et al., 2005 ; Turpin and Scholer, 2006 ), but none of these studies examined the impact of user characteristics in these correlations. To test this effect, an interactive experiment was conducted by recruiting 56 users searching for 56 TREC topics; the topics are listed in the Appendix.

Users completed searching for 56 topics by utilizing an experimental test bed (Query Performance Analyzer). 8 This system allowed access, through a single consistent interface, to three well known experimental retrieval systems (InQuery, Lemur and Terrier). The 56 topics were randomly selected from TREC topics. For more details description of the system, see Al-Maskari, Sanderson, and Clough (2008) . 3.1. Participants
Fifty-six participants were recruited for this experiment and were required to save as many relevant documents as pos-sible for a set of 56 TREC topics. (Note, have the same number of topics as users was a coincidence.) Every user completed searches for eight topics and every eight users completed searches on the same set of topics. Users were given 7 min for each topic, and topics were randomly distributed amongst users (to reduce the effects of topic order on results). Upon completing needs to be satisfied. They were free to issue multiple queries for each topic within the 7 min. The narrative field served as guidance on assessing document relevance using a ternary relevance scheme: highly relevant, 9 partially relevant 10 or not relevant. Prior to commencing the experiment series, every user underwent a training session consisting of two training tasks to ensure familiarity with the system and experimental protocols.

The participants were required to fill out self-evaluation questionnaires including demographic data (such as gender, age, academic majors, degrees earned and current academic program) and rated their general computer literacy and experience using search engines. Of the 56, 26 were male and 30 were female. All participants were, at the time of participation, stu-dents at the University of Sheffield in different faculty with 20 being undergraduates, 29 reading for MSc degrees and 7 PhD students. As shown in Table 1 the students came from various academic backgrounds. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of age.

 mean of 6.7 years of such online search experience, with one individual claiming 12 years of search engine usage; conversely, there was one recruit whose experience of interacting with online IR systems was limited to just 1 year. On average, 18% of the subjects had less than 5 years experience, 45% had between 5 and 7 years experience while 36% boasted between 8 and 10 years experience. Subjects were also asked to indicate the number of hours per day they spend conducting online searches, the statistics for which are displayed in Fig. 4 . Overall subjects had a mean of 3.7 h search per day; 63% of them claimed to spend 2 X 3 h daily using online search engines, with one individual averaging 14 h per day. 3.2. Assessing Users X  Perceptual Speed tual speed from the suite of evaluation exercises known as the Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests (FRCT), produced by the ceptual speed were (iii) the  X  X  X dentical Pictures X  X  Test, in which participants examined a sequence of five numbered geometrical figures or pic-imum overall time allowed to complete the tests was 5 min. The order of test presentation was randomized to minimize any possible learning effects. Written instructions and practice exercises were presented immediately before the participants completed each test.
 3.3. Variables tested in this experiment
As mentioned earlier, this study aimed at identifying the effect of user characteristics on user effectiveness. Therefore, user effectiveness in this experiment was measured by four variables: 4. Results 4.1. Effects of search experience on user effectiveness general computer literacy and experience using search engines. Table 2 presents a Pearson X  X  correlation analysis between search effectiveness and experience. Of the various attributes of search experience considered (e.g. years of searching, number of hours spent online using search engines, frequency of using computer, and frequency of searching online), the only attri-bute showing any correlation with user effectiveness was user X  X  search experience though the correlation was low. Table 3 provides statistical data concerning the search experiment of recruited users and their search effectiveness. tion was conducted to confirm whether users with more years of online search experience were consistently finding a higher number of relevant documents per search task than those with less experience. A split analysis was performed on the  X  X  X ears-more in TimeFRD than their more experienced counterparts. This was again confirmed by Mann X  X hitney test 13 of the same data which indicated a statistically significant difference in UserDocs scores between experienced users, 5.2 docs, and inex-averaging 1.84 min, did not significantly outperform their less experienced counterparts, who averaged 2.11 min (see Fig. 6 ,

 perceptual speed. Although Pearson X  X  correlation analysis does indicate a significant variation, this is not evident when
Mann X  X hitney test is applied for the UserDocs score: ( U  X  3412 ; N  X  28 ; N  X  28 ; p  X  0 : 408 ; two tailed). Perceptual speed seems to only influence the TimeFRD score ( U  X  216 ; N  X  28 ; N  X  28 ; p  X  0 : 004 ; two tailed  X  ; indicating that users with lower perceptual speed took longer to obtain the first relevant document than those with higher perceptual speed. Fig. 7 illustrates the user effectiveness in relation to ( TimeFRD ) their perceptual speed scores. 4.3. Users X  satisfaction with the search results
This section examines the relationship between user characteristics and user satisfaction, the effect of perceptual speed and online search experience on user satisfaction. The results in Fig. 8 showed that users with high perceptual speed were isted for experienced and inexperienced user satisfaction ( U  X  22618 ; N 1  X  280 ; N 2  X  168 ; p  X  0 : 477) in Fig. 9 . 4.4. Users X  familiarity with the search topics familiar, (iii) fairly new, and (iv) very new. This post-search questionnaire was also used in Kelly and Cool (2002) .A Spearman X  X  correlation between users X  perceptual speed and familiarity showed that there was no significant correlation between the two ( r = 0.038, p = 0.57). Similarly, there was no correlation between years of searching experience and familiarity ( r = 0.199, p = 0.14). 5. Discussions and conclusions  X  factors validation
The study reported in this paper revisited the effect of user searching experience on user effectiveness. In this paper it was demonstrated that users with more than 7 years of online searching experience obtained significantly more relevant docu-ments (5.2 relevant documents) than users with less experience (4.2 relevant documents). These results are consistent with previous research which demonstrated that domain expertise and searching experience enhanced user effectiveness ( Marchionini, 1995; McDonald &amp; Stevenson, 1998; Patel et al., 1998 ). However, in our study, experienced and non-experienced users took nearly the same amount of time to obtain the first relevant document; they only varied in the number of relevant documents obtained.

Furthermore, this study also demonstrated a significant correlation between users X  effectiveness and their perceptual speed: users who scored above the median of the perceptual speed tests took significantly less time to obtain the first rel-evant document (1.71 min) than users who scored below the median of these tests (2.19 min). Therefore, users with high cognitive skills can spot information with speed and accuracy. Using different search tasks and different IR system, the re-sults from this experiment are consist with the findings reported by previous research (e.g. Allen, 1992; Downing et al., 2005; total number of relevant documents obtained by users with different perceptual speed skills.

Furthermore, as stated in Section 3.2, users X  perceptual speed was assessed based on three tests: the  X  X  X inding A X  X  X  X ; the  X  X  X umber Comparison X  X  Test, and the  X  X  X dentical Pictures X  X  test. From this experiment, we found that the identical picture test impacted more on user effectiveness than the number comparison test whereas Allen (1992) found the opposite. Perhaps this disparity is due to the different tasks involved and different systems used in this study and in Allen X  X  study (CD-ROM index and searching for articles related to the  X  X rescription for reduction of aggression X ).

However, it is surprising to find that users with high and low perceptual speed rated themselves with the same level of satisfaction despite the fact that users with high perceptual speed obtained the first relevant document faster than users with low perceptual speed. Furthermore, experienced and inexperienced users rated themselves with the same level of sat-isfaction, although they varied significantly in the number of relevant documents obtained. The reason for the lack of differ-ence in user satisfaction between the two groups was most likely due to the subjective nature of user satisfaction and the differences in users X  opinion and perception of the search results. Furthermore, user satisfaction can be easily influenced by Al-Maskari and Sanderson (2010).

In conclusion, the findings from this study reinforced the fact that users of IR systems employ a variety of cognitive pro-cesses when retrieving information, including learning, comprehension and speed in spotting information. All these factors lation between user effectiveness and system effectiveness; it was also important to analyze the user as a complex individual entity with a unique repertoire of cognitive skills and motivations which directly affected the execution and outcome of any search task.

In light of the findings above, it was reasonable to argue that certain user characteristics can be used to predict search effectiveness or to explain differences in effectiveness between user groups. These results have implication in the evaluation of interactive IR systems. These results also have important practical implications concerning the design of IR systems which must take into consideration the influence of a user X  X  cognitive ability in determining search behaviour. Such investigations of cognitive abilities can provide fruitful input to the design process. These results may lead to the development of a variety of search system features to augment cognitive abilities. A system embedded with these features can contribute to the effective use of information retrieval systems by people with different levels of cognitive abilities and aptitudes.

This study obtained users X  familiarity with the search topics after completing the search tasks. Future research will ask users to rate their familiarity with the search topics before and after the search. This approach would allow us to measure how much knowledge the users gained upon reading the information retrieved by the IR system and therefore how much new additional information was provided to them.
