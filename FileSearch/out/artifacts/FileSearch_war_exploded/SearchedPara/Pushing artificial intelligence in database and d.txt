This special issue on  X  Pushing Arti fi cial Intelligence in Database and Data Warehouse Systems presents a rigorous selection of the best papers of the Invited Session
Chile, during September 28  X  30, 2009. Following the success of the Invited Session
LNAI KES 2008, the 2009 event has attracted a large number of submissions, and, after a rigorous review process, only 8 papers have been selected for fi nal publication. After the conference these papers have been invited for submission to the Data &amp;
Knowledge Engineering special issue on  X  Pushing Arti fi cial Intelligence in Database and Data Warehouse Systems review rounds, only 4 papers have been accepted for fi nal publication in this special issue.

The main idea that inspired this special issue relies in the evidence stating that actual Database and Data Warehouse Systems lack of methods and techniques for extending the capabilities and the expressive power of the data representation, management, cope with modern information system applications, ranging from Intelligent Tools for Database Management to Intelligent Tools for Data Warehousing, from Complex Data Mining Tools to OLAP Interfaces, from Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning
Tools to Collaborative Filtering Plug-In Components and Sensor-and-Stream Data Analysis Tools, and so forth. As a consequence, actual Database and Data Warehouse Systems are enforced to think of level host programming language, implement even-complex procedures devoted to effectively and ef and mine huge amounts of relational and multidimensional data populating their storage layers. Beyond a low re-usability for novel instances adhering to application scenarios similar to those of the target implementations, this phenomenon introduces severe limitations with respect to a wide spread of aspects, ranging from expressive power to computational complexity of the management, warehousing and mining phases, from re-use and extendibility of knowledge and pattern discovery methods to integration between actual Database and Data Warehouse Systems and traditional legacy systems, and so forth.
An attractive research direction to solve the above-described drawbacks of actual Database and Data Warehouse Systems consists in extending the applicative layers of these systems by means of methods and techniques borrowed from arti very often take the aspects of intelligent algorithms that directly extend the applicative layers of Database and Data Warehouse Systems and are implemented in native languages exposed by such systems in the vest of plug-in components.
Inspired by the need for extending actual Database and Data Warehouse Systems by means of arti techniques and tools, as demanded by modern information system applications, this special issue contains four papers that address both theoretical and practical challenges of this emerging scienti contribution that not only touches conceptual, theoretical and methodological aspects, but also proposes effective implementations and practical experimentations.

The fi rst paper, titled  X  System Models for Goal-Driven Self-Management in Autonomic Databases existing techniques strictly pay attention to make autonomous one particular administration task, and therefore cause problems like over-reaction and interference. To prevent these problems, the self-management logic requires knowledge about the system-a database system model , which serves as a knowledge base for database self-management solutions . Authors analyze which information is required in the system model to support the prediction of the overall database behavior under different con fi gurations, workloads, and database states. As creating a complete quantitative description of an existing database in a system model is a dif fi cult task, they also propose a modeling approach which supports the evolutionary re authors show how the system model can be evaluated to predict whether or not business goal de are meet.

The second paper, titled  X  Enhancing Accuracy and Expressive Power of Range Query Answers over Incomplete Spatial Databases via a Novel Reasoning Approach  X  , by Alfredo Cuzzocrea and Andrea Nucita, proposes an innovative reasoning approach for enhancing the accuracy and expressive power of range query answers over incomplete spatial databases , along its experimental assessment and analysis. Authors start their research from recognizing that modern spatial database applications built on top of distributed and heterogeneous spatial information sources such as conventional spatial databases underlying Geographical Information Systems (GIS), spatial data fi les and spatial information acquired or inferred from the Web, suffer from data integration and topological consistency problems. This more-and-more conveys in incomplete information , which makes answering range queries over incomplete spatial databases a leading research challenge in spatial database systems research. Within the general setting of incomplete spatial databases, authors particularly devote attention to the signi scenario in which the geometrical information on a sub-set of spatial database objects is incomplete whereas the spatial database still stores topological relations among these objects, and propose a novel technique for ef
Query Engine for Incomplete information ), an innovative query engine that implements the main technique. Finally, a comprehensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-life spatial data sets is provided.

The third paper, titled  X  A Semantic Approach to ETL Technologies
Sartori and Maurizio Vincini, addresses the problem of effectively and ef (ETL) processes within Data Warehouse architectures, for the creation of an updated, consistent and materialized view of a given set of data sources. The solution is represented by a novel ETL tool that introduces a semantic approach whose main bene thus de fi ning a transformation function for populating the Data Warehouse with homogeneous values. The proposed tool relies-on and extends principles and functionalities of two systems that have been previously-devised by the same authors, namely the data integration system MOMIS and the data analysis system RELEVANT , with signi of a Data Warehouse for a set of enterprises working in the beverage-and-food logistic area. Retrieved empirical results show that the proposed tool effectively and ef fi ciently supports ETL processes within modern Data Warehouse architectures.
The fourth paper, titled  X  Combining Objects with Rules to Represent Aggregation Knowledge in Data Warehouse and OLAP Systems by Nicolas Prat, Isabelle Comyn-Wattiau and Jacky Akoka, considers conceptual modeling aspects of multidimensional aggregations , in Data Warehouse and OLAP Systems. In this paper, authors argue that, since OLAP-like browsing of multidimensional data plays a means of roll-up and drill-down operators , aggregation knowledge should be adeq uately represented in conceptual multidimensional models, and mapped in subsequent logical and physical models. Unfortunately, as authors observe, current conceptual multidimensional models poorly represent aggregation knowledge, which is indeed characterized by complex structure and dynamics and is highly context-aware . Starting from these considerations, authors propose a novel approach for representing aggregation knowledge via ( i ) appropriate objects modeled by means of UML Class Diagrams and ( ii ) ad-hoc rules modeled by means of the Production Rule Representation (PRR) language , in a combined manner. In particular, in the authors' solution static aggregation knowledge is represented via class diagrams, while rules describe dynamic aggregation knowledge, i.e. how aggregations may be performed depending on the context. Authors provide principles and functionalities of the proposed conceptual framework for Data Warehouse and OLAP Systems, along with several interesting study cases targeted to a real-life
Data Warehouse project that fi nally demonstrate the bene for accepting his proposal of a special issue focused on pushing arti for assisting him whenever required. The Editor would also like to thank all the reviewers who have worked within a tight schedule and whose detailed and constructive feedbacks to authors have contributed to substantial improvement in the quality of fi nal papers.
