 As Internet use has spread and evolved, more and more information related to our daily life and residential region has become available. In other words, there is an increasing variety of Web pages whose content is  X  X ocal X . In this paper, we consider a Web page to be local if it is of interests to only the residents of a cer-tain region or organization. From this perspective, local information differs from location information. Conventional information retrieval systems and search en-gines, such as Google [5], are very useful for helping users to find interesting in-formation. However, users cannot easily find or exclude  X  X ocal X  information about their daily lives and residential regions since it is difficult to specify keywords to form an appropriate query. Some portal Web sites [11, 16] provide directory-type search services for regional information. In such sites, the regional information is organized manually. The resources available to do this may be limited, though, and some valuable information may be missed.
 more information systems have begun providing information related to each user X  X  current location, which is obtained from users X  PHS or GPS devices. For example, they may provide information concerning the area near the user X  X  cur-rent location, such as information on nearby restaurants, public transportation, or local weather. Most of these conventional mobile information systems[3, 7, 9, 14] thus search for information in a  X  X ocation-oriented X  manner.
 activities and their residential regions, we earlier proposed a concept called the localness degree [10, 12]. We say a Web page is local when it is of interest to only the residents (users) of a certain region or organization. From this viewpoint, we compute the localness degree of a Web page in two ways: a) by estimating its region dependence -the occurrence frequency of geographic words and the area of its content coverage, and b) by estimating how ubiquitous its topic is -in other words, we estimate whether the information on the page is relevant everywhere and everyday in our daily life. Information retrieval based on localness degree differs from a conventional  X  X ocation-oriented X  information system in that it searches for information in a  X  X ocalness-oriented X  manner.
 ticular region based on a coverage mapping of Web page and user X  X  location data. With this method, information is searched for from both the  X  X ocalness-oriented X  and the  X  X ocation-oriented X  perspectives. In other words, we propose a hybrid information retrieval method that considers the localness degree of a Web page and the location data for a user.
 standpoint of  X  X yoto Prefecture X , a Web page may be local. However, it may not be local from the standpoint of  X  X yoto City X . In this paper, we modify our previous computation of the localness degree by considering a hierarchical region structure when searching for local information. Moreover, we compare the content coverage of a Web page and a geographic region to select the local information regarding a certain region.
 tion regarding a wider region that extends beyond the current location of a user. In many cases, user will be familiar with their current locations, but will want more information about other nearby places that they will visit or are consider-ing visiting. In short, we search for  X  X egion X  (area) information not just  X  X lace X  (location point) information.
 related work. In Section 3, we describe the mapping of content-coverage and the user X  X  region of interest. The notion of localness degree is described in Section 4. We show some preliminary experiment results in Section 5. We conclude and look at future research in Section 6. The KOKONONET system [13], which was developed as part of Mobile Info Search (MIS) project[14], exchanges information bi-directionally between the Web and the real world based on location data. KOKONONET uses the lo-cation data, such as an address string in a document (Web page), to identify the geographic position of the document. Actually, KOKONONET is a typical location-oriented information system. Although we also use location data, our research differs in that we automatically discover  X  X ocal X  information pertaining to a wider region (an area) that extends beyond a specific location (a place). location, and studied the usage of several geographic keys for assigning site-level geographic context. By analyzing  X  X hois X  records, they built a database that correlates IP addresses and hostnames to approximate physical locations. By combining this information with the hyperlink structure of the Web, they were able to make inferences about the geography of the Web at the granularity level of a site.
 particular geographic locale to traditional keyword searching. To accomplish this, Egnor converted street addresses found within a large corpus of documents to latitude-longitude-based coordinates using the freely available TIGER and FIPS data sources, and built a two dimensional index of these coordinates. Egnor X  X  system provides an interface that allows the user to augment a keyword search with the ability to restrict matches to within a certain radius of a specified address. This differs from our method with respect to how strongly a page is related to an area. Moreover, our work focuses on obtaining local information from the Web through a contextual approach based on page content and the correlation between pages and places.
 mation about specific cities in USA. In Japan, the Digital City Kyoto project [7] developed systems and technologies to provide information on Kyoto city. These services provide high quality information through collecting and indexing Web pages by human. In Digital City Kyoto project, a system called Kyoto-SEARCH [9] has been developed to add the ability to collect and index Web pages automatically. KyotoSEARCH helps users navigate among Web informa-tion, maps, and Web-based geographic knowledge in an integrated way. In other words, KyotoSEARCH indexes Web pages by mapping each page with its rele-vant locations on a map and provides a visual interface to help users navigate regional information.
 the MBR of a given Web page. They used the tag information of HTML to identify the roles of geographical words appearing in the Web page. However, their modified methods are limited to the Web pages describing about Kyoto city, which is a well-known tourist city in Japan. In addition, they did not show any experiment results. The performances of their methods are not clear. 3.1 Content Coverage of a Web Page We convert geographic words (place and organization names) contained in a Web page into pairs of location data such as (latitude, longitude) and estimate the content coverage of the Web page based on the MBR method.
 gitude). We plot all of these points on a map where the y-and x-axes are latitude and longitude, respectively. The content coverage of a Web page can be approx-imately computed using the MBR which contains these points ( Fig. 1(a)). MBR based on the geographic boundaries. For example, to construct an MBR on a map using only the geographic word in  X  X saka City X , we could use the maximum and minimum values of the longitude and latitude data for all places in Osaka city ( Fig. 1(b)). In addition, if the geographic word is part of an organization name, we can analyze its address and pick out the place name to construct the MBR.
 such as [15]. In such cases, we upgrade the administrative level for such place names to find approximate location data. For example, if the location data of  X  X  street, B city, A state X  is not found, we can use the location data of  X  X  city, A state X  to obtain an approximate matching.
 the page X  X  context to clearly specify its location data. For example, to match up  X  X utyu City X  to its correct location data, we can examine the context. If  X  X iroshima X  appears near  X  X utyu City X , we can use the location data of  X  X utyu City, Hiroshima Prefecture X  to find the location data of  X  X utyu City X  in this page. On the other hand, if  X  X okyo X  appears, we should use  X  X utyu City, Tokyo metropolitan X  to get the proper location data. 3.2 Geographic Region In the same way as we compute the content coverage of a Web page, we can plot the user X  X  location data on a map and construct an MBR as the user X  X  current geographic region.
 than their current locations. For example, suppose you are staying at a hotel and want to go to dinner -you may be interested in information about restau-rants in a wider area, rather than just about those in the hotel with which you are already familiar. In other words, you need regional information more than location information.
 We then plot these points on a map and construct a MBR containing them. Fig. 2 shows some examples of constructing a geographic region.
 1). In such a special case, we assume the MBR is a square whose center point is l . Figure 2(b) shows an example of such a region. The distance from the current placetoeachsideis5 (longitude or latitude) which ranges from 5000 to 10000 meters in Japan. That is, we assume that users are most likely to be interested in regional information from around their current positions and the distance from the current position to a target place should be within 10 km. In practice, this distance can be modified according to user intentions and application systems. 3.3 Coverage Mapping of Web Page and Geographic Region We compare the MBRs constructed from a Web page and the user X  X  location data. If they are the same, we conclude that the Web page provides information about the user X  X  current geographic region. This is extract mapping. However, this is a rare case in the real world. In most cases, these two kinds of MBR differ from each other. Therefore, we compute the overlap between the MBRs to estimate the strength of the relationship between a Web page and a geographic region ( Fig. 3). In other words, if there is a large overlap between the content coverage of a Web page and the user X  X  geographic region, we say that the Web page is strongly related to the user X  X  interest.
 computed as follows.
 where max l a t ( x )and mi n l a t ( x ) are, respectively, the maximum and minimum latitude data used to construct the MBR of x . max log ( x )and mi n log ( x )are, respectively, the maximum and minimum longitude data used to construct the M BR ( x ) is the area of the MBR of x . Here, the standard unit of latitude and longitude used to compute M BR ( x ) is seconds.
 bility of p containing local information regarding region r is high. Of course, we also need to compute the localness degree of p as described in Section 4. We say a Web page is local when it is of interest to only users from a certain region or organization. From this viewpoint, we compute the localness degree of a Web page in two ways: a) estimating its region dependence (the frequency of geographic words and the area of its content coverage), and b) estimating the ubiquitousness of its topic (i.e., we estimate whether the information is general in that it applies everywhere and everyday in our daily life). 4.1 Region Dependence If a Web page provides information about a narrow region, its region dependence may be high. In other words, if the content coverage of a Web page is very narrow, wesaythatitislocal.
 include a lot of geographic information, such as the names of the country, state (prefecture), city, and so on. Therefore, we compute the frequency of these ge-ographic words occurring in a Web page to estimate its region dependence. In other words, the number and sizes of points plotted on the MBR (content cover-age) are also used to estimate the localness. Here, the point size represents the level of detail of a geographic word. An example is shown in Fig. 4. Four points are plotted on the left MBR, and eight points are plotted on the right MBR. Even if the areas of the two MBRs are equal, their localness degrees should dif-fer because the right one probably provides information about the region that is more detailed.
 thus be strongly related to particular regions. Here,  X  X etailed geographic word X  means that a geographic word identifies a detailed location. Usually, we can use the administrative level of each geographic word (region name) as its level of detail. In our current work, we just consider the level of detail of geographic words based on administrative levels. For example,  X  X yoto X  is more detailed than  X  X apan X . As mentioned, local information is a relative concept: a Web page may be local within a wider region but not local within a narrow region. From this perspective, for a given region ( r ) or a given administrative level ( l ), if the administrative level of a geographic word gw is less than l ,itslevelof detail is high. The given level or given administrative level relates to the user region and should be specified by the user manually or by the user location data automatically. where admi n ( x ) is the given administrative level of x . In our current work, weareabletoassigntheadministrativelevelvalueasfollows: cou n try =5, orga n izatio nn ame = state ( pref ecture )=4, city =3, tow n =2,and street ( road )=1.
 Web page X  X  corpus (i.e., Web pages from the same Web site as the one whose region dependence is being estimated) when estimating the region dependence of a Web page. If the document frequency of a geographic word contained in the Web page is high, such a geographic word is a common one and has less effect on the localness of that page.
 detailed geographic words, the Web page is local. As mentioned, it is also im-portant to consider the document frequency of each geographic word to prevent common geographic words affecting the localness degree. Therefore, we compute the localness degree based on the region dependence as follows. where l oca l d ( p ) is the localness degree, detai l ( gw i )isthelevelofdetailofgeo-graphic words, tf ( gw i ) is the frequency of gw i within p , df ( gw i ) is the document frequency of gw i within a page corpus, M BR ( p ) is the content coverage of page p ,and words ( p )isthenumberofwordscontainedin p . 4.2 Topic Ubiquitousness A ubiquitous occurrence may have a high localness degree. For example, summer festivals, athletic meets, and weekend sales are ubiquitous events that frequently occur. A ubiquitous occurrence may be a normal part of our daily life. Therefore, if a page describes a ubiquitous event, it contains local information of interest to users in a certain region.
 similarity between pages and the locations where events are held. If the pages are similar in content, but differ in terms of location or time, their topics are general. Here, the similarity between pages a and b is calculated based on the vector space model.
 of Web page p is computed as where m is the number of pages whose similarities (with page p , excluding geo-graphic words and proper nouns) are greater than threshold  X  . n is the number of pages used for the similarity comparison.
 be local for a wide region, but not considered local for a very narrow region. For example, although a particular event rarely occurs within Kyoto city, it may occur often within the Kansai area (which includes Kyoto city). A Web page describing such an event is general within the Kansai area and it is local. However, it is neither general nor local within Kyoto city. Similarly, an event occurring often during summer will be judged local within the time scope of summer, but may not be within the time scope of one year. Thus, we modify the computation of the localness degree based on ubiquitousness. Within time duration  X  and region scope  X  , the localness ( l oca l u ( p, l , X , X  )) of Web page p based on the ubiquitousness at region level l is computed as where m is the number of regions containing many similar pages p at the region level l within region scope  X  and time duration  X  . n is the number of regions at level l within  X  . area (  X , l ) is the set of regions at level l within  X  .Iftheratio of similar pages (of p ) among all pages of region x is bigger than threshold  X  , cou n tif ( x,  X  ) returns 1; else, it returns 0. cou n t (  X , l ) is the number of regions at region level l within  X  . 4.3 Integrated Localness Degree We also can define an integrated localness degree based on the region dependence and ubiquitousness, such as the sum of l oca l d ( p )and l oca l u ( p ). The integrated localness l oca l i ( p ) of page p is computed as where f stands for an integration function of l oca l d ( p )and l oca l u ( p ), such as sum or logical OR. In this section, we describe the preliminary experiment of our local-information retrieval method. We used Google[5] to search for candidate Web pages and then ranked them based on their localness degrees and relationships between them and geographic region in which the user is interested. If a Web page has high localness degree (region dependency or ubiquitousness) and related to the specified geographic region 1 , we consider that it is local-information. GoogleAPI[5] and then selected the top 50 results as the candidate Web pages. Initially, we excluded all of the structural information (e.g., HTML tags) and the advertisement content from the HTML sources of these candidate Web pages. We used ChaSen[2] for Japanese morphology analysis. To exclude stop words, we built a stop word list containing 593 terms in English and 347 terms in Japanese. collected from ASAHI.COM, a well known news Web site in Japan, during 3 month period and within 47 regions at the region level of prefecture. In our experiment, we had collected 1918 Web pages. Thus, in this experiment, at the prefecture level, cou n t (  X , l ) = 47. We used a location database[15] containing the longitude and latitude data of 3252 places in Japan.
 means that we search for Web pages which is local and related to our specified geographic region. On the other hand,  X  X earch (B) X  means that we search for Web pages which is related to our specified geographic region but not local. coverage mapping are described as follows.

If we excluded proper Nevertheless, from the experiment results, at least, we could assume that our method is useful for discovering or excluding local information concerning in a certain region. Moreover, comparing to our previous experiment results[10], we could say that we have succeed in improving the computation of localness degree. We have developed an information retrieval method from localness-oriented and region-oriented perspectives. We generate queries by using user location data and use these to search for the local Web pages. For each searched Web page, we compute its localness degree and estimate its relationship with the user X  X  region. That is, we rank the searched Web page by considering whether it contains local information pertaining to a certain region and return the pages having a high probability of containing such information. We compute the localness degree of a Web page from two perspectives: region dependence and ubiquitousness of its topic. In addition, in this paper, we have extended the localness degree to a relative concept by considering a hierarchical region structure. We have also proposed a method to compute the relationship between a Web page and a geographic region based on the MBR method. Based on our method, we can search for regional information extending beyond the location information, which the user may know in advance.
 proposed methods. In our current work, we generate the query by simply using the location data and user specified keywords. We need to further refine the query generation. For instance, we could modify the query by more precisely considering the relationships between the current place, previous place, and fu-ture place of the user. We will carry out further study on the method to compute the geographic region and content coverage of a Web page. Specially, we need carry out further natural language processing to improve the localness degree computation and coverage mapping. In addition, we hope to study the integra-tion function applied to the region dependence and ubiquitousness for various application systems.
