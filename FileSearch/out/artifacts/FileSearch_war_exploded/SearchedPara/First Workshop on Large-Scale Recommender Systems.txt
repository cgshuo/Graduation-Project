 Chances favor connected minds. The motivation of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on large -scale recommender system in order to: (1) share experience, techniques and methodologies used to develop effecti ve large -scale recommender, from architecture, algorithm, programming model, to evaluation (2) identify key challenges and promising trends in the area, and (3) identify collaboration opportunities among participants. This workshop aims to foste r discussions in several fields that are of interest to our growing community of recommendation system builders. On the practical side, we would like to encourage sharing of architecture best practices in large -scale recommender systems as they are practic ed in industry, as well as particular challenges and pain points. We hope this will guide future research that is system aware. On the research side, we focus on bringing in ideas and evaluations on sca ling beyond the current generation of big data systems , with improved recommendation metrics . We believe the brightest minds from both sides will mutually benefit from the discussions and accelerate problem solving. We solicited submissions from industrial level recommendation system practi tioners in either a short paper or slides formats on large scale system practice, as well as from recommendation systems researchers on their new research related to system aspect of recommendation with Big Data.
 We focused on the following topics: Systems of Large -scale RS: Data &amp; Algorithms in Large -scale RS: Yi Wang, Tecent Hua Zheng, Hulu Shou -kun Wang, Douban Wen -dong Gu, Cutt.com Olfa Nasraoui, University of Louisville Dionysios Logothetis, Telefonica I+D Yi Zhang, UC Santa Cruz Mingxuan Sun, P andora Jason Zhao, Douban Shai Fine, Intel Ranjit Desai, Adobe Linas Baltrunas, Telefonica I+D Ron Karidi, Outbrain The workshop will feature two keynotes and three presentation sessions . We clust ered the presentations to: (1) s ystems of large-scale recommenders, (2) d ata and algorithms, and (3) a pplication s and evaluations . We plan to schedule a discussion period follo wing each presentation session , where the participants will breakout into groups to discuss with the presenters and each ot her . Our industry keynote is from lead r esearcher Justin Basilico at Netflix , titled  X  X ecommendation at Netflix Scale  X . Our academic keynote is from Aapo Kyrola (author of Graphchi) of Carnegie Melon University, titled  X  Large -scale recommender systems on just a PC  X . We thank the RecSys 2013 organizing committee for giving us the opportunity to host this workshop in conjunction with RecSys 2013.
