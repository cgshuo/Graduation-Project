 1. Introduction
Various online activities are becoming an increasingly important part of our life. In recent years, Web 2.0 has led to the development of large Web-based communities that support and facilitate collaboration among Internet users. One class of such systems, collaborative tagging systems also known as social tagging systems, has been prevalent in Web 2.0. Popular collaborative tagging services include Delicious (social bookmarking), Flickr (photo sharing), and CiteULike (academic paper sharing).

A collaborative tagging system is a user-centric, social and democratic indexing system. Users are allowed to create their own tags and associate these tags with digital resources such as articles, photos, or websites shared on the system. Addition-ally, users can search for the resources that other users have tagged using personal vocabularies. A resource can be tagged with an unlimited number of tags. Therefore, users do not need to comply with a complex classification system and only enter the keywords that first come into mind. Novices are able to immediately participate in the system because it simply shifts from professional categorization to social tagging ( Kroski, 2005 ). The aforementioned advantages make collaborative tagging systems one of the most popular Web 2.0 systems.

However, existing collaborative tagging systems suffer from the vague-meaning problem when users retrieve or present resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following causes ( Hope, Wang, &amp;
Barkataki, 2007; Kroski, 2005; Marchetti, Tesconi, Ronzano, Rosella, &amp; Minutoli, 2007 ):  X  1. Synonyms, polysemys, and homonyms: Existing collaborative tagging does not allow for formal identification of syn-onyms, which leads to the fracturing of collections. For example,  X  X  X log X  and  X  X  X eb log X  have the same meaning but col-laborative tagging systems do not understand it. Moreover, existing collaborative tagging systems are not able to distinguish between polysemys or between homonyms. For example, the tag  X  X  X lash X  may represent the multimedia player, the lighting device of a camera, or the compact flash memory. 2. Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun can be singular or plural, uppercase or lowercase. Moreover, mis-tagging due to spelling errors occurs often. Spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative tagging systems, and therefore both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to separate words by a single tag.
Additionally, different possible spellings of the same word and tags using different languages generate term variations. 3. Personalized tags: Unorthodox or personalized tags that convey no meaning by natural language and only make sense to an individual user. 4. Lack of relationships: Relationships between tags cannot be structured in existing collaborative tagging systems.
Resources might be labeled with the tags  X  X  X offee X  or  X  X  X appuccino, X  and there is no mechanism that might indicate that cappuccino is a sub-class of coffee. The lack of hierarchy causes systems to be unable to deal with different specificities or basic levels of the words chosen to tag a resource. In addition to hierarchical relationships, other relationships should be structured between tags to improve content searches. For example,  X  X  X offee shop, X   X  X  X af X , X  and  X  X  X onvenience store X  have a  X  X  X ell X  relationship with  X  X  X offee, X  so that all resources about coffee sellers can be easily retrieved.
Keyword-based tagging systems are not able to understand the meaning of tags and the relationships between tags. Con-sequently, content searches fail to locate content identified by different tags with the same meaning and fail to distinguish irrelevant content identified by the same tag but with a different meaning, which reduces search recall and precision. The performance of information retrieval supported by social tagging is lower than that of search engines and the methods by which folksonomies can increase the effectiveness of their internal searching functions deserve further study ( Morrison, 2008 ).

Some studies have demonstrated how to develop semantic tagging systems that considered tag meanings ( Chen &amp; Rob-erts, 2007; Hope et al., 2007; Jiao &amp; Chen, 2010; Marchetti et al., 2007 ), however, they did not rigorously examine system effectiveness and user acceptance. This study develops a semantic tagging system for supporting knowledge sharing. Knowl-edge management systems are applied to leverage organizational knowledge through knowledge creation, knowledge stor-anticipated because the existing systems are limited to serve as content repositories and neglect the tasks that organize and extract the maximum possible value of the contributions. Knowledge storage and retrieval are the most important activities for the manipulation of explicit knowledge. The most common problem in knowledge retrieval is that much of the retrieved content is irrelevant to users X  demands. The possible ways to improve searching functions for knowledge management sys-tems are increasing users X  knowledge of the context of their information requirements, and improving their knowledge of the domain being searched. Knowledge maps and visualization techniques can be used to improve organization, mainte-nance, and the extraction of valuable content from knowledge management systems. Visualization techniques can be ap-plied to help users understand available information more easily. A knowledge map employs visualization techniques to provide a unified environment for finding relevant information, which allows content to be put in a context. Accordingly, this study expects that introducing semantic tagging with visualized knowledge map is able to improve the quality of knowl-edge retrieval. Based on the current problems of collaborative tagging systems and knowledge retrieval, the research objec-tives are: 1. Designing a semantic social tagging system to tackle the problems of keyword-based tagging : The proposed semantic social tagging system provides tags from the ontology when users tag contents. The ontology is a file expressing concepts, indi-viduals, and their relationships in a given domain. Users can collaboratively maintain the ontology via an ontology editor.
The tags must be words that represent concepts or relationships in the ontology; thus the system is able to understand the meanings of tags and avoid the unclear-meaning problem. The performance of keyword and semantic tagging mech-anisms will be evaluated by measuring users X  tagging behavior, and perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use, based on the Technology Acceptance Model ( Davis, 1989; Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008 ). 2. Designing semantic searching mechanisms that take advantage of semantic social tags : The semantic searching mechanisms comprise triple-pattern search and visual search modules. The triple-pattern search module enables users to search for related content by specifying subjects, predicates, and objects. The visual search module helps users search for content by clicking concept nodes or relationship links in the visualized knowledge map. These semantic searching mechanisms help the user to understand the meanings of semantic tags and to return all the resources that their semantic tags match to user-specified concepts, individuals, or relationships. The performance of searching mechanisms will be evaluated by their precisions, recall, and users X  perceptions. 2. Literature review
This section firstly introduces knowledge management and the knowledge map. Then, the features of collaborative tag-ging are mentioned. Finally, Semantic Web technology is briefly described. 2.1. Knowledge management
Knowledge management (KM) has emerged as an important research topic for information systems and management re-search since the 1990s. Knowledge management refers to identifying and leveraging the collective knowledge in an organi-zation to help the organization compete ( von Krogh, 1998 ). Gold and colleagues defined KM as the explicit and systematic management of vital knowledge and the associated processes of acquisition, conversion, application, and protection ( Gold,
Malhotra, &amp; Segars, 2001 ). It requires turning personal knowledge into organizational knowledge that can be widely shared throughout an organization and appropriately applied. Knowledge management is largely regarded as the four basic pro-cesses of creating, storing/retrieving, transferring, and applying knowledge ( Alavi &amp; Leidner, 2001 ). In summary, KM con-cerns accessing and using the information and knowledge within an organization, and enabling individuals to apply knowledge wherever it is needed. Therefore, the objective of knowledge management is facilitating and encouraging knowl-edge conversion and stimulating tacit knowledge sharing within the organization in order to process, store and convert this tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge in a form that can be easily retrieved.

Knowledge is the expertise and skills acquired through experience or education, according to the Oxford English Dictio-nary. Goldstein (1993) defined knowledge as adequate understanding of facts and of concepts and their relationships, and the basic foundation a person needs to perform a task. Davenport and Prusak (1998) defined knowledge as a fluid mix of framed experience, values, surrounding circumstantial information, and specialist insight that supplies a framework for checking and combining new experiences and information. Nonaka (1994) defined knowledge as the set of justified true be-liefs that enhances an entity X  X  capability for effective action. Knowledge have various types including tacit, explicit, individ-ual, social, declarative, procedural, causal, conditional, relational, and pragmatic knowledge ( Alavi &amp; Leidner, 2001 ).
Knowledge sharing is a complex process involving contributions to knowledge by an organization or its employees, and the collection, assimilation, and application of knowledge by the organization or its employees ( Hendriks, 2001; Huysman &amp; de Wit, 2002 ). Hendriks (1999) defined knowledge sharing as knowledge owners X  externalizing or transmitting knowledge to knowledge re-constructors by means of codifying, showing, describing, and so on; knowledge re-constructors internalize or absorb knowledge from knowledge owners through learning by doing, reading books, trying to understand codified knowl-edge, and so on. Therefore, knowledge sharing includes knowledge transmission and knowledge absorption. Knowledge sharing between individuals and units are important in an organization. It converts individual knowledge into organizational knowledge. If knowledge is not effectively shared, it impedes the transfer of best practices within an organization.
This study focused on the knowledge sharing context in which knowledge owners externalize their knowledge as articles and tags with an ontology. These articles and tags are saved in a knowledge repository, and then knowledge re-constructors search for appropriate articles via a searching mechanism. 2.2. Knowledge maps Novak defined concept maps as tools for organizing and representing knowledge ( Novak, 1993; Novak &amp; Canas, 2006 ).
Concept maps are a method for visualizing and interacting with a knowledge domain. A concept map is usually displayed by representing each concept as a node in the graph, and each concept relation as a boundary between concepts. A knowl-edge map may contain not only concepts and relations but also thousands of objects or facts that can be observed in the real world ( Crampes et al., 2006 ). Knowledge maps typically point to people as well as to documents and databases to help users find appropriate knowledge sources ( Davenport &amp; Prusak, 1998 ). A knowledge map is a visual architecture of the knowledge domain that helps users to examine the knowledge on a global scale and from different viewpoints ( Eppler, 2001 ). Knowl-edge maps play a key role in facilitating knowledge management systems more effectively, and they have become an impor-tant issue in the knowledge management domain ( Herl, O X  X eil, Chung, &amp; Schacter, 1999; Maule, 1998 ).
A knowledge map is a path for the user of a KM system to attain specific knowledge. The benefits of knowledge maps may vary, based on the perspective. In the field of decision support, knowledge maps are a method designed not only to reduce the information complexity that decision makers face, but also to improve the evocation of information and assess proba-edge artifacts to facilitate learning. Knowledge maps are able to improve learners X  search and learning performance, and they
Lakdawala (2001) employed a knowledge map to design an intelligent questioning system for improving learning efficiency and effectiveness. In the field of information retrieval, a knowledge map represents the document categories, and the con-cept hierarchy enables effective access and browsing of information. Lin and Hsueh (2003) applied information retrieval techniques to create and maintain a knowledge map for keeping document categories up-to-date to facilitate knowledge sharing activities in a virtual community. Chung, Chen, and Nunamaker (2003) proposed a knowledge map framework for discovering business intelligence and mitigating information overload on the Web.

In summary, a knowledge map is a tool for organizing knowledge and searching knowledge resources. It helps users clas-sify different kinds of knowledge, construct their interrelationships, and assist them in reaching useful knowledge sources. A knowledge repository is a vehicle for archiving explicit organizational knowledge. Knowledge maps are recognized as an expressive, efficient, and effective way to enhance access to and navigation of information in a large knowledge repository.
This study develops a visual searching mechanism that generates a knowledge map according to a user-defined ontology, and users can click nodes or links on the map to execute a content search.
 2.3. Collaborative tagging
Tagging is an approach to collecting metadata. Metadata can be described as  X  X  X ata about data X  or  X  X  X ocumentation for your data. X  Tagging, which has been widely used on Web 2.0 sites for collecting metadata about resources, is called  X  X  X ollab-orative tagging, X   X  X  X ocial tagging, X  or  X  X  X olksonomy. X  Web 2.0 was developed by Tim O X  X eilly ( O X  X eilly, 2005 ). According to
O X  X eilly,  X  X  X eb 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform. X  Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.
 The word  X  X  X olksonomy X  is a combination of  X  X  X olks X  and  X  X  X axonomy X  created by Thomas Vander Wal ( Vander Wal, 2004 ).
Folks are the common people of a society; taxonomy means a hierarchical structure of classification. Collaborative tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-based tags to shared resources. This process is easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed is to freely choose keywords from an individual X  X  vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into meta-data generators. Collaborative tagging is an extreme form of user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. The use of tags creates a collective classification scheme and provides a snapshot of the current mindset of the user.
Collaborative tagging has two purposes: first, it can quickly generate personal categorizations for later information retrie-val; second, the collective use of tags makes inferences about related resources and tags possible. A resource can be tagged with an unlimited number of tags. Collaborative tagging websites allow for the organization and sharing of digital resources.
These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or search for the information by using these tags ( Golder &amp; Huberman, 2006 ).
A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components: users, tags, and resources ( Smith, 2008 ). The three interconnected components in a collaborative tagging system can be described as follows: 1. Users: Occasionally called taggers, they employ a tagging system to create tags and sometimes they add resources. Users have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations. They try to share or label a resource so they can find it later. 2. Resources: Resources are the items that users tag. A resource can be just about anything. Within each tagging system, the resources often share some common properties. Examples of resources are the Web pages in Delicious and the photos in
Flickr. 3. Tags: The keywords added by users are tags. Tags are essentially metadata about the resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources. Different users have different tagging patterns. Tagging systems allow for these differences.
Existing collaborative tagging systems are keyword-based and face the vague-meaning problem. This study developed a semantic social tagging mechanism that helps users define relationships among tags. 2.4. Semantic Web
One of the significant problems of the current Web is that Web information is understandable by humans, but machines cannot recognize its denotation. Consider, for example, a person who wants to search the Web for websites selling cell phones, using the term  X  X  X ell phones. X  The search engine will return Web pages including this keyword regardless of whether the websites sell or do not sell cell phones, because a machine cannot understand the term  X  X  X ell. X  Moreover, websites selling smart phones cannot be retrieved, because a machine cannot know that smart phones are a kind of cell phones.
The Semantic Web is a vision originally expressed by Berners-Lee. The vision is to transform the human-understandable content on the present Web into machine-understandable content, and to enable applications such as software agents for finding, sharing, and integrating information more easily. Therefore, the key to the Semantic Web is the creation of ma-chine-consumable knowledge ( Berners-Lee, Hendler, &amp; Lassila, 2001 ). To express the semantics of resources on the Web, a set of formal languages is used to communicate between humans and machines. These languages can be stacked on top of one another to form the  X  X  X emantic Web Language Layering X  that was proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ( Berners-Lee, 2006 ). They are introduced as follows.

First, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) is used to express metadata on Web resources. It exists in XML format and was designed such that metadata can always apply to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) instead of to the parent ele-ment in the XML structure. So it allows one-to-many and many-to-one relationships to be expressed. W3C provides a triple-based RDF data model consisting of three parts: subject, predicate, and object. This triple-based RDF data model is composed of nodes and arcs. Nodes represent resources or objects, and arcs represent the properties of the resources. Both of them are labeled URIs, so everyone can link to the resources or properties and retrieve a representation of them, thanks to URIs X  global scope ( Berners-Lee, Shadbolt, &amp; Hall, 2006 ).

RDF is a domain-independent language, for which no claim about a specific domain is made. However, RDF does not con-tain a vocabulary for creating metadata, so an RDF schema is needed to predefine a vocabulary to be used with metadata generation. Therefore, an RDF vocabulary description language, namely RDF Schema (RDFS), was proposed. RDFS defines classes and properties that are used to describe classes, properties, and other resources. RDFS adopts the basic RDF model and XML syntax specifications, and it has provided some ontology representation capability. Ontology is used to capture knowledge about a specific domain. Ontology describes the concepts in the domain and the relationships among those con-cepts. RDFS is intended to model a domain in a hierarchical fashion, which poses limitations in representing some ontolog-ical knowledge. One example of this problem is the representation of the  X  X  X isjointness X  of classes, which means classes are separated from one another. Therefore, a more expressive language is needed due to this limitation.

The Ontology Inference Layer (OIL) is the first ontology language integrating features of frame-based systems and descrip-tion logics (DLs). It uses RDF and XML to express semantics. The DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) is used to develop a language and tools to facilitate the concept of the Semantic Web. The DAML + OIL ontology language was taken as a starting point for the W3C Web Ontology Working Group in developing Web Ontology Language (OWL). This language is intended to be the standard ontology language for the Semantic Web.

To define relationships among tags, this study applied OWL to describe ontology. The semantic social tagging mechanism enables taggers define tags and their relationships as well as organizing the ontology. Several semantic tagging systems have been developed employing Semantic Web technology. The comparison of existing semantic tagging systems with the system proposed by this study is listed in Table 1 . The major distinctions are that this study exploits visualized knowledge map sup-porting knowledge content search and evaluates the semantic tagging system by considering not only technical measures, precision and recall, but also user behavior and acceptance. 3. System development
This study proposed a semantic social tagging system that comprises one semantic tagging mechanism and two semantic searching mechanisms to improve the quality of content searches for knowledge sharing. The system architecture is shown in Fig. 1 .

The functions of each module are described as follows: 1. Content management module: Users create, modify, or delete content via this module. 2. Semantic tagging module: It provides tags from ontology when users tag content. The tags must represent the conceptual terms, individuals, or relationships in the ontology, which allows the system to understand the meanings of the tags according to the ontology. 3. Ontology management module: Users can collaboratively edit the ontology that expresses the knowledge domain about the content. 4. Triple-pattern search module: It enables users to search for related content by specifying subjects, predicates, and objects. 5. Visual search module: This is a knowledge map that can help users search for content by clicking on concept nodes or relationship arcs in the visualized ontology (concept map). 6. Semantic analysis module: It performs reasoning based on the ontology to understand the meaning of the tags. The tools used for system development are the Jena API, the Prot X g X  API, and Prefuse. Jena is a Java framework for building
Semantic Web applications. It generally provides a programmatic environment for RDF, RDFS, and OWL, and it includes a rule-based inference engine. Prot X g X  is a free, open-source ontology editor and knowledge-base framework. Prefuse is a set of software tools for creating rich interactive data visualizations. The Prefuse toolkit provides a visualization framework for the Java programming language. The Jena API is used to develop the triple-pattern search module. The Prot X g X  API is used to develop the semantic tagging module and the ontology management module. The semantic tagging mechanism provides tags from a user-defined ontology when users tag content. The semantic searching mechanisms include triple-pattern searches and visual searches. They allow understanding of the meanings of the semantic tags according to the user-defined ontology. Moreover, the visual search module provides the visualized ontology to users as a searching interface.
Comparatively, traditional social tagging systems enable users to tag and search with keywords, but they are not able to understand the meanings of these keywords. Therefore, the innovation of this system is to take advantage of the Semantic
Web technology and the topological characteristics of knowledge maps to improve the quality of content searches. Following are detailed descriptions of these mechanisms. 3.1. Semantic tagging Users can tag content via the semantic tagging module. They are allowed to tag articles when they create or read articles.
The tagger first determines the newly-added tag in relation to a concept, individual, or relationship. Afterwards, the semantic tagging module retrieves and gives the existing concepts, individuals, or relationships in the ontology to the tagger for tag-ging (see Fig. 2 ). The tagger can choose the appropriate tags for the content. A tagger can add new concepts, individuals, or relationships into the ontology through the ontology management module illustrated in Fig. 3 if s/he does not find any suit-able tags.

The knowledge of a concept or an individual can be practical or theoretical. Users can define these knowledge types when they add tags of concepts or individuals. The knowledge type of a relationship can be practical, theoretical, procedural (know-how), causal (know-why), or conditional (know-when) ( Alavi &amp; Leidner, 2001; Huang &amp; Yang, 2009 ), and users can define these knowledge types when they add relationship tags. Once a user connects a tag with an article, the semantic tagging module combines the tag with the content. Then the content management module inserts them into the resource database.

In addition to adding semantic tags, the semantic tagging module supports tag modification and deletion. Every resource on the system has semantic tags that are collaboratively defined by the users. Users can add new classes, individuals, or rela-tionships to the ontology if they cannot find appropriate semantic tags. The system initiates the ontology management mod-ule that assists users in editing the ontology. Besides, the system provides two semantic search mechanisms: triple-pattern search and visual search, both based on the semantic tags and the ontology. 3.2. Triple-pattern search
A triple-pattern search helps users search for resources by specifying subjects, predicates (relationships), and objects. This mechanism returns all content that involves matching the semantic tags to the specified pattern. Fig. 4 illustrates the inter-face of a triple-pattern search. 3.2.1. Searching resources about concepts or individuals
When a user searches for content about a certain concept or individual, s/he can type the term of the concept or individual in the  X  X  X ubject X  or  X  X  X bject X  field in the search interface and then execute the search. If a user wants to search for content about electronic commerce, for example, the search is executed in the following steps: 1. The user keys in the word  X  X  X lectronic Commerce X  in either the  X  X  X ubject X  or  X  X  X bject X  field and then execute the search. 2. The semantic analysis module analyzes the ontology to find all concepts and individuals that belong to the concept  X  X  X lec-tronic Commerce. X  For instance, the system is able to understand that the concepts  X  X  X 2B, X   X  X  X 2C, X  and  X  X  X 2C X  all represent kinds of electronic commerce, provided the ontology has described these subsumption relationships.
 3. The triple-pattern search module searches for content tagged as  X  X  X lectronic Commerce, X   X  X  X 2B, X   X  X  X 2C, X   X  X  X 2C, X  and other electronic-commerce-related concepts and individuals from the resource database. It then returns the results to the user. 3.2.2. Searching resources about relationships
When a user searches for content about a certain relationship, s/he can search by inputting the terms for the subject, property, and object respectively into the search interface. For example, consider a user who inputs the following query about  X  X  X uman use Information Technology, X  specifying all fields: Subject: Human, Predicate: Use, Object: Information Technol-ogy. The semantic analysis module analyzes the ontology and finds all the concepts, relationships, and individuals that be-long to  X  X  X uman, X   X  X  X se, X  and  X  X  X nformation Technology X , respectively. Then, the triple-pattern search module checks all possible combinations of concepts, individuals, and relationships, searches for the content associated with the related tags, and returns them to the user.

Users can also use the special character  X  X ? X  to generalize their search. For example, consider a user who issues the fol-lowing query, in which the object field is generalized by giving the character  X  X ? X : Subject: Human, Predicate: Use, Object: ?.
In this case, the user does not know or does not restrict which concepts or individuals have the  X  X  X se X  relationship with  X  X  X uman. X  The semantic analysis module analyzes the ontology and finds all the concepts and relationships that belong to  X  X  X uman X  and  X  X  X se, X  respectively. The module also finds which concepts or individuals possess the  X  X  X se X  relationship with  X  X  X uman. X  Then, the triple-pattern search module checks for all possible combinations, searches for the content with the re-lated tags, and returns the result to the user.

In addition to generalizing a subject or an object, a user can generalize a predicate. For example, consider a user who issues the following query in which the predicate field is generalized by giving the character  X  X ? X : Subject: Human, Predi-cate: ?, Object: Information Technology. In this case, the user does not know or restricts certain relationships between  X  X  X uman X  and  X  X  X nformation Technology. X  The semantic analysis module analyzes the ontology and finds all concepts and individuals belonging to  X  X  X uman X  and  X  X  X nformation Technology, X  respectively, and finds all the relationships among them. Then, the triple-pattern search module searches for the content with the related tags and returns the result to the user. 3.3. Visual search
To simplify triple-pattern searches and make it easier for users to employ a semantic search mechanism, the visual search module generates a concept map, a visual depiction of the ontology that enables users to search for resources by clicking on nodes or links on the map. Essentially, this visual search mechanism can be treated as a knowledge map that enables users to easily capture domain knowledge and find appropriate knowledge resources. Fig. 5 is the interface of a visual search that is also a concept map of the ontology. Users can drag, zoom in, or zoom out the map, and they control the number of hops. The following subsections introduce how the visual search works. 3.3.1. Searching resources about concepts or individuals
When a user searches for content about a certain concept or individual, s/he can click the node in the knowledge map and then the visual search module executes the search. If a user wants to search for contents about electronic commerce, for in-stance, the search is executed in the following steps: 1. The user clicks the  X  X  X lectronic Commerce X  node in the knowledge map and then the visual search module executes the search. 2. The semantic analysis module analyzes the ontology to find all concepts and individuals that belong to the concept  X  X  X lec-tronic Commerce. X  3. The visual search module searches for content tagged  X  X  X lectronic Commerce, X   X  X  X 2B, X   X  X  X 2C, X   X  X  X 2C, X  and for other elec-tronic-commerce-related concepts and individuals from the resource database, and then returns the result to the user. 3.3.2. Searching resources about relationships
When a user searches for content about a certain relationship, s/he can click the link in the knowledge map and then the visual search module executes the search. If a user wants to search for content about  X  X  X uman use Information Technology, X  for example, this search is executed in the following steps: 1. The user clicks the  X  X  X uman X  node with the right button of the mouse and then the tip  X  X  X how the relationships X  shows up (see Fig. 6 a). When the user clicks this tip, the knowledge map about relationships with  X  X  X uman X  is displayed (see
Fig. 6 b). 2. When the user clicks the link  X  X  X se X  between  X  X  X uman X  and  X  X  X nformation Technology, X  the semantic analysis module ana-lyzes the ontology to find all concepts, relationships, and individuals that belong to  X  X  X uman, X   X  X  X se, X  and  X  X  X nformation
Technology, X  respectively. 3. The visual search module searches for content with the related tags from the resource database and then returns the result to the user. 4. Experimental design
The proposed semantic social tagging system comprises a tagging mechanism and two searching mechanisms. This study compared their performance with that of traditional keyword tagging and searching mechanisms in terms of perceived use-fulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) posits that individuals X  behavioral intention to use a technology is determined by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use ( Davis, 1989 ). Moreover, perceived ease of use may be an antecedent of perceived usefulness. Perceived enjoyment is a system characteristic determining perceived ease of use ( Venkatesh, 2000 ). The Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3) posits that perceived enjoyment directly influences perceived ease of use and indirectly influences behavioral intention ( Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008 ). Some research has found that perceived enjoyment can directly affect intention to use an infor-tions, the precisions and recalls of the searching methods were investigated.

A field experiment was conducted and the experimental procedure can be described as follows: 1. Knowledge sharing and tagging: Two classes of graduate students who took the Management Information Systems (MIS) course used this system to share their knowledge. The students were asked to write reports on academic papers in the
MIS field and to tag these reports using both keyword tagging and semantic tagging. These articles with tags were shared on the students X  blogs (see Fig. 7 ). 2. Knowledge searching: The students were asked to search for these reports using three search mechanisms: keyword search, triple-pattern search, and visual search. They could search for any topics they wanted to read about. 3. Data collection: The students participated in the course throughout a semester to complete the field experiment. At the end of the course, they filled out a questionnaire (see Appendix A ) for measuring the perceived usefulness of, the per-ceived ease of use of, the perceived enjoyment of, and the intention to use the two tagging mechanisms and three search-ing mechanisms. The item wordings were based on other items representing TAM3 constructs ( Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008 ).
The items were answered using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicated more positive responses. 4. Data analysis: Since the sample size was limited due to the field setting, we decided to analyze data through Partial Least
Squares (PLS). PLS is a latent structural equation modeling technique that utilizes a component-based approach and has many advantages over traditional structural equation model. It has been argued in the literature that the PLS approach requires fewer distributional assumptions about the data (e.g., Cassel, Hackl, &amp; Westlund 1999; Wold, 1982 ) and works
Joreskog, 1982 ). When analyzing data through PLS with bootstrap algorithm ( Bollen &amp; Stine, 1992 ), small sample size as twenty are acceptable as well ( Chin &amp; Newsted, 1999; Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1993 ). Moreover, PLS regression can be used as an exploratory analysis tool to select suitable predictor variables and to identify outliers before classical linear regression.
It remains better at handling formative constructs ( Petter, Straub, &amp; Rai 2007 ). Besides, repeated-measure ANOVAs were used to examine whether the tagging and searching mechanisms differentially predicted perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use. 5. Experimental results
We collected data on 192 reports and 48 questionnaires from 48 graduate students. We adopted SPSS 18.0 and SmartPLS processes of data analysis. The PLS approach to structural equation analysis was used to analyze both the measurement model and structural model. The measurement model in PLS is assessed by item loadings and internal consistency, as well as the convergent and discriminant validity. The results shows values of Cronbach X  X  alpha are 0.874 or higher. All factor load-ings are higher than the suggested 0.50 ( Rivard, 1988 ), and load significantly higher on their own respective constructs than on other constructs in the model. The values of composite reliability are 0.923 or greater than required threshold of 0.70 1981; Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998 ). The correlations are lower than Kline X  X  (1998) suggested criterion as 0.85, and the square root of every AVE are larger than any correlation among any pair of latent constructs. Since the main purpose of this paper is not proposing and verifying a developed theoretical model, detailed data of confirmatory factor analysis are available upon request. Thus, the results indicate that reliability, discriminant and convergent validity of the measures are reasonable. 5.1. Analysis of the tagging mechanisms
Results of the repeated-measures ANOVA on perceived usefulness of, perceived ease of use of, perceived enjoyment of, and intention to use the two tagging mechanisms are listed in Table 2 . The users perceived that the keyword tagging mech-anism is more useful, easy, and enjoyable than the semantic tagging mechanism, and therefore they had higher intention to use the keyword tagging mechanism.

In order to understand the influences between these indicators, a PLS analysis was then executed based on the TAM3 mod-el. Since each subject evaluated two tagging mechanisms, there were 96 cases used for PLS analysis. The structural model in
PLS is assessed by examining the path coefficients. T statistics are computed to evaluate the significance of these path coef-
Table 3 . Use of the keyword tagging mechanism was selected as a reference variable for the dummy variable semantic tagging used . The overall model is illustrated in Fig. 8 . Approximately 50.7% of the variance in usage intention was explained.
The result shows that the key problem of the semantic tagging mechanism is that the users felt that the semantic tagging mechanism was harder to use and this perception diminished the perceived usefulness and further decreased their intention to use it. The users cannot intuitively specify semantic tags, because they had to define the relationships of these tags with other tags in the ontology in advance. The user responded that  X  X  When I define a tag in the ontology I need to think for a long tic tags is complicated and not easy . X 
The users indicated advantages of the semantic tagging, they said  X  X  X emantic tags make me clearly understand the mean-ings conveyed by articles, X   X  X  X he tag ontology gives me an overall concept about information management, X  and  X  X  X  can clearly understand the relationships between concepts. X  We checked all the keyword tags and semantic tags used by the students.
We found that these keyword tags had problems involving synonyms and term variation. For example, the tags  X  X  X RP X  and  X  X  X nterprise Resource Planning X  actually have the same meaning. When one uses these tags to search for content by a key-word searching mechanism, the search results are different. Comparatively, the students defined the semantic tags  X  X  X RP X  and  X  X  X nterprise Resource Planning X  as having an equivalence relationship by using the ontology management module. When we use one of these tags to search for content by a semantic searching mechanism, the search results are the same, because the semantic searching mechanisms are able to understand the meaning of these concepts, according to the user-defined ontology. In addition to equivalence relationships, semantic tagging can define hierarchical relationships and other arbitrary relationships. For instance, the students defined  X  X  X nterprise Resource Planning X  as a type of  X  X  X nformation Management, X  and  X  X  X rganization X  may  X  X  X ntroduce X   X  X  X nterprise Resource Planning. X  However, these relationships cannot be defined using the keyword tagging mechanism because all the tags are independent. 5.2. Analysis of the searching mechanisms
To evaluate the effectiveness of the searching mechanisms, we measured their precisions and recalls by searching for con-tents with the tags  X  X  X nformation Management, X   X  X  X lectronic Commerce, X   X  X  X ecision Support, X   X  X  X nowledge Management, X  and  X  X  X nterprise Resource Planning. X  We chose these tags because they were the main topics in the course. Their synonyms were also considered, because a keyword search cannot understand their relationships. Precision is the number of relevant doc-uments retrieved by a search divided by the total number of documents retrieved by that search. Recall is the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the total number of existing relevant documents. The precisions and recalls associated with the keyword searching and semantic searching mechanisms were evaluated by the instructor, and the results are listed in Table 4 . The results indicate that the semantic searching mechanism is able to improve precision and particularly recall, and therefore it is more effective than keyword search.

The repeated-measures ANOVA results on perceived usefulness of, perceived ease of use of, perceived enjoyment of, and intention to use the keyword, triple-pattern, and visual search mechanisms are listed in Table 5 . The results reveal that the perceived usefulness of the visual search was significantly higher than that of the keyword search. The students thought that the visual search mechanism was useful and that its search results were more accurate, complete, and relevant than those of knowledge resources through a visualized graph . X 
The results indicate that these three search mechanisms are significantly different in terms of perceived ease of use. Pair-wise comparisons indicate that the users considered the triple-pattern search to be harder to use than the other two search-ing mechanisms. The reason is that users need to specify three fields when searching for articles about relationships. They said  X  X  I need to specify many words before a search , X  and  X  X  The operation is more complicated and requires more thought and effort . X  These three search mechanisms differ significantly in terms of perceived enjoyment. The pairwise comparisons indi-cate that the users enjoyed the visual search more than the other two searches. The reason is that they can have much fun esting, and provides me with an overview of the ontology that can help me search for what I need . X  Furthermore, these three search mechanisms are significantly different in terms of intention to use. The pairwise comparisons indicate that the users had greater intention to use the visual and keyword search mechanisms than the triple-pattern search mechanism.
A PLS analysis was then conducted based on the TAM3 model. Because each subject evaluated three searching mecha-nisms 144 cases were used for this analysis. The path coefficients are listed in Table 6 . The dummy variables triple-pattern search used and visual search used are 1 or 0 to indicate whether or not the search mechanism was used. The overall model is illustrated in Fig. 9 .

The results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment positively influenced intention to use a searching mechanism. There are 54.8% of the variance in usage intention was explained. Although the re-peated-measures ANOVA did not reveal that the perceived usefulness of the triple-pattern search is significantly higher than that of the keyword search, the PLS analysis shows that use of the triple-pattern search significantly and positively affected perceived usefulness. The users responded that triple-pattern searches  X  X  help me find more accurate knowledge contents , X  and fect on perceived ease of use indirectly decreases its perceived usefulness.

The results of the repeated-measures ANOVAs show that the visual search yielded higher ratings of usefulness, ease of use, and enjoyment. The PLS analysis discloses that the main effect from use of the visual search was enjoyment and further increased perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The visual search and triple-pattern searches use the same search-ing algorithm, except for the interfaces. They also give the same search results when one initiates the same search. We can infer that the enjoyment comes from surfing the visualized knowledge map, and that enjoyment made users feel more easy and useful than triple-pattern search. Additionally, the knowledge map assisted the users in capturing overall concept about the knowledge domain and executing a search conveniently, which also enhanced ease of use and usefulness of visual search.
In summary, a semantic search supported by semantic tagging and ontology is more useful than a traditional keyword search in terms of precision, recall, perceived accuracy, completeness, and relevancy. A visualized knowledge map can pro-vide lots of fun to users and make them feel that the searching mechanism is easy to use and helps them reach more useful content. 5.3. Analysis of the social tagging systems
A social tagging system is composed of a tagging mechanism and a searching mechanism. The keyword search was sup-ported by keyword tagging, and the triple-pattern and visual searches were supported by semantic tagging. Therefore, three categories of social tagging systems could be formed: the KT + KS system is the system integrating the keyword tagging mechanism with the keyword searching mechanism, the ST + TPS system is the system integrating the semantic tagging mechanism with the triple-pattern searching mechanism, and the ST + VS system is the system integrating the semantic tag-ging mechanism with the visual searching mechanism. The students X  perceptions about these three systems were calculated by summing the perceptions of the component mechanisms.

The repeated-measures ANOVA results on the perceived usefulness of, perceived ease of use of, perceived enjoyment of, and intention to use these three social tagging systems are listed in Table 7 . The results indicate that these three systems are not significantly different in perceived usefulness. The ST + TPS system is hardest to use and the KT + KS system is easiest to use. The users enjoyed using the ST + VS system more than the other two systems and had the highest intention to use the KT + KS system and had the least intention to use the ST + TPS system.

In summary, the users can perceive the usefulness of semantic social tagging but it is harder to use than keyword-based social tagging and make the users have lower intention to use semantic social tagging. The visual searching mechanism is able to increase perceived enjoyment, usefulness, and to relieve the difficulty in searching, however, the users had to define relationships between semantic tags when using the semantic tagging mechanism and this work required more cognitive effort. On the other hand, the KT + KS system enabled users to tag and search intuitively without much thought and therefore they were willing to keep using this system.
 6. Conclusions
This study developed a semantic social tagging mechanism and two semantic searching mechanisms. The semantic tag-ging provides tags from a user-defined ontology that can be employed when tagging content. The social tagging system is able to understand the meanings of the tags according to the ontology. Semantic searching mechanisms take advantage of semantic tagging and consider tag meanings. The triple-pattern searching mechanism enables users to search for content by defining the subject, predicate, and object. The visual searching mechanism enables users to search for content by clicking on concept nodes or relationship links in the visualized knowledge map.

A field study was conducted in a knowledge sharing context to investigate the effectiveness and user perceptions of the proposed mechanisms. The results show that semantic tagging is more effective than keyword-based tagging. The semantic tagging mechanism solves the vague-meaning problem of keyword tagging and enhances users X  understanding of content meanings. Additionally, the semantic searching mechanisms supported by the semantic tagging mechanism are able to achieve greater precision and recall. This research also considered users X  perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and enjoy-ment, as well as intention to use, according to the TAM3 model. Responses on the above variables reveal that perceived use-fulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment positively influenced intention to use a social tagging system.
Integrating semantic tagging with visual search can achieve the greatest perceived enjoyment. The traditional keyword tag-ging combined with a keyword search has the advantage of ease of use, so users do not need to exert much thought to tag or search for content. The interesting finding is that even though a semantic tagging system is more effective than a keyword-based tagging system, the users had higher intention to use the keyword-based tagging system than a semantic tagging sys-tem. The reason is that the semantic tagging mechanism required the users to define tag relationships and the users had to spend more cognitive effort to figure out appropriate tags when tagging, which made semantic tagging harder to use and decreased the users X  intention to use it.

The implications of this study are listed as follows: 1. Semantic social tagging is useful for knowledge sharing: Defining relationships between tags can help knowledge sharers express their knowledge more explicitly and further improve the quality of the content search. However, the process of setting semantic tags is more complicated than keyword tagging and needs more thought. How to design a user-friendly semantic tagging mechanism that makes users feel at ease using it should be addressed in future research. A possible solution is building and adjusting ontology automatically and recommending appropriate tags to users by using text min-ing techniques. 2. A knowledge map can improve the quality of content retrievals. A visualized ontology helps knowledge seekers capture an overview of the knowledge domain and reduce the cognitive effort needed to specify appropriate concepts or relation-ships for the search. Semantic social tagging enables a knowledge management system to automatically generate a knowledge map. In addition to enhancing the quality of the search results, a visual search makes users feel at ease, obtain more enjoyment, and have a higher intention to use. 3. A social tagging system should consider not only usefulness, but also the user X  X  experience. Although semantic technology is able to improve the quality of a content search, users will not use a semantic social tagging system if they feel that the system is not easy to use or cannot provide enjoyment. A system designer must pay attention to all aspects of the user X  X  interaction with the system.

Some research limitations should be mentioned. Smaller size of subjects participated in the experiment and only one knowledge domain, MIS, was considered that may diminish the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, all items in the questionnaire are positive statements and an acquiescent or extreme response bias may occur in the results. Appendix A. The questionnaire A.1.
