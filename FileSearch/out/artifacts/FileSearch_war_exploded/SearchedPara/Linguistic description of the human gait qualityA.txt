 1. Introduction
Human beings describe phenomena in our environment using natural language (NL). In order to perform this task, we interpret the available data using our experience in both, namely, the field of knowledge that allow us to recognize the phenomena and our experience on using NL.

Our research line deals with the design and development of a new family of computational systems capable of generating linguistic descriptions of complex phenomena, i.e., these compu-tational systems obtain data from a phenomenon and provide linguistic descriptions that are relevant for specific users in specific contexts. This type of systems will be used in supervision and control applications and especially in the development of user interfaces based on the use of NL.

Human gait is a quasi-periodic phenomenon which is defined as the interval between two successive events (usually heel contact) of the same foot ( Begg et al., 2007 ). This process is characterized by a stance phase (that approximately takes 60% of the total gait cycle), where at least one foot is in contact with the ground, and a swing phase (approximately 40% of the total gait cycle), during which one limb swings through the next heel contact. Gait phases can be quite different between individuals but when normalized to a percentage of the gait cycle they maintain close similarity, indicating the absence of disorders ( Perry, 1992 ). Fig. 1 shows two different synchronized pictures.
The top picture plots a sketch of a person representing the different phases of the gait with the right limb boldfaced. The picture at the bottom represents the time period from one event (usually initial contact) of one foot to the subsequent occurrence of initial contact of the same foot.
 which requires precise coordination of the neural and musculos-keletal system to ensure correct skeletal dynamics ( Winter, 1990 ), its analysis can help in the diagnosis and treatment of walking and movement disorders, identification of balance factors, and assessment of clinical gait interventions and rehabilitation pro-grams ( Hamacher et al., 2011 ; Lai et al., 2009 ; Moustakidis et al., 2010 ; Sant X  X nna et al., 2011 ; Wren et al., 2011 ).
 obtained by means of different measurement techniques. Most gait parameters can be categorized as anthropometric data which include height, weight, or limb length; spatiotemporal data comprising variables such as walking speed, step length, or phases time span; kinematic data of measurements of joint angles, displacement, or acceleration along axes; kinetic data variables including foot force and torques; or electromyographic data which measures the muscle activation levels.
 human gait kinematic data are the computer vision approach ( Tafazzoli and Safabakhsh, 2010 ) and the sensor-based one. The main advantage of the computer vision approach is the avoidance of placing sensors on the user X  X  body. However, an expensive and complex system for capturing images is needed. Moreover, these methods usually work in lab but fail in real world scenarios due to clutter, variable light intensity and contrast. On the other hand, the sensor-based approach consists of using small sensors (usually accelerometers) placed in the body of the person. This solution provides a smart solution to the problem of capturing the signal, where data can be obtained anywhere by means of a smartphone. Moreover, they can be used in the dark and provide three-dimensional data. This line of research has attracted an important number of researchers that focus the problem of human gait modeling from different perspectives (see, e.g., Alaqtash et al., 2011 ; Najafi et al., 2003 ).
 Our approach is based on the Computational Theory of
Perceptions (CTP). This field was introduced in the Zadeh X  X  (1999) seminal paper  X  X  X rom computing with numbers to comput-ing with words  X  from manipulation of measurements to manip-ulation of perceptions X  X  and further developed in subsequent papers. CTP provides a framework to develop computational systems with the capacity of computing with the meaning of NL expressions, i.e., with the capacity of computing with imprecise descriptions of the world in a similar way that humans do it. In
CTP, a granule is a clump of elements which are drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity or functionality ( Zadeh, 1979 ). The boundary of a granule is fuzzy. Fuzziness of granules allow us to model the way in which human concepts are formed, organized and manipulated in an environment of impre-cision, uncertainty, and partial truth ( Zadeh, 1997 ). A granule underlies the concept of a linguistic variable ( Zadeh, 2008 ). A linguistic variable is a variable whose values are words or sentences in NL ( Zadeh, 1975a , b , c ).

In this paper, we do an extensive use of our previous research, contributing to the human gait quality analysis field by providing a new technique for modeling this type of phenomenon. We have developed a computational application that uses a single three-axial accelerometer to generate linguistic descriptions for assessing the human quality. Here, we develop upon our previous research on the
Granular Linguistic Model of a Phenomenon (GLMP) improving its expressiveness by introducing a new type of components based on the concept of Fuzzy Finite State Machine (FFSM). First, we identify the relevant phases of the gait based on the accelerations produced during the process. Once the phases are recognized, we use two relevant features of the human gait (homogeneity and symmetry) to evaluate the gait quality corresponding to a specific person. Finally, we develop a method for producing a linguistic report about the quality of the gait in terms of the homogeneity and the symmetry. This type of reports could be used to analyze the evolution of the human gait, e.g., after a recovery treatment and also for preventing falls in elderly people.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the main concepts of our approach to linguistic descrip-tion of complex phenomena evolving in time. Section 3 describes how to use these concepts for the linguistic description of the human gait quality. Section 4 describes the experimentation carried out, by describing the experimental setup and discussing the results. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and introduces some future research works. 2. Linguistic description of phenomena evolving in time
Our approach to computational model of phenomena is based on subjective perceptions of a domain expert that we call the designer. The more experienced designer, with better under-standing and use of NL in the application domain, the richer the model with more possibilities of achieving and responding to final users X  needs and expectations. The designer uses the resources of the computer, e.g., sensors, to acquire data about a phenomenon and uses her/his own experience to interpret these data and to create a model of the phenomenon. Then the designer uses the resources of the computer to produce the linguistic utterances.
In this section, we introduce the components of the GLMP, our approach based on CTP for developing computational systems able to generate linguistic descriptions of phenomena ( Alvarez-Alvarez et al., 2011a ; Eciolaza and Trivino, 2011 ; Mendez-Nunez and Trivino, 2010 ; Trivino et al., 2010b ). 2.1. Computational perception (CP)
A CP is the computational model of a unit of information acquired by the designer about the phenomenon to be modeled. In general, CP s correspond to particular details of the phenom-enon at certain degrees of granularity. A CP is a couple ( A , W ) where:
W  X  X  w 1 , w 2 , ... , w n  X  is a vector of validity degrees w 2.2. Perception mapping (PM)
We use PM s to create and aggregate CP s. There are many types of PM s and this paper explores several of them and contributes to where:
U is a vector of input CP s, U  X  X  u 1 , u 2 , ... , u n  X  , where y is the output CP , y  X  X  A y , W y  X  . g is an aggregation function employed to calculate the
T is a text generation algorithm that allows generating the 9 2.3. Granular Linguistic Model of a Phenomenon
The GLMP consists of a network of PM s. Each PM receives a set of input CP s and transmits upwards an output CP . We say that each output CP is explained by the PM using a set of input CP s. In the network, each CP covers specific aspects of the phenomenon with certain degree of granularity. Fig. 2 shows an example of a
GLMP. In this example, the phenomenon can be described at a very basic level in terms of three variables providing values z , and z 3 respectively at a certain instant of time.

Using different aggregation functions and different linguistic expressions, the GLMP paradigm allows the designer to model computationally her/his perceptions. In the case of Fig. 2 , other two higher-level descriptions of the phenomenon are provided.
These descriptions are given in the form of computational perceptions CP 4 and CP 5 . The second order perception mappings (2-PM s) PM 4 and PM 5 indicate that CP 4 and CP 5 can be explained
CP 4 and CP 5 is explained by those of CP 1 , CP 2 , and CP 3 top-order description of the phenomenon is provided, at the highest level of abstraction, by CP 6 , explained by PM 6 of CP 4 and CP 5 . Notice that, using this structure, one can provide not only a linguistic description of the phenomenon at a certain level, but also an explanation in terms of linguistic expressions at a lower level. 2.4. Report generation are used to calculate the weights corresponding to potentially hundreds of linguistic expressions. Now, the challenge consists of choosing the more adequate combination of these sentences to generate a useful linguistic description of the phenomenon evolu-tion including the current state. The design of this report requires a deep analysis of the application domain of language and, therefore, the collaboration of the specific final user.

Here, we are focused on a demonstration of concept that can be solved with a simple report. For this first version of our human gait report generator, we will choose the linguistic expressions with the highest validity degree and we will include detailed explanations of a perception using the conjunction  X  X  X ecause X  X . 3. Linguistic description of the human gait quality
Fig. 3 shows the GLMP designed for the linguistic description of the human gait quality. The grey speech bubbles show different examples of linguistic expressions associated to several CP s.
We use the dorso-ventral acceleration ( a x ) and the antero-posterior acceleration ( a y ) to identify the relevant phases of the human gait. Then, using the information provided by the human gait phases, we analyze the homogeneity and the symmetry of each phase based on the dorso-ventral acceleration ( a x ) during each phase. Finally we use the total homogeneity and symmetry of the gait to obtain its quality. In the following subsections, we explain the different PM s and related CP s in the model.
It is worth remarking that the trapezoidal membership func-tions and the sets of rules used below were designed empirically after an important experimental effort. Nevertheless, in order to apply this model in practice, these parameters should be tuned according with the criteria of the specific final user. Moreover, we must say the same regarding with the definition of the most suitable set of sentences for describing each CP . 3.1. Dorso-ventral acceleration perception mapping ( PM a
It is a 1-PM whose input is the numerical value of the dorso-ventral acceleration ( a x A R ) that is normalized by subtracting its average.

The output CP y a x includes the following set of NL sentences: a a a the aggregation function g a x , which uses a set of trapezoidal membership functions, i.e., to obtain these validity degrees from the input variable a x , we fuzzify the numerical values using three linguistic labels which consist of uniformly distributed trapezoi-dal membership functions: f L a x , M a x , H a x g , where L are linguistic terms representing low, medium, and high respec-tively in such a way that validity degrees are directly w
L  X  a 3.2. Antero-posterior acceleration perception mapping ( PM
This 1-PM is similar to PM a x . It has the numerical value of the a is also normalized by subtracting its average value.

The output CP y a z includes the following set of NL sentences: a a a from trapezoidal membership functions: w 1 a z  X  L a z  X  a
M  X  a 3.3. Gait phase perception mapping (PM phase )
This 2-PM has two 1-CP s as inputs: the dorso-ventral accel-eration and the antero-posterior acceleration. Therefore, the set of input CP sis U  X  X  u a x , u a z  X  .

According to the diagram of Fig. 1 and using our own knowl-edge about the process, we define four different phases which explain when double limb support, reference limb single support, or opposite limb single support are produced. Therefore, the output CP y phase identifies different four gait phases having the following set of four possible sentences: a 1 phase - X  X  The current gait phase is double limb support after the reference limb swing phase  X  X  a 2 phase - X  X  The current gait phase is reference limb single support and swing phase of the opposite limb  X  X  a 3 phase - X  X  The current gait phase is double limb support after the opposite limb swing phase  X  X  a 4 phase - X  X  The current gait phase is opposite limb single support and swing phase of the reference limb  X  X 
The aggregation function ( g phase ) calculates, at each time instant, the next value of the validity degrees for each sentence based on the previous validity degrees and current input CP s. The aggregation function is, therefore, an expert knowledge based FFSM. In a previous work, we have used a model of the human gait based on a FFSM to recognize the gait pattern of a specific person ( Trivino et al., 2010a ). Our model differs significantly from others, e.g., based on machine learning techniques, because we use a linguistic model to represent the subjective designer X  X  perceptions of the human gait process. This model is easily understood and does not require high computational cost. Never-theless, there exists the possibility of making use of an automatic machine learning technique to tune the elements of the FFSM as explained in Alvarez-Alvarez et al. (in press) .

Due to the characteristics of the human gait as a quasi-periodic process, there are eight fuzzy rules in total in the system, four rules to remain in each phase and other four to change between phases. We chose the phase 1 as the initial phase, i.e., the sentence  X  X  The current gait phase is double limb support after the reference limb swing phase  X  X  will initially have a validity degree of 1. In this way, the FFSM will synchronize with the gait, without the need of doing previous segmentation of the signal, when the conditions to be in that phase are fulfilled. We defined the conditions over the input CP s to remain in a state or to change between states by combining the information obtained from the sensors and the available expert knowledge about the human gait. The rule base of g phase is as follows: Where
The first term in the antecedent computes the previous validity degree of the sentence a i phase , i.e., w i phase mechanism, we only allow the FFSM to change from the phase i to the phase j (or to remain in phase i , when i  X  j ). For example, in R 11 , it is computed the validity degree of the sentence  X  X  The current gait phase is double limb support after the reference limb swing phase  X  X  ( w 1 phase  X  .

The second term in the antecedent describes the constraints imposed on the dorso-ventral acceleration input CP ( u a x
It computes the validity degree of one or two of the three possible sentences that this CP has, e.g.,  X  X  the dorso-ventral acceleration is low  X  X  ( w 1 a x  X  .

The third term in the antecedent describes the constraints imposed on the antero-posterior acceleration input CP ( u computes the validity degrees of one or two of the three possible sentences that this CP has, e.g.,  X  X  the antero-posterior acceleration is low or medium  X  X  ( w 1 a z OR w 2 a z  X  .
The fourth term in the antecedent describes the conditions that constrain the phases duration. To control this duration, we define two linguistic labels for each phase i : T stay the maximum time that the phase i is expected to lasts) and lasts before changing to phase j ). For example, in R 11 ,we calculate the membership degree of d 1 to the linguistic label
T stay , where d 1 is the time that w 1 phase 4 0. Fig. 4 shows an example of the linguistic labels T stay 1 and T change the temporal constraints of phase 1. In agreement with our knowledge about the typical human gait cycle, we assign to each phase a duration according to its percentage of the gait period T , which is calculated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ( Brigham and Morrow, 1967 ) over the antero-posterior acceleration ( a z ).

Finally, the consequent of the rule defines the next phase. To calculate the validity degrees of the sentences associated with each phase j ( w j of each rule R ij ( f ij ) is computed as defined in Eq. (1): where f ij is calculated using the minimum for the AND operator and the bounded sum of  X  ukasiewicz ( Alsina et al., 2006 ) for the OR operator.

Note that each rule of this set is, therefore, a complete linguistic expression as can be seen in the following expanded expression of the rule R 11 to remain in phase 1:  X  X  If the previous gait phase is double limb support after the reference limb swing phase , and the dorso-ventral acceleration is low , and the antero-posterior acceleration is low or medium , and it is time to remain in this phase. Then , the current gait phase is double limb support after the reference limb swing phase  X  X .

As an example of the performance of our proposal for human gait modeling, Fig. 5 represents the validity degrees of each sentence together with the dorso-ventral acceleration input vari-able ( u a x ) and the antero-posterior acceleration input variable ( u z ). It shows how this set of fuzzy rules is able to model linguistically the four phases of the human gait.

It is worth noting that this is an especial type of PM , which is applied here for the first time, i.e, in this paper, we contribute to this research field by combining both of our previous results, namely, GLMP and FFSM. The interested reader could see our previous papers on FFSM for a more detailed description of this paradigm and its applications ( Alvarez-Alvarez et al., 2010 , 2011b , in press ; Trivino et al., 2010a ). 3.4. Dorso-ventral acceleration during each gait phase perception mapping ( PM ^ a x ) level). Its output CP is calculated for each gait cycle instead of being calculated at each time instant. As can be seen in Fig. 3 ,it has two CP s as inputs: the dorso-ventral acceleration and the gait phase, i.e., U  X  X  u a x , u phase  X  .
 by Eq. (2), which merges the validity degrees of the input CP sat 0 0.5 1  X 0.2 each time instant t during the total duration T of each cycle k : w  X  k  X  3.5. Symmetry of the phases perception mapping ( PM S 13 , PM
In Fig. 3 , we can see that these PM s are on an upper level of granularity (complete gait level) compared to the previous one because their output CP s are calculated for a complete gait instead of being calculated for each gait cycle. These PM s have the dorso-ventral acceleration during each gait phase as input CP . Therefore, by comparing the movement of both legs. We can analyze the symmetry during the double limb support phases by comparing the dorso-ventral acceleration during phases 1 and 3, or during the swing phases by comparing the dorso-ventral acceleration during phases 2 and 4. Each PM has a set of three NL sentences as output CP , e.g., the output CP of PM S 13 ( y S set of NL sentences: a low  X  X  a medium  X  X  a high  X  X 
The validity degrees ( w 1 S of the aggregation function g S which is defined using Eq. (3), in order to compare the dorso-ventral acceleration of the different limbs during the same gait phase
J  X  x , y  X  X  First, we calculate three similarities for each gait cycle k :
The similarity between the validity degrees of the sentences a ventral acceleration during these phases.

The similarity between the validity degrees of the sentences a dorso-ventral acceleration during these phases.

The similarity between the validity degrees of the sentences a ventral acceleration during these phases.

Then, we calculate the average value of the three similarities by means of Eq. (4), which gives us a value of the symmetry during the phases 1 and 3 ( symmetry 13  X  k ) for each gait cycle k :
Once we have a complete set of symmetry values during the total number of available cycles ( symmetry 13  X  , we apply the ordered weighted averaging operator (OWA) ( Dubois and Prade, 1985 ; Yager, 1988 ) showed in Eq. (5), over the lowest three values of symmetry 13 in order to obtain a conservative symmetry value which ensures that the gait symmetry is low when any of the steps is not symmetric during phases 1 and 3
Finally, the validity degrees of the NL sentences associated to the output CP y S use of the trapezoidal membership functions showed in Fig. 6 . These membership functions convert the numerical value of symmetry 0 13 A  X  0 ; 1 into three fuzzy linguistic values (low, med-ium, and high) w
S 13  X  low  X  symmetry w
S 13  X  medium  X  symmetry w
S 13  X  high  X  symmetry
In the same way, the output CP of PM S 24 ( y S following set of NL sentences:
Whose validity degrees ( w 1 S similar way to the ones associated to the output CP y S we obtain a complete set of symmetry values during the total number of available cycles ( symmetry 24 ) using the Jaccard index as showed in Eq. (4), then we apply the OWA operator to get the value symmetry 0 24 , and finally the validity degrees are calculated using Eqs. (9) X (11) w
S 24  X  low  X  symmetry w
S 24  X  medium  X  symmetry w
S 24  X  high  X  symmetry 3.6. Homogeneity of the phases perception mapping ( PM H 1
These PM s, as the previous ones, are on an upper level of granularity (complete gait level) because their output CP sare calculated for a complete gait and they also have the dorso-ventral acceleration during each gait phase as input CP .Therefore,thesetof input CP sis U  X  X  u ^ a x  X  . The homogeneity of a gait is obtained by comparing a gait with itself in subsequent instants of time and it is calculated for each phase using two consecutive gait cycles. Each PM has a set of three NL sentences as output CP , e.g., the output CP of 0 0.5 1 PM
H 1 ( y H 1 ) includes the following set of NL sentences: reference limb swing phase is low  X  X  reference limb swing phase is medium  X  X  reference limb swing phase is high  X  X 
The validity degrees ( w 1 H the aggregation function g H explained for PM S 13 and PM S 24 , however, there is an important difference: while in the previous PM s we are comparing the dorso-ventral acceleration during phases 1 and 3 or during phases 2 and 4 for each gait cycle k , here, we compare the dorso-ventral acceleration of a single phase i during the current gait cycle k and the previous one k 1. Therefore, we calculate three similarities for each gait cycle k (starting in the second gait cycle):
The similarity between the validity degrees of the sentences eration during phase 1 in the current gait cycle ( k ) and the previous one ( k 1  X  .

The similarity between the validity degrees of the sentences acceleration during phase 1 in the current gait cycle ( k ) and the previous one ( k 1  X  .

The similarity between the validity degrees of the sentences acceleration during phase 1 in the current gait cycle ( k ) and the previous one ( k 1).

Then, we calculate the average value of the three similarities by means of Eq. (12), which gives us a value of the homogeneity of the phase 1 ( homogeneity 1  X  k ) for each gait cycle k homogeneity 1  X  k
Once we have a complete set of homogeneity values of phase 1 during the total number of available cycles ( homogeneity we apply the OWA operator over the lowest three values of homo-geneity 1 in order to obtain a conservative homogeneity value of the phase 1 as showed in Eq. (13)
Finally, the validity degrees of the NL sentences associated to the output CP y H use of the trapezoidal membership functions shown in Fig. 6 w
H 1  X  low  X  homogeneity w
H 1  X  medium  X  homogeneity w
H 1  X  high  X  homogeneity
The rest of PM s, have the output CP s y H include NL sentences expressing if the homogeneity is low, medium, or high during each gait phase. Their aggregation functions work similar to g H acceleration during each single phase, then they get an homogeneity value of the complete gait for each phase using the OWA operator, and finally this value is qualified as low, medium and high using the trapezoidal membership functions. 3.7. Symmetry of the gait perception mapping (PM S ) double limb support phases and the symmetry during the swing phases. Therefore, the set of input CP sis U  X  X  u S 13 , u includes a set of three NL sentences in its output CP ( y calculates the average value of each pair of validity degrees of the input CP s associated with a low, medium, and high symmetry 3.8. Homogeneity of the gait perception mapping (PM H ) the four phases. Therefore, the set of input CP sis output CP ( y H ) calculates the average value of the four validity degrees of the input CP s associated with a low, medium, and high homogeneity 3.9. Quality of the gait perception mapping (PM Q ) homogeneity of the gait. Therefore, the set of input CP sis low, low, medium, high, and very high. Therefore, the output CP y Q has the following set of five possible sentences: fuzzy rule-based system, with one rule for each sentence:
The consequents of the rules define the gait quality. To calculate the validity degrees of the sentences associated with the different levels of gait quality ( w i Q ), a weighted average using the firing degree of each rule R i ( f i )iscomputedasdefinedinEq.(19) w  X 
Each rule of this set is a complete linguistic expression as can be seen in the following expanded expression of the rule R predicts a high value of the gait quality:  X  X  If the gait symmetry is medium and the gait homogeneity is high , or if the gait symmetry is 4. Experimentation
In this section, we present the experimental results obtained with our proposal. First, Section 4.1 presents the experimental setup, which includes the data acquisition details. Then, the next subsection shows and discusses the obtained results for different people X  X  gait and different gaits of the same person. 4.1. Experimental setup
The data acquisition was done using a sensor device including a three-axial accelerometer and Bluetooth communication cap-abilities. It was attached to a belt, centered in the back of each person providing measurements of the three orthogonal accel-erations with a frequency of 100 Hz. We programmed a personal digital agenda (PDA) to receive the data via a Bluetooth connec-tion and to record it with a timestamp. Therefore, every record time, a x is the dorso-ventral acceleration, a y is the medio-lateral acceleration, and a z is the antero-posterior acceleration. As explained in Section 3 , in this work we only use a x and a asked each person to walk a certain distance at a self-selected walking speed which comprises around 10 complete gait cycles.
This process was repeated 10 times for each person producing a total of 10 datasets for each person.

To evaluate the proposed approach, we collected the acceleration signals of a set of 17 different people in order to assess the gait quality of each person. One set of people consisted of 15 healthy adults, 3 women and 12 men, with ages ranging between 23 and 51 years (with an average age of 30 years) and weights between 45 and 95 kg (with an average of 74 kg). The remaining two individuals have different lesions that modify their gait quality.
The first injured person was a 28 years old man with a weight of 88 kg that was not previously in our database. He suffered a medial malleolus (which is the prominence on the inner side of the ankle) fracture in the left limb. After that, he was undergo under parallel screw fixation of the medial malleolus surgery, and followed a rehab treatment during one and half months. We only had two gait data sets obtained after one month of rehab treatment and when this treatment was finished.

The other injured individual was a 39 years old man with a weight of 93 kg whose gaits were in our database as a healthy individual for another study only related to gait modeling ( Alvarez-Alvarez et al., in press ), but one month after capturing his data he that, he was undergo under a meniscus removal (meniscectomy) using arthroscopic surgery, and followed a rehab treatment during onemonth.Therefore,wehaveacompletedatabaseofdifferent gaits of this person that will show the gait quality evolution. 4.2. Results and discussion
This section presents the results obtained for each person. It shows the different summaries obtained about the gait quality of the people. We have divided the results into three parts: first, the results related to healthy people are showed; second, we analyze the obtained sentences related to the person injured in his ankle; and finally, we focus on the gait quality evolution of the man injured in his knee by comparing his healthy gaits versus the gait data obtained after the lesion. 4.2.1. Healthy people
Table 1 shows the validity degrees of the sentences associated with the gait qualities of the 15 healthy individuals. Those validity degrees whose value is the maximum for each attribute are boldfaced. Therefore, the generated sentences are those ones which have the maximum validity degrees as can be seen in the following examples:  X  X  X he gait quality of person 2 is very high because the gait symmetry is high and the gait homogeneity is high X  X .  X  X  X he gait quality of person 6 is medium because the gait symmetry is medium and the gait homogeneity is medium X  X .  X  X  X he gait quality of person 15 is high because the gait symmetry is medium and the gait homogeneity is high X  X .
It can be clearly seen how the quality of these gaits is always medium or greater than medium, being high for six people and very high for two people.
 4.2.2. Man injured in his ankle
Table 2 shows the validity degrees of the sentences associated with the gait quality of the man injured in his ankle. As explained above, the generated sentences are those ones which have the maximum validity degrees. Thanks to the hierarchical fashion of the GLMP, the final recipient of the report can choose the granularity level which better fits to her/his desired detail. In this case, the report not only details the quality, symmetry and homogeneity of the gait but also details the symmetry and homogeneity during each gait phase  X  X  X fter 30 days of rehab treatment, the gait quality of this person is low because the gait symmetry is low and the gait homogeneity is medium. The gait symmetry is medium because the symmetry during the double limb support phase is low and the symmetry during the swing phase is low. The gait homogeneity is medium because the homogeneity during the double limb support after the reference limb swing phase is medium, the homogeneity during the reference limb single support and swing phase of the opposite limb is medium, the homogeneity during the double limb support after the oppo-site limb swing phase is low, and the homogeneity during the opposite limb single support and swing phase of the reference limb is medium X  X .  X  X  X fter 45 days of rehab treatment, the gait quality of this person is medium because the gait symmetry is medium and the gait homogeneity is medium. The gait symmetry is 4.2.3. Man injured in his knee associated with the gait quality of the man injured in his knee. In this case, we have three different situations: one set of gaits before after the knee lesion (columns three, four, and five), and different gait sets after the surgery (columns six and seven). The short versions of the reports (without the details about symmetry and homogeneity during each gait phase) are listed as follows: quality before this lesion, which drastically was reduced after the lesion. Our proposal is able to identify correctly the gait quality during these different phases.
 directly describe the main details for each gait quality level in each period of time. For example, the gait quality is high 195 days after the knee lesion and 151 days after the surgery, but the homogeneity during the second phase (reference limb single support and swing phase of the opposite limb) is medium in contrast with the gaits obtained before the knee lesion (where it was high). This can be explained at the gait cycle level (see Fig. 3 )byanalyzingthe sentences related to the dorso-ventral acceleration during each gait dorso-ventral acceleration is low during the reference limb single support and swing phase of the opposite limb  X  X  ( w 12 ^ a x some cycles while during another cy cles are greater than zero, thus reducing the homogeneity of the gait during this phase. Therefore, we can produce a linguistic expression that explains the causes at support and swing phase of the opposite limb is medium because the dorso-ventral acceleration during this phase sometimes is low while other times is not  X  X . 5. Conclusions and future works project aimed to develop computational systems able to generate linguistic descriptions of complex phenomena. Here, we have used the human gait as an interesting example of complex phenomenon evolving in time. We have shown that the new version of GLMP including a FFSM is an expressive tool to represent the behavior of this type of phenomena in a human friendly way.

In the current stage of developme nt, we have generated linguistic descriptions that correspond to the context of a laboratory experi-mental setup. In future projects, we will deep into two important fields, namely, Linguistics in order to improve the generated texts, and the specific application field, in order to improve the meaning and, therefore, the usability of these texts. We will deal with applying these results to generate NL expressions in the context of specific applications, e.g., to assess the risk of falling in elderly people and to monitor the recovery process in physiotherapy.
The main contribution of this paper is the practical result of a user friendly model of the human gait. Moreover, this is an example of other possible linguistic models of complex quasi-periodic phenomena, e.g., other biological cycles such as the breath rhythm or the electrocardiogram signals, or artificial cycles such as the ones produced during the manufacturing processes of many products. In this paper, we show results that demonstrate the feasibility of these future projects.
