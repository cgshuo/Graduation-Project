 Data mining research along with related fields such as databases and information retrieval poses challenging problem s, especially for doctoral students. The research spreads over a variety of topics such as text mining, semantic web, multilingual inf ormation analysis, heterogeneous data management, database l earning, digital libraries and more. Much of this research c uts across multiple fields and presents interesting issues for discussion at conferences with a confluence of several tracks. Th e ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management provides an excellent environment for presenting such resear ch problems spanning the three tracks of database systems, info rmation retrieval and knowledge management. This article pr ovides an overview of the dissertation problems presented at a Ph.D. workshop in the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management. The goal of such workshops is to allow students to showcase their creative ideas at an ear ly stage. This enables experts to critique their work and also giv es the students an opportunity to exchange their thoughts with each other, besides providing excellent networking opportunities with i ndustry and academia. This article provides an overview of the papers presented at the Ph.D workshop. It serves as a moti vation for researchers to delve deeper into the innovative dis sertation problems summarized here and the related work in th ese areas. Dissertation problems, Ph.D. forum, interdisciplina ry work, knowledge discovery, database management, web techn ology This article serves as a short review paper describ ing the doctoral research issues that formed the content of PIKM 200 8, the 2 Ph.D. Workshop on Information and Knowledge Managem ent. This was in held conjunction with ACM CIKM 2008, th e Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, at Napa Valley, CA, USA in October 2008. The PIKM 2008 work shop served as a good forum for doctoral candidates in d atabase systems, information retrieval and knowledge manage ment to present their early work and get feedback from expe rienced researchers. This workshop was built on the success of the PIKM 2007 workshop, the first in the series, held along with ACM CIKM 2007 (at Lisbon, Portugal in November 2007). The PIKM 2008 call for papers attracted 29 sub missions from 13 countries across Asia, Europe, and North America . The program committee accepted 17 high quality submissi ons of which 10 were full papers and another 7 were poster papers, covering a vast range of topics spanning database s ystems, text mining, semantic web, social networks, and human co mputer interaction (HCI). The program committee comprised 22 experts fro m across 7 countries, maintaining a good balance of academia, research labs and the corporate world. The program committee memb ers along with the external reviewers put in tremendous effor ts and it was gratifying to see such high quality reviews, consid ering the relatively short reviewing time frame of approximat ely 2 weeks. The workshop did indeed serve its purpose of p roviding the participants with worthwhile feedback, and enabled the sharing of ideas with fellow students and researchers from aro und the world. It is hoped that this workshop will encourag e many more of its kind, and that it will further enhance resea rch across multiple tracks. This article outlines the technical contributi ons of the Ph.D. workshop in the form of the research problems prese nted along with their proposed solutions and pilot evaluations . Therefore, it encompasses challenging doctoral research issues in the areas of data mining, databases and information retrieval to day that would be of interest to a fairly broad audience in indust ry and academia. The dissertation research problems presented at the workshop are described in the following three sections on Data M ining, Databases and Information Retrieval respectively. A lthough there are overlapping research issues in many of these pa pers, they are divided into these categories based on their primar y contributions to the respective areas. A text mining issue pertaining to topic models for text related applications was discussed by Ha Thuc et al. [HS-08 ]. They covered text models such as aspect model or LDA. Th ey discovered limitations of scalability issues in run ning the models in mining large corpora and the inability to model the important concept of relevance which prevents the models from being directly applied for text classification. To overco me these limitations, they introduced a one-scan topic model requiring only a single pass over a corpus for inference and also proposed relevance-based topic models that provided better r esults than state-of-the-art models. The problem of concept search in discovering k nowledge from non-English and non-European sources was discussed by Riaz [R-08]. Urdu was chosen as an example language beca use of its unique nature, morphology and a large number of spe akers. Named-entity identification was considered to be us eful in determining the knowledge being sought by the user. A TREC like evaluation criteria was presented with relevan ce judgments, test collection and appropriate queries for knowled ge discovery. 
Wu [W-08] reported the results of database learning i n human computer interaction (HCI) errors. Earlier studies on HCI errors focused on improving the system performance. This w ork proposed an approach to identify the nature of HCI errors in interactions from the user perspective. It analyzed error episodes, recovery trials, and recovery actions, suggesting s ystematic methods for error recovery by users in different ca ses. Pilot studies corroborated the usefulness of the proposed approach. In the work of [AI-08] the areas of clustering was addressed along with the concept of term frequency -inverse document frequency, i.e., tf-idf. In this paper, a technique was proposed based on integrating models to enhance performance in querying and mining data from spontaneous speech. The propos ed technique clustered the training topics using tf-id f properties, selecting the best models for each cluster. For tes t data, the topic cluster was found and a combination of models for t his cluster was used. It was found to improve performance as co mpared to earlier methods in the area. Song et al. [WSWA-08] dealt with an NP-complete problem in the area of social network mining, proposing a 2-st ep method for community detection. This involved first analyzing vertex similarity of the network (a microscopic view) and putting a pair of vertices into the same community if they were si milar; followed by incrementing modularity of the similarity-based communities. If the number of edges between 2 communities was gr eater than an expected number based on random choice, the comm unities were merged. They tested their method on over 20 da ta sets and did better than existing algorithms. Knowledge management with respect to navigatin g humanities resources was the focus of [Sh-08]. They emphasize d that in the humanities, events and narratives though important, are not identified and disambiguated by most knowledge orga nization systems; and that the digitization of artifact coll ections and development of digital metadata make it imperative to address this issue. They described their research on gazetteers to depict such events; along with the relationships and best pract ices to use the gazetteers for improving digital resources and serv ices.
 A decision support problem pertaining to onlin e communities in social network mining was discussed in the work of Smith [Sm-08]. Online communities are connecting hordes of in dividuals that generate rich social network data. The social capit al residing in these networks is by far unknown and needs to be di scovered. This work proposed to create a mathematical model o f social capital to incorporate mobilization of social resou rces. It involved evaluating nodes based on their relationships and a ttributes, and also on their social resources. The result was a qu antitative model for characterizing and providing decision support o n how to maximize participation within social networks A SQL database system to solve constraints was disc ussed in [SW-08]. It involved integrating constraint satisfa ction problems (CSP) with databases using the structured query lan guage SQL. A case study was presented on developing such a syste m. Their SQL-based constraint data engine (SCDE) supported k ey concepts of "consql", with additional syntax to better align CSP admin with regular SQL. Testing on ACC Basketball Scheduling s howed the feasibility of SCDE. Ongoing work included building an environment for end-users to progam and debug CSPs; providing a more interactive database engine for objective fu nctions; and improving the performance of hard constraint proble ms. In [JX-08], the problem addressed was the priv acy-preserving integration of distributed heterogeneous data. Man y applications have huge volumes of data in distributed databases collected over time or produced by large scale scientific experime nts. Such data sharing is subject to confidentiality of individual s and institutions. Accordingly, this work proposed a distributed anony mization protocol for independent data providers to develop a virtual anonymized database given horizontally partitioned databases, and a secure query protocol for clients to query vi rtual databases. It also proposed distributed data integration archi tecture for querying heterogeneous and private databases. Haapasalo et al. [HJSS-08] presented the datab ase management problem of concurrency control and recov ery given multiversion database structures They proposed the design and implementation of many multiversion index structure s with complete concurrency-control along with ARIES-based recovery algorithms. Their experiments involved a multiversi on B + historical storage, to which committed transaction updates were moved one by one from a separate B + tree. They also considered using an optimized R-tree to store the multiversion data as 2-D line segments. They implemented a standard B + tree based solution to store different versions of a data item consecut ively; along with a solution based on the existing time-split B + tree. They concluded that the solution with a multiversion B + tree was the most efficient. This work won the best paper award in the Ph.D. wor kshop. An extended cooperative transaction paradigm f or the XML data model was proposed in [GS-08]. In certain area s, e.g., design or media production, authors cooperate on projects and a common data format for communication is XML. This paper ad dressed the special needs of working together on shared XML gra ph structures considering early visibility of updates, multi-directional information flow, and parallel tasks. Since state-o f-the-art transaction models were not found suitable, they pr esented a new model incorporating multi-level transactions and dy namic actions to meets the special needs. Their model was found a dvantageous in terms of providing appropriate concepts for tran saction synchronization and resolution of conflicts. The issue of advanced properties in ontology m apping for web databases was addressed by Stoutenberg in [St-08]. Ontologies support many applications today, such as enhanced s earch, rapid enterprise integration and cross-domain data sharin g. Most state-of-the-art approaches map the ontologies using simi larity and equivalence and very few apply knowledge in upper o ntologies. This work developed algorithms to acquire relations hips between ontological components beyond similarity and equiva lence which encompass hyponymy. It also built algorithms to map ontologies based on relationships specified within ontologies. Their initial test results looked promising with potential for fu rther work on ontology mapping in the web database area. An important information retrieval issue related to folksnomy systems formed the focus of Abel  X  X  work [A-08]. With the advent of Web 2.0, various folksonomy systems such as Flic kr and del.icio.us have become popular, allowing users to annotate resources, e.g., images and websites with freely ch osen keywords, i.e., tags. The evolving set of such tag assignment s, generally user-tag-resource bindings, are called folksonomies . This work analyzed the benefit of additional semantics in fol ksonomy systems. The GroupMe! folksonomy system was presen ted which brought additional semantics to tagging systems ena bling the grouping of resources. The work introduced group-se nsitive ranking algorithms that were better than existing o nes. GroupMe! also contributed towards closing the gap between th e social and the semantic web. GroupMe! data was stored as RDF a nd provided based on principles of Linked Data. An arc hitecture was developed to bridge between folksonomies and ontolo gies using the MOAT (Meaning Of A Tag) framework. 
Ingawale [I-08] addressed a Wikipedia related issue. They noted that explanations for 'altruistic' contributo r tendencies considering the positivistic paradigm, with roots i n organizational psychology, though heavily researched, are not tran sferable to quantitative models of predictive value, with refer ence to Wikipedia metrics. They also pointed out that the m odels using aggregated top-level relationships between Wikipedi a entities face the following problem: they assume relationships be tween entities as inputs to the process, not as emergent phenomena that evolving with the output. They argued for an agent based mod el of Wikipedia. The main contribution of their work was a diagnostic and/or prescriptive tool for decision makers in org anizations using or planning to use Knowledge Management Systems. Brauer et al. [BLD-08] addressed the problem o f mapping enterprise entities to text segments. In recent ye ars, important business information is stored in unstructured form ats such as documents and emails. Consider the fact that docume nts shared among business partners store information on transa ctions (purchases, invoices etc.). It is challenging to ap propriately identify and associate real-world entities in unstr uctured data with those in structured data e.g., enterprise databases . To solve this problem, Brauer et al. proposed a robust process me thodology with 3 phases: extracting entities from documents, generating entity mapping of with structured data, and disambi guating mappings to discover relationships from the enterpr ise data and the documents' structure.
 In [SU-08], the subject of digital libraries w as approached. The aim of this research was to find the networks of '' academic community'' in digital libraries by using different tools and metrics from social network analysis. This study wa s expected to detect the figureheads responsible for shaping the multi-disciplinary community of digital libraries. It als o exposed the factors pertaining to the networking of academic co mmunities. The authors indicated that the application of socia l network analysis techniques to trace linkages among communi ty members was innovative and hoped that it would be useful in providing insight into the shaping of a community.
 A web information retrieval problem related to imprecise regions formed the work of Pasley [P-08]. An overvi ew of their research was presented in terms of defining impreci se regions such as "The Midlands" of Great Britain. They prop osed using unstructured data sources found on the web to addre ss this issue. A literature review was conducted on such regions a nd the experimental plan was developed accordingly. Their study showed the results of 2 fundamental experiments. On e of them was on geo-tagging, while the other was on geograph ic coverage on the web. The results looked promising and encour aged further work on this important information retrieval issue. This article summarizes the major contributions of PIKM 2008, the 2 nd Ph.D. workshop in CIKM. The Ph.D. workshop was a grand success. It served as a good forum for exchan ge of thoughts and ideas among doctoral students at an early stage of their dissertation. This workshop emerged even more succe ssful than its predecessor PIKM 2007, in terms of the quality and quantity of submissions as judged from the reviews. PIKM 2008 a lso included a poster session in addition to oral prese ntations in order to give more students an opportunity to present the ir work in a rather short span of time. The best paper award was presented to Tuukka K. Haapasalo , Ibrahim Jaluta , Seppo Sippu , and ljas Soisalon-Soininen for their paper on  X  X oncurrency control and recovery for mult iversion database structures X . The presentation of the best paper award served as a motivation for enhancing their research as well as encouraging other students to be more competitive i n executing their research and presenting it at such events. It indicated that the workshop meets the quality standards of leading con ferences where such accolades are given. The cutting edge research ideas presented at th is Ph.D workshop provided the scope for further research in the respective areas, especially in working towards interdisciplin ary problems across the various tracks. It is sincerely hoped th at we will have more such workshops and doctoral consortia for pres entation of dissertation research at international conferences with a good blend of industry and academia.
