 room for improvement in this aspect in machine transition (MT) (Bhattacharyya, as Google Translate and Baidu Translate, as demonstrated by the following example . 
The source text is a Chinese article from Yah oo News ( Yahoo, 2016) . Due to Figure 1. English translations by Google and Baidu are shown in Figure 2 and 3.
 There are several problems in the translation s. (2) Loss of the intended meaning of a word. For example, in the first sentence of A post -edited version of the translation by Google is presented in Figur e 4 . 
In the follow ing sections, we will introduce Yes Translate, a Chinese -English translation tool aiming to be maximally loyal to the meanings of the source text while maintaining adequate fluency, and be free from the above -mentioned problems. The purpose is to build a Chinese -English bidirectional machine translation ( MT ) tool for general purpose s. We selected English and Chinese because we are more familiar on the Web . Their Internet users are 872,950,266 and 704,484,396 respectively , followed by a large gap before the 3th-place Spanish with 256,787,878 users . We are work ing on Chinese -to-English translation first because a large Chinese -English dictionary of over 110,000 words and phrases is available ( Zhang, Li and Lun, 2015).
Keeping source text meanings in machine translation is implementable by avoiding risky actions of word deleting, adding and re -ordering, and by employing more reliable methods. 
Every word in the source text will be taken into considera tion , not ignored without function of the space in the Chinese title is kept as a mark between two phrases . the example of word  X   X  X  , in addition to  X  X hould X  ,  X  X ccept X  is added to the  X  X rrive X . However, on corpus  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  each word (translation unit). And if the context is also considered, the correctness rate may be further improved. For example, word  X   X   X  has two frequent ly used functions action" . From the Chinese corpus, we can see that i f  X   X   X  is followed by a v erb then followed by a noun phrase. For example,  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  will be while Google Translate output "The meal" (  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) and "will eat rice." (  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) . That means optimization can be achieved using big data and other resources. 
Addition of words or letters with non -intended meaning should be avoided . For the article, or add an  X  X  X  at the end of  X  X roplet  X  in the last sentence . 
Movement of words is not allowed when it may incorrectly change the meaning of the water drop has caused the sea become different. X ,  X  X ook 12 Syrian refugees back may require different expressions . For example , Chinese word  X   X  X  X   X  is often translated to  X  X fter X  in English. Phrase  X 3  X  X  X  X   X  is translated into  X  X fter 3 years X . It involves moving word  X  X  X  (after ) to the front of 3  X  (3 years), which may be risky for the computer if 3  X  is re placed by a more complicated phrase. If the word is kept in its original position , then  X 3  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  (after 3 years I went to UK) X  will be or add a comma after  X  X fter X , then  X  3  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  will be translated into  X 3 years later I went to UK X  ,  X 3 years afterwa rds I went to UK X  or  X 3 years after, I went to UK X  , all can convey the correct meaning without words movement.

The output text may be more similar to the source text in word order, however that does not prevent passing the correct meanings to the target language, as shown by the feasibility of simultaneous interpretation and sight translatio n. original text. Starting from the beginning of a sentence, the computer will repeat two processing stages: (1) Select the next translation element in the source text. He re we employ the (2) Select a translation of the element in the target language . If there are more than 
There are three levels of goals: translation honest ly keeping all its meanings (be understandable) to its readers in the target language. 3.1 Implementation accessibility. The initial state is shown in Figure 5 . To translate a text from Chinese to English or vice visa, simply type or paste it in the Simplified Chinese, English -to-Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese to English, mode . 
Internally, Yes Translate has four components: the Chinese -English dictionary ( or called translation memory), the English -Chinese dictionary (translation memory), the translation engine and the user interface.
 developed from the latest version of YES -CEDICT (Z hang and Li, 2016), which includ es over 116,000 word entries, covering the following (except a small number of characters not displayable on the computer): Other references include the Oxford Chinese Dictionary (Kleeman and Yu, 2010), ABC Chinese -English Comprehensive Dictionary (DeFrancis, 2003) , the List of Frequent ly-used Words of Modern Chinese (in frequency order, National Language Commission of China , 2008) , big da ta (such as corpora on the Web), Google Translate, Baidu Translate as well as our working experienc es. Chinese, translation in English and linguistic labels , and the entries are sorted by the length of the Chinese words de scendingly. Linguistic labels include marks of part of speech, time, voice, plurality, et c, 
If a word has multiple meanings (or translations ), the mean ing s are sorted according to their frequency of use. F or example, in CC -CEDICT , Chinese word  X  X  X  frequency order is / dissatisfied/discontented /resentful/. Hence, the frequency order is adopted.

Some translations are added to the existing words in the dictionary for MT purpose . For example, Chinese word  X  X  is often translated to  X  X nly  X  referring to the only condition for something to happen, such as  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  ( We will succeed only by working hard) . W e have added the possible phrasal meaning of  X  only have  X , such as in  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  .  X  (W e only have one earth.) a simple way: the initial letter of a word is capitalized if it is preceded by a next line (/n) or a full stop (.) character.

No repeating English translation will appear in the option list. For example, to look after the variant words of  X  and  X  in traditional Chinese -to-English translation , there are inside  X   X  inside  X   X  lining  X   X  lining  X   X  among the entries of simplified Chinese  X  in the Chinese -English dictionary. In simplified Chinese to English translation. only inside  X  lining  X  will appear in the optional list.
 separate paper. 3.2 Improvement Substantial improvement of the software has been achieved by continuous tests on real -life Chinese texts. In the recent months, we have used Yes Translate to translate the complete government work report by Premier Li Keqing (2016), some paragraphs Hong Kong and other places on Google, Baidu, BBC, VOA, etc. Weak points of translation revealed by the tests are carefully analyzed and effectively solved.
For example, Yes Translate used to translate Chinese word  X  into English  X  X andle X  or  X  X old X , while in real life, it is most frequently used as a preposition in the  X   X  +O+V X  expressions (with particle  X  marking the beginning of an object noun phrase followed by the verb phrase), which are very common in Chinese but not used the boundaries of the following noun phrase or the verb phrase, which is more likely to happen when the object is long. F or inst ance, Google Translate translates:  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  into a mess of  X  The man went back to Hong Kong to Beijing. X  into an  X  X +V X  marker, avoiding movement of the object NP. A much better translation is generated for the pervious sentence:  X  (object+vt:) Go (to) Beijing ('s) people bring back to Hong Kong. X  boundary between  X  X eople X  and  X  X ring X . Word  X  can be processed in a similar way option list.  X  X f X ,  X  X hat X ,  X  X  X  X  etc. in English. For instance,  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (the office of our teacher) , and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X he book that I will read X . Both  X  X f X  and  X  X hat X  involve movement of the attributive, which can be risky. Translation with  X  X  X  X  follows the same word order of Chinese. And  X  X  X  X  is not limited to express possession, e.g.,  X  a master's degree X ,  X  X lock sb.'s path X ,  X  X ew Year's Day X ,  X  X  second sentence may no t sound grammatically correct, but its meaning is more accurate than Google  X  X  t ranslat ion:  X  I am going to read the book  X . Yes Translate is on the Web for testing. The initial results are very encouraging. 4.1 Translation of the pope X  X  news article reprinted here. Comparing with the translation of Google and Baidu, the meanings of the source text the reader to select. For example, the word  X  X hould X  in the first sentence is obviously inconsistent with the context. When clicked, it will present  X  should, answer, accepted, into a noun form , as shown in Figure 7 . number of g rammar errors still exist. 4.2 Evaluation by student s questionnaire. The results are summarized in Table 1.

The accuracy of the translation is quite exciting. Of all the 10 students , 7 agree and understandable. The average mark is (7*4+3*5 )/10= 4.3 , of a full mark of 5 . And 9 out of the 10 students agree or strongly agree that t he general meaning of each sentence is grammar and writing , though t he marks may be lower if we changed  X  X K X  into  X  X ood X  in questions 3 and 4. Finally all students agree or strongly agree that t he tool is useful , with an impressive average mark of 4.7 . 4.3 Evaluation by the computer A small -scaled evaluation in BLEU and NIST has been performed on Asiya -Online (http://asiya.lsi.upc.edu/demo/asiya_online.php ). Data for the source and 27, 2016 (on http://www.voachinese.com/z/2404.html ). There are totally 1,722 Table 2 presents the BLEU and NIST values of system translations by Google Translate, Baidu Translate and Y es Translate.

The BLEU and NIST values of Yes are mu ch lower than Google and Baidu. And all three systems score less than 50% of the full marks of BLEU (1) and NIST (10). Possible reasons include
Yes Translate is still very young. Formal development of the software started less than 7 months ago . There is large room for improve ment . 
As a matter of fact, there are excellent translations which have been scored unbelievably low BLEU and NIST marks. For instance, the Bible in B asic English on However, according to our experiment on Asiya -Online with the King James Version version is 0.4565, below half the full mark of 1. Translate is a Chinese -English translation tool to be maximally loyal to the source text while maintaining adequate fluency. In an experiment on 10 students with good meani ng of the Englis h translation by Yes Transl ate wa s correct and understandable. each sentence wa s correct. 
Other important feature s of Yes Translate are its effective suppor t to post -editing, and the client -side work mode . That means no continuous connection to the server is required . The size of the whole website is 12.6MB , very handy for a machine translation system . with out accurate meanings. The mistakes are mostly caused by incorrect word segmentation, for example,  X  X  /  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (One sheet (of paper) manpower size ('s) test paper) , /  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  X  ( Reasonable theory aspect ),  X  X  X  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (International creditor's rights (law) direction Greece provide more ('s) aid funds).
  X  X /c X  in the dictionary. F or example , both  X   X  X  X  , manpower  X  and  X   X  X  X  , human hand s X  are included . example, the error segmentation of /  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  X  can be avoided by adding phrase  X   X  X  X  X  , in theo ry X  to the translation dictionary. Unfortunately, there are too many words starting with  X  which may follow  X  , including  X  X  X  X  ...,  X  X  X  X  ...,  X  X  X   X  ..., etc. And the ambiguous chain can be longer than two words , e.g. /  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  /  X  [/  X  /  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  / ]. 
It seems more cost -effective to delete entry  X  X  X  from the dictionary. Then  X  X  X  are too popular to delete , e.g.,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  , in spite of the existence of expressions like  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  .

A better method is to further improve word segmenta tion . For example, we can take advantage of the feature that , comparing with  X   X  X  X  (ten seconds/marks) X  ,  X   X  X  X  (very ) X  is more likely to be followed by an adj ective or adv erb . Another method is to combine forward word segmentation processing and ba ckward processing, and m ark the inconsistent parts for post-editing choices. But that will slow down the translation substantially . However, word segmentation can never be 100% correct (Zhang and Sun, 2012). English, but that will take a very long period of time . Yes Translate is already capable to process word-segmented text . For example,  X   X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  is translated to  X  X t PolyU campus  X . Another aspect for further improvement is grammar and fluency of the output . Grammar errors are mainly caused by the lack of physical marks in the Chinese due to the limited time we have been working on this project.

We will continue to improve Yes Tran slate o n real -life texts, especially daily news system heavily relies on improvement of the dictionary.
 Work is now focused on the Chinese -English part. The next step is to improve English-Chinese machine translation .
