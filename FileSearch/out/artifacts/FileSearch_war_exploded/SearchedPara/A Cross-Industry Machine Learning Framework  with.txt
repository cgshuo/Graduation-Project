 At Nara Logics, we provide recommendations for ecommerce, supply chain, financial services, travel &amp; hospitality, operations and more for the Global 200. We've learned that for machine intelligence to be accepted, it must interact seamlessly with humans, expose its reasoning to humans, and even incorporate human feedback in real time into its decision making. Just as you take your friends X  recommendations more seriously when you can probe their mental model of your likes and dislikes, machine recommendations are more appealing when users understand how they were generated and can provide feedback to those recommendations. These aspects are necessary as commercial interfaces increasingly leverage recommendations alongside statistical analysis. In this talk, I will discuss a new general purpose framework,  X  X ynaptic intelligence X  , for learning and maintaining explicit representations in real-time. This framework can be used both to make recommendations and to explain why each recommendation was made to meet the objectives outlined. We will also discuss how we extend our technology to enable users to have meaningful interactions where they X  X e able to find what they X  X e looking for. We believe in developing recommendation technology that facilitates a conversation with the user. The examples we showcase will demonstrate how we are able to leverage an explicit representation to make this possible. One key to unlocking this type of interaction is in building and maintaining an explicit representation of relevant aspects of the items considered for recommendation and their features. We have integrated an explicit representation into our model which allows our clients (and customers of our clients) to interact with our recommendations in a way that they otherwise wouldn X  X  have been able to do. While content-based recommenders and other explicit models have fallen out of favor due to their inability to perform competitively against models that use latent features, we provide additional motivation for the inclusion of content metadata through hybrid recommenders. By maintaining explicit representations, we are able to introspect: to explain why those items and not other items are at the top of the list. This is a fundamental feature that enables users to make decisions with confidence. This feature is particularly helpful when trying to understand the behavior of models that are trained with different or new data. Using data contained in explicit representations, we can ensure that the results are grounded in facts and observations that are relevant for a particular domain. We can even provide new recommendations with feedback from the user on the  X  X hys X .
 Explicit representations also give users the ability to adjust their priorities dynamically. For instance, a user searching for a restaurant might see that their recommendations tend toward one particular cuisine. An explicit representation allows them to say:  X  X  X  X  feeling adventurous tonight! Give me recommendations where cuisine isn X  X  a factor. X  T his can also form the basis for natural conversational recommender systems. Unlike a typical conversational recommender system, which is essentially a rote preference elicitation mechanism and/or a tree-based rules engine, this conversational recommender system allows users to react to the specific reasons we produced recommendations and audit our representation of their preferences. This talk will demonstrate that maintaining an explicit representation bestows benefits on a recommendation system beyond accuracy: explicit representations are what will make the system accessible to users. recommendations; synaptic intelligence; explicit representation
