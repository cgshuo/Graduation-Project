 Cluster analysis has recently become a hig hly hot topic in data mining research; it has been widely used in numerous applications, including data analysis, pat-tern recognition and image processing and so on. Up to now, many cluster-ing algorithms have been already proposed, such as k -means,CURE[2],DB-SCAN[3],CLIQUE[4] and so on. Boundary points are data points that are lo-cated at the margin of densely distributed data such as a cluster, while noises are located in the sparsely populated areas. Sometimes, boundary points are more useful and important in data mining applications because they represent a subset of population that possibly straddles two or more classes. For example, this set of points may denote a subset of population that should have developed certain diseases, but somehow they do not [1]. Special attention should be cer-tainly warranted for this set of people since they may reveal some interesting characteristics of the disease. The knowledge of these points is also useful for data mining tasks such as classification since these points can be potentially misclassified. Boundary points analysis is so important in knowledge discovery, but there are few algorithms about it. Boundary points analysis, however, hasn X  X  received much attention as that o f clustering and outliers. DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm, and defines boundary points based on density. If a point p is not a core point and it X  X  directly density-reachable from a core point o , then the point p is called a boundary point and is added to the cluster that point o lies in. Because DBSCAN uses global density pa-rameter, the definition of boundary points is close related to Minpts ,thatis to say, we may get different boundary points if different parameter Minpts is used. What X  X  more, the density of each cluster in the dataset is not uniform. The central density of clusters is high while the density in the border of clusters is low. Therefore it is hard to detect boundary points effectively according to the definition of boundary points in DBSCAN.

A grid-based boundary points processing technique is proposed in reference [5,6], which uses restricted k nearest nei ghbors and concept of relative density to recognize boundary points of clusters. The case that boundary points are located in lower density cell is merely discussed in those papers, but how to detect all the boundary points of clusters is not mentioned.

Xia et al. propose a boundary points detecting algorithm BORDER[1] which employs the special property of the reverse k -nearest neighbors, and give the formal definition of boundary points. If an object p is one of the k -nearest neigh-bors of object o ,then o is called a reverse k -nearest neighbor of p .BORDER computes the reverse k -nearest neighbor number of each object in the first place, then data points are sorted according to their reverse k -nearest neighbor number incrementally, then select the top n objects as boundary points, because bound-ary points have smaller reverse k -nearest neighbor number than that of points in clusters. BORDER can detect boundary points effectively in datasets without noises. However, it still has some disadvantages: (1) The top n objects selected after sorting all the data points according to their reverse k -nearest neighbor number incrementally contain both outliers and boundary points in noisy dat-sets, since outliers have smaller reverse k -nearest neighbor number than that of boundary points in noisy datasets. Therefore BORDER can X  X  correctly de-tect boundary points in noisy datasets. (2) The time complexity of BORDER is O( kN 2 )( N is the size of dataset) which leads to BORDER has low efficiency. (3) Given the dataset, it is hard for the users to estimate the size of boundary points n .

This paper proposes a boundary points detecting algorithm BRIM(a effi-cient Boundary points detecting algorithm)aiming at the disadvantages of the algorithms mentioned above, which makes use of distribution feature of Eps -neighborhood of boundary points. BRIM can detect boundary points in noisy datasets containing different shapes and s izes clusters effectively, and has higher efficiency and accura cy than BORDER. We will give some related definitions used in our algorithm BRIM: Definition 1. A boundary point p is an object that satisfies the following con-ditions[1]: (1)Itiswithinadenseregion R 1 . (2)  X  region R 2 near p ,density( R 1 ) density( R 2 )ordensity( R 1 ) density( R 2 ). Definition 2. Given the dataset D, the Eps-neighborhood of a point p ,denoted by N Eps ( p ) , is defined by[2] : dist( p, q ) denotes the distance between two points p , q .
 Definition 3. The density attractor of a point p .Ifapoint o satisfies following attracted by o and o is density attractor of point p, denoted by Attractor(p). In fact the density attractor of point p is the point with maximal density in its Eps -neighborhood N Eps ( p ). For example in Fig.1. o is the density attractor of point p . Here we need to point out: (1) If there is no other points in N Eps ( p )ex-cept for p itself, obviously p is a noise point, then we define the density attractor of p is p itself and let the boundary degree of p equals to minimal value. (2) If there are several density attractor in N Eps ( p ), then the point that is searched first in N Eps ( p ) is selected as the density attractor of point p . Definition 4. Supposed o is the density attractor of a point p, the positive Eps-neighborhood of a point p, denoted by PN Eps ( p ) PN Eps ( p )= { q  X  D | q  X  N Obviously p belongs to PN Eps ( p ).The Eps-neighborhood of a point PN Eps ( p ) reflects the distribution feature of the points located in N Eps ( p ) in the direction of density attractor o , as Fig.1. shows that the PN Eps ( p )of p is the upper semicircle including o in two dimensional space.
 Definition 5. Supposed o is the density attractor of a point p , the negative Eps-neighborhood of a point p , denoted by NN Eps ( p ) NN Eps ( p )= { q  X  D | q  X  N
Eps ( p ) separation angle of vectors The NN Eps ( p ) reflects the distribution fea ture of the points located in N Eps ( p ) in the reverse directio n of density attractor o , as Fig.1. shows that the NN Eps ( p ) of p is the lower semicircle in two dimensional space. Note that the number of points included in NN Eps ( p ) will be the denominator of the following formula computing the boundary degree of a point. However, the NN Eps ( p ) is probably to be empty (no points in NN Eps ( p )), which brings great inconvenience to com-putation, so we define p  X  NN Eps ( p ) ,which avoids the case that denominator equals to zero.

Through our study of clusters and boundary points, we find that the Eps -neighborhood of boundary points has following distributional features: points distributed in PN Eps ( p ) are much more than points distributed in NN Eps ( p ), and the number of points distributed in the PN E ps ( p )and NN Eps ( p )isdis-crepant. For points in the deep of clusters, the points included in its PN Eps ( p ) and NN Eps ( p ) are not discrepant. If we define the boundary degree of a point p as the ratio of the number of points distributed in its PN Eps ( p )and NN Eps ( p ) based on our study, then it X  X  easy to distinguish the boundary points from points in clusters. Noises in the region of noises distributed densely also will form some  X  X mall clusters X  in noisy dataset. If we define the boundary degree of a point p as the ratio of the number of points distributed in its PN Eps ( p )and NN Eps ( p ) simply, then the boundary degree of the boundary points of the  X  X mall clusters X  would be high, it X  X  hard to distinguish the boundary points of clusters from the boundary points of the  X  X mall clusters X , since both of them has great bound-ary degree. To solve the problem, we define the boundary degree of a point p as the ratio multiplied by the absolute value of the number of points included in PN Eps ( p ) ,NN Eps ( p ).Generally speaking, the density of boundary points is greater than that of noises, so for boundary points the absolute value of the number of points included in PN Eps ( p ) ,NN Eps ( p ) is also usually greater than that of noises,which greatly reduce the impact of noises on the boundary degree. The boundary degree of a point is defined as follow: Definition 6. | PN Eps ( p ) | , | NN Eps ( p ) | are denoted as the number of points dis-tributed in PN Eps ( p ) ,NN Eps ( p ) respectively, then the boundary degree of a point p,denoted by BD ( p ) , is defined as: For example in Fig.1, o is the density attractor of p , and the number of points =21, NN Eps ( p ) =7, so the boundary degree of point p according to the definition 6, BD ( p )=(21 / 7)(21  X  7)=42 Lemma 1. Supposed o is the density attractor of p and  X  is the separation angle of vectors ( Otherwise if cos  X   X  [  X  1 , 0) ,then  X   X  (90 0 , 180 0 ] ,pointq  X  NN Eps ( p ) In vector space, cos  X  = and , and It is so easy to prove lemma 1 that we don X  X  depict the process in this paper. Since the value of pute whole value of cos  X  . That is to say, we don X  X  need know the exact value of  X  , we only need to compute the positive(negative) of value of cos  X  in order to judge q  X  NN Eps ( p )or q  X  PN Eps ( p ) , so we only compute the range of the inner product of vectors otherwise q  X  NN Eps ( p ).

The main idea of BRIM is as follow: scan the whole dataset and compute the boundary degree of each point. If the boundary degree of a point p is greater than threshold  X  , then define p as boundary point. We use the square of measure the distance between two points p, q in the experiments.
 Algorithm BRIM Inputs: Eps ,  X  Outputs: boundary points.
 Step 1: select one point p unprocessed from the dataset D .
 Step 2: search the Eps neighborhood of point p , and compute Attractor ( p ). Step 3: search the points included in the N Eps ( p ), and compute the size of PN Eps ( p )and NN Eps ( p ) respectively,denoted by | PN Eps ( p ) | and | NN Eps ( p ) | respectively, and compute the boundary degree ( BD ( p ))of point p according to definition 6.
 Step 4: If BD ( p ) &gt; X  , then define point p is a boundary point.
 Step 5: If there are points unprocessed in the dataset D ,jumptostep1. In the following we will evaluate BRIM fr om efficiency and effectiveness. Firstly, we use two dimensional synthetic datasets to verify effectiveness of our algorithm. Secondly, we use different sca le datasets to verify execution efficiency of our algo-rithm. All experiments are run on PC with Pentium2.93G CUP, 256M memory, windows XP professional operation system. The algorithm is programmed and compiled in Visual C++6.0. 4.1 Effectiveness In order to verify the effectiveness of a lgorithm, we have done experiments on many synthetic datasets (including the datasets used in the DBSCAN,Chameleon etc).But considering the limit of the pap er, we choose three typical datasets to explain the effectiveness. (1) Dataset without noises, whose geometric shape is shown in Fig.2a. The dataset has 20378 points in total and a cluster whose geometric shape looks like a five star. Fig.2b is the result of BORDER, the parameters are: the number of nearest neighbors K =50, the size of boundary points n =900; Fig.2c shows the result found by BRIM, input parameters are: the neighborhood of radius Eps =42,  X  =62; From the comparison of the two figures, we can see that both BODER and BRIM can correctly detect the boundary points in dataset without noises. (2) Dataset containing clusters with different density, whose geometric shape is shown in Fig. 3(a). The dataset has 7832 points in total, contains two clus-ters that are close to each other, different regions of the clusters have different densities, and noises distribute sparsely. Fig.3b is the result of BORDER, the parameters are: the number of nearest neighbors K =50, the size of boundary points n =450; Fig.3c shows the result found by BRIM, input parameters are: Eps =60, =100; From the comparison of the two figures, we can see that the boundary points found by BODER are mixed with lots of noises while BRIM can correctly detect the boundary points and distinguish boundary points from noises in dataset containing clusters with different density. (3) Dataset containing clusters with different density, size and shape, whose geometric shape is shown in Fig.4a. The dataset has 12919 points in total, con-tains eight clusters of different shape, size, density and orientation, as well as random noises. A particularly challenging feature of this data set is that clusters are very close to each other and they have different densities. Figure 4b shows the result found by BORDER, the parameters are: K =50, n =3000; Figure 4c shows the result found by BRIM, input parameters are: Eps =35, =42; From the comparison of the two figure, we can see from Fig.4 that the boundary points foundbyBODERaremixedwithlotsofnoi ses while BRIM can correctly detect the boundary points.

The reason why the boundary points found by BORDER are mixed with noises in noisy datsets is that noises have smaller reverse k nearest neighbor number than that of boundary points in noisy datasets, while BRIM can cor-rectly detect the boundary points in noisy d atasets, which verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.
 4.2 Time Complexity and Efficiency The neighborhood query and computing the PN Eps ( p ) ,NN Eps ( p ) of each point is the most time-consuming part of our algorithm BRIM, which can be answered in O ( logN ) time using spatial access methods such as R and SR-tree, so the time complexity of BRIM is O ( NlogN ) if some spatial access methods are used. In the worstcase,thetimecomplexityofBRIMis O ( N 2 ), while the time complexity of BORDER is O ( kN 2 ).

Obviously the time complexity of BRIM is lower than that of BORDER. In order to verify the execution efficiency of BRIM, we have done experiments on datasets of different scales rang from 6220 to 16220 coming from Chameleon. The parameter K used in BORDER is set to 50. From the Fig.5, we can see that obviously execution efficiency of BRIM is higher than that of BORDER. A boundary points detecting algorithm BRIM is proposed based on the distinct numbers of the points distributed in PN Eps ( p )and NN Eps ( p ). BRIM can cor-rectly detect the boundary points in dataset containing clusters with different density, size and shape with noises, and its time complexity is lower than that of BORDER. The parameter  X  has great impact on the number of resultant boundary points: the greater  X  is, the smaller the number of resultant boundary points is; On the contrary, the bigger the number of resultant boundary points is. So the number of resultant boundary points is sensitive to parameter  X  .Itis hard for user with no prior knowledge to set proper  X  . We will solve the problem and use the technique to clustering next.
