 As a way to gain greater insights into the operation of online communities, this dissertation applies automated text mining techniques to text-based communica tion to identify, describe and evaluate underlying social ne tworks among online community members. The main thrust of the study is to find a way to use computers to discover social ties that form between community members just from the digital footprints left behind in their online forum postings automatically. As part of this work, a web-based system for content and network analysis called the Internet Community Text Analyzer (IC TA) is being developed. A prototype of ICTA is available at http://textanalytics.net.

Each re ply to an email, link to a web page, posting on a blog, or comment on a Youtube video leaves a digital trace, a record that explicitly or implicitly connects the poster to another online participant. Each of these recorded actions contributes to the forma tion of various social networks around topics of interest and common affiliations. These online contributions and networks are growing daily, reflected in the increasing volume of texts and a growing number of participants. According to various estimates, over 100 billion emails are sent per day [1], at least 3.8 terabytes of data are posted daily on Usenet [2], and about 900,000 blogs are created each day [3]. This abundance of online data being captured and stored offers a unique opportunity for social scientists and Internet researchers to study and better understand the inner workings of online communities. Researchers can now more closely scrutinize these recorded interactions and answer questions like what the group X  X  interests and priorities are, how and why one online community emerges and another dies, how people agree on common practices and rules in an online community, and how they share knowledge and information among group members. Answers to these and other related questions will allow us to not just better understand how people meet, communicate and es tablish social relationships on the Internet, but also can be used to develop new technologies to better serve the different information needs of various online communities. For instance, social networking websites like Facebook and MySpace are good examples of how advancements in information technology can help people to meet online, form and support a much larger number of online relationships than it has ever been possible before. However, many researchers and the public at large are finding it practically impossible to keep up with the vast amount of accumulated online data. But data volume alone does not fully speak to the enormity of the task associated with analyzing online data. To fully exploit an online dataset, very often researchers have to examine the same set of data multiple times; each time looking for different things. Some of the many things that they can be looking for may include common patterns of exchange, development of shared la nguage and understanding, and emergence of roles and positions that may be unique to online interactions. Thus, it is not surpri sing that there is an increasing interest in the ability to discover and analyze online social networks automatically. Discovering details about online so cial networks automatically has already proven useful in decidi ng what information is relevant on the Internet, identifying credible websites, finding popular resources, and sharing informati on within a network of trust. Other uses of social networ k data include conducting viral marketing, identifying and tracking terrorist cells on the Internet, analyzing consumers X  perceptions of products, and measuring the effectiveness of political campaigns in online and offline media. This dissertation work focuses on new ways of discovering online social networks automatically. In particular, the work introduces and evaluates an automated approach for social network discovery from threaded discussions. Bulletin board style threaded discussions were chosen due to their wide acceptance and usage by various online communities. The most common automated method to collect information on social networks in online communities is to gather  X  X ho talks to whom X  data which counts the number of messages exchanged between individuals from their recorded interactions. A higher number of messages exchanged is usually interpreted as a stronger social tie between people. This method is often used with email-type data. In online communities that use threaded discussions, to gather  X  X ho talk s to whom X  data, researchers usually rely on information in posting headers about the chain of people who had previously posted to the thread (further referred to as reference chain). For logical and practical reasons, in the past researchers generally assumed that the reference chain may reveal the addressee(s). More specifically, it is usually assumed that a poster is replying to the previous poster in the reference chain. Unfortunately, this assumption is not always 100% true in highly argumentative and collaborative communities such as online classes. A previous poster is not always an addressee of the posting and vice versa. A poster ma y address or reference other posters from earlier in the thread, from another thread, or even from other channels of communication (e.g., emails, chats, face to face meetings, etc). So, while the use of reference chains provides some mechanism to approximate  X  X ho talks to whom X  data for threaded discussions, such approximation is not very accurate and is likely to cause an undercounting of possible connections. To overcome the inherent flaws associ ated with gathering  X  X ho talks to whom X  data from threaded disc ussions, the current dissertation proposes a new approach for inferring social networks using the actual content of postings. The proposed approach called  X  X am e network X  starts by finding all mentions of personal names in the postings and uses them as nodes in the name network. Once all the nodes are identified, the next step is to discover how th ese names/nodes are connected to each other in order to derive  X  X ho talks to whom X  data. To accomplish this, the algorithm works under the assumption that the chance of two people sharing a social tie is proportional to the number of times each of them mentions the other in his/her postings either as an addressee or a subject person. As a way to quantify this assumption, the algorithm adds a nominal weight of 1 to a tie between a poster and all names found in the postings. After processing all postings, only those ties that have weights higher than a pre-defined threshold are included as part of the name network. For a more deta iled description of the proposed algorithm, see [4]. As a case study, the proposed  X  X  ame network X  approach is evaluated in the context of online learning using data collected from six different graduate leve l online classes taught at the Graduate School of Library and In formation Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Spring 2008. The online learning context was chosen because the online classes relied primarily on bulletin boards to conduct their discussions, each class represented a close community with a finite number of online participates, and finally the time frame for data collection had a clear beginning and end. The future research will evaluate the usefulness of the  X  X ame network X  method in other types of online communities. The results thus far suggest th at the proposed  X  X ame network X  method for collecting social netw ork data provides on average 40 per cent more information about social ties in a group as compared to methods that only rely on information in the reference chain. This additional information is available mostly because name networks can account for instances when a poster addresses or references somebody who has not previously posted to a particular thread. The ab ility of name networks to find message addressees based on the content of the message makes it also possible to discover social ne tworks from Internet data where message addressees can not be determined from the information in the message header. Some examples of such data include chats, blogs, news stories, Youtube comments. The results also demonstrate that it is possible to discover social networks that closely resemble students X  se lf-reported social networks automatically; and that the social networks extracted automatically can be useful for educators to evaluate and improve teaching models from the student X  X  perspective. See discussions of these results in [5]. The end result of the research will be the development of a low-cost and time-efficient set of techniques for on-the-fly, genre-independent, content analysis of online communities and a new schema for using these technique s to discover social networks automatically. As part of this work, a web-based system for content and network analysis calle d the Internet Community Text Analyzer or ICTA for short is being developed. A fully http://textanalytics.net. The prototype is described in [6]. The main goal of ICTA is to automate the process of analyzing text-based communal interactions and provide researchers and other interested parties with an effec tive set of visualization tools and techniques covering both content and social networks. Although, the system was primarily tested with online learning communities, it can also be used to analyze a wide variety of other types of text-based online communities. [1] Leggatt, H. 2007.
