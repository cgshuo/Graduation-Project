 In the online world, user engagement refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of the interaction with a web application and, in particular, the phenomena associated with wanting to use that appli-cation longer and frequently. This definition is motivated by the observation that successful web applications are not just used, but they are engaged with. Users invest time, attention, and emotion into them.

Online providers aim not only to engage users with each service, but across all services in their network. They spend increasing effort to direct users to various services (e.g. using hyperlinks to help users navigate to and explore other ser-vices), to increase user traffic between their services. Noth-ing is known for users engaging across such a network of Web sites, something we call networked user engage-ment . We address this problem by combining techniques from web analytics and mining, information retrieval evalu-ation, and existing works on user engagement coming from the domains of information science, multimodal human com-puter interaction and cognitive psychology. In this way, we can combine insights from big data with deep analysis of human behavior in the lab or through crowd-sourcing ex-periments.
 This work was mainly done in collaboration with Janette Lehmann and Georges Dupret from Yahoo! Labs, as well as Elad Yom-Tov from Microsoft Research.

 User engagement, network of services, Web sites, metrics.
User engagement is measured in many ways, through meth-ods of self-reporting (e.g., questionnaires), observer methods (e.g., facial expression analysis, speech analysis, desktop ac-tions, etc.), neuro-physiological signal processing methods (e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular accelerations and de-celerations, muscle spasms, etc.), and from a web analyt-ics perspective (through online behavior metrics that assess users X  depth of engagement with a site). These methods represent various tradeoffs between scale of data and depth of understanding (for instance, surveys are small-scale but deep, whereas clicks are large-scale but shallow in under-standing). However, little work has been done to integrate these various measures into a coherent understanding of en-gagement success.

This research line is a first step forward to fully under-stand user engagement in the context of the Web. This work also shows the need and importance of combining different points of view coming from different disciplines. This way of thinking is crucial to many areas, going beyond the Web and will in time lead to a new genre of computational social sciences that transcend specific applications on the Internet. [1] S.

Research for Eu-rope, Middle East and Latin America, leading the labs at Barcelona, Spain and Santiago, Chile, since 2006, as well as supervising the lab in Haifa, Israel, since 2008. He is also part time Professor at the Dept. of Information and Com-munication Technologies of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain, since 2005. Until 2005 he was Professor and Director of the Center for Web Research at the Depart-ment of Computer Science of the Engineering School of the University of Chile (currently in a leave of absence). He obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 1989. Before he obtained two masters (M.Sc. CS &amp; M.Eng. EE) and the electrical engineering degree from the University of Chile, Santiago. He is co-author of the best-seller Modern Information Retrieval textbook, published in 1999 by Addison-Wesley with a second enlarged edition in 2011, as well as co-author of the 2nd edition of the Hand-book of Algorithms and Data Structures, Addison-Wesley, 1991; and co-editor of Information Retrieval: Algorithms and Data Structures, Prentice-Hall, 1992, among more than 400 other publications.

He has received the Organization of American States award for young researchers in exact sciences (1993) and the CLEI Latin American distinction for contributions to computer science in the region (2009). In 2003 he was the first com-puter scientist to be elected to the Chilean Academy of Sci-ences. During 2007 he was awarded the Graham Medal for innovation in computing, given by the University of Water-loo to distinguished ex-alumni. In 2009 he was named ACM Fellow and in 2011 IEEE Fellow.
