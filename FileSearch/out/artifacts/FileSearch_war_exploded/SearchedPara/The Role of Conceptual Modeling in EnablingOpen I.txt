 Innovation projects are more and more based on the collaboration of multiple parties to co-create value. The business literature proudly presents examples of successful social innovation projects, but it is also true that many fail and end up with disappointing results for some or all of the the contributors. They can be unsuccessful for several reasons. The benefits of the extended flexibility, so char-acteristic of open innovation, do not materialize automatically. Flexibility does also mean uncertainty, which can easily lead to defensive behavior and lack of trust and turn the project failure into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Uncertainty also increases in multidisciplinary teams when knowledge transfer creates semantic problems. From a legal perspective, Levine [5] observed that many contracts are fear-based agreeements:  X  X hey were desi gned less to support whatever vision people wanted to accomplish than to limit liability should something go wrong. Because it is impossible to foresee all problems, fear based contracts are more likely to lead to confusion (and further lawyer fees) than to create clarity and sat-isfaction X . Instead of contracts for prot ection, Levine advocates to use contracts for results. This is in line with the advice of Chesbrough:  X  X hile small companies should obtain as much protection as they can afford, there is no substitute for a good business model to protect IP X  [1:41].
 tion. Drawing on the Language/Action Perspective and the pioneering work of Drucker, an innovation is defined by Denning &amp; Dunham[2] as happening when a group or community has adopted a new practice. Practice includes habits, rou-tines and other forms of embodied recurrent actions that as such resist radical change. Mutual trust relationships are critical to achieve social change, and social innovation projects easily fail if they are not based on long-term commitments. IS tools could increase the chance of su ccess. An open innovation project can be considered as a design process on two levels. First, there is the obvious design of a new artifact and/or practice. Second, at the same time, the participants design their own collaboration. This collaboration includes at least an IP strategy and a profit distribution model. Design is often an iterative process o f representation and reflection in some context [3,6], and h ence can profit from adequate modeling support. This approach is currently followed in the Tilburg social innovation project  X  X nnovative Contract Design X .
 collaborative design of new value networks, but they are limited by their focus on the exchange of value rather than co-creation. In this tutorial, an extension to e3-value in the form of  X  X alue encounters X  is used. The objective of the tutorial is to explain value encounter modeling and how it can support open innovation projects. Value encounter models can be adopted by innovation groups for the collective unfolding and reflexive understanding of their own innovation process in all its phases, including the newly envisioned practices that adopt the tech-nology. Each phase is a value encounter in its own, and translation is required when moving from one to another. In addition, the value model is a basis for developing and selecting adequate communication structures for each phase. useful.
