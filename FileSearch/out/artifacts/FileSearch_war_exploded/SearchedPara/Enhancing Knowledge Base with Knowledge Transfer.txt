 A Knowledge Base (KB) stores, organizes, and shares infor-mation pertinent to entities (i.e. KB nodes) such as peo-ple, organizations, and events. A large KB system, such as Wikipedia, relies on human curators to create and main-tain the content in the systems. However, it has become challenging for human curators to sift through the rapidly growing amount of information and filter out the informa-tion irrelevant to a KB node. The area of Knowledge Base Enhancement (KBE) aims to explore and identify automatic methods to assist human curators to accelerate the process. KBE can be viewed as a special case of Information Filtering (IF). However, the lack of high-quality labelled data intro-duces a major challenge to train a satisfying model for the task. Transfer learning provides solutions to the problem and has explored applications in the area of text mining [3], whereas direct application to KBE or IF remains absent.
Transfer learning is a research area in machine learning, emphasizing the reuse of previously acquired knowledge to another applicable task [2]. The intuition of transfer learn-ing comes from that one may find it easier to learn Span-ish having learned French; or to perform ballroom dancing having already practiced figure skating. The method is par-ticularly useful in the situations where labeled instances are absent or difficult to obtain. To accelerate the growth of a KB, a transfer learning approach enables leveraging the heuristics and models learned from one KB node to another. For example, reusing the learned filtering models from Willie Nelson, a famous country singer, to Eddie Rabbitt, another country singer.

Transfer learning requires three components: the target task (e.g. the problem to be solved), the source task(s) (e.g. auxiliary data, previously studied problem), and criteria to select appropriate source tasks. The objectives of my dis-sertation are twofold. First, it explores methods to identify informative source nodes from which to transfer. Second, it constructs a knowledge transfer network to represent the transfer learning relationship between KB nodes.

This proposed research applies a transfer learning method  X  Segmented Transfer (ST) [1] X  and a knowledge represen-tation  X  Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN)  X  to approach the area of KBE. The primary research questions include: What are the transferable objects in information filtering algorithms? What are the KB nodes of high transferabil-ity? What are the factors that determine the transfer learn-ing relationship? Does it manifest on a knowledge transfer network representation? A transfer learning approach can alleviate the cold-start problem in a KB system, leveraging knowledge from more popular KB nodes to nodes of lim-ited or empty profiles. A representation of transfer learning relationships among KB nodes may reveal their hidden on-tological connections.

This interdisciplinary research crosses the study area of information filtering, machine learning, knowledge represen-tation, and network analysis. This proposal motivates the problem of KBE, discusses the research methodology and proposed experiments, and reviews related works in infor-mation filtering and transfer learning. This line of research hopes to extend the application of transfer learning to KBE and to explore a new dimension of IF. The proposed ST and KTN intends to bring interdisciplinary approaches in the emerging field of KBE.
