 What is the role of the internet in politics general and during cam-paigns in particular? And what is the role of large amounts of user data in all of this? In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign the Democrats were far more successful than the Republicans in utiliz-ing online media for mobilization, co-ordination and fundraising. For the first time, social media and the Internet played a fundamen-tal role in political campaigns. However, technical research in this area has been surprisingly limited and fragmented. The goal of this workshop is to bring together, for the first time, researchers work-ing at the intersection of social network analysis, computational social science and political science, to share and discuss their ideas in a common forum; and to inspire further developments in this growing, fascinating field. The workshop has Filippo Menczer as keynote speaker, it includes technical presentations of accepted pa-pers and concludes with a panel discussion where scientists and media experts from different fields can interact and share views.

The web has often been regarded as a liberating, deliberative and democratizing place. Empirical research, however, has shown that while there are many new instruments for communication and par-ticipation, online politics are but a reflection of the offline politi-cal landscape [7]. Online data is increasingly recognized as a rich source of data for studies that normally fall in the domain of social sciences [8, 10, 13].

Politicians worldwide have realized the power that social media carries when it comes to campaigning. Here, Twitter and Facebook are often on the frontline as they engage many users in political virtual debates and, ultimately, mobilize them for grassroot move-ments. Online campaigning is generally thought to have played an important rule during the 2008 U.S. presidential elections [12, 11].
The workshop is intended as a venue for researchers with differ-ent backgrounds but a common interest in the new area of compu-tational political science to meet and exchange ideas. We expect participants from the areas of Computer Science, Political Science, Information Science, Media Studies and more. Topics of interest include classifying users and content according to political lean-ing, quantifying the effect of political campaigns through online media, studying the effects of a  X  X aily Me X  on political content consumption and using both social media and prediction markets for election predictions.

We believe that the diversity of research backgrounds and per-spectives, combined with the varied nationalities of the participants will help us define a rich set of common research goals. The work-shop is meant as the first in a series of meetings for researchers in the area.
The workshop opens with a 1-hour keynote talk by Filippo Menczer entitled  X  X he Diffusion of Political Memes in Social Media X  [9]. Filippo presents ongoing work on the study of information diffu-sion in social media. The analyses in this keynote address polariza-tion, cross-ideological communication, and partisan asymmetries in online political activities. His talk includes a model of the com-petition for attention in social media that helps to explain the dy-namics of information diffusion, where a few ideas go viral while most do not. Following the keynote, there is a 20-minute overview of existing online tools for political analysis. The presentation fea-tures the Twitter Political Index 1 for sentiment analysis on Twit-ter concerning Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, PredictWise 2 using prediction markets to forecast the election, Political Search Trends 3 to identify trending political issues with a leaning from web search logs, Truthy 4 to study the spread of political memes on Twitter, as well as several other live demos. The main part of the technical program consists of six presentation of accepted pa-pers (see below). Each presenter is alloted a 20 minute with ad-ditional 5 minutes for discussion. All accepted papers underwent peer-review by at least three program committee members. At the end of the workshop there is a panel discussion with representa-tives from academia, social media companies and news media. The com/ panel covers a range of topics related to the workshop such as note-worthy examples of actual political future predictions using social media, rather than mere retro-fitting, or the impact of constantly monitoring and measuring public opinions on the web. Does it strengthen grassroot democracy by giving a louder voice to every citizen, or does it, by amplifying every single twist, weaken politi-cal stability and create a more polarized society?
The following workshop papers have been accepted for publica-tion and are presented by one of the authors.

Political Polarization and Popularity in Online Participatory Me-dia: an Integrated Approach : The paper introduces a framework for measuring the online popularity of political campaigns, illus-trated by a study of collective emotions and video virality in a Youtube video dataset. It then proposes reproducing media pop-ularity patterns using ABMs (agent-based models) and delves into how ABMs used in connection with voting advice applications (VAAs) may allow testing content virality or user behavior assumptions as well as improve VAAs for real-world users.

Just 140 Characters to Communicate with Constituents: Ital-ian Members of Parliament on Twitter : The study explores the use of Twitter by the members of the Italian parliament. Adoption of Twitter is found to be influenced by age, level of technological lit-eracy, and party leader adoption patterns. Twitter influence is found to mirror real-life status with leaders less active but more influen-tial than ordinary members. However, active ordinary members successfully use Twitter to raise their profile and cultivate useful relationships. [1] Party Cohesion in Presidential Races: Applying Social Network Theory to the 2011 Preprimary : The paper proposes the general task of analyzing patterns in the funding of candidates for political office in order to discern information about the state of the respec-tive party. A first experiment on analyzing individual contributions data for the 2012 Republican Party preprimary shows promise: the existence of specific ideological fractions in the party and the emer-gence of Mitt Romney as the most likely nominee are supported by the data. [5]
Opinions Network for Politically Controversial Topics : The pa-per introduces OpinioNetIt, a system for mining opinions held by stakeholders on politically controversial topics. The opinions are stored in a faceted knowledge base and can be used for political opinions analysis, search and summarization. Specific use cases include: heat maps of political bias, discovery of dissenters or flip-flopping politicians. [2]
French Presidential Elections: What are the Most Efficient Mea-sures for Tweets? : The paper focuses on the task of characterizing political communities by mining and tracking topics from Twitter updates sent by their members. A set of topic mining procedures are proposed and evaluated in the context of tweets sent during the 2012 French presidential and legislative elections. [4] The Price of Precision: Voter Microtargeting and its Potential Harms to the Democratic Process : The paper explores the unin-tended effects of voter microtargeting (e.g., the resulting focus on divisive, wedge issues, voter disenfranchisement, increased parti-sanship). It then introduces Soap Box, a collaborative project to develop a website acting as a clearinghouse for targeted political advertising and discusses the limits of such an approach to combat the worrisome aspects of microtargeting.
