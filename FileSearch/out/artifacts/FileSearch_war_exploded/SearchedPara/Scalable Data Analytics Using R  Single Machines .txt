 R is one of the most popular languages in the data science, statistical and machine learning (ML) community. However, when it comes to scalable data analysis and ML using R, many data scientists are blocked or h indered by (a) its limitations of available functions to handle large datasets efficiently, and ( b) knowledge about the appropriate com puting environments to scale R scripts from desktop exploratory analysis to elastic and distributed cloud services. In this tutorial we will discuss so lutions that demonstrate the use of distr ibuted compute environments and end to end solutions for R. We will present the topics through presentations and worked-out exa mples with sample code. In addition, we will provide a public code repository that attende es will be able to access and adapt to their own practice. We beli eve this tutorial will be of strong interest to a large and growing community of data scientists and developers using R for data analysis and modeling.
