 Ngoc Thanh Nguyen  X  Rados X aw P. Katarzyniak The agent ability to act in order to achieve its private goals belongs to basic properties defining this class of artificial systems. However when agents are considered in context of multi-agent systems it very often happens that their actions become involved in multiple, simple or com-plex social relations with other acting and autonomous entities. In such cases agents belonging to a broader multi-agent population need to take into account other agents while planning and realizing their behavior. According to definitions accepted in social sciences, all acts, actions and practices that involve more than two agents and affect or take account of other agents X  activities, experiences or knowledge states are called the social interactions. Such interactions encompass in various ways another selves and intend to affect their states of emotions, inten-tions, and beliefs. Their basic property is that they are always based on mutual and subjective orientationtowardsotheragents X  X houghtsaswellassomeresultsfromotheragents X  X ctivities.
The application of the social interaction concept to enhancements of multi-agent systems X  functionality is a natural step towards designing and implementing more intelligent and human-like populations of artificial autonomous systems. The related research and design efforts are understood by the Artificial Intelligence community as a necessary step towards the production of systems that are capable of advanced forms of cooperation, self-coordination, groupplanning,coalitionformation,socialproblemsolving,etc.Obviously,allcomputational approaches and modeling techniques that can contribute in this or another way to such development of artificial social interaction, have lately become an interesting and intensively studied target of scientific research.

There are multiple, lower and higher level cognitive and emotional abilities needed to realize particular cases of social interactions. However, two of them seem to be especially required: the ability to create private intentional reference towards other agents in the same group and the ability to process gained knowledge on the semantic level. Many interest-ing problems of theoretical and practical nature emerge in relation to the above named capabilities.

Some of them are:  X  How autonomous agents can take into account other agents X  intentions and in what way  X  How meaningful results from various actions, delivered by other agents, can be combined  X  How social rules and norms can be developed in an autonomous way within populations  X  In what way the knowledge of other agents X  states and other agents X  knowledge should
These and other more or less general research questions are important for practical reasons, especially when one wants to design socially effective agent systems. Unfortunately, what makes such targets very difficult is a necessity to define them and studied on various levels of autonomous knowledge processing and knowledge representation in artificial (including virtual) bodies of autonomous agents.

This special issue of Knowledge and Information Systems consists of five papers that cover a few specific research topics which solutions contribute to effective implementations of actions and social interactions within multi-agent systems. All papers included into this issue have been inspired by original presentations given by at least one of their authors, as well as highly evaluated and extensively discussed by participants to the 1st KES Symposium on Agent and Multi-Agent Systems X  X echnologies and Applications, held in Wroclaw, Poland, 31May X 1June 2007. Authors have been asked to prepare new submissions, provided that substantial extensions need to be made and updates implemented in their original works. In the first paper Norm negotiation in online multi-player games by Guido Boella and Patrice Caire (Universit X  di Torino) and Leendert van der Torre (University of Luxembourg) the authors introduce and study an agent communication protocol and speech acts that are involved in the process of norm negotiation. The obligations that are created are individual or contractual and fulfill goals of the agents. They are based on the so-called social delegation cycle. This social cycle consists of four general steps. At first, particular agents propose social goals which can be further accepted or rejected by other agents; at second the agents communicate their individual goals and so-called powers; at third they propose obligations and sanctions to achieve the social goal (they can again be accepted or rejected); and at fourth the agents accept the new norm by indicating which of their communicated individual goals the norm achieves. This model strongly relies on the concept of speech acts. In this case their semantics is based on a commitment to public mental attitudes. Norms are one of the basic concepts that shape the culture of multiagent (multi-agent) systems and influence the way agents interact with other agents and their environment.
 The second paper Approximate solutions of moral dilemmas in multiple agent system by Matteo Cristani and Elisa Burato (Universit X  di Verona) deals with the problem of represent-ing the attitudes of agents involved in a multi-agent system with ethical rules. Such class of systems is called Ethical Multiple Agent Systems. It is specified in terms of agents with ethi-cal commitments, both as obligations and as prohibitions. The Ethical judgment is a question posed with respect to a given action and an agent. This question can be stated as follows: is the act legitimate, by the moral rules to which the agent is committed? Although this ques-tion seems not to be very problematic, it can be made much more complex in some circum-stances. These circumstances are considered by the authors in the paper. The authors stress that their approach can be useful when multiagent systems formalize inter-working systems e.g. Internet Wiki tools, or on-line collaboration systems. Again, the social interaction is referred in this paper.

The third paper Developing actionable trading agents by Longbing Cao and Tony He (University of Technology, Sydney) introduces effective approaches for optimizing and inte-grating multiple classes of strategies through trading agent collaboration. Taking into account real-lifeorganizationalfactorsandtraderexpectationsontradingagents,theauthorshavebuilt evolutionary trading agents to search the golden strategies that can help an agent achieves highest benefit-cost ratio, and collaborative trading agents to concurrently trade multiple classes of identified golden trading strategies. The social dimension in this contribution is introduced when market situations are considered, due to the fact that major elements defin-ing market situations are expectations and wishes of individual agents. Actionable trading agents are developed to cope with these social elements.

The fourth paper Consensus -based evaluation framework for distributed information retrieval systems by Jason J. Jung (Yeungnam University, Korea) gives an example of how consensus theory can be applied within a distributed mutiagent retrieval system in order to compute a final retrieval result, obtained from different hosts. In each situations the proposed approach at least suggests how they should be integrated to deliver a solution, fulfilling particular effectiveness requirements known from the information retrieval field. This work addresses problems that are typical in real distributed systems where the basic operations are: the propagation of a query, the retrieval of a set of results from each host, and the integration of these result sets. The author shows an approach according to which the fusion of results coming from different agents of a heterogeneous population.
 The fifth paper Agents  X  model of uncertainty by Germano Resconi (Catholic University Brescia, Italy) and Boris Kovalerchuk (Central Washington University) deals with complex aggregations of crisp (non-fuzzy) conflicting judgments produced by different agents from a multiagent population. The authors refer strongly to the fact that that each society of agents can always have a degree of conceptual conflicts and any agent from this society can also be self-conflicting. They stress that such a situation affects agents X  abilities to use resources for identifying goals and acting. Therefore the target of the authors is to establish a fundamental logic structure that can be used for making logic decisions within the context of conflicting multiagent environment. Although social dimension in this paper and former papers is modeled more from an external rather than an internal viewpoint of a particular agent it still gives some insights into possible ways of dealing with the heterogeneity of subjectively and autonomously delivered results from various activities.
