  X  X roup Fork X  is defined as  X  X ore than two group members leave their parent organization and st art a new group X . While group fork is a common social phenomenon in any type of group, it is still understudied in virtual contexts. Drawing upon the literature from three fields, religious research, social psychology and organization studies, this study attempts to br idge this gap by answering two questions,  X  X hat causes group fork? X  and  X  X ow is individual dissatisfaction transformed into group-level dissatisfaction in virtual contexts, thus leading to the eventual fork? X  Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) proj ects will be used as examples of self-organizing virtual work, as they provide a good context to observe the whole process of how group interactions are intertwined toward to the eventual fork. A multi-stage research strategy is conducted in this study and preliminary findings will be reported. H.4.0 [ General ] Management. Group Fork, Schism, Turnover, Open Source, FLOSS. Few groups have not been threatened by the potential risk of forking at certain stages of their development [1]. Group fork has been observed in any type of group including profit and non-profit businesses, political parties, re ligious communities, and online communities of practice. This phenomenon becomes more complicated and vibrant when it comes to the virtual context. Advances in information and communication technologies make virtual work ubiquitous in today X  s organizations. Different levels of discontinuities have been found to influence group behaviors in various aspects [5]. First, computer-mediated communication (CMC) conveys less social characteristics, thus causing deindividuation [6]. The low level of individuation to some extent smoothes the differences among group members and increases their perception of overall group. Members tend to be more sensitive to any salient social identity cues and over-attribute them to group members rather than idiosyncratic individuals [7]. Though CMC may lead to more e quitable participation, it may also cause potential conflicts due to the uninhibited criticism of others. Second, geographic and temporal discontinuities bring many communication and coordination difficulties for members in virtual contexts [8]. Although the na ture of problem is similar to the one in traditional organizations, it is more difficult to solve in online contexts [9]. However, most of the existing forking studies are situated in face-to-face contexts and almost no researcher has specifically examined group fork in virtual contex ts yet. This study attempts to fulfill this gap by situating the design in an emergent virtual context. Moreover, Sani [10] notes that prior studies mainly focus on  X  X deologically based social group where values, beliefs and practices are of paramount impor tance and form the basis of a commonly shared identity among the group members X (p729) and calls for more research on other groups such as task-oriented group. In this study, Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) communities are used as examples of emergent, self-organizing virtual work. To get a comprehensive understanding of group fork, this study conducted an in-depth literature re view in several fields including religious studies, social psychology, organization studies, group research and innovation literature. The relevant concepts which can be used interchangeably so metimes range from schism [10], group fission [12], breakaway [2], to collective turnover [4]. The existing literature is dominated by variance research primarily based on variables and associated hypotheses. Those studies try to understand the factors influencing the occurrence and rate of group fork. For example, the exte rnal forces which have been heavily studied include leadership change [13], new comer X  X  join-resources [12]. The Internal for ces include organization age [14], organization size [14], cultural environment [14], organization governance and control mechanism [15], membership issues [15] and faultline [12]. Compared to the large number of variance models, few studies have adopted process approach to look at group forking behaviors and processe s. The most famous model is Exit/Voice/Loyalty/Neglect (EVLN) paradigm proposed by Hirschman in 1970 [16]. Following that, Dyck and Starke [2] develop a process model of group exit as six stages: relative harmony, idea development, change , resistance, intense conflict and group exit and emphasize the im portance of triggering events between stages. Bartunek et al [4 ] also propose a process model of collective turnover mainly consisted of two phases  X  X oice X  and  X  X xit X . They specially emphasize the role of group sense-making in transforming initial dissatisfaction into group dissatisfaction. One crucial reason for the lack of process research is the difficulty of data collection. Many forks occurred long time ago which make it difficult for the researchers to retrieve the details. Moreover, forking is a sensitive topic within the group, which often involves a lot of personal and group conflicts . However, rich email archives of FLOSS projects provide a good opportunity to observe the evolvement of group fork over time and greatly make up the deficiency of previous research. This study will look at both micro-level and macro-level behavi ors, in order to understand how the micro-level behaviors are intertwined with each other to shape the final outcome. To get a better understanding of the dynamics of group fork in virtual contexts, this study will answer  X  X hat are the causes of group fork? X ,  X  X hat are the forking behaviors exhibited in the group and how they evolve over time? X  and  X  X hat contextual factors may affect group forking behaviors, thus influencing the occurrence of group fork? X  A multi-stage strategy is conducted in this research as Table1. The primary data used in this study are interactions on the main communication venues, including developer mailing list, user mailing list and web-based discussi on forum. Content analysis is adopted as the main method to analyze interaction archives while document analysis and semi-structured interview will be conducted as triangulation. The coding scheme is developed deductively based on Exit/Voice/Loyalty/Neglect (EVLN) paradigm [16]; Process Model of Group Exit [2] and Process Model of Collective Turnover [4], and inductively revised through pilot study. The initial findings generated in the pilot study will be reported in Group2009. Phase Details Data Collection Phase-I Overview (Done) Phase-II Pilot Study (Done) Phase-III In-depth Case Studies (02-09 /2009) Phase-IV Replication Survey (09-11 /2009) The contribution of this research can be perceived as two parts. Theoretically, the models developed in traditional face-to-face settings will be tested and extende d in virtual contexts. Process approach instead of variance approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of forking dynamics. Practically, occurrence of group fork. [1] Sani, F. and Todman, J. 2002.
