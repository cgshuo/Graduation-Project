  X  1. Introduction
In the past few decades, meat industry has enormously thrived, as demands for better food quality continues to grow on both international and domestic markets ( Desmond et al., 2000 ).
Interests in meat quality are driven by the need to supply the consumer with a consistent high quality product at an affordable price ( ElMasry and Sun, 2010 ). To realise such need, it is a crucial element within the meat industry to accurately assess meat quality attributes by improving modern techniques for quality evaluation ( Herrero et al., 2008 ). Beef is one of the commercially viable and widely consumed muscle foods throughout the world.
Although it is a good food source for proteins and other essential nutrients, it is also an ideal substrate for the growth of both spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Spoilage occurs when the formation of off-fl avours, off-odours, discoloration, or any other changes in physical appearance or chemical characteristics make the food unacceptable to the consumer. Changes in muscle food characteristics are due to native or microbial enzymatic activity or to other chemical reactions. The current practice to assure the safety of meat still relies on regulatory inspection and sampling regimes. This approach, however, seems inadequate because it cannot suf fi ciently guarantee consumer protection, since 100% inspection and sampling is technically, fi nancially and logistically impossible. Additionally, although more than 50 che-mical, physical and microbiological methods have been proposed for the detection and measurement of bacterial safety or spoilage in meat, most of them are time-consuming and provide retro-spective information ( Ellis and Goodacre, 2001 ).
 quanti fi cation of these indicators in order to determine suitable processing procedures for their raw material and to predict the remaining shelf life of their products ( Dissing et al., 2013 ). During previous years, relevant analysis and screening methods had been carried out on meat utilising high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ( Vinci and Antonelli, 2002 ), and gas chromatography  X  mass spectrometry ( Ercolini et al., 2010 ). The development of non-destructive sensing technologies to detect spoilage bacteria as well as pathogenic bacteria with a high degree of dependency in food products is however very desirable.
Various rapid, non-invasive methods based on analytical instru-mental techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared spectro-scopy (FTIR) ( Balasubramanian et al., 2009 )andRaman spectroscopy ( Mouwen et al., 2011 ) have been researched for their potential in assessing meat quality. The  X  mechanism these approaches is based on the assumption that the metabolic activity of micro-organisms on meat results in biochemical changes, with the simultaneous formation of metabolic by-products, which may contribute to the spoilage phenomenon.
The quanti fi cation of these metabolic activities represents a unique  X  signature  X  , providing thus information about the type and rate of spoilage ( Nychas et al., 2008 ).

The huge amount of information provided by spectral data requires an advanced data analysis approach. This has been achieved through the integration of modern analytical platforms with computational and chemometric techniques ( Miller and
Miller, 2005 ). Multivariate statistical analyses ( e.g ., partial least square (PLS) regression, discriminant function analysis (DFA), cluster analysis) have resulted in the development of decision support systems for timely determination of safety/quality of meat products ( Guill X n et al., 2010 ). Considering that microbial meat spoilage is a complex process which involves growth of micro-organisms during storage, their spectra contain highly non-linear characteristics. Hence, linear tools might not provide a complete solution to such complex identi fi cation/classi fi cation problem ( Qin et al., 2011 ). Neural networks (NNs) have gained much interest in predictive engineering and quantitative modelling due to their fl exibility and high accuracy as compared to other modelling techniques ( e.g. , statistical models). In comparison to other NN-based application areas, the fi eld of food science is still in an early development stage. Recently, advanced NN algorithms have shown promising results in applications such as growth parameter estimation of microorganisms ( Panagou and Kodogiannis, 2009 ), whereas hybrid wavelet neural networks have been successfully applied for bacterial survival curves' identi fi cation ( Amina et al., 2010 ). NNs usually require a large number of neurons for solving the majority of approximation problems and are prone to dimen-sionality problems, as each single neuron-node cannot de fi multi-dimensional hyper-sphere of the input domain. Although fuzzy logic systems, provide such input space mapping, they do not have learning ability, thus it is dif fi cult to analyse complex systems without prior and accurate knowledge on the system being analysed ( Rutkowska, 2002 ).

To overcome the limitations of NNs and fuzzy systems, neuro-fuzzy approaches have attracted growing interest of researchers in various scienti fi c and engineering areas. The main objective of this for the fi rst time a neuro-fuzzy identi fi cation model. The proposed  X 
Adaptive Fuzzy Logic System  X  (AFLS) model includes a prototype defuzzi fi cation scheme, and differs from conventional fuzzy rule-table approaches that utilise the  X  look-up table  X  concept. In those models, an input space is divided into K 1 K 2 :::: K n fuzzy each of these subspaces, their ma in drawback is that the number of fuzzy rules increases exponenti ally with respect to the number of inputs n . ANFIS is a classical example of such approach, where the number of fuzzy rules is related to the number of input variables as well as the number of membership functions for each input. In the case of AFLS, the number of member ships for each input variable is directly associated to the number of rules, hence, the  X  curse of dimensionality  X  problem is signi fi cantly reduced.

Datasets related to FTIR spectra and the correlated microbiolo-gical analysis ( i.e. total viable counts -TVC) from beef provided to the fi rst author by Agricultural University of Athens, in the framework of the  X  Symbiosis-EU  X  research project ( SYMBIOSIS Project, 2009 ). Fresh beef fi llets were packaged under aerobic conditions and left to spoil at (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 1 C), for up to 350 h. FTIR spectra were collected directly from the surface of meat samples, whereas TVCs of bacteria were obtained via standard plating methods. Sensory evaluation was performed during sto-rage and samples were attributed into three quality classes, namely fresh, semi-fresh, and spoiled ( Argyri et al., 2010 ). Due to the nature of FTIR spectral data, it is necessary to utilise a principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the problem of dimension-ality with the minimum information lost. The proposed AFLS model has been utilised to classify beef samples to one of three quality classes, based on their biochemical pro fi le provided by the FTIR spectrometer. The same model simultaneously predicts the microbial load (as total viable counts) on meat surface. Results from AFLS scheme are compared against models based on multi-layer neural networks (MLP) and PLS. Such comparison is con-sidered as an essential practice, as we have to emphasise the need of induction to the area of food microbiology, advanced learning-based modelling schemes, which may have a signi fi cant potential for the rapid and accurate assessment of meat spoilage. Such an accurate assessment prediction could allow a more ef fi cient management of products in the food chain. 1.1. FTIR spectroscopy in food quality analysis
FTIR spectroscopy has been used extensively by chemists to identify compounds in a wide variety of applied fi elds. This motivation is justi fi ed from the fact that FTIR is a rapid, inexpen-sive and sensitive technology that rapidly allows real-time mea-surements at all stages of production without requiring special skills from users. Moreover, it has been recognised as a powerful tool when coupled to chemometric techniques, and is widely utilised for rapid quality control of numerous foodstuffs since it provides information from complex spectra about the composition of food components. In fact, for any individual sample, FTIR spectroscopy provides information on fundamental vibration and stretching of molecules exhibited under infrared light in the spectral region between 4000 and 700 cm 1 . It provides a characteristic spectrum that is the result of absorption by various chemical constituents, providing thus a  X  fi ngerprint  X  of each sample ( Karoui and De Baerdemaeker, 2007 ).

Over the last few years, FTIR has been considered as a very important tool in food analysis including authenticity and adul-teration. Nutrient determination is time consuming and not appropriate for routine application in the food industries. FTIR was able to determine omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in pork adipose tissue ( Olsen et al., 2008 ). It has been used to investigate the in fl uence of heating rates and different heating temperatures on protein denaturation in beef ( Kirschner et al., 2004 ), as well as to study the in fl uence of ageing and salting on uncooked and cooked pork ( Wu et al., 2006 ). In addition, it has been considered as a fast and non-destructive technique for the detection and quanti fi cation of pork in beef meatball formulation for Halal veri fi cation purposes. The spectral bands associated with pork fat (PF), beef fat (BF), and their mixtures in meatball formulation, were scanned, interpreted, and identi fi ed by relating them to those spectroscopically representative to pure PF and BF ( Rohman et al., 2011 ). The quality of oil, an essential ingredient of the food processing industry has also been investigated through the use of FTIR for the accurate quanti fi cationofthemoistureinedibleoils ( Vlachos et al., 2006 ). Although, the vast majority of FTIR-based and solid phase samples, very few applications based on gaseous phase samples have been reported. A FTIR spectroscopy-based olfac-tory sensing system has been investigated in sensing the volatiles collected from the headspace of a meat package for the detection of pathogen contamination ( Salmonella typhimurium )inthepackedmeat ( Amamcharla et al., 2010 ).

The application of chemometric techniques to associate FTIR spectral data with meat spoilage is not new and it has been tackled in the past ( Gangidi et al., 2003 ). In that approach, emphasis was given only to the detection of bacterial spoilage, in terms of microbiological analysis, whereas no attempt was made to associ-ate spectral data with quality classes de fi ned by sensory assess-ment of the samples. FTIR spectral data collected directly from the surface of meat had been veri fi ed that they could be used as biochemical interpretable  X  signatures  X  , in an attempt to obtain information on early stage detection of microbial spoilage of chicken breast and rump steaks ( Ellis et al., 2002 ). An MLP-based
NN has been also explored in an attempt to correlate spectral data from FTIR spectroscopy analysis with beef spoilage and its asso-ciated total viable bacteria counts-TVC ( Argyri et al., 2010 ). A rapid and non-destructive determination of pork storage time associated with its freshness has been recently considered with the aid of
FTIR and MLP networks ( Chen et al., 2011 ), while the spoilage of fresh minced pork was examined through the use of FTIR and PLS models ( Papadopoulou et al., 2011 ). 2. FTIR sampling and analysis
The FTIR experimental case was performed at the Laboratory of Microbiology and Biotechnology of Foods, at the Agricultural
University of Athens, Greece. A detailed description of the experimental methodology, as well as the related microbiologi-cal analysis of the meat samples, is described in ( Argyri et al., 2010 ). Brie fl y, the samples were prepared by cutting fresh pieces of beef into small portions (40 mm wide 50 mm long 10 mm thick) and then portions placed onto Petri dishes and stored at  X  0 ; 5 ; 10 ; 15 and 20 1 C  X  in high-precision incubation chambers for a total period of 350 h, taking into consideration the storage temperature, until spoilage was apparent ( SYMBIOSIS Project, 2009 ).

For the purposes of FTIR spectral measurements, a thin slice of the aerobic upper surface of the beef fi llet was isolated and used for additional analysis. In total, 74 FTIR spectra were produced through the use of a using a ZnSe 45 o ATR (Attenuated Total
Re fl ectance) crystal on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR Spectrometer. Spectra collected over the speci fi c wave-number range 1800 1000 cm 1 , which is considered as the area where spoilage signals are expected to be detected ( Argyri et al., 2010 ). Typical FTIR spectral data collected from fresh and spoiled beef fi llet samples stored at 10 o C for 6 days are shown in Fig. 1 . Different colours represent samples collected at various sampling times. For example, sample 10F2 has been collected after 8 h storage, while 10F18 is associated with a sample with storage of 148 h. Two curves associated to F1a and F1b are considered as measurements that correspond to the initialisation of the FTIR procedure, at t  X  0s( SYMBIOSIS Project, 2009 ). Comparison of those FTIR spectra can reveal knowledge on particular biochemical changes taking place during beef spoilage, at various temperatures. For example, the highest peak 1640 cm 1 is due to the presence of moisture with an essential contribution from amide I in the beef sample. The second peak at 1550 cm 1 is due to the absorbance of amide II, while peaks at 1460 ; 1240 1175 cm 1 can be credited to fat. These FTIR spectra were initially subjected to smoothing according to the Savitzky  X  Golay algorithm ( Argyri et al., 2010 ).
 resulting growth data from plate counts were log 10 transformed and fi tted to the primary model of Baranyi and Roberts (1994 )in order to verify the kinetic parameters of microbial growth (maximum speci fi c growth rate and lag phase duration). The growth curves of total viable counts (TVC) for beef fi llet storage at different temperatures under aerobic conditions are illustrated in Fig. 2 .
 2 : 9 3 : 3 log 10 cfu cm 2 at the beginning of storage (fresh sam-ples) to 8 : 7 9 : 4 log 10 cfu cm 2 for samples characterised as spoiled. This fi nding is consistent with an indication that the population threshold that depicts the shift of a sample from fresh to semi-fresh and then from semi-fresh to spoiled is temperature dependant. Additionally, sensory evaluation of meat samples was performed during storage, based on the perception of colour and smell before and after cooking. Each sensory attribute was assigned to a three-point scale corresponding to: 1  X  fresh; 2  X  semi-fresh; and 3  X  spoiled. In total, 74 meat samples were evaluated by a sensory panel and classi fi ed into the selected three groups as fresh ( n  X  24), semi-fresh ( n  X  16), and spoiled ( n ( SYMBIOSIS Project, 2009 ).

FTIR spectral data used for training purposes. This choice was initiated mainly by two reasons. The original FTIR spectral data is considered as a high-dimensional problem, thus it could be prohibited for utilising a learning-based model ( i.e. , excessive number of input variables). Secondly, the strong correlation among the FTIR variables ( i.e ., wave-numbers), would deteriorate ser-iously the modelling procedure. PCA scheme was implemented in MATLAB, with the aid of PLS_Toolbox (ver. 7.5, Eigenvector.com).
For this particular experimental case study, although the total variance (100%) of the dataset was explained by 34 principal components (PCs), only the fi rst fi ve PCs were associated with the 98.25% of the total variance, as shown in Table 1 . overall contribution and this is also illustrated from a visualisation of the fi rst three orthonormal principal component coef fi each variable, and the principal component scores for each observation in a single plot, as shown at Fig. 3 .
 were extracted and utilised as inputs to the various simulation models applied on this particular dataset. 3. Adaptive Fuzzy Logic System (AFLS) systems inherently associated with nonlinearity, high-order dynamics and imprecise measurements, there is need for a relevant modelling environment. During the last decade, neuro-fuzzy net-work (NF) approaches have gained considerable interest for solving real world problems, including modelling of highly complex systems and pattern recognition. Extensive experimentation has demon-strated that the class of feed-forward NF systems exhibits signi advantages compared to the NN models ( Kodogiannis and
Anagnostakis, 2002 ). NNs are well-known to act as global models, where training is performed on the entire pattern range. In contrast, owing to the partition of the input space, NF models perform a fuzzy blending of local models in space. As a result, faster convergence is learning-based training algorithms for the tuning of fuzzy logic parameters, the ef fi ciency of function approximation can be largely improved. Examples of NF systems as modelling structures include schemes such as ANFIS, Fuzzy RBF, and Fuzzy Adaptive learning Control Network (FALCON) ( Rutkowska, 2002 ).
 3.1. AFLS architecture
A Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) is a system that utilises fuzzy set theory and its operations to solve a given problem. A speci of FLS with fuzzi fi er and defuzzi fi er components is used through-out this study. Various methods have been used in defuzzi section, such as  X  centre average  X  ,  X  centroid of area  X   X  centroid of area  X  approach is an optimal answer to defuzzi because it uses all available information to compute the output.
One major problem, however, with the centroid defuzzi fi er is its intensive computation. The  X  centre average  X  ( CA ) defuzzi the other hand, is more ef fi cient in terms of implementation. Its main disadvantage is that it suffers from not utilising the entire shape of the consequent membership function. The output of a CA defuzzi fi er is still the same, regardless of whether the shape is narrow or wide ( Mendel, 1995 ). In general, an adaptive fuzzy logic system is a FLS where its rules are derived and extracted from given training data. Since we have general ideas about the structure and effect of each rule, it is straightforward to effectively initialise each rule. This is a tremendous advantage of AFLS over its NN counterpart. The  X  centroid  X  defuzzi fi er however cannot be used also due to the presence of gradient-descent learning algorithm.

The proposed AFLS scheme consists of an alternative defuzzi-fi cation approach, the area of balance (AOB), and its structure is shown in Fig. 4 ( Kodogiannis et al., 2008 ). In this architecture, the fuzzy basis layer consists of fuzzy basis nodes for each rule. A fuzzy basis node has the following form:  X  x  X  X 
 X  where  X  m  X  x  X  is a fuzzy basis node for rule m and  X  m  X  membership value of rule m . Since a product-inference is utilised, the fuzzy basis node  X  m  X  x  X  is in the following form:  X  x  X  X   X  n
 X  where  X  F m
In the proposed scheme, a  X  Gaussian-shape  X  membership function has been employed, thus  X  F m
 X  where c m i and b m i are the centre and spread parameters of the membership function i th input of the m th rule. The  X  centroid of area  X  defuzzi fi cation method returns the centroid of the area formed by the consequent membership function, the membership value of its rules and the max-min or max-product inference.
In the case of a discrete universe, the centroid calculation yields y  X  where Q is a number of quantisation levels of the output. The higher Q is the fi ner y will be. The computational cost increases analogous to Q . However, since the method provides good perfor-mance, its main characteristics, such as centre of gravity and use of the shape of membership function, have been adopted in the design of the proposed defuzzi fi cation approach.
 inference ( Kosko, 1992 ). The proposed defuzzi fi cation method can be explained by the following mass-less beam example. Let us consider the density ( D ), which is de fi nedasmass( M ) per unit volume ( V ). D  X  M V  X  5  X 
Under the assumption that we use the same material and all shapes have the same thickness, T ,then

 base of that shape. For example, if we use a triangular shape and product-inference as a t -norm, then the shape of the consequent part of rule m will be shown as in Fig. 5 . If we could consider the consequent part of each rule placed on the massless beam having the pivot point at origin, then such visualisation is shown in Fig. 6 .

Assume that D in Eq. (6) is the same, thus, y  X   X 
The calculation of area A will be depended upon the type of membership function used. Under the assumption of symmetric shape, this method will have comparable capability with the centroid calculation method to approximate the output from the fuzzy set in the consequent part.

By utilising the triangle shape as a membership function and the usage of max-product inference ( i.e. , Larsen logic), the shaded area A will be derived as follows:
A  X  1 2
Deriving from Eq. (10) , the output, y will be y  X   X 
In general form, the calculation of the output, y will be y  X  where y : the p th output of the network. m : the membership value of the m th rule.

L : the spread parameter of the membership function in the consequent part of the p th output of the m th rule. : the centre of the membership function in the consequent part of the p th output of the m th rule. 3.2. AFLS learning phase procedure
The learning algorithm of AFLS involves the use of the back propagation/gradient descent (BP/GD) method to identify the various parameters. During, the backward  X  training  X  pass, the error signals are calculating recursively from the output layer backward to the hidden ( i.e. , rules) layer, and parameters at function for training is de fi ned as J  X   X  K where K is the number of training patterns and J k is the sum of squared error for the k th pattern. Then, J k is de fi ned as: J  X  1 where Pd p is the desired response of the p th output. Variable y  X  x k  X  is de fi ned as in Eq. (13) is the number of outputs and. The update equation of y m p is as in the form y  X  n  X  1  X  X  y m p  X  n  X  X  m y  X  y m p  X  n  X  y m p  X  n 1  X   X  where  X 
J  X  where y k p is the p th output of the network corresponding to the k th pattern and  X  k m is the membership value of the m th rule corre-sponding to the k th pattern in the training data. The update equation of L m p is in the following form: L  X  n  X  1  X  X  L m p  X  n  X  X  m L  X  L m p  X  n  X  L m p  X  n 1  X   X  where  X

A machine learning approach, based on the proposed AFLS model, has been adopted in order to create a decision support system acting in three quality classes (fresh, semi-fresh, spoiled), as well as a prediction system. The real challenge in this paper is to propose a learning-based structure which co uld be considered as a new bench-mark method towards the development of ef fi cient intelligent meth-ods in food quality analysis. For this reason, the produced results are compared against MLP and PLS schemes, which are considered as well-recognised tools in chemometric analysis. The dataset, consisted of 74 beef patterns, include information from the various storage temperatures, the fi rst fi ve PCs and the sampling times.
In this research study, two distinct procedures have been considered. In the fi rst procedure, as the number of observa-tions/samples is small, the separation of the dataset into training and testing subsets (hold-out method) was considered that it would further reduce the number of data and would result in insuf fi cient training of the network. Therefore, in order to improve the robustness of identi fi cation process, the leave-1-out cross validation technique was employed to evaluate the performance of the developed AFLS model.
 more effective modelling tool against to classic MLP networks. Its structure, as shown from Fig. 4 , consists of an input layer which in this current research study contains seven input nodes ( i.e. , storage temperature, sampling time, and the values of the fi ve principal components). The second layer is related to the inference engine 12 rules are necessary for the proposed AFLS model to achieve an acceptable performance for this particular case/experiment. The number of membership functions for each input variable is directly associated to the number of rules, hence, each input signal is  X  distributed  X  through Gaussian functions with different centres and widths to every rule node via a product operator. The values of the parameters (centres and widths) of the Gaussian membership functions have been adjusted by the learning procedure. The output layer consists of two nodes, corresponding to the predicted quality class (fresh, semi-fresh, spoiled) of meat samples and the total viable counts (TVC), respectively.
 quality class is related to microbiological counts and vice versa ,a model that combines both these measurements have been consid-ered to be desirable. In orde r to accommodate both classi modelling tasks in the same model-structure, the classi fi has been modi fi ed accordingly. Rather than trying to create a distinct classi fi er, an attempt has been made to  X  model  X  the classes ( Kodogiannis, et al., 2008 ). Initially, values of 10, 20 and 30, have been used respectively, to associate the three classes with a cluster centre. During the identi fi cation process, the output values of 5 were associated to  X  fresh  X  class with cluster centre 10, values of  X  were associated to  X  semi-fresh  X  class with cluster centre 20, and fi nally values of 25 : 01 ... 35  X  were associated to class with cluster centre 30. The second output node has been assigned to the total viable counts (TVC).
 mined by the number of correctly classi fi ed samples in each sensory class divided by the total number of samples in the class.
The performance of the model in the prediction of TVC for each meat sample was determined by the bias ( B f ) and accuracy ( A factors, the mean relative percentage residual (MRPE) and the mean absolute percentage residual (MAPR), and fi nally by the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the standard error of prediction (SEP) ( Panagou, et al., 2007 ). Results revealed that the classi tion accuracy of the AFLS model was very satisfactory in the characterisation of beef samples, indicating the advantage of a neurofuzzy approach in tackling complex, nonlinear problems, such as meat spoilage. The classi fi cation accuracy obtained from AFLS, is presented in the form of a confusion matrix in Table 2 . 95.83%, 87.5% and 100% for fresh, semi-fresh and spoiled meat samples, respectively. The sensitivities ( i.e ., how good the network is at identifying correctly the positive samples) for fresh and spoiled meat samples reveal one (even marginally) out of 24 fresh meat samples, and also zero misclassi fi cations out of 34 spoiled samples. One spoiled meat sample was accurately classi fi spoiled, even marginally. In the case of semi-fresh samples, two samples out of 16 were misclassi fi ed, as fresh ones. The speci index ( i.e. , how good the network is at identifying correctly the negative samples) was also high, indicating satisfactory dis-crimination between these three classes ( Table 2 ). It is character-istic that no fresh samples were misclassi fi ed as spoiled and vice versa , indicating that the biochemical information provided by
FTIR data could discriminate these two classes accurately. Lower percentages were obtained for semi-fresh samples ( ca. 87.5%) with incorrect classi fi cations in the fresh class. It must be emphasised however that the number of examined samples within each class was not equally distributed, due to the different spoilage rate of beef samples at the different temperatures. The lower accuracies obtained in the semi-fresh class could be also attributed to the performance of the sensory evaluation process, as the difference between  X  fresh  X  and  X  semi-fresh  X  class is not very obvious sometimes.

The common measure of goodness-of-fi t for model comparison in food microbiology is performed by calculating the squared correlation coef fi cient ( R 2 )( Ross et al., 2005 ). The index R often used as an overall measure of the prediction attained. It measures the fraction of the variation about the mean that is explained by a model. The higher the value (0 r R 2 r 1), the better is the prediction by the model. The AFLS developed herein was found to yield a good agreement with experimental observations for the test data set. The overall value of 0.98% for the index R indicates a very good fi t of the experimental data from the AFLS-based approach. The individual R 2 values for fresh, semi-fresh and spoiled cases were 0.923%, 0.95% and 0.93% respectively. However,
R is a criterion for model comparison on the assumption that the error is normally distributed and not dependent on the mean value; In fact, the distribution of the error is not clearly known in the case of microbial/bacteria growth, so this term must be used with caution, particularly in non-linear regression models and hence additional indices must be employed for model comparison ( Amina, et al., 2012 ).

The plot of predicted versus observed total viable counts is illustrated in Fig. 7 , and shows a very good distribution around the line of equity ( y  X  x ), with all the data included within the unit area. The performance of the AFLS model is also presented in
Fig. 8 , where the % relative error of prediction is illustrated against the observed microbial population. Based on this plot, data was almost equally distributed above and below 0, with all (expect one) predicted microbial counts included within the 7 20% RE zone. That particular microbial count is associated with the fresh  X  0F4  X  sample, which corresponds to a beef fi llet, stored at 0 collected after 72 h of storage. Fig. 2 reveals the reason for such behaviour. The  X  0F4  X  sample is the third sample at the 0 curve. An inspection at the shape of that curve illustrates a deep drop after the fi rst two samples, while the curve is increasing throughout subsequent sampling time. The performance of the AFLS model to predict TVCs in beef samples in terms of statistical indices is presented in Table 3 .

Bias factor ( B f ) is a multiplicative factor that compares model predictions and is used to determine whether the model over-or under-predicts the response time of bacterial growth. A B than 1.0 indicates that a growth model is fail-dangerous. Equally, a B less than 1.0 generally indicates that a growth model is fail-safe ( i.e. , observed generation times were larger than predicted values), so that predicted values give a margin of safety. Perfect agreement between predictions and observations would lead to B f of 1. Based on the calculated values of the bias factor B f , it can be concluded that the AFLS model over-estimated total viable counts in semi-fresh samples ( B f 4 1), whereas for fresh samples under-estimation of microbial population was evident ( B f o 1) and almost perfect for spoiled samples (1.008).

The accuracy factor A f is a simple multiplicative factor that indicates the spread of results about the prediction. A value of one indicates that there is perfect agreement between all the predicted and measured values. In our case, the values of the accuracy factor A f indicated that the predicted total viable counts were 7.37%, 6.26%, and 3.74% different from the observed values for fresh, semi-fresh, and spoiled meat samples, respectively. Regarding the appropriate values of the accuracy factor A f , it has been reported ( Ross et al., 2005 ) that an increase of 0.15 (15%) would be acceptable for each independent variable included in model development. Therefore, in our study, with only one independent variable ( i.e. , temperature), any value of A f up to 1.15, could be considered to be satisfactory.

The mean relative percentage residual index (MRPR) similarly veri fi ed the over-prediction for semi-fresh and spoiled samples (MRPR o 0) and under-prediction for fresh samples (MRPR 4 whereas the values of mean absolute percentage residual (MAPR), representing the average deviation between observed and pre-dicted counts, veri fi ed the information provided by the accuracy factor. The RMSE values of the AFLS were very low for all samples, with an overall indicator of 0.373. This index is calculated between the desired and output values and then averaged across all data. It can be used as an estimation of the goodness of fi t of the models. It can also provide information about how consistent the model would be in the long run ( Amina et al., 2012 ).

Finally, the standard error of prediction (SEP) index is a relative typical deviation of the mean prediction values and expresses the expected average error associated with future predictions. It has the advantage of being independent on the magnitude of the measurements ( Amina et al., 2012 ). The lower the value of this index is, the better the capability of the model to predict microbial counts in new meat samples. The value of the index was 5.67% for the overall samples indicating good performance of the network for microbial count predictions in this class ( Table 3 ), with also very low values (4.4%) for spoiled samples. However in the case of fresh samples, the index gave higher values ( i.e. , 8.58%) as the network under-estimated microbial counts for some fresh beef samples.

An MLP network has been also developed on the same FTIR dataset, employing the leave-1-out validation method. After a few trials, the MLP was constructed with two hidden layers (with 12 and 6 nodes respectively) and two output nodes, one for the sensory class and one for the TVCs. The classi fi cation accuracy obtained from MLP, is presented in the form of a confusion matrix in Table 4 . The model overall achieved a 90.54% correct classi tion, with 87.5%, 81.25% and 97.06% for fresh, semi-fresh and spoiled meat samples, respectively. The related sensitivities repre-sent 3 misclassi fi cations out of 24 fresh meat samples, and one misclassi fi cation out of 34 spoiled samples. In the case of semi-fresh samples the respective fi gure was somehow lower (81.25%). In this case, 3 samples were misclassi fi ed (out of 16), two as fresh and one as spoiled cases.
 shown in Fig. 9 a, reveals a reasonable good distribution around the line of equity without any particular trend, with the majority of data ( ca. 90.54%) included within the 7 1 log unit area. Three samples were in the border-line of the 7 1 log unit area, while four samples (3 spoiled and one semi-fresh) were placed outside that unit area. A more comprehensive picture of the prediction performance of the MLP is given in Fig. 9 b where the % relative error of prediction is depicted against the observed microbial population. Based on this plot, approximately 91.89% of predicted microbial counts included within the 7 20% RE zone. The perfor-mance of the MLP network in predicting TVC in meat samples in terms of statistical indices is presented in Table 5 . An MLP implementation of the same FTIR dataset has been considered recently, however with a much simpler structure ( Argyri et al., 2010 ).
More speci fi cally, an MLP with one hidden layer (with 10 nodes) and two outputs managed to perform the same task, however with worse results. The overall RMSE was 0.850, while the overall SEP was increased to 12.94%. It is well known that a two-hidden MLP structure enjoys a better performance against its single-hidden MLP counter-part, and such results simply proved that concept.

Although both AFLS and MLP share the same learning training algorithm, i.e. , the gradient descent method, the different phy  X  in building the neurofuzzy architecture, allowed AFLS to achieve such superior performance. In MLP models, all normalised inputs are fed to the hidden layer, while in the case of AFLS, each input is fuzzi fi ed/decomposed through Gaussians membership functions. As the number of these membership functions is equal to the numbers of rules, this architecture has advantages over the classic ANFIS neurofuzzy model. The increased number of Gaussian membership functions increases the localisation of the input signal while in the same time maintains the required number of rules at low level. This localisation spread through the membership functions, is one advan-tage against the classic MLP structure. The proposed defuzzi scheme improves also the fi nal output, against a simple sigmoid function as it is the case for MLP. Both schemes have been imple-mented in MATLAB (ver. R2012a, Mathworks.com).
 Partial least squares (PLS) regression approaches, similarly to
NNs, have the ability to relate the input and output variables without having any pre-knowledge on physics of the system provided an accurate and adequate amount of data on the system variables is available ( Singh et al., 2009 ). The PLS method is a linear multivariate regression method that projects the input output data down in to a latent space, extracting a number of principal factors with an orthogonal structure, while capturing most of the variance in the original data.

PLS derives its usefulness from its ability to analyse data with strongly collinear, noisy and numerous variables in the predictor matrix X and response Y . The PLS model was constructed using the same input vector as in the cases of AFLS and MLP, and the PLS_Toolbox software (ver. 7.5, Eigenvector.com) in association with MATLAB was used to perform the PLS analysis. The nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm (NIPALS) has been chosen as the appropriate learning scheme. The related plot of the predicted versus the observed TVCs, as shown in Fig. 10 , reveals a satisfactory, but inferior to MLP and AFLS, distribution around the line of equity without any particular trend, with the majority of data ( ca. 67.56%) included within the 7 1 log unit area. The performance of the PLS regression model in predicting TVC in meat samples in terms of statistical indices is presented in Table 6 .
Although in general, PLS results are worse than those from MLP, special attention should be paid to the cases of fresh samples. Both SEP and Accuracy factor indicators are very extremely high and such behaviour could be explained by an inspection at Fig. 10 . Four fresh samples,  X  15F2  X  ,  X  20F4  X  ,  X  20F2  X  and  X  20F3  X  spond to collection after 6 h, 12 h, 4 h and 8 h of storage respec-tively, are placed far away from the 7 1 log unit area. Fig. 2 illustrates the behaviour of 15 o C and 20 o C growth curves, where a very abrupt behaviour can be noticed especially for the 20 curve at low sampling times. However, such results from PLS are expected, as it is well known that in modelling of real processes, linear PLS has some dif fi culties in its practical applications since most real problems are inherently nonlinear and dynamic ( Lee et al., 2006 ).

The FTIR data analysis utilising the leave-1-out cross validation method was imposed by the relative number of experimental samples. In order to investigate further the capabilities of AFLS model in this joint problem of classi fi cation/prediction, a second experiment was carried out, where the initial FTIR dataset was divided into a training subset with approx. 75% of the data, and a testing subset with the remaining 25% ( i.e. , 19 samples). An MLP network has been also developed for comparison reasons, to associate the same spectral data from FTIR analysis with beef spoilage during aerobic storage at different temperatures.
The proposed AFLS model has been also utilised in this second simulation study, in order to assess its competence to be trained with a dataset with a reduced number of samples. For this particular case, after trials, it has been found that only 10 rules were necessary for the proposed model to achieve an acceptable performance for this particular case/experiment. The training set consisted of 55 samples, while 19 (7 fresh, 5 semi-fresh and 7 spoiled) meat samples were included in the testing subset.
Table 7 illustrates these testing results. It has to be mentioned however, that one fresh meat sample, although formally cate-gorised as positive, its value was almost identical to the cut-off threshold, therefore it could be considered it as a  X  grey In addition, AFLS's second output modelled successfully the vs. the observed TVC for the testing dataset, have shown reason-ably good distribution around the line of equity without any particular trend, with the majority of data ( ca. 89.47%) included within the 7 1 log unit area. The semi-fresh  X  10F7  X  sample is clearly out of the 7 1 log unit area, while the spoiled  X  is on the borderline. Another fresh sample ( i.e. ,  X  0F5 placed very close to the borderline.  X  10F7  X  sample corresponds to a beef sample stored at 10 o C and collected after 52 h of storage,  X  5F9  X  corresponds to a beef sample stored at 5 o C and collected after 192 h of storage and fi nally  X  0F5  X  corresponds to a beef sample stored at 0 o C and collected after 96 h of storage. evident. A more comprehensible picture of the AFLS's prediction performance is provided in Fig. 11 b, where the % relative error of prediction is shown against the observed microbial population.
Based on this plot, data were distributed above and below 0, with approximately 89.47% of predicted microbial counts included within the 7 20% RE zone. Samples  X  10F7  X  and  X  0F5  X  are placed outside the 7 20% RE zone. The performance of the AFLS model to predict TVCs in beef samples for this second simulation, in terms of statistical indices is presented in Table 8 . Based on the calculated values of the bias factor B f it can be assumed that the neurofuzzy network under-estimated TVCs in semi-fresh and spoiled samples ( B f o 1), whereas for fresh samples over-estimation of microbial population was evident ( B f 4 1). The overall B f was almost optimal ( ca. 1.007). In addition, the values of the accuracy factor A f indicated that the predicted TVCs were 11.8%, 7.8%, and 3.1% different from the observed values for fresh, semi-fresh, and spoiled meat samples, respectively. However, a closer comparison of AFLS performance for these two simulation case studies reveals a problem with the limited number of samples for training. The SEP index is much worse in this second case, and this re fl ects an open problem in learning-based systems, i.e. , the need to have as large as possible training datasets.

The performance of the MLP model using the reduced training dataset, although it could be considered as satisfactory, it is rather inferior compared to MLP's performance from the previous case.
The calculated correct classi fi cations were similar to the previous case ( i.e. , leave-1-out case). More speci fi cally, the classi fresh, semi-fresh and spoiled beef samples were 85.71%, 80.0% and 100% respectively, whereas the overall correct classi fi cation (accu-racy) for MLP test dataset was 89.47%. The semi-fresh  X  15F10 sample, which corresponds to a beef sample stored at 15 o collected after 48 h of storage, was classi fi ed as spoiled, whereas the fresh  X  15F5  X  sample, which corresponds to a beef sample stored at 15 o C and collected after 24 h of storage, was classi semi-fresh case. Table 9 illustrates the MLP-based testing classi cation results.

The related plot of the predicted versus the observed TVCs, as shown in Fig. 12 a, reveals a reasonable good distribution around the line of equity without any particular trend, with the majority of data ( ca. 84.21%) included within the 7 1 log unit area. Three samples (2 fresh and one spoiled) were outside the border-line of the 7 1 log unit area. A more complete picture of the prediction performance of the MLP is given in Fig. 12 b where the % relative error of prediction is depicted against the observed microbial population. Based on this plot, approximately 78.94% of predicted microbial counts included within the 7 20% RE zone. The above two diagrams reveal some similarities. Samples  X  15F5  X  and which are placed outside the 7 1 log unit area at Fig. 12 a, also are responsible for the high relative errors at Fig. 12 b, with 48.76% and 28.86% respectively. Sample  X  0F2  X  corresponds to a beef sample stored at 0 o C and collected after 24 h of storage. The performance of the MLP model in predicting TVCs for beef samples for this second simulation, in terms of statistical indices is presented in Table 10 .

The overall RMSE for the MLP was 0.8133, while the overall SEP was increased to 12.73%. However, an interesting issue from both Fig. 12 a and Table 10 is related with the performance of semi-fresh samples. In comparison with the related AFLS case, MLP model managed to predict more accurately the growth dynamics of semi-fresh samples. The related SEP was 5.97%, compared to 10.7% for the case of AFLS. The related SEP indices for spoiled and especially the fresh samples were however worse in this case.

Overall results revealed that both classi fi cation and prediction accuracies of the AFLS model were better compared with the performances of MLP and PLS, in the characterisation of meat samples for this reduced number of samples, indicating again the superiority of a neurofuzzy approach in tackling complex, non-linear problems such as the meat spoilage. 5. Conclusions
In conclusion, this simulation study demonstrated the effec-tiveness of the detection approach based on FTIR spectroscopy which in combination with an appropriate machine learning strategy could become an effective tool for monitoring meat spoilage during aerobic storage at various temperatures. The collected spectra could be considered as biochemical  X  signatures  X  containing information for the discrimination of meat samples in quality classes corresponding to different spoilage levels, whereas in the same time could be used to predict satisfactorily the microbial load directly from the sample surface. In this research study we have developed a neurofuzzy identi fi cation mode for the classi fi cation/prediction of meat spoilage cases through the use of
FTIR spectral information. Results and comparison with MLP networks and PLS regression models revealed an overall very satisfactory accuracy, with an exception however for the case of  X  semi-fresh  X  samples in the second simulation case study. The current research however revealed two open problems. The use of any machine learning method cannot be considered as panacea to problems that include sensorial devices. It is well known that PLS regression models do have problems in modelling high nonlinear dynamics problems ( Amina et al., 2010 ). An MLP network, due to the use of sigmoid activation functions in its structure, utilises a  X  global-learning strategy  X  compared to  X  local-learning strategy models that utilise Gaussian Activation functions ( Ham and
Kostanic, 2001 ). Latter models are less prone to dimensionality problems as each single neuron-node de fi nes a multi-dimensional hyper-sphere in the input domain and they are considered to be more accurate in terms of prediction performance. In AFLS model, such hyper-sphere was de fi ned through the use of a Gaussian activation function placed on the fuzzy membership functions of the input variables. There is need to explore further the use of hybrid intelligent systems, and this paper has attempted for the fi rst time to associate FTIR spectra with such systems. The AFLS performance although very convincing, discloses however a sec-ond open problem, that is the need to have or  X  create  X  larger training datasets, even with the presence of small amount of real experimental data. Research work is in progress to develop algorithms based on fuzzy logic that will generate  X  virtual spectral data from limited experimental spectral meat samples.
