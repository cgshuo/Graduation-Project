 1. Introduction
Regression analysis is one of the most popular statistical techniques enabling identification of functional relationship between independent and dependent variables, when both the independent and dependent variables are given as real numbers. However, in many real-life situations, we cannot obtain such standard observations and can only have fuzzy data. Therefore, such real-life situations are quite often outside the scope of the classical regression analysis ( Bargiela et al., 2007 ), and the classical regression should be extended to deal with fuzzy data. Recent years emerge a surge of literatures about real applications of various artificial intelligence techniques in different engineer-ing fields (without claiming of completeness, see Refs. ( Chau, 2006 ; Muttil and Chau, 2007 ; Cheng et al., 2002 ; Lin et al., 2006 ; Jia et al., 2008 ; Xie et al., 2006 ). In this paper, we focus on the fuzzy regression topic as well as its applications.

Originally,  X  X  X lassical X  X  statisticians intuitively consider the fuzzy data as ordinal data in an artificial way, e.g., by  X  X 1, 2, 3, y  X  X  for a rating with respect to the precise scale. Then the classical statistical regression can be directly applied. Such intui-tion may induce some disadvantages, as remarked by Nather (2006) . In real sense, the fuzzy regression model was first introduced by Tanaka et al. (1980 , 1982) . In recent years, there is a growing literature that formalizes the linear regression model in a fuzzy domain, in which model parameters and/or data are fuzzy, or imprecise, or vague (without claiming of completeness, Chang, 2001 ; Chang and Ayyub, 2001 ; Chang and Lee, 1996 ; Diamond and Tanaka, 1998 ; D X  X rso, 2003 ; D X  X rso et al., 2011 ; Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi, 1992 ; Kim and Bishu, 1998 ; Korner and Nather, 1998 ; Lee and Chen, 2001 ; Nather, 1994 , 2006 ; Sakawa and Yano, 1992 ; Wang and Tsaur, 2000 ).
 There are two main approaches to fuzzy regression analysis. The first one is the possibilistic approach introduced by Tanaka et al. (1980 , 1982) . According to this approach, fuzzy regression coefficients are estimated minimizing the fuzziness of the esti-mated response variable, conditional to the constraint that each estimated value lies within a given interval defined on the observed values of the response variable. The second one is the least-square (LS) approach ( Celmins, 1987a , 1987b ; Diamond, 1988 ; D X  X rso et al., 2011 ), which extends the LS criterion to the fuzzy setting. This estimation procedure consists in finding the linear model which best approximates the observed data in a given metric space, taking into account the fuzziness of the data. For the interested reader, see Refs. ( Celmins, 1987a , 1987b ; Chang, 2001 ; Chang and Ayyub, 2001 ; Diamond, 1988 ; Ming 2011 ).

In the above mentioned fuzzy regression models, the fuzzy data are viewed implicitly or definitely as realizations of fuzzy random variables. In the literature, there have been proposed two views of fuzzy data ( Gebhardt et al., 1998 ). The first one assumes the data to be intrinsically fuzzy and uses the mathematical formalism of fuzzy random variables. The second one is based on an epistemic interpretation of fuzzy data, which are assumed to  X  X  X mperfectly specify a value that is existing and precise, but not measurable with exactitude under the given observation condi-tions X  X . In the second viewpoint, a fuzzy datum is thus seen as a possibility distribution associated to a precise realization of a random variable that has been only partially observed. According to such viewpoint, Denoeux (2011) proposes a new fuzzy regres-sion model by using fuzzy EM algorithm. Denoeux X  X  model provides a new and well motivated solution with very simple interpretation. As will be shown, however, this model cannot deal with the problem where the nonlinearity exists.
 2010 ; Kim et al., 2008 ; Nasrabadi and Hashemi, 2008 ), one of which is the nonlinear problem. All the aforementioned approaches are naturally linear or too complex to be used, and thus cannot be used to or cannot be easily used to deal with nonlinear problems. In practice real word systems are nonlinear and complex. Therefore, it is desirable to propose a nonlinear regression model dealing with fuzzy data. Nasrabadi and Hashemi (2008) suggest a robust fuzzy regression extending the risk-neutral model proposed by Modarres et al. (2004 , 2005) to a nonlinear fuzzy regression model using multilayered feed for-ward neural networks where weights, biases, input and output variables are assumed to be LR (Left and Right) type fuzzy. In practical engineering, some process parameters, taken as the independent variables (i.e., inputs), can usually be precisely observed, and only the process parameter, taken as dependent variable (i.e., output), can be imprecisely observed or monitored.
In such an example, the unmeasured parameter is defined in Refs. ( Su and Wang, 2009 ; Su et al., 2010 ). In addition, the model with precise structure parameters is efficient and easy to be realized in the view point of practice engineering. Therefore, Nasrabadi and Hashemi X  X  model is inefficient in such case.
 simple way used to deal with nonlinear fuzzy regression problem where inputs and model structure parameters are crisp but output is fuzzy. In this study, we focus on such topic. The main contribution of this study is that, a novel version of nonlinear fuzzy regression model, called kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model, is proposed by introducing the strategy of kernel into Denoeux X  X  model. This model can deal with regression problems where nonlinearity exists and it has high prediction accuracy and is easily to be implemented in practice. introduces the maximum likelihood estimation strategy based on fuzzy EM algorithm. Section 3 proposes the kernel based non-linear fuzzy regression model with two numerical experiments.
Section 4 presents a practical engineering application of the proposed nonlinear fuzzy regression model in power plant.
Section 5 concludes the paper. 2. Fuzzy EM algorithm based maximum likelihood estimation strategy for the consequent work in this paper. The interested reader may refer to article ( Denoeux, 2011 ) for a thorough treatment on the subject. To format the expressions in sequel, we admit the following nomenclature: capital letter in bold denotes matrix, lowercase letter in bold denotes column vector, italic letter denotes scalar variable, and letter with hat  X  X   X  X  denotes fuzzy number. Without confusion, the italic capital letter is used to indicate random vector variable.
 vector, taking value in sample space X and describing the result of a random experiment. The probability density function (p.d.f.) of
X is denoted by g ( x , w ), where w  X  ( c 1 , c 2 , y , c vector of unknown parameters with parameter space O , where superscript  X  X  X  X  X  indicates transposition.
 maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of w as any value maximiz-ing the complete-data likelihood function: L  X  w ; x  X  X  g  X  x ; w  X  X  1  X 
Therefore, the complete-data lik elihood function (1) should be extended. Given ~ x and assume its membership function to be the
Borel measurable, the probability of fuzzy set ~ x can be computed according to Zadeh X  X  definition of the probability of a fuzzy event ( Zadeh, 1968 ). Thus, the observed-data likelihood in the imprecise setting can then be defined as.
 L  X  w ; ~ x  X  X  P  X  ~ x ; w  X  X  is a realization of an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random vector X  X  ( X 1 , X 2 , y , X n ) T , and assuming the joint membership function m ~ x to be decomposed in the product of the likelihood function (2) can be written as a product of n items: L  X  w ; ~ x  X  X  and the observed-data log likelihood is: logL  X  w ; ~ x  X  X  ing the observed-data log likelihood log L ( w , ~ x ) by proceeding
Each iteration of the fuzzy EM algorithm involves two steps called the expectation step (E-step) and the maximization step (M-step). Q  X  w , w  X  q  X   X  X  E w  X  q  X   X  log L  X  w ; x  X  9 ~ x  X  X  where the expectation of log L ( w , X ) is taken with respect to the conditional p.d.f. of x given ~ x , using parameter vector w g  X  x 9 ~ x ; w  X  q  X   X  X  respect to w over the parameter space O , i.e., finding such that above until the increase of observed-data likelihood becomes smaller than some threshold.
 3. Kernel based nonlinear regression with fuzzy output
Given standard data {( u i , x i ) 9 i  X  1, 2, y , n }, where u p -dimension column vector. The multiple linear regression model can be defined in the following form: x  X  u T i b  X  or in the following matrix form x  X  U T b  X  where u  X  X  is the input column vector extended by unit one from the input variables u i  X  ( u i ,1 , y , u i , p ) T , and correspondingly the U  X  X  is a ( p  X  1) ( p  X  1) matrix extended by unitary row, x is output
Evidently, the above classical regression can be used in the case when standard data can be observed but not in the case where only partial information such as fuzzy data can be obtained, To realize the multiple regression with partial informa-tion represented by fuzzy data ~ x as output, it can be assumed that each component x i of the complete-data vector x is a realization of a normal random variable X i with mean u T i b and standard deviation s , and observer encodes his/her partial knowledge of x in the form of a possibility distribution m ~ x observed data vector x is multivariate Gaussian with mean U band variance s 2 I p  X  1 associated with possibility distribution , where I p  X  1 denotes the ( p  X  1)-dimensional identity matrix. With such assumption, the complete parameter vector is thus data can be observed.

According to above interpretations, the complete-data p.d.f. can therefore be defined as g  X  x ; w  X  X  where g  X  x i ; w  X  X 
By using the complete-data p.d.f, the complete-data log like-lihood is thus: log L  X  w ; x  X  X  log L  X  w ; x  X  X  n 2 log  X  2 p  X  n log s 1 2 s 2  X  x T x 2 b
Taking the expectation of log L ( w , x ) conditionally on the observed fuzzy data and using the fit w ( q ) of w to perform the E-step, it can get Q  X  w , w  X  q  X   X  X  E w  X  q  X   X  log L  X  w ; x  X  9 ~ x  X  Q  X  w , w  X  q  X   X  X  n 2 log  X  2 p  X  n log s 1 2 s 2 (32) in Appendix A .

As can be seen in Eq. (10), a type of fuzzy number should be adopted. The popular three kinds of fuzzy numbers are triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian membership functions, respectively. The triangular fuzzy number is used here by considering the following two facts that: (1) if Gaussian fuzzy number is adopted, it can be seen that the integral in Appendix A will become more complex; and (2) it is relatively easier to define triangular fuzzy number than others in practice engineering, see in Section 4 . The M-step requires maximizing Q ( w , w ( q ) ) with respect to w . and s , which results in: @ Q  X  w , w  X  q  X   X  @ Q  X  w , w  X  q  X   X 
Equating these derivatives to zero and solving for b and s ,we get the following unique solution: b
When the iteration terminates, we can obtain the regression coefficients b and thus obtain the multiple regression model with fuzzy output. However, such model is naturally linear and has undesirable performance in the case where nonlinearity exists between the input variables and output variable. To make sure the above regression can deal with nonlinearity, there may exist a plethora of strategies. Here, we consider introducing the strategy of kernel to the above fuzzy regression model. The so-called kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model is proposed in this study. 3.1. Basic ideal and procedure
The strategy of kernel method is to mapping the data from original data space R p into a feature space H , a Hilbert space with higher dimensionality, where the nonlinear problems in the original data space can be transformed into linear problems. In such viewpoint, we can compute the inner product of samples in the feature space directly from the original data by using a kernel function k . This is based on the fact that any kernel function k : R p R p -R satisfies the Mercer X  X  theorem ( John and Nello, 2004 ). The following are some popular kernels: (1) Linear kernel k ( x , z )  X  / x , z S (2) Polynomial kernel k ( x , z )  X  (1  X  / x , z S ) s , s (3) Radial basis function (RBF) kernel k  X  x , z  X  X 
Suppose f is the associated feature mapping to kernel. If we use the linear kernel, the feature mapping f is identity map, that is, f is linear. Otherwise, the feature mapping can be nonlinear. Therefore, the polynomial kernel and RBF kernel are usually applied. In our study, the RBF kernel is habitually adopted. Note that, the polynomial kernel can also be applied equivalently. By using the kernel, the multiple linear regression in feature space H can be represented in the following general form: x i  X  or in the following matrix form x  X  where f ( u i ) are the training samples in the feature space. multiple regression model is still w  X  ( b T , s ) T . Therefore, the complete-data p.d.f. still has the same expression as that in
Eq. (9) but with different form of g ( x i , w ), defined as: g k  X  x i ; w  X  X  1 log L k  X  w ; x  X  X  log L k  X  w ; x  X  X  n 2 log  X  2 p  X  n log s 1 2 s 2  X  x T x 2 b data and using the fit w ( q ) of w to perform the E-step. More precisely, we have
Q k  X  w , w  X  q  X   X  X  E w  X  q  X   X  log L k  X  w ; x  X  9 ~ x  X  follows @ Q k  X  w , w  X  q  X   X  @ Q k  X  w , w  X  q  X   X  incomplete solution: because feature mapping f (.) involved in Eq. (15) is implicit. In such case, we can find the dual form of b ( q  X  1) instead of directly finding b ( q  X  1) . More precisely, we have following proposition.
Proposition 1. Given kernel function k . We can calculate the dual form x ( q  X  1) of regression coefficients b ( q  X  1) as follow: where K  X  1 n n  X  K with kernel matrix K , defined as
K  X 
Proof. According to Wahba X  X  Representer Theorem ( John and Nello, 2004 ), we know that the solutions of certain risk minimization problems involving an empirical ri sk term and a quadratic regular-ization can be written as expressions in terms of the training samples. It means that a solution holds its dual form if it can be represented by using training samples. From Eq. (15), we have dual form. In what follows, we calculate x ( q  X  1) instead of b
To calculate x ( q  X  1) effectively, we denote by K  X  UU T with kernel matrix K , defined as
K  X  f  X  U  X  T f  X  U  X  X  parameter s at the ( q  X  1)th iteration as follows: algorithm used to establish the so-called kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model.

We can see from Algorithm 1 that the bandwidth s in kernel function k should be predetermined before implementing the Algorithm 1. It must be pointed out that the value of bandwidth s plays important role on the performance of Algorithm 1.
Traditionally, the criterion R -square is used to validate the performance of regression model. In the kernel case, such criter-ion is infeasible in some cases, because application of R -square avoid over fitting and to predict the fit of a model to a hypothe-tical validation set when an explicit validation set is not available. Here, the CV technique is thus adopted to assess the regression results and determine the bandwidth s of the kernel function. The best compromised value for s will be obtained by minimizing the CV criterion.

The basic idea of the CV approach is to divide the sample size n into a  X  X  X onstruction X  X  subsample with a sample size n 1 and a  X  X  X alidation X  X  subsample with a sample size 1. the process must consider the division in all n possible ways. Such approach is called Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation. The LOO CV criter-ion can be defined as CV  X  s  X  X  1 n where ^ x i is the prediction of u i with the other n 1 training samples excluding the sample u i , C (.) is a loss function defined on the observed response x .

It can be seen that the outputs of training samples are triangular fuzzy number ~ x i , however, the prediction of the proposed fuzzy regression model is crisp value. To continue the computation, we apply the core of the fuzzy number. We apply such trade-off strategy by considering the fact that the prediction of the proposed fuzzy regression model should infinitely approach the core of the fuzzy output. Therefore, the Euclidean distance can be selected as the loss function. More precisely, we have CV  X  s  X  X  1 n
The estimator ^ s of bandwidth s is then obtained by minimizing the criterion CV : ^ s  X  argmin s CV  X  s  X  X  23  X 
To reduce computational complexity finding the optimal bandwidth, it is assumed s in {1, 2,, y , 20}. 3.3. Experiments
In this subsection, we present two examples to validate the performance of the proposed model. The first example is a numerical example by using a nonlinear function. In the second example, the real data set motorcycle data is used. 3.3.1. Numerical example
To demonstrate the performance of the kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model, we perform the following numerical experiment. In the numerical illustration, we suppose to approx-imate the following nonlinear function x  X  u sin u , u A  X  0 , 10
We generalize n  X  20 values u i from the uniform distribution in [0 1 0]. To model the situation where only partial knowledge of values x 1 , x 2 , y , x n is available, triangular fuzzy numbers ~ x , ~ x 2 , ... , ~ x n were generated as follows: Step 1: Generate the true values x i  X  u i sin u i randomly draw value r i from uniform distribution in [ r , r ], 0 o r o max i ( x i ), and add r i to x i , i.e., x 0 i  X  9 r i 9 is, our guess is more accurate.

Step 3: ~ x i are defined as the triangular fuzzy number with core x 0 i and support [ x 0 i  X  a i , x 0 i  X  b i ], where a i generalized according to calculus l  X  rand [0,1] 9 r i 9 , where rand [0,1] is a canonical distribution with zero mean and variance one. We suggest a i , b i Z l by considering the fact that if a i and b i are too small, the fuzzy number ~ x i will degenerate to be crisp. Here, l  X  0.5. Note that the value of l is determined according to the domain of x i .

From the operation in above Step 3, we can see that when our ~ x is smaller, otherwise, the support of fuzzy number is larger. This is in line with our intuition. To validate the prediction accuracy, the following 100 testing samples are generalized: u  X  0 : 1  X  k 1  X  , k  X  1 , 2 , ... , 100
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) criterion is used to measure the performance of our model. To view the influence of threshold r on the performance of the proposed model, we record the results when r takes different values from set {0, 1, 2, 4}. In each case, the whole experiment was repeated 100 times. The box plot of distribution of MSE over the 100 trials is presented in Fig. 1 . accurate, the MSE of our model is smaller. With the increase of guess bias r , the MSE increases. Although the bias of training samples exceeds 20% (i.e., r  X  2), our model still has high predic-tion accuracy. In the extreme case r  X  0, the MSE is zero. Fig. 2 shows one result of the 100 trials.

To show the powerful performance of our method, we also implement two popular regression methods Support Vector
Machine regression (SVM) ( John and Nello, 2004 ; Lin et al., 2006 ) and Kernel based Linear Regression (KLR) ( Li, 2010 ) 100 times, respectively. Note that, the SVM and KLR can only deal with crisp output. Here, we use the core of fuzzy numbers, i.e., x 0 outputs of SVM and KLR.

Fig. 3 that our method has high prediction accuracy, and it outperforms SVM and KLR in the most of cases. Most of all, our method can deal with fuzzy output. 3.3.2. Motorcycle data input u represents the time (in milliseconds) after a simulated impact of a motorcycle against an obstacle. The response variable x is the head acceleration of postmortem human test object (in G , acceleration of gravity). This is a classical data set composed of two parts: 67examples for training and the rest examples for the test. x x
The simple three-step strategy designed in Section 3.3.1 is still used here to model the situation where only partial knowledge of directly the values of head acceleration of postmortem human test object. By considering the large range of response variable x for the motorcycle data, the parameter r in the Step 2 in such strategy is set in {0, 10, 20, 40}. When parameter r takes a value in {0, 10, 20, 40}, we repeat the experiments 100 trials and one result was randomly selected from the 100 trials. Fig. 4 shows four results over the 100 trials when parameter r takes different values in {0, 10, 20, 40}.

In the same way, the SVM and KLS are, respectively imple-mented 100 trials when parameter r takes a value in {0, 10, 20, 40}, as those done in the Section 3.3.1. According to the experi-mental analysis for the motorcycle data, we find that the bandwidth s of RBF kernel in KLR can be determined in the same way as that done in the numerical example, whereas, using Gaussian kernel achieves bad performance by using SVM for the motorcycle data. With experimental analysis, the bandwidth in It can be seen from Fig. 5 that our method outperforms SVM and KLR in the most of cases. 4. Application to monitoring unmeasured parameter in power plant
In this section, we apply the kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model to monitor the unmeasured parameter level of coal powder filling in ball mill in power plant. Section 4.1 introduces the unmeasured parameter, as well as its importance. Section 4.2 designs an experiment to obtain running data. Section 4.3 discusses how to  X  X  X uess X  X  the unmeasured parameter based on running data and expertise, and presents them as fuzzy numbers. Section 4.4 provides the monitoring results for the unmeasured parameter by using the proposed model, and analyzes the results. 4.1. Unmeasured parameter: Level of coal powder
Let us first present the definition of the so-called unmeasured parameter as follow: Definition 1 (unmeasured parameter). The unmeasured para-meter means a family of process parameters in industrial process that cannot be monitored online and offline due the limitations of device.

Level of coal powder filling in ball mill in coal pulverizing system is such an example. Coal pulverizing system is a critical subsystem, which prepares the fine coal powder for combusting in the boiler in power plant. This system mainly consists of coal feeder, ball mill, classifier, fan, some adjustable valves and some necessary pipes with different radius. The simple structure of the coal pulverizing system is illustrated in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6 , crude coal is fed to the ball mill by coal feeder, and is pulverized by ball mill; the mill throughput 1 is classified by the classifier and the fine coal powder is given into the boiler for combusting by the fan. Among all the equipments consisting of the coal pulverizing system, the ball mill is the most important one.

The performance of ball mill is pivotal for enhancing the product ability of this system and can be efficiently evaluated by the levels of coal powder filling in the ball mill: with increasing the levels of coal powder up to a certain level value, the product ability increases; with the increasing levels of coal powder over the certain level, the product ability decreases. In view of this MSE MSE x x
MSE
MSE point, monitoring the levels of coal powder is important for the coal pulverizing system. Unfortunately, this parameter can not be measured due to limitations of the device.

In practice, the operator/expert evaluates the levels to run the mill according to one or several process parameters related to level of coal powder such as Current of Motor for driving ball mill (CM), Outlet Temperature of ball mill (OT), Inlet Pressure of ball mill (IP), inlet-outlet Pressure Difference of ball mill (PD), and vibration of the bearing housing transferring from the front and ball mill (VS)). The level of coal powder can be evaluated by using process parameters CM, OT, IP, PD, and VS, because these process parameters and the level of coal powder are nonlinearly related, i.e., these process parameters can reflect different aspects of level in different pulverizing conditions. More precisely, when the level of coal powder increases, area of cross section of mill decreases, and the decreasing area makes the removal air not move well throughout the mill tube, which leads to the increase of PD and IP; the more amount of thermal energy are needed to desiccate the increasing level, which leads to decreasing of OT; the moment of inertia of the mill tube decreases with increasing level, which leads to decreasing of CM; the more impact energy are needed to comminute the increasing raw coal, and the left energy transfer-ring to the pair of shafts decreases, namely the VS decreases. By using the form of  X  X  X f X  X hen X  X  rule, the initial expertise for monitor-ing level of coal powder can be listed as follows: If IP increases, Then level increases If PD increases, Then level increases If OT increases, Then level decreases If VS increases, Then level decreases If CM increases up to a certain value, Then level increases If CM increases over the certain value, Then level decreases
The functional relationships between these parameters and the level of coal powder are nonlinear and implicit In the higher level conditions, VS are insensitive
The above if-then rules show several coarse relationships between a single parameter and level of coal powder. The final expertise can be obtained by combining all these single rules. To constitute a combined rule, we can fuzzify each parameters and combine fuzzified grades of each parameters. For instance, the values of these parameters can be fuzzified into several grades such as smaller (SS), small (S), medium (M), high (H), higher (HH), etc. Table 1 shows a kind of fuzzified grade of IP, PD, OT, VS and CM. The main expertise, expressed in the form of combined rule, is shown in Table 2 . 4.2. Experiment design and data collection
Evidently, the running data of CM, OT, IP, PD, and VS are necessary and must be collected in order to construct fuzzy numbers reflecting the possible values of unmeasured parameter. As we known, the observations of CM, OT, IP and PD can be directly obtained from the Distributed Control System (DCS) in the power plant. In other words, all these four process variables are sampled every second by DCS and then are transferred to the designed data acquisition system that will be interpreted consequently. The VS were measured by the authors X  designed hardware system, mainly consisting of two highly sensitive Integrated Circuit Piezoelectric accelerometers (ICP s , Summit Instruments, USA), two transmitters (DNZB-II, output 4 X 20-mA) and a data acquisition card (ADAM5000, China). The two accelerometers were mounted on the front and rear bearing housings to record the vibration produced by the hollow shaft (shaft used for short in the text) of the mill. The recorded amplitude and the frequency of the accelerometer were in the range of 7 50 g and 0.5 Hz X 10 kHz, respectively. This type of accelerometer was used on account of the frequency range (lower than 4000 kHz) of the ball impaction. The positions on which the accelerometers were installed are briefly depicted in Fig. 6 .
The designed data acquisition system possesses two main functionalities: (1) storing the data of CM, OT, IP and PD transferring from DCS, and (2) data acquisition and processing for the VS. The data acquisition and processing were governed by the KINGVIEW s programming environment as well as by a Visual C  X  X  program. The mechanical vibration of the shaft during operation was continuously monitored from the surface of the bearing housing by the accelerometer, whose output was ampli-fied two times by a programmable logic controller (PLC) amplifier, and then transferred to the KINGVEIW s data acquisition system.
The sampling frequency applied to capture the vibration signal was 16 kHz, thus the data acquisition system stored 128 kBof VS data each second, and the VC  X  X  programming was implemented to transfer the recorded domain signals into energy amplitudes using a wavelet packet technique. To coincide with the sample time of the other four variables, the energy amplitudes during one second were averaged. Once the running data of CM, OT, IP, PD, and VS can be collected, how to make sure these running data cover sufficient level conditions is critical.
 different working conditions of ball mill, namely, to make sure the levels of coal powder cover all the interval [0, 1], the ball mill was operated by changing the coal load in mill from no-load (level x  X  0) or a very low-load (level x E 0) to over-load (The over-load case must be avoided in practice, but it had to occur in the experiment because the case level x  X  1 is necessary.). The mill was driven by a motor, and the load of coal feeder and valve of removal air were feasibly operated by the operator. The revolution per minute (rpm) of coal feeder was controlled to feed coal load, and valve of removal air was operated to control the OT and mill throughout. The rpm and valve of removal air were combined to control the CM, IP and PD. It is notable that to make sure the mill run safely, the mill first has to be operated in safe ranges (see in Table 1 ). Otherwise, the mill and/or coal pulveriz-ing system will be in dangerous cases.

Table 2 .Moreprecisely,alltherulesareusedtoevaluatethelevel cases, and the mill was operated according to the evaluated level cases. According to the levels evaluated by using expertise and feasible operations for mill inter preted in the above paragraph, one can operate the mill from no-load to over-load, or from over-load to x is small), we can increase coal load and valve of removing air by to over-load; when the coal load approaches to over case, we can decrease rpm and then decrease valve of removal air to control the mill safely run in a relative lower level case. The operations of coal load and value of removal air during the experiment are detailed in

To construct training samples in the form of ( u i , ~ x i and input data u i are both needed to be prepared in advance. The basic concepts for constructing imprecise training samples are: (1) to select primary samples, covering sufficient states of the x , from the experimental data and/or running data of other variables relative to the x , (2) to explore the characteristics underlying in these primary samples, and (3) to allocate values of x in its domain X to these explored characteristics . In other words, constructing imprecise training samples is to label the inputs x with our interest x by using expertise and data analysis tools. Obviously, one can also directly label the inputs u in terms of expertise. In this section, a simple strategy is introduced for process industry.

For the above first task, the knowledge such as expertise is needed and is used to judge what running data cover the sufficient states of interest x . With the expertise, the primary samples can be obtained from r unning data and/or experimen-tal data. By the second one, clustering tools can be used to recognize significant characteristics involved in the primary samples. There are population of clustering methods. The most popular one is the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). However, FCM cannot automatically determine the number of clusters. In practice, we have no priori of the cluster number. In Ref. ( Su et al., 2012 ), we proposed a novel automatic FCM algorithm, called Variable string length Artificial Bee Colony FCM algorithm (VABC-FCM), which does not require the cluster number in advance. There-fore, we use VABC-FCM to automatically partition the primary samples so as to explore the underlying characteristics of the primary samples.

Once the characteristics of primary samples, such as the class number, cluster centre matrix V , and membership matrix M , were found, the remaining question is to relate the values of interest x to these explored characteristics. To relate the explored characteristics and the values of interest x ,inother words to label these explored characteristics, we assure that under some undemanding constraints the following fact is true: the larger the distance between two cluster centres is, the more different corresponding values of x are. These constraints are not so strict in process industries. For instance, one of con-straints may be that, the (most) input vector variables are monotonic (not strictly monotonic) functions of x but are not rigorously linear; the other popular one may be the load up process in industry. According to the results obtained in the first task, once the lowest value/state of interest x is rationally labeled to one of these explored characteristics (called refer-ence characteristic), the other values of interest x correspond-ing to the rest characteristics can be calculated by using an increasing or decreasing function of distances between their centres and that of the reference characteristic. A simple linear increasing function can be defined as L  X  o i  X  X  L c  X  o 0  X  X  X  1 L c  X  o 0  X  X  d E  X  o i , o 0  X  max where o 0 is the reference cluster; d E ( o i , o 0 ) denotes the Euclidean distance between two cluster centres o i and o 0 L ( o i )denotethevalueof y corresponding the centre of o i to the centre of cluster o i is  X  X  X round l  X  X . The response to other primary samples x i included in cluster o i , denoted by L ( u L  X  u i  X  X  u belonging to the j th cluster. Mathematically for the semantic of linguistic word  X  X  X round X  X , the fuzzy number can be used. Here, we apply the triangular fuzzy number.

According to the above strategy, the fuzzy numbers reflecting information of level of coal powder are constructed as follows. Step 1: Primary samples selection.

According to the expertise (see in Table 2 ), the first 1100 running samples (see in Fig. 8 ) cover sufficient information of the pulverizing conditions of ball mill. For reducing the computation complexity, every 10 running samples were selected as the primary samples, and so the count number of primary samples is 110.
 Step 2: Underlying characteristics exploration.

The parameters used to implement VABC-FCM algorithm are those in Su et al. (2012) . We automatically get three clusters.
The normalized coordinates of these ten underlying classes, i.e., the cluster centre matrix V , are presented in Table 3 , and the membership matrix M is shown in Fig. 9 .
 Step 3: Relate the explored characteristics and interest x . From the designed overload experiment (load up process), Rule 5 was first used to guide the experiments, and then the
Rule 4, Rule 3, Rule 2, and Rule 1. The running patterns, expressed in the form of 6-dimension feature space (CM, OT, IP, PD, VS), were clustered into three classes. These three x 0 i  X  0.02]. Here, 0.02 is used by considering that the variance of the  X  X  X uess X  X  cores in Fig. 10 is not bigger than 0.07 (i.e., 0.02 o 0.07). Therefore, we can construct 110 fuzzy numbers as the outputs of the primary samples to form the training samples ( u i , ~ x i ), some of which are presented in Fig. 11 . 4.4. Results and discussions 110}, the kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model can be identified. We have ^ s  X  2.3349 e 6. However we decide not to present the structure parameter ^ o because ^ o is a dual form of regression coefficients b and it is only meaningful in the feature space but meaningless in the original data space. The logarithmic plot of MSE vs. the bandwidth s is illustrated in Fig. 12 . It can be seen from Fig. 12 that s  X  1 is determined. Using the identified model, we estimate the whole operation process. The results are presented in Fig. 13 .
 model to estimate the level of coal powder based on the same training samples. The estimations are also presented in Fig. 13 (see the dot line).

Due to the lack of precise testing samples, here we give our qualitative analysis to the estimation. The simulation study with available testing samples has been discussed in Section 3 .
The operation times can be divided into three periods: the former 1000 s, the middle 200 s and the later 600 s. In the first period, the mill was operated from a lower load 2 to over-load, and the level increased with time. The curve of level in Fig. 13 convinces this trend. Around the 1000 s, the ball mill approached to over load condition, 3 and the load of coal feeder was low downed. Correspondingly, to make the OT not exceeding its safe range, the valve of removal air was gradually decreased. Due to the decreased removal ability, the level case first rises during a short period and then slowly departed from the over load condition and continuously decreased. Around 1050 s, we found the output temperature OT exceeded the lower bound of its safe range, and thus increase the valve of removal air. At the same time, to make OT not exceed its upper bound of safe range, we slightly increased the load of coal feeder. During the period between 1000 s and 1200 s, the input coal load is smaller than the output load of the mill, so the level of coal powder filling in the mill should be in decreasing trend. By considering the time delay of level 4 , the level of coal powder around 1200 s decrease largely. After the 1200 s, the load of coal feeder and valve of removal air were both operated to make the ball mill work under a certain level case so as to maintain the normal running. There-fore, the level of coal powder should increase after 1200 s and then approaches to and maintain at a certain level case. However, we can see also from Fig. 13 that the linear fuzzy regression model cannot reflect such nonlinear trend, although its estima-tions during the former 1000 s are similar as our model. The above analysis can be validated from the running data (in Fig. 8 ) by using the expertise presented in Table 2 .
 All the above discussions can be reflected by the estimations in Fig. 13 . From the estimations and qualitative analysis, it suggests that the strategy used to construct fuzzy outputs reflecting the unmeasured parameter and the proposed kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model are feasible in practical engineering. 5. Conclusions
Most of recent fuzzy regression models can be ineffective when nonlinearity exist between the inputs and output. To solve such issue, we propose a novel version of fuzzy regression model, called kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model, which deals with crisp inputs and fuzzy output, by introducing the strategy of kernel into fuzzy regression.

The points in original data space are first mapped into feature space by using a feature mapping associated with the selected kernel function. Using kernel function transformations the nonlinear functional relationship in the original data space into a linear functional relationship in the feature space. Then, the proposed model aims to construct linear functional rela-tionship between the inputs in feature space and the fuzzy output. In the proposed model, there are two kinds of para-meters need to be determined: the model structure parameters and bandwidth of kernel. The model structure parameters are identified by using maximum likelihood estimation strategy that is based on fuzzy EM algorithm, and the bandwidth of kernel is proposed to be determined by using a trade-off cross-validation strategy.

To validate the performance of the proposed model, two categories of applications, i .e., the simulation study and engineering application, of the proposed model are presented. The first simulation study is us ed to quantitati vely evaluate the prediction of the proposed model. Whereas, the second engineering application is used to qualitatively evaluate the prediction of the proposed mod el. In the simulation study, a numerical example and the real data motorcycle are used. To ensure that the proposed method performs reasonably well in the simulation study, some other popular regression methods such as SVM and Kernel based linear regression model (KLR) are compared. The experimental results show that the pro-posed model has high prediction accuracy and outperforms SVM and KLR in the most of cases. Most of all, the kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model can be used in fuzzy setting, but not the SVM and KLR. In the en gineering application, the kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model is used to monitor unmeasured parameter level of coal powder filling in ball mill in power plant. Due to the fact that the level of coal powder cannot be monitored (online and offline), a strategy is proposed to construct fuzzy data reflecting the possible values of level of coal powder, on the basis of running data and expertise. The application in the practical engineering shows that the prediction fits well with the expertise analysis and therefore suggests that the ke rnel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model is feasible.
 instance, how to relax some assumptions that are supposed in the model, and how to quantitatively analyze the prediction for the unmeasured parameter, are interesting. In addition, it is interested to extend the kernel based nonlinear fuzzy regression model to the belief function framework, another powerful theory used to re present uncertainty.
