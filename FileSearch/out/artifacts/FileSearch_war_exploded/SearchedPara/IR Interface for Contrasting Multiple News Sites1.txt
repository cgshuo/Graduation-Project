 We have recently been able to access a wide variety of news sites from all over the world through the Internet. Because each country has different opinions and interests, when we use news sites from diffe rent countries, we can obtain different points of view on a topic. For example, considering diplomatic issues to do with North Korea, Asian news sites, European sites, and American sites have common interestsaswellastheirowncharacteris tic interests. So, in order to analyze some news site.

There are several experimental systems that integrate news articles for a par-ticular event from multiple news sites. For example, PENG [1] and Newsblaster [2] are integrated news aggregation systems from distributed news archives. PENG is good for finding articles that meet users X  preferences, but this is not a system that contrasts different news si tes. Newsblaster [2] is a system that collects news articles from different res ources and generates news article sum-maries by integrating articles from diff erent resources. This system is good for users to understand particular events using different resources, but does not pay attention to the characteristics of each news resource.

In order to characterize d ifferent data sets, the concept of contrast set mining has been proposed by Bay et. al. [3]. This framework chara cterizes each contrast set by finding out conjunctions of attributes and values that have meaningfully different support levels.

By using contrast set mining, Yoshioka et. al. proposed a news-sites analysis method that focuses on correlation change between different news sites [4]. This method demonstrates the possibility of determining the characteristic informa-tion of each news site for a given topic, but it is too computationally demanding.
In this paper, the News Site Contrast (NSContrast) system is proposed for ac-cessing news articles from multiple news sites by contrasting each news site X  X  char-acteristics. This system is applied to a news article database constructed from multiple news sites from different countri es in order to evaluate its effectiveness. First, news-site analysis method that focuses on correlation change between dif-ferent news sites [4] is briefly reviewed. 2.1 Contrast Set Mining Conventional data mining, such as association rule mining based on a support confidence framework [5], tries to find rules that are dominant in the database. These rules assist in understanding the database. However, in many cases, most of the rules are well known and are not so interesting. To solve this problem, the concept of contrast set mining was p roposed [3]. This framework compares a global and a conditioned local data set to find characteristic item information that is significantly different from the global characteristic information. Even though this information is not dominant in either the global or local data sets, it can be used to understand the characteristics of the local database.
DC pair mining [6] is an algorithm that is based on the concept of contrast set mining. DC pair mining tries to find the characteristic item pairs in a local database by contrasting correlations between a global and a conditioned local database. The following are definitions used in the DC pair mining problem.
In DC pair mining, the  X  X ifference of correlations observed by conditioning a local database X  is of particular inter est. To quantify this difference, a new measure, correl ( X, Y )and change ( X, Y ; C ) are introduced; where X and Y represent the item sets and C represents the condition for constructing the local database. correl ( X, Y )and correl C ( X, Y ) correspond to the correlation between X and Y in the global database and in the C conditioned local database, respectively.

By using this measure, the system can e xtract item set pairs whose correla-tions are different from the global database; e.g., an item set pair with higher change means that it is a characteristic correlation in the local database (posi-tive feature), and a pair with lower change means that it is rarely correlated in the local database (negative feature). 2.2 News Sites Analysis System Based on DC Pair Mining Following is an algorithm for making a news site database for DC pair mining from multiple news sites. 1. Extraction of news articles from news sites 2. Generation of index terms from the articles 3. Addition of news site information
Based on this database and the DC pair mining algorithm, a news site analysis system was proposed.

However, the original DC pair mining algorithm is quite time consuming be-cause all combinations of item set pairs ( X , Y )thatsatisfyagivenminimum support condition are examined to calculate change ( X, Y ; C )foreachnewssite (
C ). Therefore, the item set X is restricted to a set of given topic keywords for analyzing the news site.

This news site analysis system demonstrates the possibility of determining the characteristic keywords for each ne ws site for a given keyword set. However, it is still time consuming and it is not possible to find out characteristic keyword sets that have a smaller change. Based on the research results discussed i n the previous section, the News Site Contrast (NSContrast) system is proposed for accessing news articles from mul-tiple news sites by using a concept of DC pair mining; i.e., the contrast between a global database of news articles from multiple sites, and a local database of news articles from a single news site. 3.1 System Architecture NSContrast consists of a news article retrieval system and a DC pair mining system.

In the news article analysis system discussed in previous section, all combina-tions of item set pairs ( X , Y ) that satisfy a given minimum support condition are examined to calculate change ( X, Y ; C ). However, since it is not so easy to understand complicated item set pair information and it is quite time consuming to calculate them, this algorithm is inappropriate for an interactive system. To solve this performance problem, NSContrast restricts exploration space. Since NSContrast is a system for accessing news articles, the topic keywords for searching news articles are used as item set pairs X, Y to calculate change ( X, Y ; C ). The system checks only items (not item sets) for Y .Asaresult, NSContrast can generate a list of keywords with change ( X, Y ; C ). By using this list, the user can find out positive and negative characteristic terms about a given topic X  X  keywords for each news site.

The following is the algorithm for extracting characteristic terms. 1. A user inputs topic keywords and the IR system retrieves articles that contain 2. The DC pair mining system selects candidate keywords that exist in the 3. Correlations between topic keyword s and each candidate keyword are cal-4. The DC pair mining system calculates the change ( X, Y ; C ) value for each
Based on this procedure, NSContrast extracts the following keyword lists for given topic keywords: List with higher correlation in global database. This list is good for un-List with higher change for each news site. This list is good for under-List with smaller change for each news site. This list is good for under-3.2 Analysis Experiment In order to analyze the effectiveness of t he system, an analysis experiment was conducted using a news site database obtained from the Internet. The news article database was populated by English language articles obtained from the following sites from May 1 to November 30, 2006: (Table 1). Since most of the news articles from the news sites have additional nonnews content, such as indexes and advertising, it is necessary to extract the main content from the news article pages using Webstemmer.
 Tables 2 X 4 are tables extracted for analyzing the keyword  X  X orth Korea X . Table 2 shows terms (phrases) with highest correlation with keyword  X  X orth Korea X  in each news site and total.  X  X yongyang X  and  X  X uclear X  were selected as common topic keywords. From this table, we can see almost all news sites pay attention to the issue of nuclear and missile in this period.
 Table 3 shows terms (phrases) with the highest change with keyword  X  X orth Korea X  in each news site. From this table, we can see the Los Angeles Times pays attention to the relationship between European countries, such as  X  X ritain X  and  X  X rance X .
 Table 4 shows terms (phrases) with smaller change with the keyword  X  X orth Korea X  in each news site. From this tab le we can see American news sites, such as CNN, Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, pay little attention to  X  X bduction X  in the  X  X orth Korea X  keyword case. (This is a common topic for Japanese newspapers; e.g., characteristic keyword  X 1977 X  in Asahi newspaper is a year that one Japanese woman was abducted.) In this paper, the application of the contrast set mining technique to multiple-news-site analysis is proposed and a news site analysis system NSContrast is demonstrated. This system can find characteristic information of the news site for given topic keywords.
