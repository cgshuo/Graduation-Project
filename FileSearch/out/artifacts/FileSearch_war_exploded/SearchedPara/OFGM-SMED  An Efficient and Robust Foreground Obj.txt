 1. Introduction
A video surveillance system ( Lucas and Kanade 1981 )mustbe capable of continuous operation under various weather and illumi-nation conditions. It should be capable of dealing with movement through cluttered areas, objects overlapping in the visual shadows, lighting changes, and e ffects of moving elements of the scene (e.g. swaying trees), slow-m oving objects, and objects being introduced or removed from the scene. Traditional approaches based on backgrounding methods typically fail in these general situations.
Background subtraction is a very important part of surveillance applications for successful segmen tation of objects of interest in a scene for applications such as surveillance. The purpose of Back-ground Subtraction algorithm is to distinguish moving objects (here-after referred to as the foreground) from static or moving parts of the scene (called Background). Simple motion detection algorithm ( BarnichandVanDroogenbroeck2011 )comparesastaticback-ground frame with a current frame of a video scene, pixel by pixel.
This is the basic principle of background subtraction where each video frame is compared against a background model, and the pixels which signi fi cantly deviate from the model are considered to be the foreground. These  X  foreground  X  pixels are further post-processed for object localization and tracking. The general framework of Back-
Ground Subtraction (BGS) ( Cong et al., 2011 ) usually comprises of four steps: preprocessing, background modeling, foreground detec-tion, and post processing. The preprocessing step collects training samples and removes imaging noises; the background modeling step builds a background model which is in general robust to certain background changes; the foreground detection step generates fore-ground candidates through calculating the deviation of a pixel from the background model; fi nally, the post processing step thresholds those candidates to form foreground masks.

Among these four steps, the third step namely foreground detection is the important process that should detect foreground object exactly. i.e., the resultant video sequence or image thus so obtained should not contain background noise. Our goal is to create a robust, adaptive tracking system for foreground detection of video objects under the compressed domain that is fl exible enough to handle variations in lighting, moving scene clutter, multiple moving objects and other arbitrary changes to the observed scene. 1.1. Previous work and current Shortcomings
The existing foreground detection algorithms can be divided into three categories: frame difference, optical fl ow and back-ground subtract.

Frame difference ( Gupta and Kulkarni 2007 ) calculates pixel gray scale difference between adjacent two frames in a continuous image sequence and determines foreground by setting threshold.
Frame difference method can be used in dynamic environment, but it cannot completely extract all the foreground area, the central part of the target will be lost, which results in bad target recognition. In addition, this method is dif fi cult to accurately detect fast moving objects as well as multiple objects.
Optical fl ow ( Horn and Schunck 1981 ) is the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness patterns in an image. Optical fl ow can arise from relative motion of objects and can give important information about the spatial arrangement of the objects viewed and the rate of change of this arrangement.
Discontinuities in Optical fl ow can help in segmenting images into regions that correspond to different objects. Since it is very dif fi cult to calculate the true velocity fi eld using image sequence, the optical fl ow fi eld which is obtained from the information of moving objects can be used to replace the velocity fi eld. But, the optical fl ow fi eld alone cannot be used because it cannot get rid of background noises ( Stauffer and Grimson 1999 ) which occur due to the in fl uence of ambient light.

Background subtract ( Stauffer and Grimson 1999 ) is a common method used in foreground detection shown in Fig. 1 . It calculates the difference between the current image and background image and detects foreground by setting threshold. Basically there are two methods to obtain background image, viz., 1. De fi ning back-ground image manually, and 2. Obtaining a background model by a training algorithm as like used in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
Compared to the former, the latter is more accurate and the result of foreground detection is much better. Background subtract method has robustness to light changing and slight movement, but when using this method to deal with long image sequence there may be much accumulate error in the foreground. Moreover,
GMM produces good results of detecting Foreground in uncom-pressed domain of Video sequence. But for compressed domain of video it produces very poor results with high background noise.
Optical fl ow covers long distance and the background noise due to brightness change is less which results in less accumulate error percentage.

In digital image processing ( Gonzalez et al., 2002 ), the edge detection is an important technique. Edge detection is the process of fi nding meaningful transitions in an image. Various edge detection ( Rajesh, R. 2008 ) algorithms have been proposed based on either gradient operator or statistical approaches. Mostly the gradient operators are easily affected by background noise, and the fi ltering operators are used to reduce the background noise rate. In edge detection, morphological edge detectors ( Fathy and Siyal 1995 ) are also available which are more effective than the gradient operators. Some kinds of morphological detectors are also avail-able and those are not ef fi cient while comparing to separable morphological edge detector. But the edges at different angles are not covered and thin edges are missed by this mathematical morphological detector. Hence separable morphological edge detector detects thin edges and the edges at different angles with less background noise ( Siyal and Solangi 2006 ).

Various methods have been proposed to video image processing until now. But these existing methods have some dif fi culties with congestion, shadows, background n oise and various lighting condi-tions. This literature report describes various techniques involved, their constraints like memory, computing tie, complexity. The Video surveillance method proposed by Baumann.A et al. Baumann et al., (2008) , aims at robustness with low volume of false positive and false negative rate simultaneously. But the requirement is to have zero false negative rates and also it should cope with varying illumination condition, occlusion situations and low contrast. Real time video surveillance proposed by Nan Lu et al. Lu et al., (2008) deals with real time detection of moving objects. This deals with problems like storage space and time consumption to record the video. To avoid the above problems this uses motion detection algorithm but this covers only the video that has important information. In real time visual surveillance W4S ( Rourke and Bell 1988 ) method (What, When, Where and Who) is the low cost PC based real time visual surveillance system for detecting and tracking people and monitoring their activities in an outdoor environment. It has been implemented to track people and their parts of the body. It has the problems like sudden illumination changes, shadow and occlusion. W4S is an integrated real time stereo method which has addressed the limitation that W4S has met. It deals with tracking of people in outdoor environ-ment. But this makes tracking much harder in intensity images. End-to-End method has been proposed which is used for remov-ing moving targets from a stream of real time videos. It sorts them according to image based properties. But this involves in forceful tracking of moving targets. Smart video surveillance systems support the human operators with identi fi cation of signi events in video. It can do object detection in outdoor and indoor environments under varying illumination conditions. But this is based on the shape of detected objects. Automatic video surveil-lance using background subtraction ( Schmoldt et al., 1997 ) has different problems. Pixel based multi color background model is a successful solution to this problem. However this method suffers from slow learning at the beginning and it could not differentiate between moving objects and moving shadows. Multimedia sur-veillance ( Rajesh, R. 2008 ) utilizes assorted number of related media streams, each of which has a different assurance level to attain numerous surveillance tasks. It is dif fi cult to insert a new stream in the system with no knowledge of prior history.
Edge detection has been a challenging problem in image processing. Due to lack of edge information the output image is not visually pleasing. Various types of edge detectors are discussed here, Robert edge detector ( Fathy and Siyal 1995 ) detects edges which run along vertical axis of 45 and 135 degree. The only drawback is that it takes long time to compute. Gaussian edge detector reduces background noise by smoothing images and gives better results in a noisy environment. The dif fi culty is that it is very time consuming and very complex for computation. Zero crossing detectors use second derivative of the input image and it includes the laplacian operator. It is having fi xed characteristics in all directions. But it is sensitive to background noise. In Canny edge detector approach, if the set threshold is low, it produces false edges and conversely, if the set threshold is high it leaves out important edges. The main disadvantage of canny edge detector is that it is not susceptible to background noise ( Rajesh, R. 2008 ).
To overcome the aforesaid problems involved in the existing techniques we propose a newly adapted approach. This is very effective and could overcome all the above mentioned problems like congestion, shadow &amp; lighting transitions, robustness to light changing and even slight movement. This proposed approach will background with varying Frame rates. Also the proposed approach has produced good results in detecting foreground video objects in the compressed domain.

This paper primarily aims at the new technique of video image processing used to solve the above said problems associated with the real-time video surveillance system. A new foreground detec-tion approach called Optical Flow with Gaussian Mixture model and SMED (OFGM-SMED) has been proposed for detecting the foreground objects. The rest of the paper is organized as follows; section II introduces the proposed approach which is called OFGM and SMED (OFGM-SMED) and in section III some experimental results and discussions to verify the proposed approach is explained. Finally, the paper is concluded in section IV. 2. Proposed system 2.1. Optical fl ow
A new foreground detection approach called OFGM-SMED which makes use of Lucas-Kanade optical fl ow ( Lu et al., 2008 ) and Gaussian Mixture Model along with SMED is proposed. A perfect foreground cannot be obtained by using optical fl due to some brightness change. But, optimal foreground can be obtained by OFGM-SMED effectively.
 It is known that there are fi ve kinds of optical fl ow method and
Lucas Kanade (LK) optical fl ow shown in Fig. 2 is a kind of gradient-based algorithm ( Rajesh, R. 2008 ). If I ( x; y; t ) is the vector of pixel m ( x; y ), then after a short time interval optical fl ow constraint equation  X 
I :
Vm  X 
Where  X 
Because vm is a two dimension variable, more constraints are needed to settle this question. LK optical fl ow method estimates vm by v expressed in (2) on the assumption that vm is a constant in a small spatial neighborhood  X  .  X 
W 2  X  m  X   X  I : v  X 
In (2), W 2 ( m ) is a window function making the central part of the neighborhood has greater weight than the peripheral part. For v  X  X  A Where
A  X  (  X  I (m1) ...  X  I (mn)) T;
W  X  diag (W (m1) ... W (mn))
And b  X   X  I  X  m 1  X   X 
Since LK method calculates optical fl ow in every pixel, by using this method we can detect all the changes between adjacent frames, therefore it is the best choice in detecting crowd move-ment ( Rahmalan et al., 2006 ). However, optical fl ow methods are very sensitive to brightness change, when using LK method it is dif fi cult to fi nd a proper threshold to segment foreground and background. In fact, no matter how to make a choice, the detection result may either lose some foreground area or contain some background noises. Obviously we cannot obtain an optimal fore-ground by using LK method alone. Hence we try to use another method to improve the result. After a series of experiments we found that by combining LK optical fl ow and SMED method we could get a perfect result. 2.2. Gaussian Background Modeling
Gaussain Background Modeling (GBM) ( Fathy and Siyal 1995 ) shown in Fig. 3 , is one among the different kinds of background subtract method. In this method, K Gaussian models are used to approximate the pixel values in the image, these models are updated on every frames of the video. If the residual value of pixel value and approximate value is larger than the set threshold value, this pixel is regarded as foreground, otherwise it is con-sidered as background. Using K Gaussian mixture models, the gray probability function of pixel X at time t is given as
PX  X  X  X   X 
Where w n is the weight of number n Gaussian model whose mean and variance are m n and  X  2 n . Usually, the value of K is from 3 to 5. In order to represent a complex scene, we need to use larger K . It should be noted that the calculation time increases for larger K .

Optical fl ow [17] and GBM proves to be less ef fi cient as optimal foreground is not obtained. Error percentage ( Li et al., 2010 ) also ranks high. Optical fl ow alone consists of possibly less background noise due to fi ltering and also it is robust to brightness change.
Also, these methods have produced very poor results in the case of compressed video (which has the greater advantage of reduced memory size and less execution time). 2.3. Separable Morphological Edge Detector
The image edges include rich information that is very signi cant for obtaining the image characteristics by object recognition.
Edge detection refers to the process of identifying and locating sharp discontinuities in an image. Various edge detection algo-rithms ( Gonzalez et al., 2002 ) have been proposed based on gradient operator or statistical approaches. Mostly the gradient operators are easily affected by background noise, and the operators are used to reduce the background noise rate. In edge detection, morphological edge detectors are also available which are effective than the gradient operators. Some kinds of morpho-logical detectors ( Browne et al., 2010 ) are also available and they are not ef fi cient when compared with Separable Morphological
Edge Detectors. The effectiveness of many image processing and computer vision algorithms depends on the perfection of detect-ing meaningful edges. Due to lack of object edge information the output image is not visually pleasing.

Existing edge detectors are also available but the main dis-advantage is that they are sensitive to background noise and inaccurate. Some examples are Robert's edge detector and Sobel edge detector. As existing edge detectors have some disadvantages with background noise, a new morphological edge-detection operator Separable Morphological Edge Detector (SMED) ( Siyal and Solangi 2006 ) has been proposed. It requires less computation, and has appreciable performance when compared with other morphological operators. The reasons for adopting SMED operator is listed below. (1) SMED can detect edges at different angles, while other edge (2) The strength of the edges detected by SMED is twice than (3) SMED ( Lee et al., 1990 ) uses separable median fi ltering to
A Separable Morphological Edge Detector as shown in Fig. 4 performs the following 1. Grayscale conversion. 2. Median Filtering 3. Boundary Extraction using histogram and fi xing Threshold. 4. Remove the noisy pixels from the Image and Filling the pixel break in regular pattern. 5. Make Image One Pixel Thick in Horizontal and Vertical Direction.
SMED, which uses compatible and easily implementable opera-tors, has a lower computational requirement, compared to the other morphological edge-de tection operator. Open  X  close has better per-formance than the SMED operator ( Hashimoto et al., 1988 ), but it requires about eight times more com putational power, therefore, it is not suitable for real-time applications.

We propose a new approach by combining SMED and OFBM which is shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that OFBM method applies LK optical fl ow and GBM in parallel. On one hand, we fi rst use the two adjacent images f ( x; y; t 1) and f ( x; y; t ) to calculate the LK optical fl ow fi eld, then median fi lter and Gaussian fi eliminate salt and pepper noises and high-frequency noises respectively.

After that we use a threshold Tlk, LK Threshold, to segment results show the range of Tlk is [0.05, 0.20], choosing smaller Tlk will produce larger foreground area including background noises, while choosing bigger threshold may lose some foreground area.
In order to detect all the movement area we select the smallest value 0.05, and then we try to eliminate the background noises in the foreground mask fl k ( x; y; t ). On the other hand, GBM method is used to get another foreground mask where the scale fi lter is employed for segmenting foreground and background. In the scale fi lter, we set another threshold Tg, GMM Threshold, that means an area of pixel block. For an obtained foreground image, if a pixel block has smaller as foreground. Hence, we can get a new foreground mask fg ( x; y; t ). In our test, the value of Tg should be near 1 / 400 of the image area.
For example, when the size of image is 320 240, the range of Tg is [160, 200]. As like LK method, we select the smallest Tg to obtain the largest foreground mask fg ( x; y; t ).

Finally, these two masks are multiplied and we operate morphological processing ( Horn and Schunck 1981 ) to join the adjacent areas and exclude small blocks in the foreground, then an optimal foreground fore ( x; y; t ) can be obtained as shown in the contain background noises, the background noise in fl k ( x; y; t )is caused by brightness alteration and appears randomly on the pro fi les of objects, whereas in fg ( x; y; t ) the background noise occurs on the edge of objects and with time going by, the background noise appears at the same place. Because the two background noises appear at different places, we can eliminate
The foreground image fore ( x; y; t ) obtained by OFGM is then used in the crowd density estimation.

When using SMED method, the foreground containing much accumulated error due to background noise should be eliminated.
The background noises present in the Optical Flow algorithm can also be removed by this approach by applying Separable Morpho-logical Edge Detector. While using the proposed OFGM-SMED approach, almost all the background noises are removed, and no foreground is lost, so the fi nal object detection result will be optimal as it gets low error rate shown in Table 2 . OFGM-SMED approach is effective. 3. Results and Discussion
Foreground detection is the base of motion analysis, such as object tracking, image segmentation, and motion estimation shown in Fig. 7 . The proposed approach is tested on video sequences of both the uncompressed and compressed domain for three different videos with sample of minimum 250 images under the following category. The results are discussed herein.
The Video 1, Fig. 6 a is slow moving scene taken by static camera with a frame rate of 30 fps, Video2, Fig. 6 b is a scene taken by a dynamic camera (both foreground and background is dynamic) with frame rate of 25 fps and Video3, Fig. 6 c is the fast moving traf fi c scene captured by a static camera with a frame rate of 15fps.
The segmentation is carried out on the videos under uncom-pressed (avi) and Compressed (mp4) domain. GMM shows good result in the case of fast moving objects with lower frame rate. But
GMM produces noisy moving regions for all the input videos a, b, c under the compressed domain. The moving regions are segmented by a bounding box as shown in Fig. 7 .

Supplementary material related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.engappai.2013.09.007 .

The Fig. 8 shows the better performance of our approach. The computational time (elapsed time) of GMM is relatively high when compared with their counterparts' say optical fl ow and OF with
SMED. The elapsed time is even reduced under compressed domain (mp4), where the number of frames to be processed is less which has been shown in Fig. 11 . The performance evaluation of GMM, OF and OFGM-SMED has been shown in Figs. 9  X  11 respectively for MPEG-4 and AVI. The comparison of elapsed time taken by GMM, OF and OFGM-SMED for MPEG-4 has been shown in Fig. 12 . In the graph, peaks represent the elapsed time which shows that our method OFGM-SMED has better results under the compressed domain, as the peaks are comparatively less through-out the frames. Also the overall performance of OFGM-SMED compared to its counterparts as the computational cost is low and is less sensitive to background noise.
 Average error rate is calculated for all methods which show
OFGM-SMED is very effective and has less error rate. The numer-ical result in Table 1 shows OFGM-SMED that it has less error rate (1.74%). It can be seen that when using optical fl ow method, there are some background noises because each motion area is detected.
The algorithm uses a recent technique by applying simple but effective operations. As this approach works well in compressed domain, the computation time has been reduced while compared to other video surveillance operation. The vehicle detection operation is a less sensitive edge-based technique. The threshold selection is done dynamically using a statistical approach to reduce the effects of variations of lighting. The approach is based on selecting a point on the horizontal axis of the histogram of the image, where the sum of the entropy of the points above and below this point is maximum. This point is selected as the threshold value for the next period. When using SMED method, the foreground which had more accumulated error has been eliminated.

As SMED possess median fi ltering it eliminates all background noise present in optical fl ow. Crowd density estimation is very important in surveillance. Texture analysis and moment analysis are two common ways to estimate crowd density, in texture analysis a set of density features can be extracted from Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) which is calculated from foreground image. If M is the GLCM of the nxm foreground image, where i and j are the spatial positions in the foreground image, we can calculate a new feature F M , GLCM of Foreground image , which is de fi ned as follows.
 F
M  X   X 
In the moment analysis, because the zeroth order moment represents the total mass of the given image, we propose another feature F 00 de fi ned as follows,
F  X  ln m 00
Where A f is the area of foreground and m 00 is the zeroth order moment of foreground image. Both F M and F 00 can be used to estimate the crowd density, the larger values of F M and the smaller values of F 00 mean higher density. In our test, we used F estimate the crowds in different scenes and use F 00 to measure the different crowds in fi x scene. We carried out our approach on seven different videos which contain 1200 frames of image, and we randomly picked up 100 images to estimate OF-SMED. First we arti fi cially appointed the foreground area on each image which is the real foreground, and then we used the following equations to test the error rate of OFBM r  X 
Where A real is the area of real foreground, A is the area of experimental result foreground, r is the error rate and the average error rate R for randomly picked up 100 images is given by,
R  X  The test result can be seen in Table 2 that shows our approach
OFGM-SMED has less error rate comparatively than their counterparts.

This algorithm works well not only for the static camera but also for moving camera with static and dynamic background video sequences. It is also possible to detect the foreground object based on the Region of Interest (ROI). This system is adoptable even for sudden illumination changes, since the combination of OFGM with
SMED is less sensitive to ambient lighting. In the video 2 (dynamic camera with dynamic background) irrespective of sudden illumi-nation changes, the foreground object has been detected effec-tively as shown in Fig. 8 .
 4. Conclusion
A new and simpler algorithm for the segmentation of compressed video (OFGM-SMED) has been est ablished and explained. The proposed approach OFGM-SMED combines the foregrounds of both
OF and GBM together to eliminat e background noise. In optical the background noise appears at random and in SMED ( Fathy and
Siyal 1995 ) method the background noise appears at fi xed places such as the edge of building, so by doing the combination almost all the background noises can be eliminated. When using the proposed
OFGM-SMED approach, we can see that almost all background noises are removed, and no foreground is lost, so the fi nal object detection result is optimal. This algorithm has many advantages than their existing counterpart viz., lesser computation time, increased accu-racy,lesscomplexanditisef fi cient to calculate number of moving regions in every frame. OFGM-SMED proves to be an optimal approach for traf fi c and crowd monitoring real time applications with error rate of 1.74% which is a satis fi ed result. References
