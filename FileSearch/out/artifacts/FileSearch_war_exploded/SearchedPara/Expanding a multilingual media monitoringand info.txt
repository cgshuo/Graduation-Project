 Erik van der Goot Abstract The Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications is a set of multilingual tools that gather, cluster and classify news in currently fifty languages and that extract named entities and quotations (reported speech) from twenty languages. In this paper, we describe the recent effort of adding the African Bantu language Swahili to EMM. EMM is designed in an entirely modular way, allowing plugging in a new language by providing the language-specific resources for that language. We thus describe the type of language-specific resources needed, the effort involved, and ways of boot-strapping the generation of these resources in order to keep the effort of adding a new language to a minimum. The text analysis applications pursued in our efforts include clustering, classification, recognition and disambiguation of named entities (persons, organisations and locations), recognition and normalisation of date expres-sions, as well as the identification of reported speech quotations by and about people.

Institutions and companies are interested in monitoring the news and other sources regularly to be kept up-to-date with the latest developments in their field of interest. Sometimes, they also want to know what the media say about themselves or their competitors. Before the age of the internet, manual newspaper clipping was the major method, while nowadays the internet is the major source of information for such services.
Monitoring the media in multiple languages has several major advantages: (a) News coverage across countries and languages is complementary so that more information is found when monitoring the news in multiple languages. (b) Even if large events are eventually reported in the world X  X  most widely spoken languages, there is always a time delay, which can be avoided by monitoring the source languages directly. Smaller events, such as the reporting of minor disease outbreaks, local criminal activity, minor accidents X  X ll these are events that can be of major interest to some specialist media monitoring users X  X re typically reported in local news and are as good as never reported abroad. (c) Seeing the news from different sources and different countries gives the reader a view of events that is less biased by national or political interests.

The Europe Media Monitor EMM (Steinberger et al. 2009 ), publicly available online since the year 2002, is an automated service that scrapes about 2,500 online news sites to gather a current daily average of about 100,000 news articles from fifty languages (status March 2011). EMM uses RSS feeds if they are available, and otherwise extracts the text from the HTML pages, visiting some web sites every 5 min to always get the latest available articles from around the world. The EMM news gathering engine feeds the articles to several media monitoring applications, of which four are freely accessible online at http://www.emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html . The two live applications X  NewsBrief for generic news and the Medical Information System MedISys for Public Health-related issues X  X ilter and classify the news in near-real time, cluster related articles every 10 min, geo-locate each news cluster, recog-nise entities (mostly persons and organisations), and detect breaking news by identifying news clusters that quickly grow in size, or by monitoring the relative flow of articles per subject category for each reporting country. NewsExplorer , instead, groups all articles arriving within one calendar day for a subset of 20 languages, automatically identifies related clusters across languages, recognises new names, grounds name variants by mapping them X  X ven across languages and scripts X  X o the same name identifier, tracks topics over larger periods of time (even weeks or months) and collects multilingual historical information on named entities. Users of these and other EMM applications are European Institutions, including the European Com-mission and many different departments therein, national governmental organisations in the European Union X  X  27 Member States, international organisations such as var-ious United Nations sub-organisations, and various international partners such as national organisations in the United States, Canada, China, etc. Additionally, an average of 30,000 daily anonymous users visits EMM X  X  public websites.

The work presented here on adding the African Bantu language Swahili to EMM is motivated by collaborations with the African Union Commission and the Pan-African Parliament, but also by the interests of the aforementioned user groups, who do carry out global media monitoring, for instance to warn early about the outbreak of contagious diseases or for country stability monitoring. Figures 1 and 2 show Swahili pages of the EMM applications NewsBrief and NewsExplorer, as they can now be seen on the publicly accessible EMM pages.
The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 discusses related work. Section 3 describes selected features of the Swahili language. In Sect. 4 , we give an overview of how our text analysis applications work and what work was done for Swahili, including an indication how long it took to prepare the Swahili resources. In Sect. 5 , we present results of a manual evaluation of the information automatically extracted from Swahili texts. The paper ends with a short summary. 2 Related work In this section, we will discuss related work regarding four areas: multilingual media monitoring applications; approaches to adapting existing text mining tools to new languages; Swahili Named Entity Recognition (NER) software; and other tools and resources for the Swahili language.

Most automatic operational media monitoring systems are monolingual English, including NewsVine, 1 SiloBreaker 2 and Daylife. 3 The only multilingual system we are aware of apart from our own is NewsTin, 4 which gathers and classifies news in eleven languages. Our own application NewsExplorer currently covers twenty languages, with the twentieth language (Swahili) having been added in 2010. 5
Developers of multilingual text mining systems typically develop an application in one language and then adapt it to others (e.g. Gamon et al 1997 ; Manny and Bouillon 1996 ; Pastra et al. 2002 ; Carenini et al. 2007 ). In the course of their work, developers have come up with best practices regarding a relatively quick and efficient adaptation. For an overview of these, see Steinberger ( 2011 ). Ideas include the requirement for modularity (Pastra et al. 2002 ; Carenini et al. 2007 ; Maynard et al. 2002 ), simplicity of rules and the lexicon (Carenini et al. 2007 ), uniform input and output structures (Carenini et al. 2007 ; Bering et al. 2003 ), and partially shared grammars for phenomena that are the same across languages (Bering et al. 2003 ). For cross-lingual applications such as cross-lingual topic tracking or linking related documents across languages, the most common approach is to use Machine Translation (e.g. Leek et al. 1999 ) or bilingual dictionaries (e.g. Wactlar 1999 )to translate foreign languages into one language, typically English.

However, there are also approaches that use multilingual parallel corpora to automatically generate multilingual word associations in a multilingual space, either using Lexical Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Littman 1991 ) or Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (Vinokourov et al. 2002 ). Steinberger et al. ( 2008a ) pick up on the ideas of simplicity, modularity and language-independent rules, but propose to use language-independent anchors such as disambiguated and normalised entity identifiers (persons, organisations, locations, dates) and subject domain codes to provide cross-lingual functionality, as these allow to plug in a new language at any time when the language-specific resources for this language become available. This is the approach pursued in the work presented here. In the context of the work on Swahili text mining, this specifically means avoiding the use of full dictionaries, morphological analysers and syntactic parsers. More details will be discussed in Sect. 4 .
 To our knowledge, there have been only two attempts to carry out Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Swahili. The first one was by Sproat et al. ( 2005 ), who developed tools to identify persons, organisations and locations for fifty languages. Their work is not described in much detail, 6 but it looks like some seed patterns were used and a small number of seed entities were annotated in a corpus, on which a Hidden Markov Model was trained. No evaluation results are available. The other was by Shah et al. ( 2010 ) who exploited Swahili-English machine translation, English language NER software and word alignment information (Google had just released their online translation software for this language pair). They applied the combination of two different NER tools (to increase recall) on the automatically produced English translation of the original Swahili text, used Giza ?? (Och and Ney 2003 ) to project the named entity information back to Swahili and applied a post-processing procedure using POS filtering on the Swahili result to improve Precision. For the most successful settings, the authors report a Precision of 0.75 and a Recall of 0.89, counting individual word tokens rather than entities. The method thus works reasonably well, but it requires the existence of a Swahili morphological dictionary and of Swahili machine translation software. It furthermore requires using the translation software as part of the NER processing chain. However, standalone software could be produced by training a Swahili NER tool on the outcome of the projection, similar to Yarowski et al. ( 2001 ).

Wentland et al. ( 2008 ) built a multilingual named entity dictionary which includes Swahili, by mining Wikipedia and exploiting various link types. They first built an English named entity repository of about 1.5 million names, by selecting all article headers and by assuming that these headers are named entities if at least 75% of these strings are more frequently found in uppercase than in lowercase (except at the beginning of a sentence). They then exploit the multilingual links, as well as the redirect and disambiguation pages to identify target language equivalences in altogether fifteen languages. They end up with a list of almost 3,000 Swahili named entities. Note that this method produced 250,000 named entities for the most successful language (German), which shows how much more successful such methods can be for highly resourced languages.
Wentland et al. point out how cumbersome it is to develop linguistic resources for named entity recognition, but building such resources from scratch is indeed the method we used, although we made good use of bootstrapping methods for lexical acquisition. For all tasks described in Sect. 4 , the effort was about three person months, of which about 3 weeks were used to come up with lists of expressions that help identify person and organisation names in Swahili. From our point of view, this is an acceptable investment.
 Swahili may not be a resource-rich language, but it is one of the better-developed African languages as a range of linguistic resources and tools are available or are being worked on. These resources include a parallel corpus with English (de Pauw et al. 2011 ), multilingual person name lists including Swahili (Wentland et al. 2008 ) and the Helsinki Corpus of Swahili. 7 This 12.5 million word corpus has been annotated with information on the base form of the words (lemma), part-of-speech, morphological information including noun class affiliation and verb morphology. There are various Swahili-English bilingual dictionaries which de Pauw et al. ( 2009 ) aim to consolidate into a unified lexicographic database. Additionally, work has been carried out on Swahili part-of-speech tagging (de Pauw et al. 2006 ), morphological analysis (de Pauw and de Schryver 2008 ) and word sense disambig-uation (Ng X  X ng X  X  2005 ). Helsinki University works on the Swahili Language Manager SALAMA, 8 a computational environment that facilitates many kinds of applications based on written Swahili text, including machine translation. Google X  X  online machine translation software 9 is an important resource that offers free translation between Swahili and over fifty other languages and that can be exploited to create further linguistic tools such as NER software (e.g. Shah et al. 2010 ). Finally, the Kamusi project should be mentioned here, as it is a participatory international effort dedicated to the languages of Africa, aiming to produce dictionaries and other resources for African languages and to make them widely available. 10 3 A short description of Swahili Swahili is an African language of the Bantu family largely spoken in Eastern and Central Africa. It is spoken by five to ten million people as a native language, and by about 50 million persons as either their first or second language. 11 At the moment, it is the only language of African origin that was adopted as a working language of the African Union, alongside English, French, Arabic and Portuguese. The language is written using the Roman script, which was introduced in the middle of the nineteenth century. The orthography was standardised in the 1930s. In some coastal areas, older generations still use the Arabic script. Swahili is under-resourced in Wikipedia compared to many European languages: there are only about 14,000 Swahili Wikipedia pages, compared to over 100,000 pages for many European languages. It is nevertheless one of the most documented African languages on line.
We discuss a selection of language features here showing that Swahili is rather different from the other language groups covered by EMM-NewsExplorer, which currently are from the Indo-European, Semitic, Turkic and Finno-Ugric language families. Like the other languages of the Bantu family, Swahili has a fixed Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. It is an agglutinating language that marks noun classes with prefixes. The classes are semi-semantically defined; prefixes are arranged in singular/plural pairs and distinguish names of human beings and some animals, things made from plants or wood, plants, natural phenomena, the spirit world, some body parts of animates like arms and legs, fruits, paired body parts such as eyes, liquid mass nouns, collections or groups, artefacts, disabled humans, kinship terms, most animals and insects, linear and abstract objects. Verbs agree with the noun class of both the subject and the objects. Adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the classes of their nouns. Some languages in the Bantu group distinguish up to twenty semantic noun classes, but Swahili only accounts for sixteen of the prefixes.

It was important to consider the morphology of Swahili when developing the subject domain category definitions (see Sect. 4.3 ), as well as the expressions used to identify uppercase words as named entities (Sect. 4.4 ), and reporting verbs for the recognition of quotations (reported speech; Sect. 4.7 ). Prefixes describing the semantic class had to be considered for nouns. For reporting verbs, prefixes referring to the subject noun phrase and to the tense of the verb had to be considered: In the reporting verb a -li -sema , a refers to the conveyor, li marks the past tense and sema represents the stem of the verb to say .

EMM makes intensive use of finite state transducers to match words, multi-word expressions or combinations of words and expressions against the full text of all articles. While English and many European languages mostly use suffixes so that wild cards such as the Kleene star can be used quite efficiently, Swahili uses prefixes. As finite state matches with expressions using word-initial wild cards are computationally inefficient or would need entirely separate treatment, we attempted to avoid word-initial wild cards and preferred to list several word forms one by one. This means that Swahili category definitions are typically longer than English ones. 4 Producing Swahili language resources for EMM In this section, we will give a rough overview of how the various text mining tools used in EMM work, and of the linguistic resources that need to be created when adding a new language. Any features that are specific to the Swahili language will be discussed in the relevant sections. In Sect. 4.1 , we describe the effort of finding and adding Swahili news sources for scraping. Section 4.2 is about the translation of menu items for the multilingual interface, Sect. 4.3 about creating Swahili category definitions. Section 4.4 is dedicated to creating resources for the recognition of person and organisation names, Sect. 4.5 about date recognition, and Sect. 4.6 about resources for the recognition and disambiguation of geographical references in text (locations). The recognition of quotations is described in Sect. 4.7 . This task includes not only the recognition of the text in quotation marks, but also the name of the person who issues the quotation and the reporting verb, possibly involving determiners and modifiers that separate the other parts. 4.1 Adding Swahili news sources All EMM applications process news articles in UTF8-encoded RSS format. Finding the articles on the web and ingesting the news articles is thus the first task when adding a new language to EMM. Identifying the news sources is a manual (i.e. intellectual) effort, typically first looking at meta-news sites with long lists of URLs of online media and additionally searching by using a search engine. Initially, twenty-one Swahili news sources were found, but seven of those were not suitable for automatic news article gathering because of their low update frequency (less than one update every 3 days) or because the news pages contained image files rather than machine-readable text files (xml, html, plain text, readable PDF). Interestingly, the fourteen news resources retained were mostly from international news agencies such as BBC, Deutsche Welle and Irib, as well as newspapers from Tanzania. In Kenya, where Swahili is one of the national languages, only one online source was found. 12 For each source, specific starting pages are identified in order to target the scraping to pages with potentially relevant contents and to avoid going into the archives. Whenever news in RSS format is available, the EMM grabber takes the files in that format. Alternatively, HTML pages are downloaded, menu items, images and scripts are removed, then the text is identified, using some heuristics considering the density of links in the text. New articles are added to the processing chain, previously seen ones are discarded. EMM gathers an average of just over one hundred Swahili news articles per day. 4.2 Translating interface menu items EMM X  X  applications NewsBrief and MedISys allow separate language settings for the news content and for the interface language (see Fig. 3 ). Due to time restrictions, it was decided not to translate all interface components into Swahili, but only a subset of the most important ones, including the major subject domains (referred to as  X  X hemes X  in EMM). Translations of interface text components are stored in an XML file. Each menu item has a unique identifier and a language code, to allow the selection of the appropriate translations when building the HTML web pages.

Translations of menu items and of category definition words (see next Section) were done either purely based on the editor X  X  native speaker skills or X  X n more difficult cases X  X sing online dictionaries. 13 While the existence of Swahili-English bilingual dictionaries is a good achievement and an extremely useful resource, the coverage and completeness of these dictionaries is still relatively low, meaning that the editor frequently needed to make time-consuming internet searches to find appropriate terms. 4.3 Category definitions Each automatically retrieved EMM article is categorised into one or more of hundreds of pre-defined subject domain classes. Some of these categories are rather generic, such as  X  X cology X ,  X  X ommunicable Diseases X  or  X  X ood Security and Aid X , but many of them are rather specific, user-defined categories, which may include the name of a specific disease or of a chemical agent, or the name of a person or organisation. It was decided to only translate the approximately thirty most generic categories and all the categories relating to countries into Swahili, as users usually provide search terms for their own specific categories themselves, if they need to retrieve articles in a certain language. The editor chose to use the English category definitions as a basis for the Swahili equivalent and spent altogether about two person weeks for the definition, verification and tuning of category definitions.
EMM marks articles as belonging to a certain category if they match the category definition, which can consist of Boolean operators with optional vicinity operators and wild cards. Alternatively, cumulative positive or negative weights and a threshold can be used (see Fig. 4 ). Uppercase letters in the category definition only match uppercase words, while lowercase letters match both uppercase and lowercase words. Category definitions in EMM are mixed-language, i.e. definition words of all languages are matched against news articles in all languages. This has the obvious disadvantage that false friends (same words coincidentally meaning different things in different languages) can lead to false positives. It has the advantage, however, that X  X ue to similarities across many languages X  X he same definition word may capture articles in different languages. Examples are the word  X  X sunami X  or the search string  X  X uber_ulos% X  (_ stands for one letter of choice, % matches zero, one or more characters, matching English  X  X uberculosis X , German  X  X uberkulose X , Italian  X  X uberculosi X , etc.). The Swahili category definition word  X  vita  X ( X  fight  X ) X  X ery useful to define the  X  X ecurity X  category X  X s a false friend with the homographic Italian word meaning  X  life  X , so that combinations of words or negative weights had to be used to exclude wrong Italian articles for the Swahili  X  X ecurity X  category. Details on the category definitions, as well as a motivation for the implementation choices made, can be found in Steinberger et al. ( 2009 ). Swahili is more highly inflected than languages such as English, French or Spanish. In the case of highly inflected languages, editors typically use wild cards to capture morphological and other variants of the same lemma. Swahili, however, uses prefixes rather than suffixes and the usage of word-initial wild cards is inefficient when using EMM X  X  finite state tools. Instead of using wild cards, the Swahili category editor thus listed all word-initial morphological variants of the same words (mostly nouns). The number of entries per noun is nevertheless limited, as nouns do not usually change their semantic class so that mostly the singular and plural variants of nouns as well as prepositions needed to be considered. Definiteness of nouns is expressed in Swahili as part of the morpheme indicating the semantic class. The following examples show some Swahili morphological variants for category definition words relating to two different categories. In Swahili, plural is indicated by a plural prefix and by a preposition. In the given example,  X  Ma  X  is the plural prefix of classes 11 and 6.
 Category natural disaster Category conflict m situ/ mi situ (forest/forests) m gogoro/ mi gogoro (uprising/uprisings) m furiko/ mi furiko (flood/floods) ki kosi/ vi kosi (troops) m poromoko wa arthi/ ma poromoko ya ardhi (landslides)
Most category definitions are defined using a Boolean OR list, or an AND combination of OR lists. The Swahili definition for the category  X  X errorist Attack X  ( X  Mashambulizi ya Kigaidi  X ), for instance, contains the words  X  makaidi  X ( suicide bombers ),  X  mlipuko  X ( explosion ) and  X  ma/kombora  X ( bomb ). Defining trigger words that only select relevant texts was a challenging task. Many times, irrelevant articles were classified into a category where they did not belong (false positives). This problem was tackled by tuning the alerts over time, trying to mostly exclude words that led to false positives, and by adding better trigger words. Figure 5 shows a Swahili categorisation result, displaying also the words that helped to trigger this category. 4.4 Person name recognition NewsBrief and MedISys use a finite state automaton to recognise and display known person and organisation names in all 50 languages, including their previously seen inflected forms and spelling variants. This list of known names has been compiled during 7 years of information extraction performed on multilingual news and it currently consists of over 1.15 million names plus about 215,000 spelling variants (status March 2011). NewsExplorer additionally recognises new names in currently 20 languages and identifies which name variants (including across scripts, e.g. Arabic, Cyrillic and Greek) seem to refer to the same real-world entity (Pouliquen and Steinberger 2009 ).

The mentioned named entity types are recognised using a number of rule-based language-independent information extraction patterns (regular expressions). These patterns make reference to various language-specific word lists. The patterns can be applied to a new language (e.g. Swahili) by providing these word lists in a language-specific parameter file for that new language. As the patterns below show, the rules make reference to various slots, which can be filled by any string from the word list with the same name. Generally speaking, any sequence of two or more uppercase words is a name candidate and it will be categorised as an entity if it fulfils any of the rules below. 14 The tool aims to only recognise full names, consisting of at least two name parts, because each name will be grounded in the real world and assigned to a unique name identifier. Name parts are thus not of interest at this stage. Name part co-occurrence within the text (e.g. Mwai Kibaki and Raisi Kibaki ; English: President Kibaki ) are dealt with at a later stage in the processing chain.
The patterns allow any multi-part name to be separated by one or more name infixes (INFIX) such as de la, van der, von, abu, bin , etc. in order to also recognise names such as Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani . For display purposes, name infixes are not shown in the rules below, and various other simplifications were applied. The following patterns (meta-rules) give an idea of the coverage of the person name recognition software. Numbers and the  X  ?  X  sign indicate how many of these elements are required or allowed.  X 2 ?  X  thus means: at least two elements are required, but more are allowed:
The list KNOWN_FIRST_NAME contains tens of thousands of names from around the world. Size and multilinguality of this list is important because rule ( 1 )is very powerful and newspaper articles frequently talk about international issues, and thus about names from around the world. Over 1,500 African names were added to the list for the purpose of improving the recognition coverage of Swahili and other languages. We expected to find more, but it seems that the international name lists already contained many of the collected African names. No additional typically African name infix was found as Arabic and European-language names were already well-covered.
 The TRIGGER_WORD list of elements contains conventional titles (e.g. Dr., Mr., President ), professions and occupations (e.g. spokeswoman, artist, playboy, tennis player ), roles inside teams ( secretary, defence player, short -stop ), adjectives referring to countries, regions, locations, ethnic groups or religions (e.g. Iraqi, Latin -American, Parisian, Berber, Catholic ), and a variety of other strings that may indicate that the adjacent uppercase words are a person (e.g. XX -year -old, has declared, deceased ). To keep things simple, the different semantic types of trigger words are not necessarily separated. Trigger word lists typically consist of thousands of terms. They can be multi-word expressions and may contain further regular expressions to allow variants due to spelling, gender, etc. The TRIG-GER_WORD slot itself is rather complex as it allows for the nesting of known entities inside titles (such as United Nations filling KNOWN in Eq. 4 ) and of unknown all-uppercase words (assumed to be unknown organisations, such as LREC , filling UC in Eq. 5 ). In these two cases, the title proper ( former secretary general , Conference Chair ) is separated from the name by some additional filler words (here: of, the ). The language-specific file with TRIGGER_WORD entries thus also contains MODIFIER (e.g. former, 56 -years -old ) and FILLER words (e.g. determiners and possessives) that are allowed in such constructions, to make up more complex TRIGGER_WORD slots:
Finally, the TRIGGER_WORD category contains also large regular expressions allowing combinations of titles (e.g. minister, president, secretary), filler words and activity domains (e.g. agriculture, finance, foreign affairs), to allow complex titles such as Secretary/Minister/ ... of Agriculture/Finance/Gender Issues/ ... , etc. It goes without saying that these lists and combinations are never going to be complete and that sentence parsing would potentially be a more powerful alternative, but they are much easier to produce for a new language than sentence parsers. We aim to cover those vocabulary items that are empirically most frequently found next to names.
Generally speaking, all rules are under-specified so as to match many different cases in the different languages. The same applies to the different slot types. For instance, the list of MODIFIER elements not only includes many adjectives, but it may also include nouns (e.g. press secretary ) or other parts of speech that may appear in the same position.

The rules allow for the use of name stop words to exclude capturing uppercase words such as Today , which may coincidentally occur next to the person name so that it could be recognised as part of the person name (e.g. Fan Meets President Obama Today ). As we have not yet detected any cases in Swahili, the Swahili stop name list is currently empty.
 Occasionally, the rules identify organisation names instead of person names. These are automatically categorised as belonging to the entity type organisation by using lists of typical organisation name parts, such as Jumuiya (Association), idara (Ministry) , Benki (Bank), ligi (Club), ya kimataifa (International), and mchango (Fund). For some languages, a Bayesian classifier has been trained on known entities to distinguish person from organisation names, but this was not done for Swahili.

The rules have already been applied to 20 languages and we are not aware of the need of any new rule to cover Swahili phenomena. The language-specific Swahili word lists were initially filled by translating the most obvious English dictionary entries such as Rais (president) and Daktari (Doctor), and by exploiting web resources listing professions, religions, regions and more. The country lists produced for menu translations (see Sect. 4.2 ) and category definitions (see Sect. 4.3 ) were also re-used. In a second step, n-gram frequency lists of words found on either side of known entities in a large Swahili news collection were inspected manually to add more entries. Altogether, approximately three person weeks were used to produce the Swahili language-specific parameter files. The individual files now contain over 1,200 words plus a multitude of variants, often expressed as regular expressions. To compare: this is less than the equivalent resources for well-developed EMM languages such as English (3,400), German (2,400) or French (2,700), but it is more than others, such as Italian (700), Portuguese (800) or Swedish (1,000). The three most frequently found names in Swahili news in the six-month period September 2010 to February 2011 are all Tanzanian: President Jakaya Kikwete , the socialist party Chama Cha Mapinduzi and Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda . The titles most frequently found next to names in Swahili text are profesa (English professor ; found 113 times for 24 different persons), jaji ( judge ; 50 X 14), rais ( president ; 22 X 14), katibu ( secretary ; 45 X 7). The longest titles found are katibu mkuu wa chama (secretary general of the party) and makamu wa rais, seneta (vice president, senator). 4.5 Geo-tagging: recognition and disambiguation of geographical references EMM applications not only recognise place names, but attempt to ground them to real-world locations with certain co-ordinates so that the news items can be displayed on a map (Pouliquen et al. 2006 ). The challenges are that there are many places with the same name (e.g. there are fifteen places each called Berlin and London on this globe, each of course with its own co-ordinates) and that place names are frequently homographic with persons (e.g. Paris Hilton ) or common words of a language (e.g. Split in Croatia and And in Armenia). The disambiguation rules are language-independent and can thus also be applied to Swahili text. The geo-tagging task does, however, need two language-specific resources: gazetteers (lists of places and their co-ordinates) and geo-stop word lists, i.e. lists of locations that are homographic with common words of a specific language. No Swahili gazetteer entries have been added to date, but many place names are identified simply because the Swahili place name coincides with the English name. Examples of Swahili words being homographic with place names are the words Katika (a preposition, homographic with places in Zambia, Nigeria, Cyprus and Papua New Guinea) and Hapa (meaning  X  X ere X  in English, homographic with towns in Ghana and Burma). In order to produce lists of locations that are homographic with frequent Swahili words, i.e. words that are likely to lead to the identification of a lot of wrong geo-locations, we produced a Swahili word frequency list and compared each word automatically with our multilingual gazetteer. For the most frequent homographs, the Swahili native speaker decided whether this word should be part of the geo-stop word list or whether it is really a place name. The Swahili geo-stop word list now contains just under two hundred words. The manual effort involved was about one person day. 4.6 Recognition and reference resolution of dates The EMM date recognition module has the task of identifying expressions referring to specific dates. Date types recognised are full dates in various formats (e.g. 3rd of November of the year 2011 and 03/11/2011 ), partial dates missing either the day of the month (e.g. November 2011 ) or the year (e.g. 3rd of November ), and relative dates referring to individual days (e.g. yesterday ) or months (e.g. last November ). In the case of relative dates, the exact date will be calculated, making use of a reference date, which in the case of newspaper articles is today X  X  date. On 3.11.2011, for instance, the expression the day before yesterday is recognised as referring to 1.11.2011. The tool expresses all dates in the normalised form DD/MM/ YYYY. For details, see Ignat et al. ( 2003 ).

To add a new language, the date recognition tool requires the following language-specific information: (a) days of the week, (b) days of the month, ordinal and cardinal, both in numbers and in words, (c) month names, including abbreviations, (d) words that are allowed between the expressions for days, months and the year (e.g. the words of , the and year to capture dates in full format such as 3rd of November of the year 2009 ), (e) relative date expressions such as yesterday , and words that are part of relative date expressions (e.g. last in last May ). The tool also allows to list days of festivities such as New Year X  X  Eve (31.12.) and historical dates such as 9/11 (11.09.2001), but this functionality was not used for Swahili. The effort to produce this language-specific parameter file and to test the tool was about one person day. 4.7 Recognition of quotations (reported speech) EMM systems identify reported speech (quotations) in the news and display those that can be assigned to named speakers with an identifier in our name database (Pouliquen et al. 2007 ). The tool first searches for quotation marks in the text and then verifies whether a full or a partial person name and a reporting verb (e.g. said , replied ) can be found close-by. These words can be separated from the quotation marks by modifiers and by titles . As Swahili does not use different quotation markers from other EMM languages, the task of adapting this functionality to Swahili thus consisted of providing lists of possible reporting verbs (and their morphological variations) and of modifiers. The list of titles is the same as for person name recognition (see Sect. 4.4 ). The effort of the Swahili native speaker to produce the list of 27 reporting verbs (108 word forms when including variants) and a small list of modifiers and determiners was about two person days. In a four-week period in early 2011, the tool identified 178 Swahili quotes, i.e. about seven quotes per day. This number is relatively low as a major news sources was broken during this time so that less than half the usual articles got ingested and analysed. To compare: for the languages English, Italian and Arabic, the tool identifies an average of 2670, 270 and 82 quotes per day, respectively. The by far most frequently found Swahili reporting verb in that period was alisema (English said, 157 occurrences); others were amesema ( has said , 7), alieleza ( described , 5), alisisitiza ( stressed , 4), and more. 5 Evaluation The text mining tools for the recognition of entities (Sect. 5.1 ), quotations (Sect. 5.2 ) and dates (Sect. 5.3 ) were evaluated, using a set of 419 Swahili news articles randomly selected from non-adjacent dates spread out over time. The following sections describe the results of this evaluation. An evaluation of the Boolean category definitions described in Sect. 4.2 is not useful, as categories differ enormously: Specific categories such as  X  X uberculosis X  or  X  X ird flu X  typically work very well, while vaguer categories such as  X  X ecurity X  are much harder, even for humans (see Steinberger et al. 2008b ).

A first evaluation typically helps to find overlooked entries (of quotation verbs, or name titles, of stop words, etc.) and to correct the most obvious errors. It is thus beneficial to do a second evaluation where the major errors have already been corrected. However, as the Swahili speaker was unfortunately only available to us for a limited period, we did not have enough time to carry out this second evaluation so that we have to describe here the results of the first, less favourable evaluation. 5.1 Evaluation of Swahili person and organisation name recognition This functionality was tested on a subset of 100 articles containing 355 entities, of which about 6.5% were organisation names. Note that organisation name recognition is not highly developed in our tool set, although more elaborate organisation recognition patterns are used in other EMM applications not mentioned here and not currently adapted to Swahili. Sixteen additional articles were discarded because they consisted of lists of persons and the sports results they achieved, thus being lists rather than running text. Due to the lack of titles in such lists, names will only be recognised by our tool if they contain a known first name.
 The software identified 294 entities, of which 18 were wrong, yielding thus a Precision of 93.9%. The tool missed 79 entities, meaning that the Recall was 77.7%. Wrongly identified entities include Rover Defender (a car model), Geneva Uswisi (English: Geneva, Switzerland ), Katibu Mkuu Wizara (English: * head secretary of Ministry , with katibu meaning secretary , Mkuu meaning head or leader , and Wizara meaning Ministry ). Error analysis showed that Recall could be improved by adding more first names from the Swahili-speaking countries. Recall will automatically improve with time when the number of known entities increases, because the pattern TITLE wa (of) KNOWN_ORG (Pattern ( 4 ) in Sect. 4.4 ) will recognise complex titles such as katibu mkuu wa Chapa Cha Minduzi (English: head secretary of the Party of Change ) once Chapa Cha Minduzi ( Party of Change ) is a known organisation. Generally speaking, our tool aims at high Precision rather than high Recall, as the high data redundancy in our news collections (2,500 online sources) usually eliminates the effect of low information extraction recall. 5.2 Evaluation of Swahili quotation recognition Our test collection of 419 documents contained 240 quotations marked by quotation marks. Eighty-one of these quotations were of the type we aim to recognise, i.e. quotations accompanied by a reporting verb and X  X ost importantly X  X  named speaker whose full name (at least two name parts) is mentioned somewhere in the text. The software identified correctly 45 and missed 36 of these 81 quotes (Precision = 100%; Recall = 55.6%). Nine quotes were missed because the reporting verbs had not been listed in the language-specific parameter files. Six quotes were missed because quotation marks were not closed when quotations stretched over paragraphs: a new quotation mark was opened to indicate the continuation of the quote instead of first closing the first quotation. The remaining 21 quotes were missed because the named entity tool did not successfully recognise the full name of the speakers in the text. Following the evaluation, the missing reporting verbs (and more) were added to the list and the quotation rule was amended, allowing for non-closed quotes that continue after the end of a paragraph. We thus expect that the tool will perform better in the future. Additionally, the named entity recognition tool will automatically perform better with time as the list of known names will increase (see Sect. 5.1 ). 5.3 Evaluation of Swahili date recognition In the same set of documents, our software detected, resolved and normalised 461 dates of the types described in Sect. 4.6 . Three hundred and fifty-seven of the dates identified were relative dates such as juzi (English the day before yesterday )or kesho (English: tomorrow ). We identified 70 incomplete dates (either the year or the day of the month were not mentioned, e.g. Septemba 26 and Oktoba mwaka huu , English October of this year ), and 34 complete dates (e.g. Oktoba 14, 1999). All the automatically recognised dates were correct (Precision = 100%). We have not evaluated the recall of the system, but we do know that at least some dates of the following format were not recognised: tarehe 24 ya mwezi uliopita wa Septemba (English: 24th of September this month ), where the day (24) is separated from the month ( Septemba ). This format was not foreseen by the rules and such dates were thus not recognised.
 6 Summary and conclusion The Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications are highly multilingual media monitoring applications that gather about 100,000 news articles per day from around the world in about fifty languages, cluster and categorise the news items, track trends and extract information. The software used in EMM is modular and comparatively simple, so as to allow an easy extension of the tools to new languages. In this article, we described the effort involved when adding the new language Swahili, the specific features of Swahili that needed to be considered (e.g. agglutination and prefixes), and the results achieved when applying the newly developed text analysis tools to real-world live news articles. The results of this work can be viewed in the publicly visible EMM applications NewsBrief and NewsExplorer (see Figs. 1 , 2 ). 15 The biggest problem for the applications is the relatively low number of daily Swahili news articles that can be found online, resulting in EMM pages that are sometimes almost empty.

The simplicity of the tools and the decision not to make use of taggers, parsers and large dictionaries is an enormous advantage X  X f not an indispensable premise X  for the development of such a highly multilingual application. However, it does make some tasks harder. An example is the consideration of modifiers separating the quotation from the reporting verb and the speaker: without using a parser that would identify constituents such as prepositional phrases, modifiers need to be listed one by one in the modifier dictionaries, meaning that exhaustive coverage is far from possible. The results achieved by the text analysis applications reported here are nevertheless relatively good, considering also that high data redundancy (reporting about the same event by multiple sources) allows us to focus the effort on high precision and trusting that events will be captured by analysing other news articles that can be analysed successfully. Swahili turned out to be a language that was relatively easy to add to the multilingual tool set. One reason is that it uses the Latin script so that name dictionaries built in the course of time for other languages will also benefit Swahili. Another reason is that proper names are not inflected. The effects of Swahili agglutination, the usage of different prefixes according to the semantic class of nouns, and the double agreement of Swahili verbs both with the subject and the object were either not relevant for our information extraction grammars or they could be dealt with by using regular expressions or by listing several variants. The overall effort of adding Swahili as a twentieth language to NewsExplorer and to the other EMM applications can be considered successful. References
