 concept interconnection[6],[7]. different values under different conditions. assigning to each attribute the set of allowed values under some conditions. provides some interesting problems. by defining[8]: a description d, iff m(g)  X  d(m),  X  m  X  M.
 of the descriptions, and the infimum  X  d j is given by their disjunction: d  X  :={g  X  G |m(g)  X  d(m),  X  m  X  M }. complete lattice: supremums defined by (Where {(A j ,d j )| j  X  J}  X   X  (K).):  X  (A where  X  X m/h X  and  X  X  X  are the units. which it holds that (g, m, q, w)  X  I and (g, m, q, v)  X  I always imply w=v. conditions, the attribute m may have the different values the object g. For example, the extended formal descriptions about Abraham Lincoln and John F. (Height.Being an adult: About 1.95m), (Status. From 1847 to1859: Lawyer), (Status. distinct the descriptions of object g in K and ones in  X  .  X  {(  X  ,  X  )}: m(A):={(q,g(m))|g  X  A  X  X  X  q  X  Q(g,m,q,g(m))  X  I}or {(  X  ,  X  )|(g,m,q,g(m))  X  I} 
We extend the order on P (Q  X  W ) given by inclusion to P* (Q  X  W ) by defining iff (q, m(g))  X  d(m),  X  m  X  M. changing the structure of the concept lattice.  X  dj is given by their disjunction: A m|  X  m(A), d  X  :={g  X  G |(q, g(m))  X  d(m),  X  m  X  M }. lattice: supremum by:  X  (A functions as follows: and  X  assigns to each object g  X  G and attribute m  X  M a subset  X  (g, m )  X  W. For each concept (A, d), d(m)| A =m(A)=  X  g  X  A {  X  (g,m)  X  {(  X  ,  X  )}. object semantic interconnect if satisfying the following conditions: Proposition 6: The object semantic interconnection has the following basic forms: g g semantic interconnect if satisfying the following conditions: C  X  x  X  A C C -+,--};5)C 1  X  C 3  X  C 1  X  ? C 2  X  C 1  X  ? C 3 , ?  X  {++,+-,+,-, -+,--}. interconnect.  X  satisfying one of the following conditions:  X  g  X  g  X  g  X  g Proposition 11: Order interconnection is reflexive and anti-symmetric. interconnect. conditions:  X  g (m 2 )  X   X  (m 2 (g 2 )) {| g 1 (m 1 )-g 2 (m 1 )|= | g 1 (m 2 )-g 2 (m 2 )|} Proposition 13:  X  -interconnection is reflexive, symmetric and anti-symmetric. define: or, equivalently, that within the context  X  , d 1 is a premise of d 2 . g the description d 1 . complexity. |M|= n . Now, we provide an example to explain these interconnection definitions. From the extended formal descriptions about Lincoln and Kennedy, we can easily obtain the following interesting knowledge: 1) Lincoln was higher than Kennedy; 2) Lincoln hundred years after Lincoln becoming a president, John F. Kennedy won president position. semantic interconnection based on the extended description and implication between have interconnections. more deeply.
