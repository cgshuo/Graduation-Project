 Taxonomies embody formalized knowledge and define ag-gregations between concepts/categories in a given domain, facilitating the organization of the data and making the con-tents easily accessible to the users. Since taxonomies have significant roles in the data annotation, search and navi-gation, they are often carefully engineered. However, espe-cially in very dynamic content, they do not necessarily reflect the content knowledge. Thus, in this paper, we propose A Narrative Interpretation of Taxonomies for their Adaptation ( ANITA ) for re-structuring existing taxonomies to varying ap-plication contexts and we evaluate the proposed scheme by user studies that show that the proposed algorithm is able to adapt the taxonomy in a new compact and understandable structure from a human point of view.

While there are many strategies for organizing text doc-uments, hierarchical categorization  X  X sually implemented through a pre-determined taxonomical structure X  is often the preferred choice. In a taxonomy-based information or-ganization, each category in the hierarchy can index text documents that are relevant to it, facilitating the user in the navigation and access to the available contents. Un-fortunately, given a set of text documents, it is not easy to find the appropriate categorization that best describes the contents. In fact the available taxonomies are usually designed for broad coverage of concepts in a considered do-main, failing to properly reflect important details within the considered data collection.

In this paper we introduce a new method for distilling a taxonomical domain categorization from an existing one, within the context of a set of text documents that have to be represented and indexed by it. Thus, recognizing that the primary role of a taxonomy is to describe or narrate the nat-ural relationships between concepts in a given domain to its users, we propose A Narrative Interpretation for Taxonomy Adaptation ( ANITA ), a novel distillation approach for adapt-ing existing taxonomies to varying application contexts.
In the literature, many authors tried to automatically extract hierarchical categorizations from text corpora. [2] presents an overview about the many methodologies that have been proposed to automatically extract structured in-formation from texts. In [10], Sanderson et al. present an unsupervised method to automatically derive from a set of documents a hierarchical organization of concepts, using co-occurrence information.

One of the most critical tasks is the definition of the se-mantical relationships among the retrieved concepts: [4] organized the extracted concepts by analyzing the syntac-tic dependencies of the terms in the considered text corpus. Many other methods rely on preliminary supervised oper-ations to limit the noise in the retrieved concepts: in [1], the user sketches a preliminary ontology for a domain by selecting the vocabulary associated to the desired elements in the ontology (this phase is called lexicalisation). In [8], Ponzetto et al. investigate the problem of automatic knowl-edge acquisition from Wikipedia repositories.

Evaluation of the quality of automatically generated tax-onomies is a very important and non-trivial task. In [11], authors determine the precision of the clustering algorithm by manually assigning a relevance judgment to the docu-ments associated to the clusters. In [12], authors use the F-Score to evaluate the accuracy of the document associa-tions (but the approach requires a ground truth, which is hard to determine in many cases). In [9] authors perform a user study to evaluate the qualities of the relationships between concepts and their children and parent concepts. In [6], the quality of the concepts is measured by evaluating their ability to find documents within the hierarchy.
Given an input taxonomy H ( C, E ) (also called hierarchy in the paper) where C = { c 1 , . . . , c n } represents the set of n concept nodes (or categories) and E is the set of structural based on a given context defined by a corpus, D , of text doc-uments. As described before, ANITA relies on a  X  X arrative X  interpretation of the input taxonomy to achieve this goal. Unlike the original taxonomy, which is hierarchical, the nar-rative is linear in structure; however, it is created in such a way that the structure of the narrative corresponds to the structure of the hierarchy. More specifically, the scope of each concept (represented as a sentence) is contextual-ized by those that precede and follow it, and this contextual scope corresponds to both the structural information (com-ing from the original structure) as well as the content of the considered corpus.
Whereas a taxonomy is a hierarchy of concept-nodes, a narrative is a sequence of sentences. Therefore, in order to create a narrative corresponding to the taxonomy, we need to map concept-nodes of the input taxonomy into concept-sentences . What we refer to as concept-sentences are not natural language sentences, but vectors obtained by analyz-ing the structure of the given taxonomy and the related cor-pus of documents. Intuitively, these sentence-vectors can be thought of as being analogous to keyword-vectors commonly used in representing documents in IR systems.

Concept-sentences associate to each concept a coherent set of semantically related keywords, extracted from the associ-ated text corpus. Thus, for each concept c i in the considered hierarchy, we associate a sentence-vector ~ sv c i as where v represents the total number of considered terms (the corpus vocabulary and labels in the taxonomy), and w i,j represents the semantical correlations between the j-th term and the i-th taxonomical concept.

Concept-sentences can be obtained in many different ways; [3], [4], [7] propose various approaches that leverage semantic similarities between concepts in a given context for obtaining such vectors. In this paper, we use the approach proposed in [3] to associate to each concept a keyword-vector, that tightly integrates terms extracted from text doc-uments and labels of concepts obtained from the considered domain taxonomy. Thus, the resulting vectors reflect both the structural context (imposed by the taxonomy) and the documents X  content (imposed by the corpus).

After the vector-based encoding of the concept-sentences , the creation of the narrative is completed by ordering these sentences (therefore the nodes in the original hierarchy) in an order representing the structure of the taxonomy. A hi-erarchy is structured in a way that the most general concept is used as the root of the hierarchy and the most specific ones are the leaves. In a sense, each node provides more specialized knowledge within the context defined by all its ancestors. We leverage this observation to create a narra-tive: the sentences associated to the nodes of the taxonomy can be read in different orders to obtain the narrative. In the evaluations presented in Section 4, we consider the pre-order reading, where each concept-sentence is immediately followed by its detailed description in terms of its special-izations.
At this point, the narrative is a sequence of sentences (or more precisely sentence-vectors), each including the infor-mation coming from the structural knowledge (hierarchy) and the context knowledge (documents), defining a global discourse that covers all the topics addressed by the taxon-omy, according to the knowledge expressed by the contents.
In the next step, we analyze this narrative to identify seg-ments (or partitions) that are highly correlated. The idea is that if, in the given corpus, two concepts are highly corre-lated, they may not need two separate nodes in the adapted taxonomy. In contrast, if there is a significant difference between two portions of the narrative, then these two por-tions (or segments) do necessitate different concepts in the resulting taxonomy.

In this paper, in order to partition the narrative ~sv 1 , ~sv 2 , . . . , ~sv n into coherent segments, we seek partitions that correspond to similar internal coherence (defined in terms of the total amount of internal topic drift): 1. Given the narrative (i.e., ordered sequence of sentence-2. The sequence of vectors is then analyzed for topic
At the end of the process, we have a set of segments, or partitions, P = { P 1 , P 2 , , P k } that represent sequences of coherent narrative components. Note that, each partition is a sequence of concepts from the original taxonomy and defines a single concept in the revised taxonomy
In order to construct the adapted taxonomy from the par-titions created in the previous step, we need to re-attach the partitions in the form of a tree structure. Furthermore, for each partition, we need to pick a label that will be presented to the user and will describe the concepts in the partition. (where each node c  X  i represents the partition P i ) should pre-serve the original structure of H ( C, E ) as much as possible:  X  The root of H  X  is c root (1  X  root  X  k ) such that the corresponding partition P root contains the root of H .  X  Let us consider a pair, P i and P j , of partitions in P . The decision on whether (and how) the corresponding concepts Figure 1: Narrative-based adaptation of a taxonomy fragment: based on the structural constraints and the available NSF content (described in Section4) (a) the partitions are linked to each other. Finally, (b) each partition is labeled by selecting a represen-tative label. c  X  i and c  X  j should be connected is based on the following analysis. Let E i,j be the set of edges in E linking any concept in P i to any concept in P j . Similarly, let E j,i be the set of edges in E linking any concept in P j to any concept in P i . With the goal of preserving to the best the structure of H , we measure the strength of the structural constraints implied by E in H , and we propose as our solution the adapted taxonomy which maximally preserves such constraints.

Let e = h c a , c b i be an edge in H that connects two dif-ferent partitions P i and P j (i.e. c a  X  P i , c b  X  P j strength of the structural constraint e , strength ( e ), (i.e., the strength of the structural constraints induced by e ) is 1+ d b , being d b the number of descendants of c b in H that also belong to P j .
 as the ancestor of c  X  j is supported by the strength of the structural constraints associated to the edges in E i,j .
Thus, the taxonomy H  X  , is constructed by maximally pre-serving such constraints as follows:
For example, let us consider the taxonomy fragment and its partitions shown in Figure 1(a). In the adapted hierarchy (Figure 1(b)), ANITA picks as root the partition containing the root node ( X  science  X ). Then, the remaining three parti-tions have been attached to it by analyzing the constraints given by the structural original edges. Note that the distilla-tion process can alter the structure of the hierarchy, since the relationships among concepts could change from one domain to another one. For example, in a political context, concepts  X  nuclear  X  and  X  environment  X  will may found to be strongly related, while in a context of a scientific taxonomy, the con-cept X  nuclear  X  X ay be more rigorously related to the concept  X  physics  X  (in fact, as shown in Figure 1(b), considering the NSF awarded abstracts,  X  nuclear  X  has been connected to  X  physics  X ). Therefore, considering the knowledge expressed by the domain experts in the original taxonomy, ANITA tries to preserve the original relationships among concepts, but alters the structure when there is sufficient evidence in the corpus that a different structure would reflect the content better.
In order to select a representative label for each partition we need to analyze the obtained partitions in the context of the original structure. In order to pick a label for the node associated to P i , we consider the structural relationships in the original hierarchy H among the nodes in P i . If there is a concept c i  X  P i that dominates all the other nodes in the partition (i.e.,  X  c j  X  P i c j is a descendant of c the label of c i is selected as the label of c  X  i . If there is no such single node, then the minimal set D i of nodes covering the partition P i (based on H ) is found, and the concatenation of the concept labels in D i is used as the partition label. Intuitively, a concatenation implies that, in the given docu-ment context, these corresponding concepts are found to be not sufficiently distinguished from each other. On the other hand, any label that was in the original taxonomy, but is not included in the new taxonomy is found to be unnecessary in the new context. An example can be seen in Figure 1(b).
In order to analyze the benefits of using an ANITA adapted categorization for text data indexing purposes, we conducted a user study and evaluate the feedback of 16 users when exploring a set of scientific abstracts from National Science Foundation 1 (  X  50K article abstracts describing NSF awards for basic research, with over  X  30K unique keywords) using different taxonomies.

The users represent various range of ages, backgrounds, jobs and education level and they have intermediate web ability (they are not computer scientists or domain experts).
We presented to the users, three different taxonomies that indexed NSF documents: the original portion of DMOZ-extracted taxonomy, with 72 concepts (obtained consider-ing the most relevant terms, in the considered domains, ex-tracted from the corpora), its ANITA -based adaptation with 13 concepts (with k randomly set to 13) and the k -Means based adaptation (with same value of k ) 2 . In order to avoid bias in the evaluation of the presented taxonomies, we pre-sented the 3 taxonomies to the user in a random order.
Given a randomly selected concept label extracted from the original taxonomy (different for each partecipating user), 2 For the k -Means clustering, the sentence-vector represen-tation of the taxonomy nodes is used to support partition-ing. Also, once the partitions are obtained, the same tax-onomy re-construction and labeling strategies (described in Section 3.3) are used to stitch the taxonomy back. Table 1: User Study: Average time and average number of interactions (clicks on the structure for expanding or collapsing nodes) per taxonomy, when the users explore the structure to retrieve docu-ments related to a randomly selected concept. we asked the users, for each presented taxonomy, to retrieve related documents by exploring the presented categoriza-tions. Therefore, we analyze the time and the number of in-teractions (in terms of expansions/collapses of the presented nodes in the taxonomies) the user needs to reach satisfac-tory documents. As reported in Table 1, ANITA adapted taxonomy reports significant gains in terms of time (from an average of 23.5 seconds to an average of 9.7) and num-ber of interactions (from 5.1 to 2.3) by reducing the number of nodes the user has to navigate through. On the other hand it is important to note that, even if k -Means adapted taxonomy presents the same number of nodes as ANITA , it is not able to guide the user as well as ANITA adapted tax-onomies do; the user needs more time to find relevant doc-uments (an average of 11.0 seconds) and more interactions to retrieve the appropriate contents (an average of 2.9 op-erations). Thus, we can state that ANITA is not only able to reduce the cardinality of the selected taxonomy, but also or-ganizes the concepts in such a way to facilitate the retrieval operations.

Given a randomly selected article (different for each con-sidered user), extracted from the considered NSF corpus of documents, we asked to the users, for each presented taxon-omy, to select those nodes (if any) that would best represent the selected content. Then we compared these user associa-calculating the percentage of shared concepts associated. All the considered users provided, for each document, between two and three associated concepts per taxonomy. The re-sults indicate that, for the original taxonomy, 67.7% of the user selected concepts were shared by the system. Simi-larly, the ANITA -based adapted taxonomy provides a 68.7% of shared concepts, indicating that the quality of the tax-onomy is as good as original one despite containing much smaller number of concepts. On the other hand, the k -Means based adapted taxonomy does not perform well: only 37.4% of the user selected concepts had been effectively associated by the system to such nodes, highlighting the fact that a naive re-structuring process (such as k -Means) can cause a significant increase in terms of confusion and disorganiza-tion.

After the study, each user also completed a brief ques-tionnaire which included two questions ( X  X s the taxonomy easy to use? X  and  X  X s the taxonomy sufficiently detailed? X ); erality, we rely on the concept-vectors introduced in [5], by quantifying, as usual, the cosine similarity between the doc-ument keyword-vector (containing term frequencies) and the concept sentence-vector.
 Table 2: Subjective questions in the user study: for each question, each user has quantified her opinion by a 5-point scale rating. the users could quantify the responses using a 5-point scale ratings.

As show in Table 2, the users reported that the ANITA adapted taxonomy was as  X  X asy to use X  as the original one (both 4.1) while the k -Means adapted taxonomy was signif-icantly harder to use (3.3). Moreover, even if the number of presented nodes was dropped almost 80%, the users com-mented that, in terms of providing  X  X ufficient details X  (i.e., the number of alternatives), ANITA adapted taxonomy pro-vides a good range of details, close to the original one (3.6 vs 3.8). We can summarize these results as follows: as initially supposed, the original taxonomies, developed by domain ex-perts for broad coverage of documents, provide unnecessary details that can be removed without causing significant loss in terms of contextual knowledge. On the other hand, a gen-eral adaptation method such as k -Means, could introduce confusion and disorientation: the k -Means adapted taxon-omy significantly reduces the  X  X ufficiency X  (only 2.6) and re-sults in taxonomies that the users find harder to use (3.3 in terms of  X  X asy to use X ). In this paper, we introduced A Narrative Interpretation of Taxonomies for their Adaptation ( ANITA ) for re-structuring existing taxonomies to varying application contexts. The user studies validated the proposed technique from a human point of view.
