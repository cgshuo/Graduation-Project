 1. Introduction
As a compromise to natural language understanding, Information Extraction (IE) aims to extract structured information 2012; Maslennikov &amp; Chua, 2007; Patwardhan &amp; Riloff, 2007; Patwardhan &amp; Riloff, 2009 ). In comparison, there are few successful stories regarding Chinese event extraction due to the special characteristics in the occurrence of unknown triggers 1 and the lack of sentence-level information.
 For the occurrence of unknown triggers, Table 1 gives the statistics in both the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) 2005  X  instances and uses a classifier to distinguish true trigger mentions from pseudo ones. tion, especially when the word triggering an event is polysemous or an unknown trigger. Kim (2000) compares the use of to only 64% in Chinese. Our statistics in the ACE 2005 Chinese corpora shows that almost 55% event arguments are missing and this imposes extra difficulty in Chinese event extraction.

To resolve above two issues, this paper proposes two novel inference mechanisms to Chinese trigger identification by employing the compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers to infer unknown triggers and imposing the discourse con-sistency between Chinese trigger mentions to recover trigger mentions.

The first mechanism is motivated by the compositional nature of Chinese words, whose semantics can be often deter-mined by the component morphemes. Hence, it is natural to infer unknown triggers by employing the compositional seman-tics inside Chinese triggers. Take following two sentences as examples: (E1) 4  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  /4-Ming-Xue-Sheng-Bei-Bo-Li-Hua-Shang/ (E2) 1  X   X   X   X   X   X  /1-Ming-Cheng-Ke-Bei-Chi-Shang/ where  X  X   X   X  /Hua-Shang/ X  is a known trigger and  X  X   X   X  /Chi-Shang/ X  is an unknown one. those of  X  X   X  /Hua/ X  (scratch) and  X  X   X  /Shang/ X  (injure) while the semantics of  X  X  can easily infer that  X  X   X   X  /Chi-Shang/ X (injure by stabbing) in (E2) is a trigger if  X  X  in (E1) is known as a trigger. Similarly, we can infer more triggers in the event type injure , such as  X  X  by burning),  X  X   X   X  /Zhuang-Shang/ X  (injure by hitting),  X  X 
The second mechanism is enlightened by the wide existance of the discourse consistency in natural languages, particu-do ones is only possible with discourse-level information. Take following two contingent sentences as examples: (E3)  X   X   X   X   X  3  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  /Mei-Guo-Yu-Bei-Han-3-Hao-Zai-Ji-Long-Po-Jie-Shu-Fei-Dan-Hui-Tan/ (E4)  X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X  /Hui-Tan-De-Qi-Fen-Yan-Su/ sentential information (entities, such as agents, time and place in the sentence) and difficult for mention  X  X  in the sentence (E4), we can easily infer from the sentence (E3) that  X  X  type, it is very likely that its other instances in the same discourse will be a trigger mention of the same event type. baseline system for Chinese event extraction.

 2. Related work information.

Compared with the tremendous work on English trigger identification, there are only a few studies on Chinese trigger identification.

On feature engineering, Tan, Zhao, and Zheng (2008) first employ a local feature selection method to ensure the perfor-
On trigger expansion, almost all the related studies use predefined or automatically-clustered synsets, a common mech-ger and its arguments in a special event mention to Chinese via manual cross-lingual projection and then add those addi-texts and thus may introduce too many pseudo triggers and harm the precision.

As an important hypothesis in natural languages, the discourse consistency has been widely applied to many natural inference mechanism to refine local extraction results for the disease name, location and start/end time. Mann (2007)
Ji and Grishman (2008) employ a rule-based approach to propagate consistent triggers and arguments across topic-related documents. Gupta and Ji (2009) use a similar approach to recover implicit time information for events. Liao and Grishman (2011) integrates a similar approach with a self-training strategy to extract events. Besides, Liao and Grishman (2010) employ the cross-event consistency information to improve sentence-level event extraction. Hong et al. (2011) regard the entity type consistency as a key feature to predict event mentions and propose a cross-entity inference mechanism to improve the traditional event extraction system.
 improve the performance of Chinese event extraction, in particular Chinese trigger identification. 3. Task definition and baseline system
In this section, we define the task firstly and then introduce a strong baseline system. 3.1. Task definition cific occurrence involving participants, we list some ACE terminologies: Event mention: a phrase or sentence within which an event is described;
Trigger: the main word which most clearly expresses the occurrence of an event, so recognizing an event can be recast as identifying a corresponding trigger; Trigger mention: a reference to a trigger; Event type: the type of an event; Argument: an entity involved in an event; Argument role: the relation of an argument to an event where it participates.
 In particular, the event extraction task can be divided into four components: Trigger identification: to distinguish true trigger mentions from pseudo trigger mentions; Event type classification: to classify trigger mentions by event types; Argument identification: to distinguish true arguments from pseudo arguments; Argument role classification: to classify arguments by argument roles.

Take the following sentence as an example: (E5)  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  /Sha-Long-Jin-Tian-Dao-Da-Hua-Sheng-Dun/ should determine it as a Movement event. Finally, the argument identifier should select  X  X 
Tian/ X  (today) and  X  X   X   X   X  /Hua-Sheng-Dun/ X  (Washington) as the arguments of this event mention and the argument role classifier should assign the roles Artifact , Time and Destination to them respectively. 3.2. Baseline system
For comparison, we re-implement the state-of-the-art Chinese event extraction system, as described in Chen and Ji afterwards. Finally, the argument role classifier is introduced to assign a role to each argument.
One problem with Chen and Ji X  X  system is its ignoring effective long-distance features. In order to resolve this problem and provide a stronger baseline, we introduce more features into four components: nearest entity to the trigger mention + entity; tion, the dependency path from the entity to the trigger mention; (2) neighbor words: the left neighbor word of the returned by a semantic role labeler ( Zhou, Li, Fan, &amp; Zhu, 2011 ).

Normally, Chinese trigger identification may suffer much from the errors propagated from upstream processing such as 3.3. Experimental setting
Chinese documents annotated with 8 predefined event types and 33 predefined subtypes. In this paper, we adopt the same experimental setting as Chen and Ji (2009b) and randomly select 567 documents as the training set and the remaining 66 of ACE diagnostic tasks, and use the ground truth entities, times and values for our training and testing.
For evaluation, we follow the same standards as defined in Ji (2009) : A trigger is correctly identified if its position in the document matches a reference trigger;
An event type is correctly determined if the event type of a trigger mention and its position in the document match a reference trigger;
An argument is correctly identified if its involved event type and position in the document match any of the reference argument mentions;
An argument role is correctly determined if its involved event type, position in the document, and role match any of the reference argument mentions.

Finally, all sentences in the corpus are divided into words using a word segmenter ICTCLAS both the constituent and dependency parse trees and employ the ME model 3.4. Experimental results and 0.3 units in F1-measure in the four components respectively. However, this improvement is very limited compared to possible 8.7% word segmentation errors to known and unknown triggers.

For our baseline system, given the small performance gaps between trigger identification and event type classification cates the importance of trigger identification in overall Chinese event extraction.

Language is perhaps the only communicative system in nature, which compositionally builds structured meanings from and usage in Chinese language processing by employing it into Chinese trigger identification. 4.1. Compositional semantics and morphological structures in Chinese words Both in English and Chinese languages, a word is composed of one or more characters. However, a component character in own meanings as morphemes, the minimal meaningful unit in Chinese language. If a Chinese word contains more than one morpheme, its meaning can be often interpreted in terms of its composite morphemes. This more fine-grained semantics are the compositional semantics inside Chinese words namely. Actually, it is also a normal way to understand a new Chinese words. For example,  X  X   X   X  /Hui-Jian/ X  is composed of two morphemes,  X  X  tics, and the semantics of  X  X   X   X  /Hui-Jian/ X  comes from those of its component morphemes  X  X 
Without doubt, a general method to represent the compositional semantics inside Chinese words is to systematically ex-plore the morphological structures in Chinese words since it is the nature of compound words. As the basic word-building mechanism to form morphemes into words, the morphological structures of Chinese words are formulated by three major processes: compounding, affixation, and conversion. Among them, compounding concatenates two or more morphemes to-form, and conversion changes a word from one POS into another without the addition or deletion of any morphemes. Be-sides, compounding is the most productive way to compose a Chinese word while affixation is the most popular way to con-words have more than one grammatical role. 4.2. Morphological structures in Chinese triggers or verbal nouns and nearly 5% of the triggers are nouns (e.g.,  X  X  contain one or two morphemes. Therefore, this paper only considers the one-morpheme and two-morpheme triggers of verbs and nouns. Besides, this paper focuses on following morphological structures in compounding a two-morpheme trig-ger (besides the one-morpheme structure) due to its dominance:
Coordinative Structure : The two morphemes of a trigger play coordinative roles. For example,  X  X   X  /Bing/ X  (merge) are coordinative in trigger  X  X   X   X  /He-Bing/ X  (merge).

Modifier-Head Structure : The modified morpheme follows the modifying one in a trigger. For example,  X  X  (marry) is modified by  X  X   X  /Xin/ X  (new) in trigger  X  X   X   X 
Subject-Predicate Structure : One morpheme is the subject and the other one tells something about the subject. This structure is like a subject-predicate sentence condensed in a trigger. For example,  X  X  icate  X  X   X  /Wang/ X  (die) in trigger  X  X   X   X  /Shen-Wang/ X  (die).
  X  /Ye/ X  (business) serves as the object of predicate  X  X   X 
Predicate-Complement Structure : The first morpheme is a predicate and the second one interprets the first one from different aspects (e.g., direction, result and tense) in a trigger. For example, morpheme X  X  tion of action  X  X   X  /Jin/ X  (go) in trigger  X  X   X   X  /Jin-Ru/ X  (go into). 4.3. Determining morphological structures in Chinese triggers
A general method to determine the morphological structures in Chinese triggers is to first annotate some instances man-logical structures: Single-Morpheme Structure : For a single-morpheme trigger whose POS is noun or verb, its morphological structure is cases given correct POSs.
 Object . The statistics on the training set shows that this inference rule covers 99.2% of cases given correct POSs.
Coordinative Structure : If the POS structure of a trigger is ( verb + verb ) (e.g.,  X  X   X  /Hun/NN  X  /Yin/NN X  (marriage)).
 dinative or Subject-Predicate , respectively.

Subject-Predicate Structure : Our exploration on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus shows that only one trigger (i.e.  X  X  Shen-Wang/ X  (die)) has the Subject-Predicate structure. Therefore, we ignore this structure in this paper. extracted using above inference rules. Random manual evaluation of 1000 instances shows that our inference rules achieve the accuracy of 91.2% given automatically-tagged POSs. 4.4. Identifying head morphemes in Chinese triggers
Normally, almost all Chinese verbs or nouns contain one morpheme as the governing semantic element, called Head Mor-unknown triggers via HMs. For example, given verb  X  X   X  /Si/ X  (die) as HM in trigger  X  X  of the Die event) whose morphological structure is Coordinative , it is reasonable to infer  X  X   X  structures and HMs as  X  X   X   X  /Shao-Si/ X . This also applies to noun as HM. For example, given X  X 
HM  X  X   X  /Xin/ X  (letter) and morphological structure Modifier-Head (e.g.,  X  X  Xin/ X  (secret letter), etc.), as new triggers.

Therefore, how to identify the HM in a Chinese trigger becomes the key to infer unknown triggers. Table 5 shows our automatic mechanism to identify HM, where LM(w) and RM(w) are used to obtain the left and right morphemes from one-morpheme or two-morphemes word w respectively.
 morphological structure is Coordinative . For example, trigger  X  X  dinative , whose two component morphemes,  X  X   X  /Fang/ X  (visit) and  X  X  we can find out that morpheme  X  X   X  /Fang/ X  (visit) has the same meaning as trigger  X  X  way to identify HM in a trigger of the Coordinative structure is via the semantic similarity. In this paper, we employ HowNet 5 (Dong and Dong, 2006) to obtain the semantics of Chinese words. Similar to Wordnet in the semantic similarity between the sememes of the trigger x and its morpheme y as follow: where Dis(x,y) is the distance between the sememe of x and y in HowNet X  X  sememe hierarchical architecture and for / . Howerver, our experimental results show this parameter is not sensitive enough: when parameter and Li (2002) .

If the sememe of a trigger is similar to one of its morphemes, we extract this morpheme as HM. For those words that have trigger mentions, the percentages become 89.1% and 65.2% respectively. An extreme example is that 85.2% (75/88) of the trigger types in the Trial-Hearing event mentions contain HM  X  X  in the injure event mentions contains HM  X  X   X  /Shang/ X  (injure). 4.5. Inferring unknown triggers
To better represent the nature of the compositional semantics inside Chinese words, we infer unknown triggers both on the head morphemes and governing sememes, according to their morphological structures.
Firstly, following the compositional semantics principle, all the one-morpheme or two-morpheme words in the test set are extracted as candidates if candidate word w satisfies following conditions: (1) w contains at least one HM; (2) The POS of w is noun or verb; (3) w occurs as a pseudo trigger less than 5 times in the training set; triggers.

Secondly, for each candidate word w in the candidate set, we apply following inferences to distinguish the true unknown triggers from the pseudo ones on different morphological structures, according to its morphological structure.
Single-Morpheme : We expand those HMs in two-morpheme triggers as the single-morpheme triggers. So we apply a simple inference to infer unknown triggers: if the maximum score of the semantic similarity SemSim between word w and each known trigger which contain word w is equal to 1, we accept w as an unknown trigger.
Predicate-Complement :The first morpheme is usually a verb, so the sememe of word w always is similar to the sememe of its first morpheme. We accept word w as an unknown trigger when its left morpheme is in the set of left morphemes of those Predicate-Complement triggers in the training set .

Predicate-Object : we regard word w as an unknown trigger following two conditions:
Similar triggers are those triggers with the same morphological structure and the same HM. For example, if there are two triggers  X  X   X   X  /Li-Zhi/ X  (resign) and  X  X   X   X  /Ci-zhi/ X  (resign), and their HMs are  X  X  zhi/ X  (resign), its morphological structure is as same as the above two and its HM also is  X  X  triggers and calculate the similarities between  X  X   X  /Mian/ X (dismiss) and the predicates ( X  X  in its similar triggers in the training set.

Modifier-Head :The first morpheme of word w modifies the second one, so that the semantics of word w comes from its second morpheme. We apply following rules based on POS consistency and semantic similarity:
Coordinative : Since the two composite morphemes of word w are homogeneous and its semantics is flexible and maybe comes from the combination of its two morphemes or one of its morpheme. We calculate the average score of the sim-ilarities to infer trigger of this type as follows: their left/right morphemes and the left/right morpheme of word w are the same HM. Besides, own triggers. 5. Imposing discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions to recover trigger mentions
Some trigger mentions fail to provide enough intra-sentential information to the trigger identifier and their triggering an event is polysemous or an unknown trigger. In this paper, we impose the discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions to recover trigger mentions for Chinese trigger identification. 5.1. Discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions
Take the following discourse as an example: (E6) 8  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  (TM1) /8-Ri-Wan-You-Tai-Ren-He-A-La-Bo-Ren-Zai-Na-Sa-Lei-Shi-Fa-
Obviously, it is easy for a trigger identifier to determine that mention TM1 of trigger  X  X 
Table 7 compares the discourse consistency between trigger mentions in the ACE 2005 Chinese and English corpora. Here,
TM1, TM2 and TM3 of trigger  X  X   X   X  /Chong-Tu/ X  in (E6) are annotated full-consistent while both TM1/TM2 and TM2/TM3 are event mentions in the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus.

Inspired by the observation on the adjacent pair consistency between the mentions of the same trigger, we find out that also trigger an event of the same type. Take the following discourse as an example: (E7)  X   X   X  26  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  (TM4)  X   X   X   X   X   X  /Wu-Sa0-zu-26-Sui-De-Shi-Hou-Jiu-Dan-Ren-Quan-Guo-Xue-Lian-
In (E7), trigger mentions TM4, TM5 and TM6 have the same HM  X  X  trigger mentions with the same HM holds in more than 90% cases. 5.2. Recovering trigger mentions via discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions consistency to impose the discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions. Particularly, we apply the Markov Net-impose the discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions and introduce the First Order Logic to infer trigger mentions.

Following the discourse consistency principle, our method infers a trigger mention based on other mentions of the same we apply Markov Logic Network (MLN) ( Richardson &amp; Domingos, 2006 ) to recover true trigger mentions. applications (e.g., Poon and Domingos, 2007; Poon and Vanderwende, 2010; Song, Jiang, Zhao, Li, &amp; Wang, 2012 ). dence and query predicates used in our MLN, along with brief descriptions.

The second and third formulas are adopted, following the discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions, to re-discourse.

In particular, the open-source Alchemy package 6 is employed for learning and inference. Like Poon and Vanderwende mentions. 6. Experimentation
In this section, we first evaluate our computational semantics and discourse consistency mechanisms in inferring un-tification and overall Chinese event extraction, using the same experimental settings as described in Section 3.3. 6.1. Computational semantics: inferring unknown triggers
As the key to infer unknown triggers, Table 9 shows the performance of HM identification. For evaluation, the HMs of all the known triggers in the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus are manually labeled by three annotators and we accept those mor-phemes as HMs when at least two annotators agree on them.

Manual inspection shows that 57% of errors are related to two morphological structures, Predicate-Object and Coordina-tification (34%), largely due to wrong POS tagging.
 may be a combination of its component morphemes instead of just the head morpheme. For example, while  X  X  is a useful HM to infer triggers  X  X   X   X  /Li-Zhi/ X  (resign),  X  X  cates also play an important role in composing their semantics (e.g.,  X  X  For a trigger with the Coordinative structure, it is possible that none of its component morphemes is HM.
Table 10 shows the performance of inferring unknown triggers via the compositional semantics. Manual inspection shows that 62 words are inferred as unknown triggers, among which 69.4% are true triggers.
Table 11 shows the contribution of inference rules on different morphological structures to infer unknown trigger men-and Ji (2009b) and our baseline event extraction system
Compared with the baseline , our mechanism recovers 16.3% (60) of true trigger mentions. This improvement further proves that our mechanism is effective to infer unknown trigger mentions. Moreover, combining HMs and sememes of Chi-nese words not only can infer unknown trigger mentions, but also can filter out more pseudo trigger mentions. Table 11 number of pseudo trigger mentions is reduced to only 508, less than that of the Baseline. 6.2. Discourse consistency: recovering trigger mentions
We collect relevant information from the trigger identifier and event type classifier and simply accept those mentions pseudo trigger mentions. The high and low probability thresholds are fine-tuned to 95% and 5% respectively, using the development set. Specifically, for those mentions in-between, we apply our MLN-based mechanism to recover true trigger mentions.
 Table 12 shows that our mechanism of imposing discourse consistency further improves the performance by 3.5 units in that our mechanism is more effective to impose the discourse consistency between those pseudo trigger mentions. 6.3. Chinese trigger identification and overall event extraction
Table 13 illustrates the contribution of our compositional semantics and discourse consistency mechanisms on trigger annotators (The human annotator 1 is a first year postgraduate student with no background to Chinese event extraction respectively.

Table 13 also shows that that our compositional semantics mechanism significantly enhances the F1-measure of trigger compositional semantics mechanism in inferring unknown triggers. Further analysis also shows that there are two sources training set. The another is due to wrong POS tagging, resulting in wrongly determining the morphological structure of a trigger.

For fair comparison with the traditional method of expanding triggers using predefined or automatically-clustered syn-tion. It shows that the synset-based expanding method only slightly improves the performance over the baseline and this of a word in complex contexts in that too many pseudo triggers may harm the precision.
The low inter-annotator agreement of two annotators indicates that Chinese event extraction is really challenging even event mentions when a sentence contains more than one event mention. The second reason is that it is hard to identify an 13 also shows the performance gaps of human annotators between trigger identification and event type classification are and determine the role of each argument, all with more than 90% in accuracy, once a trigger is identified correctly. 7. Discussion
In this section, we discuss our two novel mechanisms for inferring triggers and trigger mentions. 7.1. Compositional semantics in inferring unknown triggers
This paper shows that the morphological structures can well represent the compositional semantics in Chinese words and of determining the morphological structures in Chinese triggers can reach 96% (+5%) and the F1-measure of HM identifica-tion can reach 88%. As a consequence, an additional 3.5% of the true unknown triggers will be inferred and 26% of pseudo unknown triggers will be filtered out.

Compared with English, the morphological structures in Chinese are much more complex and diverse, causing a lot of troubles in Chinese language processing. We ensure the importance of the compositional semantics in Chinese words in a wide range of Chinese language processing applications, such as machine translation, semantic parsing, etc. However, how to employ the compositional semantics in Chinese words to Chinese language processing applications still is a chal-a bridge.

Although simple, our mechanism is promising enough for further efforts in this direction. If more fine-grained morpho-be divided into a few fine-grained morphological structures, some of which are shown in Table 14 .If X  X  jail) is a trigger of the Arrest-Jail event, we will infer  X  X  same event according to our current mechanism due to the same HM  X  X 
Object . However, this inference is problematic since  X  X   X   X 
If we can introduce those more fine-grained morphological structures as shown in Table 14 into our mechanism, it will be filtered as pseudo trigger due to its different fine-grained morphological structure from that of  X  X 
Our experimentation shows that HM provides a simple but effective way to infer unknown trigger. In this paper, we only consider those words, which contain one or two morphemes, as unknown triggers, ignoring the words with more than two longer words are constructed (nestedly) by some one-morpheme or two-morpheme words. For example, as a trigger of the phone-write event,  X  X   X   X   X  /Gong-Kai-Xin/ X  (open letter) contains a one-morpheme word  X  X  pheme word  X  X   X   X  /Gong-Kai/ X  (open), with morphological structure Modifier-Head and HM  X  X  it from known trigger  X  X   X   X  /Si-Xin/ X  (private letter) whose morphological structure and HM are as same as  X  X 
Kai-Xin/ X  (open letter). 7.2. Discourse consistency
As a discourse-driven language, ellipsis is very common in Chinese, causing the discourse inference a fundamental mech-anism to understand the meaning of a clause, sentence or discourse. A document always contains many events. Unfortu-nately, how to identify the scope of a discourse is challenging. In this paper, we adopt document as a discourse unit to obvious-different discourses. If the scope of a discourse can be identified exactly, more improvement can be expected. Table 15 categorizes the samples of the inconsistency between trigger mentions. It shows, (1) 35.0% result from the generic event mentions (e.g.,  X  X  (2) 34.2% result from the annotation inconsistency due to the ACE guideline that ambiguous triggers should only be guideline is too difficult for the annotators to conform; (3) 16.0% are caused by POS tagging errors. For example,  X  X  (4) Sense shifting covers 13.6% of the inconsistency. Most of them occur in two discourses in a document.
Manual inspection on those consistent trigger mentions shows that 62.5% belong to the discourse consistency between the pseudo trigger mentions and this figure reduces to 37.5% on the consistency between the true trigger mentions. This comparison further justifies our experimental results in Section 6.2 that more pseudo trigger mentions are filtered out and less true trigger mentions are recovered. 7.3. Training set size on the performance of inferring unknown triggers via compositional semantics positional semantics mechanism (CS). From Fig. 2 , we can find out that our mechanism can extract much more true trigger justifies that our mechanism can be well applied to minimally-supervised event extraction. 8. Conclusion
In this paper we propose two novel inference mechanisms to Chinese trigger identification. In particular, the composi-nese trigger mentions are imposed to recover trigger mentions. We give good reasons why this should be done, and present effective ways how this could be done. The evaluation shows that our proposed inference mechanisms for Chinese event extraction are linguistically justified and pragmatically beneficial to real applications. Compared with our previous work ( Li et al., 2012 ), the contributions of this paper are as follows: compositional semantics inside Chinese words (esp Chinese triggers). Besides, a novel mechanism is proposed to automat-erning sememes in place of three simple inference rules in Li et al. (2012) ;
A Markov Logic Network (MLN)-based inference mechanism, is introduced to impose discourse consistency in palce of the consistency on the trigger mentions with the same head morpheme.

In future work, we will focus on how to introduce the discourse information into the individual components of Chinese event extraction and their joint learning.
