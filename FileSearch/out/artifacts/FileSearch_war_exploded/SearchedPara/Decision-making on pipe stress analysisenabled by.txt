 REGULAR PAPER Mat  X   X as Alvarado  X  Miguel A. Rodr  X   X guez-Toral  X  Armando Rosas  X  Sergio Ayala Abstract This paper presents engineering decision-making on pipe stress analy-sis through the application of knowledge-based systems (KBS). Stress analysis, as part of the design and analysis of process pipe networks, serves to identify whether a given pipe arrangement can cope with weight, thermal, and pressure stress at safe operation levels. An iterative process of design and analysis cycle is done routinely by engineers while analyzing the existing networks or while designing the process pipe networks. In our proposal, the KBS establishes a bidirectional communication with the current engineering software for pipe stress analysis, so that the user benefits from this integration. The stress analysis knowledge base is constructed by registering the senior engineers X  know-how. The engineers X  overall strategy to follow up during the pipe stress analysis, to some extent contained by the KBS, is presented. Advantages in saving engineering man-hours and useful-ness in guiding experts in pipe stress analysis are the major services for the process industry.
 Keywords Decision making  X  Pipe stress analysis  X  Knowledge-based systems 1 Introduction Engineering practice in the oil and gas industry is a combination of complex and specialized areas. Nowadays, the use of engineering software by engineers carry-ing out information input or manipulating decision variables is a daily issue. When an engineering problem requires a specific solution, human engineers manipulate and interpret the input data to a software system and they decide to accept data for implanted solutions. Whenever the engineering software does not come up with an acceptable solution, engineers manipulate variables and parameters to achieve a convenient output that fulfils the mean requirements. The software tools, sim-ulators, largely act like black boxes answering yes or no based on the input data with respect to some goal solution. However, no suggestion is delivered from the simulators about what to do if the input data does not assure a required solution. Actually, the relevant human expert task is dealing with the change of input data, typically during an iterative process of successive approximations to solution, so that new data gets closer to obtaining the required solution. 1.1 Interaction between human expert/engineering software This interaction process, technical expert X  X ngineering software X  X echnical expert, is common in engineering practice. In engineering companies X  X s in diverse pro-ductive organizations X  X t is well known that the human technical skills are finite resources that should be well managed in order to optimize the company work execution. In this paper, we show that the usage of modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques rooted in KBS for specific engineering discipline is a key aspect in boosting productivity. AI soft-computing techniques like genetic algorithms, neural networks, and fuzzy logics do flexible data manipulation and support ro-bust solutions in complex domains like those from engineering fields. Besides, the preservation of the engineering technical knowledge and improvement of the effective usage of preserved knowledge is strategic to promote sustainability of engineering services. Based on the knowledge management embedment in engi-neering practice, reuse of the human experts X  know-how for future works can be done in an effective manner. In this proposal, the effective use of a KBS is with respect to two main objectives:  X  To support a successful transfer of knowledge from senior expert engineering  X  To allow the human expert to use knowledge skills and experience from others pass through a mean steep learning curve. Furthermore, in a broad perspective, KBS can be a powerful and versatile tool for the designer; the KBS allows him or her to reuse the know-how from other organization members, thus preserving design quality and augmenting productivity with the (semi-) automated support from the KBS.
 tion of current KBS is that ES was used to automate the usage of information for low-level expert X  X  decision-making. Interest in old ES is renewed by the current challenge of dealing with complex dynamics in business process re-engineering as well as in concurrent engineering in an automated fashion. Due to the matu-rity of the AI methods, practical aspects relevant to engineering can be addressed jointly by software developers, knowledge engineers, and domain experts through-out KBS deployment.
 1.2 Pipe network: critical lines, flexibility, and supports distribution Opportunities were identified for KBS application in pipe stress analysis (PSA) which is a part of the design process of pipe networks. PSA is used to identify whether a pipe arrangement will cope with weight, thermal, and pressure stress at acceptable levels under engineering design standards for safe operation. An itera-tive process of design and analysis cycle is done on the existing or to-be designed pipe networks. The KBS can support engineers during the steps of process pipe design by suggesting pipe design rules or possible solutions, such that design con-ditions for safe and reliable operation will be accomplished in an effective manner. The more the KBS guides the verification and approval of design proposals, the more the pipe stress analysis expert X  X  time is saved. In addition, KBS can support PSA experts in routine or preliminary tests of pipe network X  X  design reliability. process plant pipe networks in the upstream or downstream petroleum industry. According to our PSA experience, decision-making bears on  X  identification of critical pipelines,  X  top-down ranking of critical pipelines,  X  flexibility of the piping system for relaxing overstressed points,  X  proper and balanced supports distribution.
 tion of design information of the piping system. Such information is provided from the engineering workgroups at previous steps of the pipe system design. Whenever a formal PSA of the pipe design indicates an overstressed point, decision-making over possible solutions imply modifications of the pipe pathway, supports distri-bution or both. If none of these modifications solve the pipe overstress, a redesign coming from the steps of basic engineering would be necessary. The KBS has a bidirectional communication with the PSA software simulator. Through the rest of the paper, the overall strategy followed during the development of the KBS for PSA and the advantages in its application are presented. Beyond saving PSA engi-neering man-hours, KBS increases productivity and becomes useful in the process of training new technical experts. As an antecedent of our aims, we mention that KBS technology has successfully provided intelligent support to humans during the process of database analysis and design [ 36 ]. However, skepticism remained on the capacity to simulate the diagnostic competence of human designers. Ex-pert human designers employ the so-called knowledge of the real world in car-rying their design activities. Last advances in AI on knowledge management and knowledge representation techniques in modern KBS apply on implementing such capacity. Herein this advance is advantaged by linking the capabilities of highly experienced people on pipe stress analysis with those from AI. This has method-ological advantages including project development management, human expert use, and acceptance (most likely, since they are contributors too), and practical as well as realistic user requirements for the KBS. In the next section, a summary of the state-of-the-art KBS in engineering for the process industry as well as the presentation of the AI techniques for decision-making is presented. Throughout the rest of the sections, our pipe stress analysis decision-making perspective is introduced. 2 Engineering decision-making After mid-1970s, interest in ES decreased; they recovered some popularity in the 1990s with the application of techniques like case-based reasoning and constraint-based reasoning. These were mainly associated with business process re-engineering and knowledge-based software engineering. Expert systems, now recognized as KBS, can capture the (senior) expert X  X  know-how on design solu-tions; they involve the construction and usage of the following modules:  X  Knowledge base (KB),  X  Inference engine,  X  User X  X  interface.
 edge about the engineering domain, e.g., chemical, mechanical, civil, and so on X  at the basic or detailed levels of engineering. The inference engine codifies the way the expert engineers do reasoning in such a way that from the set of KB in-formation, new relevant information can be induced, deduced or abducted. The knowledge and reasoning process is the qualitative part dealing with semantic ob-jects that require definition or translation to numerical values. In addition, the KBS should perform some of its inference based upon dynamic changes in knowledge; the execution order of the system should not be defined solely by data, as with many algorithms. The user interface sets the way the input information must be captured for material problem situations. 2.1 KBS for process industry KBS on engineering applications for the process industry herein is reviewed, specifically in relation to piping systems, process plants, and equipment. Applica-tions include the analysis of metallurgical failures in an ES for recognizing modes of failure like stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement [ 31 ]. Later, the devel-opment of an ES designed to assist technical personnel in the evaluation of the physical integrity of process equipment by generating diagnosis and explanatory information was reported in [ 17 ]. In this ES, the knowledge base draws in the three expertise domains required to evaluate the integrity of the equipment: inspection of the equipment, numerical analysis of critical defects, and recommendation of corrective actions. A KBS for material selection in an engineering design process is described in [ 44 ]. It discusses the development of material databases to be used as material selection packages. Examples were shown for the use of a KBS in ma-terial selection in the domain of polymeric-based composite. The importance of KBS in the context of concurrent engineering is also explained. 2.1.1 Computer aided design tools The concept of so-called intelligent computer-aided design (CAD) systems has been identified as an approach toward integrated engineering environments. The experience of designers is the main tool in the process of finding an optimum route of ship pipes, which is a complicated and time-consuming process. To re-duce the amount of design man-hours and human errors, an ES shell and a geo-metric modeling kernel were integrated for design process automation [ 23 ]. They implemented methods of ES to find the routes of ship pipes on the main deck of a bulk carrier. A framework of the intelligent CAD system for pipe auto-routing was suggested. The CADDS 5 of Computervision is used as the overall CAD en-vironment, the Nexpert Object of Neuron Data is used as the ES shell, and the CADDS 5 ISSM is used to build user interface through which geometric models of pipes are created and modified. 2.1.2 Knowledge-based engineering Competitive pressures are forcing equipment manufacturers to reduce product de-velopment times, minimize design iterations, and react rapidly to changing mar-kets. Concurrent engineering replaces the traditional sequential design process with parallel efforts in multiple disciplines, increasing the product quality while reducing the work time. Knowledge-based engineering captures product and pro-cess knowledge contained in the  X  X orporate memory X  to enhance and accelerate the design process. Linking these two together provides a wide variety of syner-gistic effects. A general description of the process used to create a knowledge-based engineering (KBE) for concurrent engineering (CE) is given in [ 27 ]. The use of the system to solve real world design problems in compressor rotor design is discussed.
 tion, where a wide range of specialized knowledge is available as qualitative rules that can be incorporated in an ES. Abou-Ali and Beltagui [ 1 ] present a technique for building a KBS utilizing object-oriented ES shells. The constructed prototype assists the designer in making decisions about fluid allocation, selection of Tubu-lar Exchanger Manufacturers Association (TEMA) shell type, bundle, heads, and various geometrical details. The final aim of developing an ES of this type is to achieve an integrated design procedure, from initial selection to the final thermo-hydraulic and mechanical design.
 work, the structure and development strategy of the ES including, user interface, a database (where nuclear piping material properties are stored and the unknown material properties are provided through inferring the known material proper-ties), a knowledge base (with rules for inferring material properties), expert part (where the most appropriate evaluation method for given input condition is rec-ommended), and finally, an integrity part (where they plan to do the evaluation of piping integrity), is described. 2.1.3 Case-based reasoning for experience recording Case-based reasoning (CBR) employs past problem-solving experiences when solving novel problems. In [ 40 ], CBR has been applied to mechanical bearing design. Their system retrieves previous design cases from a case repository and uses adaptation techniques to modify them for satisfaction of problem require-ments. The approach combines (a) parametric adaptation, to consider parameter substitution and the interrelationships between the problem definition and its so-lution; (b) constraint satisfaction, to globally check the design requirements to assess case adaptability. The system was implemented and tested in the domain of rolling bearings.
 ure is reviewed in [ 20 ]; they emphasized on the reasoning methodologies and the knowledge domains. Case-based reasoning techniques were considered to be the most suitable for generic failure analysis due to the complexity of knowledge re-quired. They concluded that future trends in diagnostic expert systems will be based on the holistic hybrid rule-case-based reasoning approach combined with a number of stand-alone engineering failure-analysis calculating software tools and a multimedia-type KBS for different failure modes. 2.1.4 Knowledge management practice Knowledge management (KM) grants effective methods to organize and reuse information for executing business procedures [ 33 ]. In the process industry, the complex interrelationship between design stress and environment often makes this an overwhelming task, even for engineers with considerable know-how and expe-rience in failure analysis. Usage of information systems as complementary frame-works for the knowledge-based ones, facilitates the analysis task. The stored and subsequently accruing expert X  X  experience is available to be reused for junior en-gineers. Furthermore, organized information can be used for planning, decision-making, and process optimization. As an instance, the building of a KM system in the Mechanical and Industrial Department at DAR AL HANDASAH, a lead-ing consulting firm in the Middle East, as well as lessons learned in building the system and the steps needed to improve it are reported in [ 29 ]. 2.2 Decision-making representation 2.2.1 Artificial intelligence techniques Nowadays, the codification of autonomous agent X  X  knowledge as well as the rea-soning capacities is strongly based in AI techniques like multivalued logics, ge-netic algorithms and neural networks. The autonomous agent system X  X  application in any discipline carries on the usage of AI methods to deal with diverse informa-tion in a flexible manner. In engineering, the expectation is the advancement in the knowledge-based engineering added value by applying tools that are integrated in autonomous computational modules.
 the test of designed solutions. The input data configuring a proposed solution are processed in the simulator for validation if conditions for safe operation are ful-filled. Simulators process huge volumes of data that typically implies hard and complicated calculus, in a precise manner, making it easy X  X o some extend X  X or the human analysis of the solutions.
 solutions, either at the preliminary tests or during the iterative steps looking for a convenient solution. Such guiding system is thought to suggest possible adjust-ment of parameters in order to fit the design of an intended solution. In pipe stress analysis, for instance, the designer has to decide about the pipe flexibility as well as the distribution of balanced pipe supports.
 ment of technical and administrative data is required, such that the data becomes useful information through the analysis of novel solutions for either well-known or novel problems. Furthermore, a step forward in this direction is to be able to codify in computational systems, the experiences of engineers participating in rou-tine operations, but specially, the acquired know-how of engineers providing novel solutions to challenging problems in their expertise area. 2.2.2 Architecture Decisions in engineering are related to an artefact being designed, constructed, operated, or maintained [ 5 ]. Therefore, there should be a link that exposes the de-cisions made, but explicitly with respect to the issues in artefact decision-making. have addressed this relationship and have proposed different solutions. A relevant conclusion is that the relationship between the designed device and the decision-making about such a design must be a part of the representation.

Furthermore, execution of tasks throughout the workflow carries on decision-making processes at different levels of complexity.

Every issue has a number of possible solutions (options), and a de-cision involves the selection of one of these options. A decision is implemented throughout an action that is the embodiment of the transition between states. Thus, decisions/actions are the transitions linking the issues/states.
 considered and the criteria used for their evaluation), also known as decision ra-tionale , could be the most convenient way to record best practices and lessons learned. Decision rationale would be an essential part of knowledge management, the key principle of which is capturing intellectual assets for the tangible benefit of the organization. The suitability of KM based on decision-rationale to improve the competitive edge of engineering is allowed so that the aim of any design engineer-ing organization may produce projects with high quality and make them available in less time. 3 Pipe stress analysis PSA is a complex engineering discipline which covers the design, analysis, and identification of piping problems by ensuring that weight, thermal, and pressure stresses are at acceptable levels specified in engineering design standards. PSA includes the calculation of piping code stresses, loads, and deflections under static and dynamic loading conditions. The stress analysis of pipe networks is normally done using the finite element method (FEM) [ 35 ].
 to ensure that the piping is well supported and does not fall or deflect under its own weight; the deflections are well controlled when thermal and other loads are applied; the loads and moments imposed on machinery and vessels by the ther-mal growth of the attached piping are not excessive; and that the stresses in the pipework in cold and hot conditions are under the range allowed. PSA addresses problems such as thermal analysis (analysis for free and restrained thermal growth conditions); deadweight analysis (analysis at ambient temperature with a system of hangers at specific locations to support the weight of the system, for allow-able stress and reactions at equipment connections); seismic analysis (static or dynamic); wind load analysis (static stress analysis); transient analysis (for vari-ous transient loading conditions such as, turbine trip, pipe whip, safety relief valve trip, etc.). Static analysis in PSA includes the use of hangers, wind load sets, nozzle flexibilities and stresses, equipment load check (under engineering standards, for example, for steam turbines (NEMA SM23), centrifugal compressors (API 617), air-cooled exchangers (API 661), etc.), flange leakage and stresses, fatigue analy-sis and cumulative usage (to calculate the remaining life based on material fatigue curve data and an assigned number of cycles), offshore piping analysis (for ana-lyzing individual pipe elements experiencing loading due to hydrodynamic effects of ocean waves and ocean currents).
 posed vibration, snubbers, and spectrum definitions. Dynamic analysis includes aspects such as mode shape and natural frequency calculations (for reviewing the systems natural modes of vibration), harmonic forces and displacements (to eval-uate the vibration response of a damped system to a range of harmonic forces or displacements to simulate mechanical and acoustic line vibrations), shock spec-trum analysis and independent support motion (including anchor movements), force spectrum analysis (for the analysis of general impact loads such as water and steam hammer, slug flow and relief valve discharge), modal time history anal-ysis, relief valve load synthesis (to calculate the dynamic thrust load and transient pressures from relief valves in open discharge systems).
 erly address the occasional load requirements of the piping codes. 3.1 PSA: from early to current computer applications Early applications of PSA on microcomputers are reported in [ 3 ]. In 1955, the stress concept for evaluating thermal expansion stress was recognized by an in-ternational engineering code, for pressure piping [ 38 ]. Applications of pipe stress analysis include pipelines with soil forces and longitudinal/lateral pipe movement [ 37 ], pipe stress/support analysis to establish extra safety margin [ 26 ], and under-ground pipes in granular or sandy soil using a pipe stress program for the evalua-tion of thermal and pressure effects [ 42 ].
 the AUTO-PIPE CAE System that allows the user to perform the entire sequence of piping analysis and design in a streamlined work flow process. Tasks in this automatic process include pipe stress analysis, pipe support location optimization, stress isometric drawing generation, pipe support pattern selection and member design, 3-D interference detection for support. At the core of the system is the AUTO-PIPE (relational) database which contains all the static (project-specific) and dynamic (model-specific) data required for all of the mentioned tasks. The AUTO-PIPE CAE System has been used for pipe system design of nuclear power plants in Japan to achieve substantial manpower reduction and cost savings. Now, there is a commercial software, AutoPIPE, as a stand-alone computer-aided engi-neering (CAE) program for the calculation of piping stresses, flange analysis, pipe support design, and equipment nozzle loading analysis under static and dynamic loading conditions.
 under internal pressure were analyzed. It acknowledged the nonlinearity and hysteresis of the gasket by using an axisymmetric theory of elasticity and the FEM.
 connections in low-pressure large-diameter piping systems are designed, as re-portedin[ 43 ], the flexibility factors in ASME B31.31 for branch connections do not assist the designer in taking credit for flexibility that may exist in a large di-ameter intersection. The author reports that since the stress intensification factors (SIFs) are relatively high for large-diameter piping, many stub-in branch connec-tions will require a pad to meet the code displacement stress limits. 3.2 Engineering software Pipe stress analysis can be done using analysis software such as AutoPIPE or CAESAR II. The model is constructed from piping general arrangement, piping isometric drawings, and piping and valve specifications. Once the system is mod-eled and the boundary conditions are set, comprehensive stress analysis calcula-tions are done by the engineering software, and modifications to the model can be made to ensure compliance with the design requirements.
 vices on design and analysis of process pipe networks use the CAESAR II engi-neering software, first introduced in 1984 by a company named COADE; today, it is perhaps the most used in the engineering area [ 14 ]. CAESAR II allows the analysis of piping systems subject to weight, pressure, thermal, seismic, and other static and dynamic loads. The code compliance report generated by CAESAR II defines the overstressed points in the system.
 to comply with piping code stress requirements. As a comprehensive program for pipe stress analysis, it includes a full range of the latest international piping codes. It provides static and dynamic analysis of pipe and piping systems, and evaluates fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP); buried piping; wind, wave, and earthquake loading; expansion joints, valves, flanges, and vessel nozzles; pipe components; and nozzle flexibilities. The program automatically models structural steel and buried pipe, and provides spectrum, time history analysis, and automatic spring sizing. CAE-SAR II includes component databases and an extensive material database with allowable stress data. It also includes a bidirectional link to COADE X  X  CADWorx Plant drafting package.

Data values depicted in the help screens are automatically presented in the current set of units to make input easier. 3.2.1 About exchanging data from CAESAR II CAESAR II offers a link to CADWorx/PIPE, COADE X  X  AutoCAD based pipe drafting and design software. This is a fully functional, bidirectional link between CAD and the PSA program. CAESAR II has a neutral data file format for inde-pendent use in exchanging data with other programs such as CadCentres PDMS and Jacobus 3DM. Piping input and output can be directed to an ODBC database, e.g., MS Access R , for data review and manipulation outside CAESAR II. 3.3 Expert systems in pipe stress analysis and design The identification of piping design rules and how these rules can be incorporated into an expert system using a common subset of LISP was reported for an expert system that was then interfaced with a computer-aided design package [ 21 ]. Also, applications in engineering companies like Brown and Root, Inc., U.S.A., reported the opportunity for AI techniques in diagnosing high-energy piping problems [ 41 ], arguing the need of an expert system for efficiently using their company X  X  experi-ence on many high-energy piping systems in fossil power plants, technical papers, procedures, reports and reviews with a large database, including the accumulated experience of senior engineering specialists. The challenge was how to best use this expanding base of valuable knowledge and experience. They saw an oppor-tunity for piping data and expertise to be used more efficiently, comprehensively, and accurately with an expert system.
 knowledge required to analyze the internal structure of flexible pipes named FRAESisreportedin[ 9 ]. There, numerical algorithms, databases, and expert knowledge are explored by the inference mechanism of the system to assist the technical personnel of petroleum companies in the analysis, design, and diagnosis of flexible pipes; these are used as flowlines or risers in offshore applications. alyze safety reserves in buried pipes because of the variation of the phenomena acting on the behavior of the pipe sewers. Their decision support system is used to boost the efficient use of existing resources as it integrates all of the information involved in a decision-making process. They report a semiprobabilistic approach to diagnose urban sewers, which is divided into two parts: one based on a sim-plified probabilistic method (concerns only the mechanical behavior of the pipe); the other part is based on the established rules to integrate the impact of the pipe behavior on its environment. They insist that their method will permit to establish a rational diagnosis of urban sewers.
 pipe networks and pipelines design include a range of complex and specialized knowledge like the one outlined in the next section, thus showing a necessity for the development of a KBS as proposed here. 3.4 Issues and options on piping system design As in many engineering disciplines today, the expert uses computer software for engineering calculations, then he or she may need to decide on the modifications required to apply to the computer model until a satisfactory solution comes up. Technical expert in PSA should know when and how to use specific restraints (or support types) for piping systems and these include the following.

Restraints: A device that prevents, resists, or limits the free thermal movement
Anchors: A restraint that provides substantial rigid strength, ideally allowing nei-
Expansion loops: A purpose designed device that absorbs thermal growth; usu-
Cold pull or cold spring: It is used to pre-load the piping system in cold condition
Spring hangers: They are used to support a piping system that is subjected to

 department (using commercial software too, e.g., Stoners LIQT and Sunrise Sys-tems PIPENET or even by hand, expressing the piping isometric into his own engineering software, e.g., CAESAR II. He or she should know specific topics from engineering codes, as well as effects like single or double acting transla-tional, single or double acting rotational, translational with bilinear stiffness, use of snubbers (shock absorbers), guides and limit stops, bottomed-out springs, tie rod assemblies, gaps and friction, connecting nodes for nodal interdependence and large rotation rod supports.
 placements, forces, and stresses results in the modification of load cases. Some choices are indicated as obliged, but there are others that admit alternative solu-tions, and the criteria to select them is a key judgment by senior engineers. On the other hand, to pipe the support X  X  distribution should be decided on the position of each support, the type of support, the distribution along the process plant, etc. 4 The knowledge-based system The PSA experts X  decision-making concerns with the artefact to be analyzed, which is the design of process plant pipe. The steps to PSA decision-making are the ones mentioned in Sect. 1.2:  X  identification of pipe critical lines,  X  ranking of critical lines according to the level of risk or danger,  X  flexibility of the piping system as for not having overstressed points,  X  proper and balanced supports distribution.
 ing system delivered from the basic engineering (process and design) technicians. PSA engineers do decide whether according to the given specifications, the pipe pathway is reliable or not, as well as if the distribution of pipe supports is well suited, then will that pipe operate safe. Identification of pipe critical lines indi-cates the part of the pipe to put special attention considering the top-down ranking of risk and danger of the pipelines. Whenever PSA of the proposed design derives in pipe overstress, the decision-making compels to modify pipe pathway or sup-ports distribution or both, as the solution that the PSA engineers can introduce to achieve safe operation. 4.1 Device information and experts know-how Technical data about the piping system to make decisions is broadly contained in the PSA simulator jointly with other engineering software tools. PSA sim-ulator uses the design information of the piping system to test if it suits stress enough below the allowed limits. If design data input to simulator fulfils the spec-ified restraints and there are no overstressed points, then the simulators output is OK. Otherwise, reasons for a negative answer are not shown. However, no rec-ommendation is indicated about possible changes to introduce in the proposed pipe design. Actually, this is the current difficulty that PSA engineers deal with. Currently, assessment and interpretation about what to do is being obtained from human experts X  know-how. The more the engineer X  X  experience, the more quickly the required design is found out: junior engineers can spend a lot of man-hours to get the right solution, usually by a trial X  X rror cycle or by asking senior PSA engineers for some guidance.
 decision-making can reside in the KBS. When the PSA software simulator finds overstressed points in the piping system, the human expert feeds the simulator with alternative data. The experts X  recommendations, besides the processed infor-mation to find them, can be coded inside the KBS for PSA. Like the human ex-perts, KBS will support decision-making; thus, it should deal with the assessment and interpretation of information on the design of the piping system to address an enough-flexible pathway as well as a proper distribution of supports as human engineers deal with. As a human supporter, KBS should guide, to some extent, the eventual changes that could be introduced in the pipe design.
 to avoid overstress; then, this new data of design is the next input to simulator in turns. This way, an interacting cycle X  X imulator/KBS/simulator X  X eceives after some iteration, a well-suited pipe design. Symmetrically, the initial data that feeds the simulator can be previously assessed by a KBS so that a KBS/simulator/KBS cycle works as well. Then, KBS offers a possible design of the solution as the input for the simulator, or that the simulator output is the input to be assessed and weighted for the KBS. 4.2 Pipe stress analysis reasoning Based on the concepts of [ 16 ], people involved in the development of KBS for pipe stress analysis are (a) senior experts with engineering experience, (b) knowledge engineers, and (c) the end users. In all the cases, more than one person would participate, since the complexity and magnitude of each PSA matter is wide and complex enough (see Fig. 2 ). The knowledge acquisition tool (KAT) is for KB construction, and the KAT shell serves the purpose of constructed knowledge base [ 46 ].
 support to KBS inference engine. Because of fuzzy sets, the parameters used to model or simulate an engineering situation can have an ad hoc range of values. Fuzzy logic furnishes the parameter X  X  combination in such a way that a global assessment of the engineering problem is available. There, a sample of rules that human expert uses for decision-making in designing pipe networks is presented. They are being implemented in the knowledge base and grouped in the steps men-tioned in this section. 4.2.1 Critical lines In the very first step are identified the parts of the pipe that, due to the flow con-ditions, material, and size of the pipe as well as the type of connected devices, is especially dangerous and needs extra care. Flow conditions refer to temperature, pressure, type, toxicity, density, regime, among others. Pipe size involves diam-eter and length. Connected equipments to the pipe are furnaces, bombs, thermal changers, turbines, and compresors, among others. Some example rules for this step decisions are presented in Table 1 . 4.2.2 Top-down ranking of critical lines The second step is the creation of a top-down scoring of lines X  criticalness level due to the characteristics of the flow each line transports as well as the pipe di-ameter or the equipment that is being connected. Most combinations making pipe critical lines involve high flow temperature, medium or big pipe diameter as well as more fine equipment being connected. The more the level of each flow tem-perature, pipe diameter size or equipment fineness, the more the level of line crit-icalness. By the process of Cartesian coordinates, Fig. 3 illustrates that point A corresponds to a more critical line than the one represented by point B because A contains flow with a higher temperature, has a bigger diameter, and connects more fine equipment than does B. Also with equal temperature, point D sets a more critical line than does E because D X  X  diameter is bigger.
 and then constructed. This way, the pipe pathway space needed to locate critical lines or the facilities construction required to keep them together with all compul-sory conditions can be allowed without restrictions. As much as most critical lines are designed or constructed, the lines of next minor level of criticalness should be designed; the design of less critical lines can be adapted to the left conditions after the design and construction of the most critical ones. Experiences doing the de-sign and some times the construction X  X egardless of this order X  X dvice that hard difficulties in constructing extreme critical lines may occur. 4.2.3 Pathway modification Modifications about pathway aim to benefit pipe flexibility by introducing pipe architectural elements like the following among others:  X  expansion joints,  X  expansion loops,  X  thermal changers.
 increment of flow pressure or force, thus increasing pipe stress. In this case, it is suggested to modify the long section architecture by introducing an expansion loop or omega (for the letter shape). The loop diminishes the flow inertia and re-duces the pressure or temperature. An alternative is the introduction in the middle of the pipe long section of an expansion joint made of a more flexible material with shape of folds or biome that augments the pipe flexibility. Actually, both of the mentioned resources augment the pipe flexibility in order to cope with the stress flow induced by pressure or temperature. Also it guarantees a safe pipe op-eration in front of the flow turbulence or the so-called flow ram touch. gas, or even solid. Connection to a specific equipment to modify other flow regime is required. In these cases, it is a condition to attend vendor X  X  specifications about the devices to guarantee a right usage. Other aspect to be attended is the corrosion that pipe is exposed to. Special materials covering the pipe X  X  inner surface should be considered such that enough pipe resilience is assured. 4.2.4 Supports modifications Balance and equilibrium on pipe X  X  weight and stress also concerns the supports pipes keep. Right distribution of supports as well as the adequate support at the required place contribute to a safer pipe operation. Actions that PSA engineers can take with regard to pipe supports in order to achieve safe operation as follows:  X  add supports,  X  change supports separation or distribution,  X  change the type of support.
 By adding supports or changing the separation between them, a well-suited weight distribution can be obtained. On the other hand, when the pipe height is a variable, Pipe section X  X  height varies due to pipe expansion or distension from variable temperature from the inside flow or environment. This is a typical situation of weather conditions, like the ones of desert, where severe changes occur from day to night; variation in temperature is high during a 24-h cycle such that special supports adaptable to different conditions are needed.
 formed in an atmospheric distillation column, whose separated vapour goes to a condenser through a piping system as the one shown in Fig. 4 . The piping sys-tem consists of one feed and one discharge connection pipe segments, one rigid Y support, three shoe supports, and four long-radius elbows. The upper end is con-nected to the top of the distillation column while the piping system X  X  lower end is connected to the overhead condenser. The resultant pipe stress analysis done with CAESAR II determined that forces in the piping system exceed the limit specified in the ASME B31.3 code for process piping. The pipe system does not have suffi-cient flexibility to accommodate the elongation of the atmospheric tower resulting from the temperature variations.
 mit upward movement caused by the elongation of the tower; then, CAESAR II resulted in no warning or error messages for exceeding code limits. An alternative solution was the introduction of an expansion joint, it was an expensive solution X  therefore not practiced X  X ue to the pipe diameter. Nor was an expansion loop in-troduced, because it would be necessary as an additional support to a great height, which is expensive too. 4.3 Major redesign Whenever none of the PSA proposals solves the pipe overstress, a redesign must be practiced by the process and/or design engineers. It passes on major modifica-tions of the pipe pathway concerning such steps of the pipe deployment. 4.4 Intelligent Chat KBS/PSA As introduced in Sect. 2.2, the integration of technical information about the designing issues, in this case, the process workflow and the experts X  know-how, harmonize the holistic solutions that benefits decision-making for our pur-poses. As mentioned in Sect. 4.1, the technical information on device under consideration is modeled in the software engineering PSA simulator. On the other hand, the expert engineers X  information is partially included in the KBS as long as it captures the human expert X  X  know-how. Rules to identify criti-cal lines as well as for the top-down scoring fashion or the ones about the pipe pathway modifications and support distribution codify the PSA engineers X  know-how.
 chitecture is arranged. The managed knowledge about pipe stress analysis is cou-pled with the pipe network being designed. The KBS becomes a smart mediator between the simulators modeling and the PSA engineer experiences adjusting the model (see Fig. 5 ). KBS can suggest alternatives in order to achieve an adequate piping system design under the advanced stress analysis. 4.5 Advantages In addition to human expert X  X  time being saved and used for finer deci-sions, the advantage of KBS application is to be able to code specialized know-how such that the knowledge base turns out to be a significant exper-tise from senior experts. There are significant advantages in its application in terms of saving engineering man-hours, increasing productivity, and being useful in training new technical experts. Furthermore, the medium extent of KBS deployment should deal with high-level decision-making of keen expert X  X  know-how.
 is a key aspect in augmenting productivity, preserving, and incrementing orga-nization technical knowledge and being strategic in promoting sustainability of engineering services organizations.
 5 Ongoing technologies for decision-making 5.1 Ontologies and business process languages Nowadays, a competent method to represent information useful to model, design and then implement computational systems is the ontologies. Ontologies provide the elements to precisely define the entities and relationships among entities in certain domain. Ontologies set the methodology and basic elements to construct a representation language in such a domain. By using ontologies, decision tools of a language devoted to make clear communication among a community of users can be constructed [ 32 ]. The incorporation of ontology engineering tasks is a must in knowledge-empowered organizations [ 25 ], as is the case in engineering companies related to the energy sector.
 mains and facts that characterize the system, whereas the service ontologies depict the abilities each computing module (agent) provides. There are interaction on-tologies specifying the protocol attending declarative or actionable message inter-change as well as the shared understanding of information contents. The interop-erability ontologies specify the layers making communications and coordination (collaboration or cooperation) among heterogeneous applications.
 the usage of ontologies. The ontologies-based representation allows a smart design of complex information system, as illustrated in [ 18 ]. This ontological description sets easier process integration from structural, functional, or teleological perspec-tive. For our purpose, the PSA ontology embraces description of the plant of pro-cesses entities like temperature, diameter size, and connected equipment. Com-plementarily, the ontological description of physical and chemical cause X  X ffect relationships among the mentioned entities describe the functional and teleolog-ical facts regarding pipe stress analysis. Some KBS rules are the computational programming of these physical/chemical relations. There are teleological relations pertaining to the experts X  know-how that are not being programmed yet, and could be considered in further ontological descriptions.
 modeling language [ 10 ] that extends the workflow language. The workflow lan-guage models the automation of the whole and a part of business process: accord-ing to procedural rules, tasks information is passed between participants for ac-tion. In actionable perspective, the sequence/parallel distribution of subprocesses and tasks are fine modeled such that business process modeling allocates a quick management of the dynamic and teleological relationships during engineering pro-cesses, complementary to the ontological description of related entities. Further-more, BPML places manage technical information about the process, on partic-ipant X  X  profile data, as well as on the workflow process documents, namely in-put/output information, used/provided for/from the parts of process PSA analysis herein. BMPL family extends deployment facilities, e.g., the business process ex-ecution language for Web services (BPEL4WS). BPEL4WS, 2006, specification is a recent option enabling Web services standard for composition such that it al-lows creating complex processes by wiring together activities including data ma-nipulation, correlation, fault handling, compensation, and begin/end of structured activities alongside processes. 5.2 Autonomous agents and rationale The autonomous agent systems technology enables social interaction so as to manage input/output data through sequential or parallel steps, without a whole centralized control. Autonomy on computing, meaning the capacity of a system X  X  module to self-manage the processing and answer (output) attending environment requirements (input), is a distinctive characteristic of agents as components of the new generation of distributed systems. Autonomy entails agent X  X  processing of incoming messages or effects from external actions, such that own-managing on time and conditions of reply is practiced. The autonomous task executions to agent X  X  goals-achieving are coordinated on the base of individual or shared agent X  X  plan actions. In addition to autonomy, the abilities defining an autonomous agent (AA) are pro-activity so that agents plan and act to reach their own no-external-demanded goals; knowledge-reasoning process: information an agent has about own and the system X  X  states that are processed through internal inference mecha-nisms (agents mental structure). The Workflow Automation Agent-Based Reflec-tive Process (WARP) approach proposes a methodology and frame to implement complex process attending the structural, dynamic and functional facets [ 8 ]. Mul-tiagent systems supported on Web services cross through the whole activities and actors through the organized workflow. Actually, business process specification gets an effective autonomous-agents-based decision-making deployment [ 33 ]. generation based on the use of ontologies that organize and do context mak-ing meaningful information [ 34 ]. Recording the know-how and the best lessons learned is fundamental in order to be able to reuse previous information and ex-periences in decision-making. Questions to attend, on one hand, involved what to record from the partial results; on the other hand, how to ensure that the resulting records are not only easily retrievable and in a format that allows its reconstruc-tion by future users, but also amenable to be processed by a computer in order to achieve a degree of automation in an effective fashion [ 2 ]. 6 Conclusions Engineering decision-making mediated by KBS for pipe stress analysis is an op-portunity to contribute to the effectiveness, the increase in productivity, the en-hancement of technical knowledge, but as a major strategy to promote sustain-ability of engineering services organizations. This area of engineering has been focussing on AI techniques since the late 1980s with variable interest, but we be-lieve the current advances both in the engineering discipline (including knowledge and commercial software) and in AI, methods are in a strategic position as to be combined to enhance the productivity in engineering practice.
