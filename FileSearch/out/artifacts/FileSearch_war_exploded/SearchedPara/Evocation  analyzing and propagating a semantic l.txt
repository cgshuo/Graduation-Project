 Xiaojuan Ma Abstract Studies of lexical X  X emantic relations aim to understand the mechanism of semantic memory and the organization of the mental lexicon. However, standard paradigmatic relations such as  X  X  X ypernym X  X  and  X  X  X yponym X  X  cannot capture con-nections among concepts from different parts of speech. WordNet, which organizes synsets (i.e., synonym sets) using these lexical X  X emantic relations, is rather sparse in its connectivity. According to WordNet statistics, the average number of outgoing/ incoming arcs for the hypernym/hyponym relation per synset is 1.33. Evocation, defined as how much a concept (expressed by one or more words) brings to mind another, is proposed as a new directed and weighted measure for the semantic relatedness among concepts. Commonly applied semantic relations and relatedness measures do not seem to be fully compatible with data that reflect evocations among concepts. They are compatible but evocation captures MORE. This work aims to provide a reliable and extendable dataset of concepts evoked by, and evoking, other concepts to enrich WordNet, the existing semantic network. We propose the use of disambiguated free word association data (first responses to verbal stimuli) to infer and collect evocation ratings. WordNet aims to represent the organization of mental lexicon, and free word association which has been used by psycholinguists to explore semantic organization can contribute to the understanding. This work was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, it was confirmed that existing free word association norms can be converted into evocation data computationally. In the second phase, a two-stage association-annotation procedure of collecting evocation data from human judgment was compared to the state-of-the-art method, showing that introducing free association can greatly improve the quality of the evocation data generated. Evocation can be incorporated into WordNet as directed links with scales, and benefits various natural language processing applications.
 Keywords Evocation Free association WordNet relations 1 Introduction Evocation (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ; Nikolova et al. 2011 ), is proposed as a measure of  X  X  X ow much one concept evokes or brings to mind the other. X  X  This definition has been widely used in psychology, such as (Grice 1968 ; Buss 1987 ; Larsen and Buss 2002 ). In contrast to previously proposed semantic relations like hyper-/hyponymy and antonymy, evocation is a quantitative measure of the association between directed sense pairs based on human judgment. There are various paths to evocation between two concepts, e.g., example, category, manner, setting, and likeness (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ). Given that evocation is based on people X  X  subjective opinions, it is not a strictly defined relation, but rather an indication of natural, salient associations among concepts. Measuring evocation among concepts and encoding the results in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998 ), an online lexical network, can enrich this database with cross-part of speech relations. The evocation-enhanced WordNet will serve as a more powerful tool for natural language processing applications requiring word sense disambiguation.

The state-of-the-art method to collect evocation data (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 )is not efficient as most of the synset pairs presented to the human raters have weak or even no semantic connection. Therefore, we are exploring new methods to effectively expand the evocation dataset. Free word association (Moss and Older 1996 ; Church and Hanks 1991 ) is a common method that examines which words are connected in people X  X  minds. The simple procedure asks participants to respond with the first word that comes to mind after presentation of a stimulus word. For example, one study reports that 98 % of participants responded  X  X  X octor X  X  to the stimulus word  X  X  X urse X  X  (Nelson et al. 1998 ). Word association norms collected from different speaker populations show fairly consistent and robust results, providing word pairs with a strong semantic connection. However, a major flaw of these norms is that both stimuli and responses are words that may have several distinct senses; the norms do not specify which sense the experimenters and the participants had in mind when providing the stimuli and the responses, respectively. One might argue that the responses point to one interpretation of the stimulus. For example, when  X  X  X octor X  X  evokes the response word  X  X  X urse, X  X  it is likely to be interpreted as the medical doctor rather than a Ph.D. Another example, people must have a different meaning of  X  X  X rother X  X  in mind when they respond  X  X  X onk X  X  as opposed to  X  X  X ister. X  X  Therefore, it is possible to induce evocation by eliminating the potential lexical ambiguity and turn connections among single words into associations among sets of synonyms that all refer to the same concept.

This paper analyzes the differences between evocation and common semantic relations (e.g., hyponym) as well as conventional semantic relatedness measures. Although co-occurrence indicates word association (Miller 1969 ; Spence and Owens 1990 ), the lack of clear correlation between evocation strength and the WordNet-or corpus-based relatedness scores (see Sect. 2.2 ) suggests that pairs of concepts with strong evocation cannot be fully inferred from WordNet or corpus-based distributional measures, since many of the instant evocations (e.g., beer ? glass) which are based on human perception and experiences are not reflected in common language usage. In other words, frequent co-occurrence, such as (Kilgarriff et al. 2004 ), may imply strong association, but the reverse may not necessarily be true. In addition, the direction of the association which is a key feature of evocation may not be extracted from co-occurrence. For example,  X  X  X eer X  X  strongly evokes  X  X  X lass, X  X  but few people probably think of  X  X  X eer X  X  when being prompted the word  X  X  X lass, X  X  meaning that  X  X  X lass ? beer X  X  has very low evocation rating. It is hard to differentiate which concept evokes which other concept(s) based on pure co-occurrence count. Instead, considering the similarity between evocation and free word association, we propose the use of disambiguated free-associated word pairs to derive evocation ratings, both via computational method and via human annotation. Our ultimate goal is to augment and enhance a semantic network with an efficiently and effectively built evocation dataset that reflects how people associate concepts in their minds. The evocation data 1 can be added to the WordNet database by simply adding new incoming/outgoing arcs called evocation, and made freely available. The link in Footnote 1 demonstrates this new type of links. 2 Evocation Semantic memory is where concept-based knowledge is stored. Knowledge shared among speakers includes the fact that a whale is an animal but not a metal. So the concept  X  X  X hale X  X  is associated with  X  X  X nimal X  X  but not (or less so) with  X  X  X etal. X  X  Our goal is to elicit associations among related concepts. Such associations may vary in their strengths. Prototype Theory, which holds that some category members are more prototypical than others (Rosch 1978 ) demonstrates one such weighted association: when people are asked to name an  X  X  X nimal, X  X   X  X  X og X  X  and  X  X  X ird X  X  have a higher chance to be mentioned than  X  X  X hale. X  X  The existence of the weighted relations among concepts is presented in the semantic network model (Collins and Quillian 1969 ). Associations among specific word pairs are also directed: the most infrequent (23 vs. 2 %, Moss and Older 1996 ). Systematic investigation of these semantic associations can enhance our knowledge of the organization of semantic memory, and assist natural language processing tasks that require word sense disambiguation. 2.1 Evocation as a semantic link Standard, paradigmatic semantic relations included in WordNet such as hypernym, hyponym, meronym, connect concepts from the same part of speech only. Relations across parts of speech which imply other important concept associations are largely missing in WordNet 2 (Fellbaum and Miller 2003 ).

Evocation (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ) measures how strongly one concept brings to mind another. Evocation differs from standard semantic relations as found in WordNet in three ways.  X  Evocation links concepts expressing entities, events, actions, and attributes,  X  Evocation is directed (as described earlier), and could be asymmetric between  X  Evocation is quantitative, giving a weighted score between a concept pair. One
No comprehensive dataset of evocation ratings is available, but prior research has carried out an approach to collect such data via human annotators. A set of candidate synset pairs was presented to human judges, who were asked to rate how strongly a given concept evokes another on a scale from 0 to 100. This scale was devised by Osherson (co-author of Boyd-Graber paper), a very famous psychologist. Judges were encouraged to make use of the full scale. Boyd-Graber et al. ( 2006 ) collected evocation ratings from trained undergraduates for 1,000 pairs of the most synsets selected on the basis of word frequency in the British National Corpus (BNC 2008 ) and salience (refer to the  X  X  CoreWordNet  X  X  3 ; the 1,000 pairs are a subset of this). It was verified that the evocation ratings were usually consistent across different judges. This evocation dataset was extended by (Nikolova et al. 2011 ). They first created a set of approximately 100,000 synset pairs which were predicted to have a high evocation rating by an AdaBoost classifier trained over the Boyd-Graber dataset. Then, Nikolova et al. recruited human raters via Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk (MTurk 2009 ) to generate evocation ratings for this 100,000 dataset. MTurk is a widely-used research tool to obtain large-scale human data online in fields such as psychology, Human X  X omputer Interaction, and Computer Vision. Although the process of data collection on MTurk was not as controlled as lab experiments, researchers have applied different mechanisms to ensure the quality of the results (Ipeirotis et al. 2010 ).

Comparison of the evocation results and other measures of semantic relatedness shows that evocation captures information that eludes prior measures (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ). The next two subsections compare the existing collection of evocation data 4 to conventional WordNet semantic relations and various relatedness measurements. 2.2 Evocation versus WordNet path length and existing semantic relatedness Among the 2,700 (out of 100,000) directed pairs of synsets that show strong evocation and received a score of 100 from all human judges assigned in (Nikolova et al. 2011 ), only 38 % were related in WordNet by a path length of ten or less. There was no significant difference (Fig. 1 ) between the average WordNet path length (about five steps apart) and between the immediately evoked synset pairs and the pairs which were only remotely related or not related at all (i.e., with a human rating of 30 out of 100 and lower). That is to say, strong evocation does not mean a shorter path, indicating that current WordNet relations cannot sufficiently capture the cross-part of speech pathways.

Prior experiments have compared the performance on Word Sense Disambig-uation between evocation and the common semantic relatedness measures [(Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ) on the 1,000 and on the 100,000 evocation dataset (Ma et al. 2010 )]. Both revealed low overlap among the synsets correctly identified by evocation and by the other measures.

Figure 2 shows the corresponding semantic relatedness scores (normalized between 0 and 1) of synset pairs at three evocation levels (immediate/very strong X  human rating of 100, strong X  X uman rating between 75 and 99, and moderate X  human rating between 38 and 74) under various measures:  X  X (shortest) path, X  X   X  X  X up X  X  (Wu and Palmer 1994 ), and  X  X  X ch X  X  (Leacock and Chodorow 1998 ) which are WordNet structure-based;  X  X  X esk X  X  (Banerjee and Pedersen 2002 ),  X  X  X ector X  X  and  X  X  X ector_pairs X  X  (Patwardhan and Pedersen 2006 ) which are WordNet definition-based;  X  X  X es X  X  (Resnik 1995 ),  X  X  X in X  X  (Lin 1997 ), and  X  X  X cn X  X  (Jiang and Conrath 1997 ) which are corpus-based. Although all of the relatedness measures produced significantly higher score given strong evocation synset pairs than moderate evocation pairs, results suggest that none successfully captured the most strongly evoked concept pairs. In addition, these measures generally fail to infer any direction information that is critical to evocation as they generated the same score regardless of which pair member was presented first to the judges. 3 Using free word association data to measure evocation The analysis in Sect. 2.2 suggests that evocation is a useful semantic association indicator and the ratings, though they partially overlap with previous measures of semantic relatedness, capture additional information. Hence, evocation cannot be trivially computed or derived from data in WordNet or from corpora.

However, the state-of-the-art human annotation method is not efficient, as most of the synset pairs rated thus far are not related in any way [about 67 % of the ratings were 0 in (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ), and 47 % in (Nikolova et al. 2011 )]. Clearly, not all word pairs in a language can be meaningfully related, as this would make communication difficult, if not impossible. Hence, one of the key problems is how to construct a list of concept pairs with potentially non-zero evocation ratings for experimentation with human judges, as random pairings of concepts is not a good strategy. The boosting algorithm suggested by Nikolova et al. ( 2011 ) relied on the WordNet structure and corpus-based co-occurrence. Since there is no significant correlation between WordNet path length/number of co-occurrence and evocation strength, the boosting algorithm fails to predict most of the immediate evocation relation.

To construct a dataset of word pairs that are likely to produce good evocation ratings we consider free word association data. 3.1 Word association Psychologists have long been interested in human semantic memory. Word Association experiments are arguably a window into the way people store and retrieve words and concepts. Given a stimulus word, participants are asked to respond with the first word that comes to their mind. (When the response is not constrained to a part of speech, for example, this is called free word association , and the data we discuss in this paper are all based on free associations.) Compiling large amounts of such data allows one to compute norms, e.g., (Moss and Older 1996 ), which reveal surprising uniformity across age, gender, race, culture, nationalities, and language background. Although both the stimulus words and the response words are polysemous, free word association norms give some insight as to which words are commonly associated.
 Analyses of the stimulus X  X esponse word revealed different kinds of relatedness. Some pairs are linked in terms of paradigmatic relations such as the part-whole relation. Thus, given  X  X  X oe, X  X  a third of the first responses are  X  X  X oot. X  X  Such pairs are also related in WordNet, which connects words mostly in terms of paradigmatic relations. Other responses seem to arise from contextual closeness:  X  X  X oe X  X  also generates words like  X  X  X hoe (5 %), X  X  and  X  X  X ig (2 %). X  X  Prior research has examined the link between free word association and some common semantic relatedness measures, e.g., co-occurrence (Schulte im Walde and Melinger 2008 ), but there is little work showing the similarity and distinction between free word association and evocation. 3.2 Comparing free word association and evocation Free word association and evocation are clearly related based on their definitions: a stimulus X  X esponse pair with a strong association should also be rated high for evocation. Moreover, given a stimulus word, the percentage of subjects coming up with a given response word indicates the strength of evocation between each pair. For example, the 79.9 % response rate for  X  X  X oney X  X  versus 3.5 % for  X  X  X obber X  X  given the word  X  X  X ank, X  X  implies that the evocation of  X  X  X ank ? money X  X  is stronger than that of  X  X  X ank ? robber. X  X  In addition, free word association can be directed as well. For example, 79.9 % of respondents generated  X  X  X oney X  X  given  X  X  X ank X  X  but only 1.9 % of people thought of  X  X  X ank X  X  when presented with  X  X  X oney. X  X 
However, there are several obvious differences between free word association and evocation. In free association, the stimulus word provided by the investigator and the response word generated by the subject are both ambiguous. For example, there is no clue whether the word  X  X  X ooler X  X  given in a free association task as a response to  X  X  X alifornia X  X  refers to  X  X (n.) a refrigerator for cooling liquids X  X  or  X  X (adj.) neither warm nor very cold. X  X  By contrast, evocation is assessed between the specific senses of two words, and we presented WordNet synsets in the studies to avoid ambiguity.

Moreover, free word association is not purely based on semantics. There are at least two other connections that people use to link words together: phonetic similarity (same/similar sound, rhyme, etc.) and personal association (Shapiro and Palermo 1968 ;Do  X  llein 1976 ). For instance, the  X  X  X un X  X  ?  X  X  X on X  X  association can be attributed most likely to that fact that these words are homophones. An example for relating words based on personal experience is  X  X  X lbow X  X  and  X  X  X ite X  X  (the person X  X  elbow probably got bitten by a dog once). When Boyd-Graber et al. collect evocation ratings, they instructed the annotators explicitly to disregard such idiosyncratic associations. 4 Converting free word association norms into an evocation database In this section, we introduce a novel methodology to generate pairs of sense-specific words and the strength of their associations from an existing free word association norm dataset. The basic approach was to assign the appropriate senses to the stimulus X  X esponse word pairs in the association norms. The assignments were first generated by a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm and then manually checked. A preliminary analysis was conducted on the free association-based evocation data, showing that its correspondence to the conventional semantic relations is consistent with the human annotation-based evocation data. 4.1 Selection of free-associated word pairs The Free Word Association Norm comes from the dataset compiled at the University of South Florida (Nelson et al. 1998 ). The authors collected nearly three-quarters of a million responses to 5,019 stimulus words from over 6,000 participants, i.e., over 700,000 stimulus X  X esponse pairs. The forward strength, which is calculated by the proportion of subjects in the group who produce a particular target in the presence of the cue word, is available for each stimulus X  response pair. The forward strength can be coarsely mapped to four evocation levels (remote, moderate, strong, and immediate).

To extract the pairs that are more commonly used in everyday communication, the stimulus words were intersected with the word forms from a list of 5,000 most frequent and salient synsets compiled by Christiane Fellbaum (a linguist) and Dan Osherson (a psychologist) at Princeton University (p.c.) The overlap yielded 3,043 stimulus words together with their associative responses. 4.2 Step 1: Response word clustering In order to run a Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm, a context must be given for each word to determine the specific sense of a polysemic word. Since there is no sufficient information for identifying the senses only given the two words in the pair, we propose the following way to construct richer context information of each word (either a stimulus or a response) in the USF norm.

Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 2006 ) is a program for Large Network Analysis. It transformed the USF association norm into directed network graphs (Fig. 3 left). After removing the stimulus word and the edges going in or out of it, the Pajek graph becomes separate sets of interconnected response words. Each of the separated response set can be used together with the stimulus word as a context in the WSD algorithm. For example, in Fig. 3 (right), five contexts are created, all containing different senses of the word light: {light, electricity, watt, bulb, lamp}, {light, heavy, dim, dark, shadow}, {light, laser, beam}, {light, darkness}, and {light, switch}. (The actual Pajek graph is much more complicated than the one in the figure.) 4.3 Step 2: Word pair sense disambiguation The WSD algorithm applied to identify the senses of the words in the selected USF free association pairs was adopted from the unsupervised measure-combined voting algorithm for label sense disambiguation presented in (Ma et al. 2010 ). This algorithm combines the prediction from assorted semantic relatedness measures (listed in Fig. 2 ) according to the majority rule and achieves significantly better disambiguation accuracy than using each of the measures alone. WordNet was used as the sense inventory to derive the meanings. For each stimulus word, each of the contexts generated in Step 1 became the input of the voting WSD algorithm. Ten semantic relatedness measures (Nikolova X  X  evocation dataset plus the nine measures mentioned in Sect. 2.2 ) predicted the possible sense of each word in the context individually. The candidate sense with the most votes from the 10 measures was assigned to the corresponding word.

This automatic voting WSD algorithm cannot achieve 100 % accuracy. Human judgment on sense assignments is necessary to ensure the quality of the evocation data. In the actual context division, many response words that may belong to different contexts got grouped together, because they are associated through other senses. For example, {light, lunch, noon, sun} was one of the contexts generated for the stimulus  X  X  X ight. X  X  However, {light ? lunch} and {light ? sun} may better be processed separately, since  X  X  X ight X  X  in the former is likely to refer to  X  X (adj.) not rich or heavily seasoned, X  X  while  X  X  X ight X  X  in the latter possibly means  X  X (n.) electromag-netic radiation that can produce a visual sensation. X  X  Such context mis-grouping lowered the accuracy of the WSD algorithm.

A web interface (Fig. 4 ) was developed to facilitate the manual verification process. The interface contains a script that looks up given stimulus-to-response pair in the Google search engine. Researchers in our team determined the sense assigned to each of the concept in the pair based on the search results which reflected the contexts where the two words commonly appear together. For example, as shown in Fig. 4 ,  X  X  X nitial X  X  and  X  X  X ing X  X  often occur in the context of engraving someone X  X  initial/name in piece of jewelry. Therefore, the judge accepted the sense  X  X  X he first letter of a word X  X  for  X  X  X nitial X  X  and corrected the meaning of  X  X  X ing X  X  to be  X  X  X ewelry consisting of a circlet of precious metal. X  X 
In summary, a total of 12,550 words from the USF free association norm were disambiguated. Based on manual verification results, the accuracy rate of the automatic WSD algorithm was 55.95 %. The performance of the algorithm is poor, partially because of the noise in the original association data. There are 1,227 pairs of words that likely came from a compound word, e.g., the association pair  X  X  X ar ? ring X  X  results probably from the word  X  X  X arring. X  X  Other pairs were based on pronunciation or other non-semantic associations. In addition, some word pairs involved proper names, and for some pairs the senses could not be determined at all. A total of 967 word pairs fell into this category. 4.4 Step 3: Evocation strength assignment Overall, 71,190 synset pairs with forward strength were generated from the USF free association norm, of which 1,657 (2.33 %) pairs have both members belong to the same synset, and the rest consist of members with different senses.

Although forward strength (ranging from 0 to 100 %) implies the percentage of participants agreeing on the strongest association between two synsets, it is not equivalent to the evocation rating (0 X 100). Since in a free association study, participants responded based on their interpretation of the stimulus word, the forward strength of a synset pair (S x,Wa ,S y,Wb ) is affected by the probability of the stimulus word W a being interpreted as the sense S x,Wa . For example, presented with the stimulus word  X  X  X id, X  X  over 50 % of participants took the  X  X  X  young person of either sex X  X  as the default meaning and came up with responses such as  X  X  X oy, X  X   X  X  X dult, X  X   X  X  X lay, X  X  and  X  X  X oung; X  X  whereas only 7.4 % people considered the meaning of  X  X  X oung goat X  X  and generated  X  X  X oat X  X  accordingly.

Since the forward strength can be influenced by the frequency of each sense of the stimulus word, the numeric scores of forward strength cannot be directly used as the evocation rating. Instead, it is used to approximately divide the synset pairs in categorical evocation bins. Figure 5 shows the distribution histogram of the forward strength provided by the USF free association norm across all semantically associated synset pairs. The mean of the forward strength is 0.0573 (on average 5.73 % subjects produced the same response word), and the standard deviation is 0.0937. This is determined by the nature of the Free Word Association data. Usually, for a given stimulus word, only one or two response words are agreed upon by the majority of participants X  X hat is, with strong forward strength/evocation. Over 70 % of the response words were only mentioned by 5 % of respondents. For a rough estimation of the scale of evocation between two synsets consider the following: if over 25 % of the subjects (more than two standard deviation above the average) generated the response concept, the evocation of the synset pair is immediate/very strong; the evocation is strong if 15 X 25 % (between one and two standard deviation away) of the participants produced the same response; between 5 and 15 % agreement (one standard deviation away) indicates that the evocation is moderate, if below 5 % of agreement (below average), the evocation is remote. Based on this scale, among the 71,190 synsets, 86.58 % are moderately related, 7.49 % are strongly related, and 5.93 % are most strongly related via evocation.
Although the exact value of a free association forward strength depends on the particular data-gathering experiment, the general trend is rather consistent across studies. Therefore, the weight of evocations links in WordNet should be in the format of a scale (very strong, strong, moderate, weak) instead of a specific number. 4.5 Results Figure 6 , plotted using the TreePlus software (Lee et al. 2006 ), shows part of the evocation network (see Footnote 1) derived from the USF free association norm. Unlike free association, evocation connects specific senses of two words. Different from the many existing semantic relations such as hyponymy and meronymy (Lyons 1977 ; Cruse 1986 ), evocation is across parts of speech, e.g.,  X  X  X ight (adj.) ? feather (n.). X  X  Through evocation, concepts can be interconnected with weighted arcs (not showed in the figure). The resultant network can be used to augment and enhance the connectivity of WordNet.

An analysis compared the newly collected data to Nikolova et al. X  X  ( 2011 ) evocation set on evocative concept pairs that are only 1 X 2 steps apart in WordNet. Results indicated strong correlations: the correlation on the number of synset pairs from each evocation set under each standard relation is 0.82, and the correlation on the average evocation rating under each relation (Fig. 7 ) is 0.40. However, since the evocation synset pairs generated from the free association norms had little overlap with Nikolova et al. X  X  ( 2011 ) dataset, direct comparison of the accuracy of the evocation strength could not be carried out. To further evaluate the effect of the use of free association in generating evocation relations, we experimented with a second approach. 5 Propagating evocation via human judgment on free association pairs The Nikolova et al. X  X  evocation dataset was created by collecting human judgment via Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk (MTurk). As a comparison, we proposed a way to use MTurk platform to propagate evocation based on free association. It is implemented as a two-stage collection process (Ernst 2010 ): in the first stage (Sect. 5.1 ), (stimulus synset, response word) pairs were generated using free word association; in the second stage (Sect. 5.2 ), similar to the (Nikolova et al. 2011 ) approach, human evocation ratings on all the possible synset pairs based on the results from the first stage were collected. The MTurk approach described in this section can generate evocation scores for synset pairs that do not exist in any of the available free association norms.
 5.1 First stage: Free association generation In order to test the proposed two-stage collection method without the expense of fully covering WordNet X  X  117,000 synsets, we use the top 2,000 from the Fellbaum-Osherson  X  X  X ore synsets X  X  (Sect. 4.1 ) as a basis for constructing evocation pairs.
Untrained annotators recruited from the Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform were shown a single synset at a time and prompted to enter words that  X  X  X ome to mind X  X  when they think of the synset. Annotators were specifically instructed to avoid listing only synonyms and words that  X  X  X ound similar X  X  to avoid non-semantic responses.

Different from some conventional free association studies that only asked for one response word from each subject, we aimed to gather as many evoked words as possible to expand the semantic association network. In the initial batch of MTurk assignment with each of the 2,000 core synsets presented to exactly two different human workers, only 4.85 responses were generated per stimulus per person on average. To further increase the potential evocation pair set, a second batch of MTurk assignment on 234 synsets selected from the 2,000 list was administered. At least ten evoked words were required for each stimulus synset from 20 annotators.  X  X  X urkers X  X  were allowed to indicate that they could not meet the 10-word requirement for a particular synset. The average words evoked per synset rose to 12.48 in the second batch. This approach enabled us to collect a wider variety of evoked words. Annotators were not requested to rank order their responses, as we did not rely on this information to determine the evocation. 5.2 Second stage: Sense disambiguation and evocation rating The association generation stage described in the previous subsection resulted in a set of (synset, word) pairs, where  X  X  X ord X  X  is a possibly ambiguous arbitrary string entered by the annotator. For example, the response word  X  X  X enter X  X  for the given concept  X  X  X rain: that part of the central nervous system X  X  has 18 senses in WordNet. Since the goal of an evocation database is to have weighted, directed edges between pairs of concepts, it is critical to determine which sense of  X  X  X enter X  X  people have in mind when seeing  X  X  X rain X  X  as the central nervous system. Therefore, at the end of the second stage, the (synset, word) pairs should be turned into unambiguous (synset, synset) pairs on which evocation ratings are assigned.
 We experimented with two ways for the disambiguation plus rating process. In the first method (Fig. 8 ), all the possible senses of the same response word were presented to different annotators for evaluation together with the target concept. For example, one annotator may receive (brain: the central nervous system, center: a building dedicated to a particular activity), while the other may get (brain: the central nervous system, center: a cluster of nerve cells governing a specific bodily process). To make the rating categories clearer, we rephrased the scale to  X  X  X o connection, X  X   X  X  X arely connected X  X  (originally remote association),  X  X  X omewhat connected X  X  (moderate),  X  X  X air connection X  X  (strong), and  X  X  X trong connection X  X  (originally the  X  X  X ery strong/immediate X  X  association).

Using the first method we collected valid evocation ratings on 41,604 synset pairs from MTurk (each by five annotators). Sets of 50 pairs were grouped into a single task with five checks using the gold standard by trained annotators in (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ) embedded. Among these pairs, 1.12 % were considered as very strongly connected, 8.07 % as strong, 18.84 % as moderate, 36.07 % as remotely related. Still, 35.9 % pairs received a  X  X  X o connection X  X  rating by all five raters. This is in line with our expectations as it implies that annotators successfully resolved polysemy for evoked words by assigning a low rating or even a  X  X  X o connection X  X  to the inappropriate senses (as suggested in the WordNet statistics, the average polysemy is 2.95).

One problem with the disambiguated rating method described above is that people may not produce the best sense assignment if not shown all the options. In the (brain, center) example, an annotator may consider  X  X  X  place where some particular activity is concentrated X  X  an acceptable sense of  X  X  X enter, X  X  if not knowing the existence of the more specific definition  X  X  X  cluster of nerve cells. X  X  To address this issue, we developed a second method. Instead of asking each annotator to rate a set of possible synset pairs, one from each response word, a user is shown one synset along with one word that it evoked (from the first-stage results). The user is asked to confirm whether the word is evoked when they think of the stimulus synset (a yes/no question). If the user chooses yes, he is shown all of the possible senses of the response word and asked to choose the one that  X  X  X est matches X  X  the synset. Finally annotators are also asked to assign a weight to this evocation, using the same  X  X  X o connection X  X  to  X  X  X trong connection X  X  scale used in the previous method (Fig. 9 ).

About 60,000 synset pairs were disambiguated and rated using the second method in Stage 2. The same verification mechanism as in the first method was applied. Raters agreed that 11.09 % of the pairs were most strongly associated, and the association was strong in 31.73 % of the pairs and moderate in 43.04 % of the pairs. These results show that the second scheme was more effective in producing synset pairs with high evocation ratings.

However, the second method has problems as well. It is unclear exactly how to reconcile differing answers among annotators on the same task. If two annotators choose a different synset when resolving the evoked word, should each of the synsets be penalized in scoring for not being chosen unanimously? In this particular experiment, such a penalty was not implemented X  X ne cannot expect everyone to come up with the same associations. But the issue of unifying different annotator decisions under this approach is a difficult problem. On the other hand, such an approach does not take into account the possibility that multiple concepts might all be appropriate. For example, given the word (wet: covered or soaked with a liquid, rain), the response word  X  X  X ain X  X  can be interpret either as a verb or a noun. The second method forces annotators to make an unnecessary decision. Such negative consequences overruled the benefits in reducing confusion in polysemous words, and thus the following evaluation was conducted only on the data collected via the first method. 5.3 Comparison with the Nikolova et al. X  X  Dataset To evaluate the performance of the free association-based two-stage evocation generation approach, we compared the newly create evocation collection to the existing dataset provided by Nikolova et al. ( 2011 ). Nikolova et al. X  X  Dataset was the only large-scale evocation dataset available when our data were generated. We think that it serves as a valid counterpart because we collected data from the same population, i.e., Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk workers. The key difference between the two datasets is the methods to generate evocation ratings: Nikolova et al. took an approach directly derived from the definition of evocation, while we built on free association. Despite a set of candidate pairs that is twice as large, Nikolova et al. only received 2,277 pairs rated as  X  X  X trong X  X  (compared to our 3,357) and 8,780 pairs rated as  X  X  X oderate and above X  X  (compared to our 7,839). Thus the method described here is at least twice as effective at collecting pairs of similar rankings.
A more direct comparison on the evocation ratings collected in the two datasets was conducted as well. A set of 400 synset pairs with an  X  X  X mmediate/very strong evocation X  X  rating from the Nikolova et al. dataset were chosen; a similar set of 400 pairs with a full rating were chosen from the data generated by our approach. In each AMT task, participants were asked to rate 24 selected pairs from each dataset together with two control pairs. The result was strongly bifurcated. The immediate-evoked synset pairs from Nikolova et al. achieved a mean rating of remote association and a median rating of no association, while the selected synset pairs from our dataset achieved a mean rating of strong association and a median rating of immediate association. This suggests that our free association-based approach achieved stronger evocation relations than Nikolova X  X  boosting-based mechanism. 6 Discussions The goal of this work was to explore strategies to induce  X  X  X vocation X  X  ratings among similar concepts from free word association data. There are several alternative designs of the two-stage human annotation approach described in Sect. 5 that could potentially improve the performance. In the current approach, we asked annotators participating in the second stage to make a second guess as to which sense the responses generated in the first stage was intended by the respondents. These guesses may not be reliable. To address this problem, we could ask the subjects in the first stage to specify the sense to each of the response word they generate.
In sticking to the current methodology, we may be able to improve the disambiguation and rating performance by combining the two methods in the second stage. To be more specific, annotators will be presented with all the senses of the response word given the stimulus concept (like method 2). They are allowed to rate each sense (instead of only one) that has the potential to be evoked by the given concept, especially when raters are not sure of which  X  X  X est X  X  sense to assign. The score on each sense could be an indicator on annotators X  confidence on their sense disambiguation output. 7 Conclusions and future work Evocation is a directed and weighted measure for the relatedness among concepts that discloses semantic associations in a way not yet been addressed by the standard relations used in WordNet and the common relatedness measures (Boyd-Graber et al. 2006 ). Hence, evocation datasets cannot be trivially computed or derived from WordNet or corpora. In this paper, we propose the use of free word association data to induce concept pairs linked by evocation and the strength of their association. We experimented with two approaches: one used computational techniques to convert existing free association norms into an evocation dataset; the other extended a prior human-generated evocation collection method to a two-stage procedure of free association generation, response disambiguation, and evocation assessment. Com-parison between the two new datasets and the data generated in prior research revealed the benefit of this free association-based evocation inference strategy.
Once a large-scale robust evocation database is established, we can integrate it into WordNet to increase the connectivity between concepts especially across different parts of speech. Word Sense Disambiguation is at the core of most applications for evocation-enhanced WordNet. Since evocation is a measure of strength of semantic associations, it can be used as a supplement of other semantic similarity measures (the ones listed in Fig. 2 ) in other NLP applications such as Machine Translation and Automatic Text Understanding. In addition, evocation-enhanced WordNet is beneficial for language learning and assistive communication. It demonstrates how concepts are commonly connected in everyday language usage, and WordNet users will be able to navigate to a broader set of related synsets much more easily. Research has shown that people with language disabilities could find words and compose sentences faster in a vocabulary with evocation links integrated (Nikolova et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, the consistency of free word association across culture, nationalities, and language background indicates that evocation has the same property. It suggests that evocation-enhanced WordNet can be used for applications involving crosslingual lexical comparisons as well. We plan to explore the different research opportunities introduced by evocation in the future. References
