 We propose a new approach for social and personalized query expansion using social structures in the Web 2.0. While focusing on social tagging systems, the proposed approach considers (i) the semantic similarity between tags composing a query, (ii) a social proximity between the query and the user profile, and (iii) on the fly, a strategy for expanding user queries. The proposed approach has been evaluated using a large dataset crawled from del.icio.us .

Nowadays, social networking sites, collaborative tagging, and micro-blogging sites are certainly the most representa-tive and the most adopted applications in this new era of Web 2.0 for interacting with peers, exchanging messages, sharing resources like photos and videos, commenting on news, creating and updating profiles, etc. Valuable infor-mation is generally exchanged on these platforms but is not necessarily leveraged due to the dynamics of the ecosystem, the huge amount of information, information volatility, etc. In this context, it is natural that finding relevant pieces of information is a recurrent need for users. However, find-ing such relevant information becomes harder for end-users since: (i) by definition, the user doesn X  X  necessarily know what she is looking for until she finds it, and (ii) even if the user knows what she is looking for, she doesn X  X  necessarily know how to formulate the right query.

Query expansion comes then as a means to reduce the impacts of such problems. It enriches the user X  X  initial query with additional information that could be relevant to the initial query so that the system may propose suitable results that better satisfy the user X  X  needs. We consider in this work social bookmarking systems, also called folksonomies , which are generally modeled as a tripartite social graph with three types of entities: users, documents, and tags. We propose a new approach to query expansion through the combination of semantic and social information to reduce some of the limitations of the existing approaches, e.g., personalization.
The problem we are addressing can be formalized as fol-lows: For a given user u who issued a query Q = { t 1 , t how to provide for each t i  X  Q a ranked list of its related pectations and system X  X  offerings is minimized. We translate this by the fact that the ranking function needs to take into account the semantic link between t i and t ij (1  X  j  X  k ), and the social link between t ij and u , which translates the closeness of the user firing the query with other users in the system. Thus, the objective is to transform Q into a new query Q  X  such that: (i) Q is necessarily included in Q  X  , (ii) the results of Q are included in those of Q  X  , and (iii) the obtained results with Q  X  should increase the accuracy of the results and doesn X  X  decrease the user X  X  satisfaction.
To provide social and personalized expansions of a query term t with related term t j , we propose to take into ac-count two main features: (i) the similarity between t and t , i.e., the semantic strength between the two terms, and (ii) the similarity between t j and the user profile expressing the extent to which a tag t j is likely to be interesting to the considered user. We define a user profile as a weighted vec-quency, inverse user frequency (utf-iuf) that evaluates how important a term is to a user inside a set of users, i.e., similar to the tf-idf measure.

Once these two similarities are computed, a merge oper-ation is necessary to obtain a final ranking value that indi-cates the similarity of t j with t w.r.t. the user u . For this, we choose the Weighted Borda Fuse (WBF) as summarized in Equation 1, where 0  X   X   X  1 is a parameter that controls the strength of the semantic and the social parts. where Sim ( t, t i ) is a similarity computed between the query term t and t i , m the profile X  X  length, and w t j the weight of t in the user profile. In order to consider specific constraints in our approach, we propose a similarity measure that takes into account the credibility of entities in a folksonomy based on their popularity obtained using SPR [3], where the credi-bility of an entity e (i.e., user, document, or tag) is given by  X  log ( SP R ( e ). Then, we reduce into three bipartite graphs, i.e., User-Tag, User-Document, and Tag-Document, where w e consider only the User-Tag graph (see [4]), to compute the similarity between tags inspired from the Jaccard simi-larity using Formula 2.

Where N ( t i ) is the set of users that are the direct neigh-bors of t i (resp. t j ) in the bipartite graph User-Tag, and  X  ( t i , u ) the number of times t i interacts with u obtained by their aggregation over documents. Finally, we reduce the bipartite graph to obtain a graph of tags G tag , which repre-sents similarity between tags computed with Formula 2. Algorithm 1 E ffective Social Query Expansion SoQuES
After getting the user X  X  profile as explained above (Line 1), t he purpose is to enrich each term t i of Q with related terms (Line 2). Then, the objective is to get all the neighboring tags t j of t i in the tag graph G tag (Line 3). After that, in Line 4, we compute for each t j , the ranking value that indicates its similarity with t i w.r.t. the user u (Line 5). Next, the neighborhood list has to be sorted according to the value of Rank [ t j ] and keep only the k top tags (Line 6). Finally, t i and its remaining neighbors must be linked with the OR (  X  ) logical connector (Line 7) and updated in Q  X  . As an example, if a user u issues a query Q = t 1  X  t 2  X  ...  X  t it will be expanded to become Q  X  =( t 1  X  t 11  X  ...  X  t t  X  ...  X  t 2 k )  X  ...  X  ( t m  X  t m 1  X  ...  X  t mr ) .
The evaluation has been performed on data crawled from del.icio.us on September 2010, which consist of about 150  X  like in [1], which consists of: the relevant documents for a personalized query Q = ( u, t ) fired by user u with query term t are those tagged by u with t . Q is enriched and transformed into Q  X  , and documents that are indexed with tags of Q  X  are retrieved, ranked and sorted according to two IR model: (i) using the cosine similarity measure between Q  X  and each document d j (Vectorial model), with values of Equation 1 as weights of Q  X  ; or (ii) using the Okapi BM25 similarity measure (probabilistic model). This is made on 1000 couples (u,t), over which we compute the Mean Average Precision (MAP) . We first begin by computing the optimal values of  X  and the number of terms added to the queries (Figure 1).
We choose to fix  X  = 0 . 5 for giving the same importance to the semantic similarity between terms, and to the social proximity with the user profile, and the query size = 6 per query term to compare with other approaches. Figure 1: MAP for different values of  X  , and query size, averaged over 1000 queries, using the VSM. Figure 2: Comparison of the proposed approach, while fixing  X  = 0 . 5 and query size to 6.

The comparison with other approaches is made while us-ing the Vectorial Model , and the probabilistic model based on Okapi BM25 . The results for our method are illustrated as SoQuES VSM and SoQuES BM25 in Figure 2(a) and 2(b) respectively. These approaches are: (i) Non expanded queries based on VSM and BM25, (ii) Neighborhood based approach , which consists of enriching the query Q with the most related terms to t i without considering the user profile, based on VSM and BM25, and (iii) Ex-pansion Social Semantic , an approach proposed in [2], where documents are ranked using BM25 and tag similarity scores. We implemented this strategy and evaluated it over our del.icio.us dataset.
We described in this paper a new query expansion ap-proach based on social personalization to transform an ini-tial query Q to another query Q  X  enriched with close terms that are mostly used by a given user and her social rela-tives. A formal evaluation of the quality of the results, using datasets crawled from del.icio.us , has shown the benefits of this approach in comparison to other approaches. Reinforce the evaluation by including real users, improve the execution time, and combine our approach with existing techniques are among our plans for future work.
