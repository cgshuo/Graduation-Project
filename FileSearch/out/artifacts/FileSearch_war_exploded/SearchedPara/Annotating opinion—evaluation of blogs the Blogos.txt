 Abstract The blog phenomenon is universal. Blogs are characterized by their evaluative use, in that they enable Internet users to express their opinion on a given subject. From this point of view, they are an ideal resource for the constitution of an annotated sentiment analysis corpus, crossing the subject and the opinion expressed on this subject. This paper presents the Blogoscopy corpus for the French language which was built up with personal thematic blogs. The annotation was governed by three principles: theoretical, as opinion is grounded in a linguistic theory of eval-uation, practical, as every opinion is linked to an object, and methodological as annotation rules and successive phases are defined to ensure quality and thoroughness.
 Keywords Blogs Sentiment analysis Corpus annotation Evaluation Polarity French language 1 Introduction Sentiment analysis in texts is a recent research area in intelligent information retrieval. Many research works are devoted to that task that are presented in specialised sessions in the main NLP conferences such as ACL, as well as workshops such as EMOT 2008, EMOTION 2010 and evaluation campaigns of sentiment analysis systems such as SemEval 2007 for English or DEFT 2007, 2009 for French. The sentiment analysis systems are of three main types: the first seeks to retrieve the semantic orientation of a text which can be either positive or negative, or even neutral (Turney 2002 ; Pang et al. 2002 ; Torres-Moreno et al. 2007 ); the second identifies subjective sentences in a text, and then categorizes them according to their semantic orientation (Riloff and Wiebe 2003 ; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003 ; Kim and Hovy 2004 ); and the third Popescu and Etzioni 2005 ; Kobayashi et al. 2007 ; Kessler and Nicolov 2009 ). More detailed discussions about sentiment analysis are found in (Pang and Lee 2008 ; Liu 2010 ).

Whatever the type of system and method, a corpus is needed for training and for (Devitt and Ahmad 2007 ), movie reviews from specialized websites (Pang et al. 2002 ) or from blogs (Mishne 2006 ). A grade is assigned to each text that reflects the semantic orientation. The corpus for the second and third types requires text annotations that could be very sophisticated such as the sentiment analysis corpus provided for English by Wiebe et al. ( 2006 ) that performs annotations at sentence and at word levels. The texts that are included in such a corpus are newspaper articles, and thus are limited in the way of expressing sentiments. A generic sentiment analysis system should make use of corpora that gather texts from different communities and cultures, different domains and times that express sentiments in different ways.
 The  X  X  X log phenomenon X  X  is universal, very popular and is growing continuously. The number of blogs, diaries and personal sites on the Internet increased from 8 to 72 million between March 2005 and March 2007 ( http://www.alain-lambert-blog.org/ ). Blogs are everywhere nowadays: the media uses and refers to them, politicians resort to them and researchers use them for their work. With this popular fashion, the number of blog platforms has increased in France since 2002, multi-plying tenfold the possible extent of information exchanges. In this new web landscape, blogs are characterized by their evaluative use, in the way that they are used by Internet users to express their opinions on a given subject. From this point of view, they constitute an ideal resource for the constitution of an annotated corpus for French bringing together the subject and the sentiment expressed about the subject together.

The expressions of sentiments have been studied for English by Quirk et al. ( 1985 ) and Martin and White ( 2005 ), and for French by Charaudeau ( 1992 ). From the latter, we deduce an annotation scheme to encode subject and sentiments with a few adaptations to the blog data. The choice of Charaudeau X  X  theory is justified: it gives descriptions of evaluation that are adapted to the French language and close to the appraisal theory (Martin and White 2005 ). Furthermore, Charaudeau X  X  typology is introduced in an intuitive way that guarantees the homogeneity of the annotation, and thus the exploitation of the corpus.
This paper presents the Blogoscopy corpus: the first French corpus annotated for sentiment analysis according to Charaudeau X  X  theory that covers different domains and times, and constructed with personal thematic blogs.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 defines and characterizes the blog. Section 3 presents Charaudeau X  X  theory that describes opinion-evaluation for the French language. Section 4 gives an overview of the annotating scheme. Section 5 presents the data. Section 6 describes the annotating rules and the methodology. Section 7 provides statistics on annotations. Section 8 discusses related and future works. 2 Blog: a very personal medium 2.1 Presentation 2.1.1 A new publication tool The definition of a blog is complex, because it started out as a publication tool and then in 2002 it became a multifaceted phenomenon embracing fashion, society, the Internet, etc. The attractive use of this tool seems to be at the origin of its success, because it enables any Internet user to put on-line texts and images as easily as using a simple word processor. It explains, on the one hand, the different members of the public and the wide-ranging uses (e.g. teenager/diary; journalist/long press articles; professional/personal analyses on a specialized subject), and on the other hand, the speed of the updates and their frequency. 2.1.2 Definition Generally speaking in spite of the multiple facets of this new publication tool, we can define a blog as  X A type of Web site consisting mainly of posts (or of news) published with the stream and appearing according to an anti-chronological order (the most recent at the top of page), mostly enriched by external hypertext links X  (Fievet and Turrettini 2004 , p. 3). 1 This definition clearly assigns a certain number of structural criteria which characterize the shape of blogs. 2.1.3 Structural benchmark The homepage of a blog is a web page consisting of two or three columns of texts, distributed in a list of posts, comments, links and a list of archives:  X  X  X logs are really about the format X  X requent, short bursts of text X  X  format that happens to work very well on the web, both for readers ( X  X  X eople don X  X  read on the web X  X ) and writers/publishers. X  X  [Williams Evan]. 2 A post appears in the shape of clearly different paragraphs which are generally short and classified in inverted chrono-column X  X  of the blog. Every post can be commented by the visitor X  X eader, anonymously or not. These reactions are qualified as comments. Comments are also archived, so that it is also possible to consult them chronologically. A blog includes a list of links (available on a frame in general) chosen by the author, which clock in usually towards other Websites, mostly of blogs too. These hypertext links can be permanent (e.g.: URL of the post enables the user to have direct access and to refer permanently to it). These external links point towards other information sources which support the remarks made. Finally, all posts and comments are archived. The calendar and can be organized by categories, topic or key words. 2.2 A new medium 2.2.1 A personalized medium Blogs represents a new publication format, a new ground of expression, a new form of communication and thus a new form of mass media. Traditionally, the mass media defines itself as  X  X  X n impersonal way of circulating news (such as the press, the radio, the television), used to communicate. Mass media enables information to be broadcast to a large number of individuals without the personalization of the message. X  X  3 What characterizes blogs is precisely its personal aspect.
 We  X  X  X xpress emotional problems, our soul searching, our fancies or our blushes. We publish unimportant photographs as well as PhD theses. We comment on the news. We share our tastes and comment on information published by others. And we meet our readers there, who can themselves become authors, by a simple click of the mouse X  X  (Fievet and Turrettini 2004 , p. V). So, the principle of communication becomes therefore impersonal. As a result, this publication format is characterized by a freedom of tone. 2.2.2 Expression of opinions A blog is generally the fruit of a single individual, but a blog can be collective or even come from a firm. Nevertheless, the interest and success of a blog often depends on its author, particularly on his/her personality, style, interests and opinions. Bloggers personify their blogs and the writings. Many bloggers write in the first person singular. That is why,  X  X  X ontrary to traditional mass media, the personality of the blogger, his style and his opinions play an essential role in the interest of the blog X  X  (Fievet and Turrettini 2004 , p. 6). 2.2.3 Thematic aspect Most of the time, bloggers express their opinion on subjects which interest them and exchange with readers sharing their interests; they also create communities. These communities are identified by blog topics which we often find on blog platforms such as Skyblog, Overblog, MSN Space, Blogger, Typepad, etc. These blogs are qualified as thematic blogs. They are well represented in the blogosphere and constitute an intermediary between the personal diary and the pure web-log (consisting only of a list of links). Furthermore, these blogs present the particularity of being the favorite place to express opinions (cf. Sect. 5.1 on thematic blogs). 2.3 Issues In 2006, Technorati ( http://www.technorati.com/ ) counted 38 million blogs with a real activity, of which 2% were written in French, which means that 532,000 French blogs are alive. For example, 1,100 blogs are created every day on the Over-blog platform, where every visitor spends approximately 12 min of his or her day reading its 3.5 million pages. They are read by a Blogger population that is representative of the global population, because Over-blog is not specifically marketed for teenagers, unlike Skyblog and MSN Spaces for example. That is why we built the Blogoscopy corpus from the Overblog platform (cf. Sect. 5.2 ). Blogs therefore constitute both a new method of information exchange and a new power of information, which can influence the opinion of readers. Therefore, Blogs represent an ideal subject of study for the observation of different forms of expressions of opinion X  X valuation, where evaluation includes all types of opinion. 3 Opinion: evaluation theory The goal of the annotation scheme is to distinguish the different forms of opinions that a speaker can express about a subject. Opinion is a subjective form of information. As a result, the annotation scheme is centered on the notion of evaluation, a general term that covers opinions, appreciations, judgments, etc. Evaluation is  X  rather difficult to confine: appreciation of the aesthetic qualities, the uses of an object, but also emotional, behavioral, even somatic reaction to the qualities of things, people and events, or even judgment of a moral or ethical order  X  (Legallois and Ferrari 2006 , p. 58).

On both the lexical and enunciative levels, evaluation is at the heart of several linguistic fields:  X  the semantics (Kerbrat-Orecchioni 1997 ), the aim of which is to structure the meaning, describe certain lexical units as being intrinsically evaluative, that is as being carriers of a polarity, positive such as improvement , negative such as rape , even ambivalent such as strike (Galatanu 2005 , 2006 );  X  Integrated pragmatics (in semantics) (Anscombre 1989 ; Anscombre and Ducrot 1983 ) place the evaluative function at the heart of the argumentative device. For example, to say this tablecloth is square , not only gives information regarding its geometrical characteristics but it also tends towards an argumentative chain, possibly favorable suggesting it is perfectly adapted to my table, or unfavorable in that it is impossible to lay it on my table (Galatanu 2002 );  X  Traditionally in the lineage of the French school of discourse analysis (Pe  X  scheux and Fuchs 1975 ; Charaudeau 1983 ; Maingueneau 1987 , 1990 , 1991 , 1995 , 1996 ), evaluation is analyzed thanks to enunciation marks. Enunciation testifies to the way the speaking subject appropriates the language to organize it into discourse; in this process of appropriation, the speaking subject is brought to a position with regard to his addressee, with regard to the world which surrounds him, and with regard to what he says (Benveniste 1974 ). 4
As well as (Legallois and Ferrari 2006 ), our approach to analyze evaluation is based on the discursive usage, involving semantics, pragmatics and enunciation. We concentrate on direct opinions and set aside comparison opinions that could be easily identified thanks to syntactic patterns. These dimensions are observable and analyzable from the contextual occurrences of its expression and specific in its textual genre (Rastier 2001 ). Generally speaking the evaluative phenomena observed in discourse through the texts show themselves through (Charaudeau 1992 , p. 469):  X  The subjective qualification X  X .g.: it is a beautiful picture .  X  The person X  X .g.: I, me, us, you , etc.  X  The designation X  X .g.: my, my, my, tone, your, your , etc.  X  The temporal situation X  X .g.: present (tense).

The subjective qualification can be observed through the lexical elements which express for the speaker a break in the indifference in relation to the contents of the statement or the object about which he/she speaks. According to the nature of the positive versus negative poles (e.g.: it is a beautiful picture  X  X ositive).
The person, the designation, and the temporal situation enable us to clarify the speaker X  X  attitude towards his addressee and the proposition of the utterance. They consist of three basic locutionary acts: the Speaker X  X  act, the Addressee X  X  act, and the Illocutive act.

In the Speaker X  X  act, the speaker makes no direct reference to his addressee. He reveals his own position by what he says. This act is classified into nine categories (or modalities) such as opinion, appreciation, obligation, suggestion, etc. These discourse.

In the Addressee X  X  act, the speaker involves his addressees in the utterance and imposes on the latter the content of the proposition. This act is classified into nine categories such as judgment, injunction, permission, suggestion, and so on.
Finally, the Illocutive act refers neither to the speaker nor to the addressee. It is statements contain neither linguistic marks of the speaker ( I, me, my , etc.), nor of the addressee ( you, your , etc.). So, the enunciative modality of the assertion is described by miscellaneous subcategories  X  X  X hich correspond, point by point, to most of the modalities of the Speaker X  X  act where we would have removed the responsibility of the speaker X  X  (Charaudeau 1992 , p. 619). For example, for the opinion It is evident that or for the appreciation It is considerable .
 Charaudeau describes twelve Speaker X  X  and nine Addressee X  X  modalities. From these modalities, we kept only five, which decline into twenty-three subcategories. Two criteria presided over this choice: the one concerning the intensity of the evaluation emitted (e.g.: Opinion X  X onviction, supposition, strong certainty, etc.), the other concerning the break of indifference with regard to the emitted comment and being translated by a positive or negative orientation (e.g.: Acceptance X  positive, Refusal X  X egative). These two criteria are not exclusive, in that some enunciative modalities share both aspects (e.g.: Appreciation X  X ositive explicit appreciation, negative implicit appreciation, etc. the explicit or implicit aspect of the evaluation translating one degree of intensity in the expression of the evaluation). We will now present the annotation (cf. Sect. 4 ) and the Blogoscopy corpus (cf. Sect. 5 ). 4 Overview of the annotation scheme The annotation of the Blogoscopy corpus concerns two categories of elements: the objects contained in posts and comments, and the evaluations by the author of the post or the comment about the objects.

As this section concentrates on the transposition of Charaudeau X  X  theory to the blog data, certain definitions are necessary. First of all, we define as an evaluation, all the linguistic brands indicating the feeling of the author with regard to an object (e.g. opinion, appreciation, judgment, etc.). An object is a name or a nominal phrase which characterizes a subject or a theme. A subject is a keyword used for extracting posts and corresponding to the applicative target, whereas a theme refers to a category proposed for the distribution of blogs on the Overblog platform 5 (e.g. current events, artists, the economy, etc.). The speaker is the blogger or the author of the blog and the post. The addressees are the Internet readers of the blog and the post. The Internet readers can, in turn, become authors, if they post a comment in answer to a post they have read.

Section 4.1 details and exemplifies the five categories of evaluations used to annotate the corpus, and Sect. 4.2 describes the various constituents of an object and specifies the relations which link evaluations and objects. 4.1 Evaluations We have chosen to leave the Illocutive act aside and to consider only five subcategories of the Speaker X  X  and the Addressee X  X  acts (Charaudeau 1992 , pp. 599 X 618): opinion, appreciation, acceptance-refusal, agreement-discord and judgment. For each of these modalities, we present their subcategories. 4.1.1 Opinion The expression of an opinion refers to a fact or presupposed information which the blogger  X  X  X e-places X  X  in its universe of belief:  X  X  X he speaker thus estimates the truth of his comment and reveals at the same moment what is his point of view. This point of adopts a belief attitude based on motives ( I think, I believe, I doubt ) X  X  (Charaudeau 1992 , p. 601).

The opinion can be divided into two attitudes of belief: conviction and comment. So, the certainty expressed by the author is individual for him (e.g.: I have the inmost conviction that he will succeed ). The supposition implies that there is no complete certainty of the truth of the comment; this allows the author to express his point of view by different degrees of certainty. The certainty thus varies according to an axis which goes from strong certainty to presentiment, by way of medium and low certainties. Each of these modalities can be expressed according to an explicit or implicit aspect. In the explicit aspect, there are five subcategories:  X  conviction (e.g. je suis persuade  X  /I am absolutely sure )  X  supposition certitude high (e.g. je me doute/I am almost sure )  X  supposition certitude medium (e.g. je crois/I think )  X  supposition certitude low (e.g. je doute/I am not sure )  X  supposition premonition (e.g. je sens/I feel ) In the implicit aspect, the expression of the conviction and the supposition requires intonation and affirmative or sceptical body language. Working only on written texts, these two dimensions can only be taken into account, by the punctuation (e.g. three suspension points for the sceptical aspect), or the presence of emoticons (e.g.: information is ambiguous, we keep only the explicit forms of the expression of these two attitudes of belief. 4.1.2 Appreciation The expression of an appreciation refers to a fact or to presupposed information about which the blogger  X  X  X xpresses X  X  his feeling.

He  X  X  X hus estimates its value, by revealing his own feelings, and not the truth of the comment X  X  (Charaudeau 1992 , p. 604). This evaluation is emotional, in that that the author appropriates the comment by qualifying it according to an emotional judgment. This judgment is inevitably polarized, i.e. it varies according to an axis ranking from a positive polarity to a negative polarity.

The positive or negative appreciation covers four value areas: ethics (values of morality; e.g. It is good/bad , aesthetics (e.g. he looks attractive/ugly ), hedonics (emotional values; e.g. he is happy/unfortunate ) and pragmatics (utilitarian values; implicit aspect.

In the explicit aspect, this modality can be expressed in two ways, either by a verb of modality (or a modal verbal periphrasis), or by an exclamatory sentence. The explicit aspects break down into three forms: satisfaction, relief and euphoria for positive polarity and disappointment, resignation and despair for the negative polarity. However, these value areas turned out to be too restrictive to be applied to blogs. Therefore, we kept only the two polarities:  X  positive explicit appreciation PEA (e.g. je suis satisfait/I am satisfied )  X  negative explicit appreciation NEA (e.g. je suis triste que/I am so sad that ... )  X  positive exclamation X  X xplicit appreciation X  PEEA (e.g. Youpi!/ I X  X  very  X  negative exclamation X  X xplicit appreciation NEEA (e.g. Merde!/Dam! ) The implicit aspect corresponds to any statement containing a positive or negative element from the author and expressed in a way other than by a verb (or a circumlocution) modal verb or an exclamative way:  X  positive implicit appreciation PIA (e.g. c X  X st vraiment inte  X  ressant/ this is very  X  negative implicit appreciation NIA (e.g. c X  X st vraiment mauvais/this is really 4.1.3 Acceptance-refusal The expression of the acceptance-refusal from the author of the blog, who  X  X  X resupposes that he was asked to achieve an act X  X  (Charaudeau 1992 , p. 614), which he answers favourably (acceptance) or unfavourably (refusal). This modality also declines according to an aspect:  X  explicit: acceptance (e.g. je consens/I consent )  X  implicit: by the expression of a presupposition or body language Only the explicit aspect is encountered in textual data. 4.1.4 Agreement-discord The expression of the agreement-discord also from the author of the blog, who comment held by the other one X  X  (Charaudeau 1992 , p. 615). He answers it by validating positively or negatively the truth of the comment. This modality declines into four subcategories:  X  full agreement (e.g. bien su  X  r, je/of course, I )  X  vague agreement (e.g. je suis globalement d X  X ccord/In the main I agree )  X  corrective agreement (e.g. oui, mais je/yes, but I )  X  full disagreement (e.g. certainement pas, je/certainly not, I ) As well as for the acceptance-refusal, in its implicit aspect, this modality is expressed essentially by body language; it materializes generally by a movement of the head, and cannot be thus considered within the framework of this textual annotation. 4.1.5 Judgment Contrary to four other types of evaluation, the expression of the judgment comes from the author of the blog, but it is sent to the Internet user reader of the post:  X  X  X he speaker describes a realized action; postulates that the addressee is responsible for this act (to say or to make); judges that this act is good or bad; declares its approval or disapproval by qualifying the addressee ( X  X  X entence X  X ); gives himself the moral authority of the one who can judge X  X  (Charaudeau 1992 , p. 586). The Internet user reader is thus supposed to have an act for which he is responsible and is qualified by the judgment of the author.
In its explicit aspect, this modality is expressed by verbs, circumlocutions or nouns which specify the positive or negative way of judging:  X  explicit positive judgement X (e.g.: je vous approuve/I agree with you )  X  explicit negative judgement X (e.g.: je te reproche/I blame you) In its implicit aspect, this modality is expressed by any statement describing an action keep the fourth value areas which are congratulation, pardon, accusation and reproach:  X  positive implicit judgment X  X ongratulation (e.g. vous avez e  X  te  X  magnifique/you  X  positive implicit judgement X  X ardon (e.g. c X  X st oublie  X  , n X  X n parlons plus/it X  X   X  negative implicit judgment X  X ccusation (e.g. vous avez enfonce  X  ma porte/you  X  negative implicit judgment X  X eproach (e.g. ton attitude n X  X st pas correcte/your 4.1.6 Synthesis of the evaluations Table 1 summarizes and illustrates the five categories of evaluations kept for the annotating work and the subcategories to which they are associated. Every subcategory comes with an example occurring in the corpus (cf. Sect. 5.2 ). 4.2 Concepts and instances An evaluation concerns an object that is of two types: a concept or an instance. In a post, a concept (e.g. character) can be instantiated to one or several proper nouns (e.g. Harry Potter, Hermione , etc.). As Kobayashi et al. ( 2007 ), Banea et al. ( 2008 ), we distinguish between the concept and its instances, the proper nouns, that could be numerous and for which a close list does not exist. We distinguish also between the comment, and those which are not.

A concept is a nominal phrase, a text occurrence appearing within the post or the comment. We defined three types of concepts to annotate the corpus: the main concepts (CC), the subordinate or associated concepts (AC), and the not associated concepts (NC). As Liu ( 2010 ), an object is represented as a hierarchy of components and sub-components. The main concepts correspond to the nature of the referent and answer the question  X  X  X hat is the post or the comment about? X  X  (e.g. strike, law, film, etc.). The subordinate or associated concepts belong to the semantic field of the main concept in the post or the comment (e.g. actor is an associated concept of the main concept film ). The non-associated concepts are concepts not associated to the object of the post or the comment, but that have been evaluated (e.g. within the post about the Sin City object, we have identified the main concepts: info, film, upload ; the associated concepts: release date, director ; and the non-associated concepts: town, area, cops ).

An instance of a concept is a name entity that occurs in the post or the comment. The name entities as defined within the MUC conferences (MUC-6 1995 ) gather named persons, companies, and geographic entities (e.g. Sarkozy , Renault, Brittany ). Such name entity classes do not take into account all the instances that have been found in the blogs, so we adopt the extensive name entity classification proposed by Fourour and Morin ( 2003 ) that classifies any type of name entities, including names of works (e.g. Joconde, La Peau de Chagrin ), names of mythical or fictitious characters (e.g. Hercules, Colombo ). We defined two types of instances: the associated instance (IA) that could be linked to the detonated by the fictitious character Harry Potter is linked to the main concepts: film, book, books, novel ), and the non-associated instance (IN), which is not linked to a concept but is evaluated too. 5 Data 5.1 The personal thematic blogs and the OverBlog platform Before the data collection, a comparative analysis of three typologies of blogs (Dubreil et al. 2009 ) enabled us to focus our analyses on the personal thematic blogs, that is on  X  X  X rench-speaking personal blogs, held by the same individual, regularly supplied and open to the public X  X  (Cardon and Delaunay-Te  X  terel 2006 , relative posts contain simultaneously an informative part relative to the concept, and an evaluative one relative to the point of view of the author in the posts and to that of his addressee in every associated comment.

Posts and comments were extracted from blogs hosted on the Over-Blog website ( http://www.over-blog.com/ ). Over-Blog is a platform of blogs, which means a tool enabling blogs to be created. Out of the 43 themes proposed by Over-Blog to its bloggers to classify their production (e.g. de  X  tente/recreation, e  X  conomie/ economics, enfants/children, famille/family, gastronomie/gastronomy, guides d X  X chats/shopping guide, humour/humor, jeux/games, journal intime/diary, lesbian/ business, cinema, etc.) to compose our corpus, chosen according to their adequacy to our typological principles. These posts and comments were extracted in June, 2007; a previous extraction would have introduced a bias into the representation French presidential elections of April 22nd and May 6th 2007. To make sure of the representativeness of the corpus with regards to the main interests and hobbies of bloggers, we selected 10 blogs that were most visited by subject, then the 10 most recent published posts and the first 10 comments (maximum) associated with every post. 5.2 The Blogoscopy corpus The Blogoscopy corpus ([Blogoscopy]) contains 200 annotated posts and 612 associated comments, which represents a little more than 83,500 words distributed within 200 files in the .xml format. 5,666 objects were annotated and there were 4,943 evaluations. [Blogoscopy] contains three subsections clarified below. Ideally, [Blogoscopy] has to report on a variety of objects evoked by bloggers in correlation with a representativeness of the various forms of possible evaluations. Pursuing this objective, we modified the criteria of choice of the posts and comments to be annotated during the procedure of tagging. As a result [Blogoscopy] breaks down into three parts.

The first part of the corpus contains 76 posts and 296 comments that were selected according to a thematic criterion among 33 categories held on the Over-Blog website, which are: actualite  X  s/news, artiste/artist, blogzine, business, cinema/ cinema, collectionneur/collector, consummation/consumption, console, croyance/ faith, decoration/decoration, de  X  tente/recreation, e  X  conomie/economics, enfants/chil-dren, familles/families, gastronomie/gastronomy, guides d X  X chats/shopping guide, internet, jeux/games, livres/books, loisirs/leisure activities, maison/house, musique/ health, sciences, sport, techno, television/television, voyage/travel, weblogs. Two out of three posts (and their associated comments) were annotated by category. At this stage of the annotation, it was a question of covering the maximum number of subjects for a better representation of the personal interests of bloggers. However, as there was too great a variety of the treated objects and by repercussion, the weak recurrence of the annotated concepts, urged us to apply another principle of selection of posts, at the risk of not being able to observe enough regularities.
The second part of the corpus collects 34 posts and 162 comments, divided into 8 themes; 4 posts by theme. These 8 themes are: news, artist, blogzine, business, cinema, gastronomy, shopping guide and books. Files were selected according to the same two criteria as the first part: the presence of textual contents and evaluations concerning one or several concepts. Here, the purpose of the note was to label evaluations on the most recurrent concepts. However, the weak variety of the listed evaluations encouraged us to apply another principle of selection of posts.
The third part of the corpus consists of 90 posts and 156 comments, divided into 10 subjects; 10 posts per subject. These 10 subjects are: Beaujolais, sustainable development, the SNCF strike, Harry Potter, le c X ur des hommes 2/the heart of men 2, the law on the responsibility of universities X  X RU, nuclear power, Raymond Domenech, Vladimir Putin and Wii. At this stage, the objective was to annotate various evaluations on the most recurrent concepts. This last approach was the most forms of expressions of the evaluation.

Table 2 summarizes for each part of [Blogoscopy] the number of evaluations annotated in posts and comments. 6 Annotating rules and methodology This section details how objects and evaluations have been encoded and the rules that the annotators have applied. Three types of rules have been used:  X  Automation rules that allow the annotator to encode only once an object or an evaluation occurring several times within a blog. They are used to minimize annotation errors and not to overload the text during the manual encoding. The missing occurrences will be automatically annotated.  X  Standardization rules that perform normalization on the objects and the evaluations. They will ease the identification of the objects and the analysis of evaluation on the objects.  X  Exhaustive rules that list all the objects and the evaluations occurring in the blog. This exhaustive identification will be useful for building a lexicon or an ontology of a given subject and to collect further evaluations on new corpora.
The annotation follows three phases that guarantee the increase of its quality: the application of the linguistic theory, the reinforcement of the annotation phase, and the increase of the data. An inter-coder agreement study is carried out between the phases. 6.1 Objects and annotating rules 6.1.1 Concepts and instance To the main concepts (CC), answering the question  X  X  X hat is the subject of the post or the comment? X  X , the annotator must assign an identifier, according to the textual occurrences within the post or the comment (e.g. the main concept Beaujolais Some of the occurrences of the main concepts are hyponyms or meronyms. In this case, the annotator assigns a new identifier to the hyponym or the meronym and links it to its subordinate main concept (e.g. the identifier C2 identifies Beaujolais which is a hyponym of the main concept Beaujolais nouveau identified by concepts (AC) are necessarily and manually linked by the annotator to the main concepts to which they are semantically connected. The non-subordinated concept concept with four possible values: colloquial language (e.g. vin/wine ), formal language (e.g. cru/vintage ), terminological language (e.g. Appellation d X  X rigine plonk) .

The instances (IA) are necessarily and manually linked by the annotator to the As for the non-subordinated concept, the non-associated instance does not receive an identifier (e.g. &lt; IA cc =  X  X  X resident,gouvernement X  X  &gt; Sarkozy &lt; /IA &gt;). 6.1.2 General annotation rules Some of general rules govern the manual annotation of the concepts and the instances:R1 X  X utomation rules:  X  R1-1 X  X  concept or an instance is annotated on the page only once, even if it  X  R1-2 X  X he morphological variants of a concept or an instance already annotated E.g. The plural form of the main concept movement is annotated and receives the same identifier as the singular form:
R2 X  X tandardization rules:  X  R2-1 X  X he synonyms of the main concepts are clustered under the same E.g. the main concepts series and sitcom are synonyms within the blog and receive the same identifier:  X  R2-2 X  X hen a concept is expressed thanks to a nominal phrase, it could be So, when it is a nominal phrase expressing a concept, the maximal nominal phrase is encoded. Here: &lt;CC id_c= X  X  X 1 X  X &gt; lampe balise marine &lt;/CC&gt;, other occurrences are variants.

R3 X  X xhaustiveness rules:  X  R3-1 X  X ach main and associated concept that occur within the post or the  X  R3-2 X  X ll the instances that have an evaluation are annotated and linked to the E.g. The organisation name Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable development is an instance of the main concept government and linked to it: 6.2 Application of evaluations and annotating rules 6.2.1 Evaluations The five types of evaluations: opinion, appreciation, acceptance X  X efusal, agree-ment X  X iscord and judgment consist of several subcategories that are encoded as a value of the type feature. (e.g. &lt; Opinion type =  X  X  X onviction X  X  &gt; does not have to sum specified thanks to the form (e.g. &lt; Opinion type =  X  X  X onviction X  X  form =  X  X  X ction, the evaluation can be the object of an ironic process, which often inverses the positive X  X egative polarity of the evaluation; in that case the annotator has to instantiate the irony feature to the  X  X  X es X  X  value. (E.g. The main concept beaujolais nouveau received an evaluation that comments on its raspberry taste. In the context, this appreciation is negative because of the following ironic appreciation: &lt; Appre-ciation type =  X  X  X EEA X  X  forme =  X  X  X eaujolais nouveau, gou  X  t X  X  irony =  X  X  X es X  X  &gt; autant boire du Yop!/why not drink Yop! &lt; /Appreciation &gt;). 6.2.2 Specific annotation rules Several specific rules have been added to the general rules when carrying out the annotation. They solve problems that annotators have encountered
R1 X  X utomation rules:  X  R1-3 X  X he default value of the irony feature is the  X  X  X o X  X  value. Only the ironic E.g.: &lt; Appreciation type =  X  X  X IA X  X  form =  X  X  X onction publique X  X  irony =  X  X  X es X  X  &gt; on publique/public service &lt; /CA &gt;
R2 X  X tandardization rules:  X  R2-3 X  X hen various forms of evaluations succeed one another, each of them E.g. &lt; Opinion type =  X  X  X ow_supposition_certitude X  X  forme =  X  X  X arkozy X  X  &gt; je doute le rend sexy ! &lt; /Appreciation &gt; )  X  R2-4 X  X he evaluation must include the positive or negative clues or the E.g.: Derrie ` re ces/Behind these &lt; CA cc =  X  X  X 1 X  X  &gt; comportements/behaviours family matter and this is &lt; Appreciation type =  X  X  X IA X  X  forme =  X  X  X omportements X  X  &gt; pas toujours facile a ` de  X  nouer/not always easy to solve &lt; /Appreciation &gt;  X  X  )  X  R2-5 X  X he form feature used to link an evaluation to an object has to encode the chef X  X  &gt; de  X  jante  X  &lt; /Appreciation  X  R2-6 X  X oncerning the explicit appreciation X  X xclamative form (PEEA and E.g. &lt;Appreciation type= X  X  X EA X  X  forme= X  X  X e t X  X voir fait rire X  X &gt; Contente !/Happy!
R3 X  X ules of exhaustiveness  X  R3-3 X  X hen an evaluation concerns several objects, the lexical forms of these E.g. &lt;Appreciation type =  X  X  X IA X  X  forme =  X  X  X daptation, livre/adaptation,book X  X  &gt; le plus inte  X  ressant/the most interesting &lt;/Appreciation&gt; 6.3 Corpus annotating methodology and agreement study The corpus annotating methodology specifies the formal criteria for identifying the various forms of evaluation and the linguistic properties of the object to be encoded. The annotation was carried out in three phases:  X  application of the linguistic theory phase;  X  reinforcement of the annotation scheme phase;  X  increase of the data phase.
Various aspects of the annotation scheme could be measured: which objects (concepts, associated concepts, instances) and which evaluations should be marked; evaluations according to Chareaudeau X  X  theory; the identification of the boundaries of the objects and evaluations.

To measure the agreement of the set of objects and evaluations to be marked, we adopt the metric agr defined by Wiebe et al. ( 2006 ) that considers how much intersection there is between the set of objects or evaluations such as: where A and B are the set of objects or evaluations annotated by annotators a and b , respectively.

To measure the agreement to categorize the different types of objects and the evaluations according to Chareaudeau X  X  theory, we compute Fleiss X  Kappa coefficient ( J ) (Fleiss 1971 ) adapted to a pool of coders, where none of them should be distinguished. 6.3.1 Linguistic theory application phase The application phase for the linguistic theory was simultaneously carried out by 5 annotators on 12 blogs, belonging to the first part of [Blogoscopy] and selected according to a thematic criterion in correlation with the variety and the difficulty of the linguistic brands of the evaluation that they contained. The aim was to evaluate the relevance of the annotation scheme so that common rules of annotation could emerge. Regarding the objects, all the subordinated concepts are annotated even if they do not contain any evaluation (rule R3-1) and only the instances that are the object of an evaluation (rule R3-2). All the objects are annotated only once by page (rule R1-1).
 We compute the agreement upon concepts and associated concepts for 12 blogs.
Table 3 shows how to compute the agreement for the set of annotated concepts for one blog. For example, E identifies 3 concepts, none of them was identified by H, 1 of them was identified by M, and 2 of them by L and S. The column Avg is the arithmetic agreement by annotator. The overall average agreement on the concept of the post is the arithmetic mean of the five averages by annotator. In Table 4 , we give the average of the minimum, the maximum and the average of identified objects by blog; the inter-rater agreement for the objects and the positive and negative implicit phase of annotation shows that the annotators perfectly agree in distinguishing between the different categories of concepts and the range of Charaudeau X  X  evaluations. However, great differences exist between the annotators for the identification of concepts and evaluations. To improve the agreement between annotators for the identification task, we have decided to detail some exhaustiveness rules, to apply normalization on objects and evaluations, and to define rules for boundaries for both of them too. We also supply rules about how to link a concept to an evaluation.

The R3-1 exhaustiveness rule requires identifying every main and associated concept that occurs within the blog. To identify more accurately associate concepts, we recommend annotating hyponyms of the main concepts (e.g. &lt;CC id_c= X  X  X 1 X  X &gt; fruits secs/dried fruit &lt;/CC&gt;, &lt;CA cc= X  X  X 1 X  X &gt; raisins/grapes &lt;/CA&gt;).
Normalization on the object is necessary when a text contains a spelling variant, a derivational variant, or a synonymic variant of an object (R1-2). The concept and sitcom ) (Rule R2-1).

The identification of the boundaries of the object may be problematic in the case of a multi-word term: the maximal nominal phrase including embedding nominal phrases should be retained (Rule R2.2). On the contrary, a text span of evaluation contains only one evaluation: in the case of a conjunction of modalities, the evaluations should be distinguished (e.g. &lt;Appreciation type =  X  X  X IA X  X  forme= type =  X  X  X IA X  X  forme= X  X  X ette femme, Me  X  lissa Theuriau X  X &gt; ravissante &lt;/Apprecia-tion&gt;/ this brilliant and charming woman ; (Rule R2-3). Another boundary rule for the evaluations states that the subject personal pronouns should be included related concepts or instances that appear in the neighbourhood of the evaluation evaluation that is chosen (Rule R2-5). 6.3.2 Reinforcement phase of the annotation scheme The second phase of the annotation phase was simultaneously carried out by 3 annotators on 64 posts, belonging to the first part of [Blogoscopy]. The aim is to measure the improvement of the identification of the concepts and the evaluations thanks to the new normalization and boundary rules. Table 5 shows a slight improvement of the identification of concepts and evaluations and a moderate one for associate concepts and instances.

This second phase allowed us to refine the annotation principles for the evaluations. We introduced a new feature  X  X  X rony X  X  with a yes/no value (e.g. Ah bon ?/Really? &lt;Appreciation= X  X  X IA X  X  forme= X  X  X ico, Ce  X  cilia X  X  irony= X  X  X es X  X &gt; parce que Ce  X  cilia?/between Nico and Cecila? ) (Rule R1-3). We proposed a new boundary rule in order to include the exclamatory forms of the appreciation (Rule R2-6). 6.3.3 Increase of volume phase The annotation was made by a single annotator on 124 blogs belonging to the second and the third parts of [Blogoscopy]. When the annotator faced a problem, it was the object of the discussion with the 4 other linguists that were involved in the preceding phases. The preceding phases emphasize the difficulties in obtaining inter-agreement annotators for the concept identification although several rules were [Blogoscopy], we changed the annotation procedure. Rather than identifying concepts for each post, the annotator proceeds first by reading all posts and comments for each subject in order to identify the recurring concepts across the posts and to adopt a hierarchy of subordinated concepts. For example, 10 posts about the future law of autonomy of French Universities were collected. In this particular case, the following were annotated as concepts: C1: loi sur l X  X utonomie concept), C2 gouvernement/government ,C3 universite  X  /university (hyponymic relation of C1), C4 mouvement/movement (hyponymic relation of C1), C5 bill (hyponymic relation of C1), etc. Identifying several main concepts that appear in different posts eases the selection of subordinated concepts. For C1, the subordinated concepts (ACs) are autonomie de  X  mocratique/democratic autonomy , for C2, the ACs are de  X  mocratie/democracy , for C3 the ACs are pre  X  sident de l X  X niversite  X  /a university dean, personnels exte  X  rieurs/outside personnel personnels/ students, droits d X  X nscription/registration fees , etc.

Table 6 summarizes the revision of the coding scheme following the two-fold evaluations: for each phase, the number of raters, the number of posts, the part of the [Blogoscopy] corpus (see Sect. 5.2 ), and the rule numbers that have been applied (see Sects. 6.1 , 6.2 ). Most of rules have been defined during Phase 1 and applied during the following phases. The evaluation that occurs after Phase 2 shows that only a few new rules could be added to improve the coding scheme. The enlargement of data obtained by clustering the blogs by subject appears to be the right solution to facilitate the identification of the concepts. 7 Statistics and results Six months of full-time annotating were necessary to annotate 200 posts and 612 comments which make up [Blogoscopy]. It contains at the moment 83,500 words without the punctuation, which represent 3,661 sentences. We propose a synthesis with numbers of all the various annotations made.

Figure 1 represents the quantity of concepts and instances annotated by subcategory. All in all, 5,666 concepts and 1,210 instances were tagged. In particular, this figure indicates that among the concepts, the AC are the most represented with 4,322 annotated occurrences, which is not surprising, as one CC is connected to 4.3 AC on average, with one post having between 2 and 4 CC. Also, they are the most numerous associated instances with 1,161 annotations against only 49 for the non-associated instances.

Figure 2 represents the distribution of 4,909 evaluation annotations according to the five categories. This figure indicates a predominance of the Appreciation (4,129 annotations), far in front of the Agreement/Discord (349 annotations), the Opinion (270 annotations), the Judgment (143 annotations) and the Acceptance/Refusal (18 annotations). As the [Bloscoscopy] posts were the most popular of the OverBlog exchange about what they do or do not like (presence of positive or negative orientation), and that the bloggers whatever the opinion they hold about an object, express it in a consensual way in order to attract a large public (predominance of appreciation). 8 Related works: discussion To our knowledge, the only work on manual annotation of opinions similar to [Blogoscopy] is the one accomplished by Wiebe and her colleagues for English: the MPQA opinion annotated corpus (Wiebe et al. 2006 ; Banea et al. 2008 ). We present below a summary of this work, then a comparison in terms of likeness and dissimilarity, establishing the possible footbridges between both approaches and justifying differences. 8.1 MPQA opinion annotated corpus 8.1.1 The data The MPQA manually annotated corpus [MPQA] includes 10,657 sentences coming from 530 news articles written in English and published between June 2001 and May 2002. Articles come from 187 different newspapers, they even come from different countries. ([MPQA) 7 is copyrighted under MITRE corporation). This corpus was collected and annotated during the summer of 2002. 8.1.2 The methodology and annotating scheme The annotation scheme concerns the level of the word and speech more than at sentence or document level. The notions of opinion, emotion, feeling, and evaluation are considered as points of view and are grouped under the same category (private state) (Quirk et al. 1985 ; Banfield 1982 ). A point of view is a fact which is not based on objective observations or checks.
 They describe three types of points of view: explicit lies of private states (e.g. the US fears a spill -over, said Xirao -Nima ), speech events expressing private states (e.g.  X  X  the report is full of absurdities  X  X , said Xirao-Nima), or expressive subjective elements (e.g. the report is full of absurdities ). The expression of a point of view comes from the identification of the source (what is the nature of the opinion X  evaluation emitted?), of the target (what concerns the expression of the point of view?), and other properties such as the intensity, the importance, the type of attitude of the emitted point of view. So, the element frame of [MPQA] is (Wiebe et al. 2006 , p. 170): 1. &lt;text anchor&gt;: sequence/occurrence of text; 2. &lt;source&gt;: people or entities who/ which express the  X  X  X oint of view X  X ; 3. &lt;target&gt;: entity which is concerned by the  X  X  X oint of view X  X : in fact, only the 4. &lt;properties&gt;
The expressions of the points of view were annotated by five annotators. They did not have any instructions for the annotation: no information on types of words to be annotated (both from the point of view of the parts of speech and grammatical categories), and on the quantity of words to be tagged. As a result, many types of constituents were raised, including pragmatic phenomena such as irony, sarcasm and metaphoric techniques. 8.2 Comparison between the two annotation schemes Similarities and dissimilarity concerning both works are mainly on the corpus, the methodology of annotation and the annotation itself. 8.2.1 Similarities The aim of both works is identical: to describe and to collect the different ways of expressing opinions in a language across the study of an annotated corpus and to propose a scheme of annotation which offers good granularity of the linguistic properties of expressing opinions.

From this point of view, both approaches of the annotation of opinion in context share the following linguistic choices:  X  not to take into account grammatical categories a priori ;  X  to adopt a positive and negative orientation of the evaluation expressions;  X  to differentiate forms of explicit and implicit expression of evaluations;  X  to qualify the evaluation with ironic or sarcastic 8 features when metaphoric  X  the size of the corpus.

In order to do that, both schemes of annotation are based on a grammar of the expressions of evaluations: (Quirk et al. 1985 ) for the English language and (Charaudeau 1992 ) for the French language. Both corpora could be seen as small with regards to those used for language model learning: 530 news articles for [MPQA] and 200 blogs for [Blogoscopy]. This sparsity of the data could be explained partly by the linguistic expertise that is required for such discourse annotation including the training to purchase accurate annotation. However, the annotated data allow us to identify for each language a core of opinion expressions and patterns. We believe that new expressions of opinion/evaluation will use such patterns with the single substitution of fashion evaluation words. 8.2.2 Dissimilarity Based on two different linguistic theories, the two types of annotations differ fundamentally with regards to the element frame, and for the annotation of intensity and of polarity.
 Element frame In [MPQA], the element frame always includes the source of the expressive phrase. In [Blogoscopy], the source is always the writer of the blog and there is no need to identify it.
 Intensity In [MPQA], intensity is annotated according to four levels (low, medium, high, extreme), and further additional intensity cases could be introduced if necessary. In [Blogoscopy], intensity is not annotated. We do consider it to be too dependent on the nature of the evaluation. Intensity should be calculated a posteriori thanks to grammar rules taking into account at least the whole document. For example, an explicit evaluation including a first person pronoun and an adverb would score as extremely intense (e.g. I find this painting really horrible). Polarity In [MPQA], polarity is annotated independently of the evaluation scheme with four values: positive, negative, both, neither. As a result, 69% of the polarities were tagged  X  X  X either X  X . Wiebe and her colleague conclude that the polarity regarding its purpose. At the same time, results show that for the 31% remaining, there were no difficulties in identifying the polarity of the point of view, positive versus negative, as only 1% of annotations are tagged  X  X  X oth X  X . In [Blogoscopy], the polarity is part of Charaudeau X  X  theory: positive and negative polarities are distinct categories of evaluation. We demonstrate that the identification of Chareaudeau X  X  categories of evaluation was done with a perfect agreement. 9 Conclusion This article describes the manual annotation of the opinions-evaluation in a corpus of blogs, the Blogoscopy corpus [Blogoscopy]. Three principles govern the annotation of the corpus: theoretical, practical and methodological.

From a theoretical point of view, opinion is grounded in a linguistic theory, and evaluation can be noticed across the modalities of the Speaker X  X  act. From this theoretical point of view, Charaudeau describes twelve Speaker X  X  modalities, among which five denote evaluation: opinion, acceptation-refusal, agreement-disagree-ment, judgment, and evaluation. These five modalities are themselves split into twenty subcategories. From a practical point of view, evaluation concerns objects of two types: concept and instance. A concept is a nominal phrase; an instance of a concept is generally a proper name. We distinguish between objects that are in or out of the semantic field of the blog. The concepts that belong to the semantic field are divided between main and associated concepts. An evaluation is always linked to a concept. The concepts of the semantic field of the blog are annotated even if they do not receive an evaluation. By annotating all the evaluations and all the concepts, we have anticipated further opinion works: the building of a French evaluation lexicon, the evaluation of targeting opinion tasks. From a methodological point of view, [Blogoscopy] was built up from the OverBlog platform in spring 2007, encoded manually following different types of annotating rules and worked out in three successive phases in order to allow us to improve the inter-annotator agreement rate.
