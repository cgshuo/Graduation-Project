 In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly. Researchers are increasingly interested in investigating network structure features and social patterns residing in social networks, including community discovery, link prediction, anomaly detection, trend prediction, etc. [Newman 2003]. Even though detection of these fea-tures and patterns is of great interest, understanding their functions in broader appli-cations remains relatively limited.

Encountering a real application about social networks, it is important to select and study the corresponding network structure features and social patterns of the same scale. For example, given a macro-level problem like information maximization, the macro-level structure features such as community are worth great consideration [Wu 2008], given a micro-level problem like user profiling, the micro-level structure features such as neighborhoods are important [Mislove et al. 2010]. Furthermore, network structure features and social patterns in different scales are highly correlated to each other. For example, Yin et al. [2010a, 2010b] suggest that both macro-level network structure and micro-level node attribute information could be leveraged together on the tasks of link prediction and node attribute inference. Not only are the macro-level communities often used to detect micro-level links [Zheleva and Getoor 2009], but the micro-level patterns like user moods can also be used to identify influential users of the whole network [Quercia et al. 2011].

In this special issue, we have accepted six articles that carefully link the scale of social features to the corresponding functions. Each accepted article has gone through two to three rounds of reviewing, each round with three referees. The contents of this special issue cover decreasing the granularity of network structure features for solving micro-level problems like user interest profiling and link sign prediction or improving the efficiency of time-consuming information maximization, moving beyond network clusters themselves by studying their overlap regions, which paves a contradictive way against conventional community detection, and leveraging both macro-level network structure features and micro-level node attributes for link prediction and community detection. Interestingly, all of the articles consider the selection of features in right scale as crucial to applications.

A macro-level feature like network structure has been widely utilized in various data mining tasks. However, the granularity of global network structure is too coarse to calibrate the accuracy of data mining. In this special issue, there are two articles focusing on the study of designing local network structure features to boost the effec-tiveness of micro-level data mining problems, that is, user interest profiling and link sign prediction.
 The article  X  X nfer User Interests via Link Structure Regularization X  by Jinpeng Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yulan He, and Xiaoming Li proposes that the network structure feature should be task-dependent. The authors suggest that graph regularization on network structure should be based on the particular task of which node similarities are evaluated in a local link structure, and they verify this assumption by learning user interest for a set of predefined topics based on a retweet network in Twitter. The article  X  X luster-Based Collaborative Filtering for Sign Prediction in Social Networks with Positive and Negative Links X  by Amin Javari and Mahdi Jalili proposes that the network structure should be clustered into a number of clusters, where inner-cluster links are more positively correlated and inter-cluster links are more negatively correlated. With these clusters, the task of predicting sign of the links (friendship or enmity, trust, or distrust) is able to better tap into a cluster X  X  local network structure as well as connections between clusters. Their results are tested on Wikipedia, Slashdot, and Epinions datasets.

Rather than boosting data mining effectiveness, reducing the granularity of network structure can also potentially improve the efficiency for those time-consuming data mining tasks. The article  X  X IM: Community-Based Influence Maximization in Social Networks X  by Yi-Cheng Chen, Wen-Yuan Zhu, Wen-Chih Peng, Wang-Chien Lee, and Suh-Yin Lee proves that a first-pass clustering on the entire network can largely improve the efficiency of selecting the number of seeds to maximize information spreads in a large-scale social network. Results evaluated on the NETHep network and the Facebook network indicate the efficiency and scalability of their approach, with almost no compromise in effectiveness.

Beyond the network clusters themselves, the overlap part of local network clusters (communities) has been ignored for a long time because people often trust the con-ventional wisdom that community overlaps are more sparsely connected than the nonoverlapping parts themselves. The article  X  X tructure and Overlaps of Ground-Truth Communities in Networks X  by Jaewon Yang and Jure Leskovec observes the surprising phenomena that the overlaps of communities are more densely connected than the nonoverlapping parts of communities in six large social, collaboration, and information networks including LiveJournal blogging Community, Friendster online network, Orkut social network, Amazon product copurchasing Network, DBLP, and IMDB, where nodes explicitly state their ground-truth community memberships. Their novel observation and the corresponding Community-Affiliation Graph Model provide a new way to drill down the network structure feature for downstream applications. Most existing models confuse overlaps as separate communities.

Not only can features in different scales boost each other, but they can also be leveraged together to better analyze user behaviors in social networks. For example, micro-level sentiment-based features have been found to be useful in identifying influ-ential users at the macro level [Zhao et al. 2014]. However, the combination strategy of features at various granularity levels on learning remains unclear. The article  X  X oint Link Prediction and Attribute Inference Using a Social-Attribute Network X  by Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Ameet Talwalkar, Lester Mackey, Ling Huang, Eui Chul Richard Shin, Emil Stefanov, Elaine (Runting) Shi, and Dawn Song discloses that link predic-tion accuracy can be further improved by first inferring missing attributes for nodes in a social network. They experimented with several leading supervised and unsuper-vised link prediction algorithms using a large-scale Google + dataset (which they made publicly available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/  X  stevgong/gplus.html) to demonstrate their findings. The article  X  X escription-Driven Community Detection X  by Simon Pool, Francesco Bonchi, and Matthijs Van Leeuwen demonstrates that, starting from any given description or seed set of nodes, the authors are able to build well-described co-hesive clusters (communities) in large online social networks including DELICIOUS, FLICKR, and LASTFM by leveraging the node attributes to a model network struc-ture. These two articles collectively validate that developing methods that can use, when available, any domain-specific fine-grained features (e.g., node attributes, user information) allows them to be combined synergistically to help challenges in analyzing large-scale complex online social interactions.

Putting together this special issue has been a team effort, inspired by the success of the 6th KDD Workshop on Social Network Mining and Analysis. First, we are in debt to all of the authors who submitted their work to the special issue. Second, we would like to thank all the referees for their expertise and dedication in providing invaluable comments and suggestions. Finally, we are grateful to Editor-in-Chief, Qiang Yang, for his encouragement and the editorial officer, Weike Pan, for his excellent support, which made this special issue possible.
