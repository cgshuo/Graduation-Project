 JungWon Yoon * 1. Introduction
Soergel (1995) expressed that a good thesaurus provides searchers and indexers with a  X  X  X emantic road map X  (p. 369). By consulting a thesaurus, indexers can identify index terms that surrogate a document during the information-search process and searchers can uncover and select search terms that properly represent their information needs. In other words, a the-saurus serves as a structured semantic space for improving information retrieval by guiding searchers as well as indexers.
Because of their advantages in information retrieval, thesauri have been used for a diversity of document formats. However, different formats of documents each have their own unique features that influence the ways users search for information as well as the issues which should be considered during the indexing process. Therefore, if the unique features of different for-mats of documents are taken into account when developing thesauri, their advantages X  X uch as promoting indexing consis-tency and supporting comprehensive search capabilities (Lancaster, 1986 ) X  X an be greater realized through enhanced retrieval. In the field of library and information science, researchers have spent much time exploring the features of image documents in conceptual and experimental ways with the purpose of developing an image-retrieval mechanism that can fulfill users X  needs. For example, an image document does not itself contain any verbal cues, and a single image can convey a variety of messages and meanings depending on the viewer, so consistency has been recognized as a relatively challenging issue in image indexing (J X rgensen, 2003 ). It has also been asserted that, because a user can browse many more image doc-uments in a smaller amount of time than they can text documents, browsability should be considered as a significant ele-ment in designing image-retrieval applications (Shatford, 1994 ). However, special consideration of these features has rarely been applied in thesaurus construction. This study argues that, if the unique features of image documents can be taken into account in designing a thesaurus for image documents, the resulting product is a better  X  X  X emantic road map X  for image searchers and indexers.
 Traditionally, the task of thesaurus construction has largely lain with domain specialists and information professionals.
Although experimental studies have shown how effective it is to utilize thesauri in information retrieval, as Bates (1998) aptly noted, sometimes expert knowledge seems to increase the gaps between index terms and the search terms that inex-perienced users are most likely to employ. Several other researchers have joined Bates in advocating the need for integrating request-oriented (or user-oriented) indexing in thesaurus development (Graham, 1999; J X rgensen, 2004; Soergel, 1985 ). Fol-lowing the lead of these researchers, this study explores the question that Bates (1998) raised:  X  X  X ow can we produce a sys-tem whose front-end feels natural to and compatible with the search? X  (p. 1188).

This study considers the potential applications of social tagging in developing a user-oriented and non-domain-specific thesaurus. Research on social tagging has indicated that users tend to assign tags not only for their own individual uses but also with the intention of helping other users find these same resources (Golder &amp; Huberman, 2006 ). The idea that social tagging represents how users organize and describe resources for their own use and that of others X  encourages researchers to make use of user-supplied tags in developing controlled vocabulary systems that include user-friendly language ( Furnas et al., 2006; Kroski, 2005; Merholz, 2004 ). Whereas most current studies have largely focused on the statistical analysis of tags to develop an automated system for generating controlled vocabulary (Vo X , 2007 ), this study investigates the seman-tic space represented in user-supplied tags in terms of two components of a thesaurus: Selected concepts and their semantic relations.

Within that context, this study aims to examine how a semantic space extracted from user-supplied tags reflects the fea-tures of image documents and to suggest how these findings can be applied in designing a user-centered thesaurus for image collections. In particular, the following specific questions are addressed: 2. Literature review 2.1. Image features and thesaurus structure
A thesaurus is a tool that facilitates subject access by presenting a semantic guideline. Subject access has long been con-sidered a critical but problematic area for most formats of information objects. In the case of image documents, this problem is compounded by the fact that certain inherent features of an image make subject representation more difficult. One of the main obstacles for subject access appears during the process of translating visual stimuli or visual needs into verbal surro-gates such as image descriptions or search terms. As it can be inferred from the old adage,  X  X  X  picture is worth a thousand words, X  a single image includes a diversity of messages and can deliver different messages to each viewer. However, verbal representation has a limitation in conveying those layered messages contained in an image document. A study by J X rgensen (2003) found that, out of 58 participants who were asked to describe a set of images for the purpose of future retrieval, an average of 30 unique descriptors were assigned to each image. In addition to J X rgensen, studies by O X  X onnor, O X  X onnor, and
Abbas (1999) and Greisdorf and O X  X onnor (2002) experimentally demonstrated that a diversity of descriptors is used for describing a single image. In addition to image descriptions, different users also employed various search terms for finding an image under the same task. Yoon (2006) found that under a given task X  X ocating an image for a Web site promoting peaceful resolution of international conflict X 36 unique search terms, such as dove, olive branch, dead soldiers, handshake, peace, harmony, and so on, were employed by 21 participants. As shown by these studies, a diversity of verbal expressions is related to heterogeneous users X  interpretations of a single image. Thus, as Enser, Sandom, Hare, and Lewis (2007) noted,  X  X  X he retrieval utility of any given image is inherently unpredictable and the appropriate exhaustivity and specificity of the index-ing is correspondingly indeterminate X  (p. 468). This study operates under the premise that a thesaurus is a tool that can in-crease retrieval efficacy by controlling the versatility of verbal representations and by guiding semantic structure of layered messages embedded in image documents. 1 This section will discuss some features of image documents that should be con-sidered when constructing a thesaurus for image documents.

A thesaurus is composed of selected concepts and their semantic relations (Hj X rland, 2007 ). Therefore, the main decisions to be made when constructing a thesaurus are which concepts or terms should be included and how relations among se-lected concepts are identified. Regarding a choice of concepts to be included in a thesaurus, Svenonius (2003) explained three approaches: (a) literary warrant, (b) use warrant, and (c) scholarly usage. Although literary warrant is the principle that is used most dominantly in thesaurus construction, for an image document, which possesses no inherent verbal cues, it is the-oretically next to impossible to extract terms from the document itself. Thus, scholarly usage, in which experts are involved in term selection, has been one of the main approaches in the development of thesauri for image documents. Although this approach relies on expert knowledge and opinions, a major drawback is that an expert or a small group of experts often use different language than inexperienced users. Put simply, because an image can be interpreted in various ways depending on the perceptions of viewer, it is unrealistic to expect that several experts can select a comprehensive set of terms and concepts that are useful for general users. In fact, existing thesauri for image collections, such as ICONCLASS, the Arts and Architect
Thesaurus (AAT), and the Library of Congress Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (LCTGM), have been criticized because the se-lected concepts are too professional and specialized to apply to a general image-search process (J X rgensen, 2004 ). Some the-sauri for commercial image-retrieval systems, such as Corbis or GettyImage, employ more user-friendly terms, but their thesauri are not fully open to the public and their effectiveness has not been sufficiently studied ( J X rgensen, 2003 ). The use-warrant approach, which incorporates users X  language, has been advocated by many researchers. For identifying com-monly used terms, Soergel (1985) suggested collecting the concepts to be included in a thesaurus from actual and expected search requests, while J X rgensen (2004) proposed the use of user-provided descriptions for selecting concepts for an image thesaurus. Following on the advent of online social tagging, this study attempts to utilize user-supplied tags for implement-ing the use-warrant approach. Detailed discussions on social tagging are included in Section 2.2.

In the user-oriented approach, common usage of user-supplied terms can be the primary criteria for selecting concepts for inclusion. However, some experts have voiced concerns that terms selected entirely on the basis of users X  common usage do not provide sufficient guidelines for improving recall and precision (Svenonius, 2003 ). In other words, although com-monly used terms have high probability to support a majority of the user group, it would also be desirable to consider the features of semantic structure of pictorial messages rather than rely entirely on term occurrence. By taking into account semantic structure, it would be possible to develop a thesaurus that integrates the necessary components for increased recall and precision with the concepts dominantly adopted by general users. In an effort to derive a structured order from the unpredictable and unlimited jumble of meanings and messages that can be found within a single image, researchers have identified several attributes (or categories of meanings) of an image by analyzing image documents along with user-supplied image descriptors or query terms. Those researchers attempted to examine important categories (or attributes) in interpret-ing and retrieving images and their natures that may influence image retrieval. Different terminologies and different struc-tures have been articulated by each researcher, but three levels of meanings have been commonly identified by analyzing users X  queries: (1) low-level features; (2) denotative or objective meanings; and (3) connotative, symbolic, or emotional meanings ( Eakins &amp; Graham, 1999; Greisdorf &amp; O X  X onnor, 2002 ). Also, Shatford (1986) proposed a faceted classification scheme for the subject analysis of an image by applying Who, What, When and Where facets into the three categories of pictorial meanings: Generic Of , Specific Of , and Abou t. This study will examine user-supplied tags based on Shatford X  X  faceted classification structure, which has been referred to in many related studies (see Section 3.1).

The inherent versatility of verbally expressed concepts can also be explored by applying basic-level theory. Rosch et al. (1976) theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that all concepts can be categorized into one of three levels: The superordinate level, the basic level, or the subordinate level. For example, for the same object (or an image of the object), a person can say,  X  X  X  saw an animal , X   X  X  X  saw a dog , X  or  X  X  X  saw a Chihuahua . X  However, although all three terms are possible, most people tend to default to the basic-level concept (dog) rather than the superordinate (animal) or subordinate (Chihua-hua) concept. To explain this behavior, Rosch et al. (1976) theorized that it is because basic-level terms are generally the most useful and informative. It has been consistently demonstrated that basic-level concepts are directly related to general interpretation of an object. It also has been found that children learn basic-level terms first and that adults identify and pro-cess those terms most easily (Rosch et al., 1976 ). Although it has been found that people having specialized backgrounds or knowledge may consider terms at a different level (Golder &amp; Huberman, 2006 ), it will be worthwhile to examine whether general users tend to employ basic-level terminology in interpreting non-domain-specific images. As Bates (1998) men-tioned, if it is found that there is a set of basic-level terms that are dominantly used and commonly shared by general users, that should be the level of specificity of concepts to be included in a thesaurus.

In addition to selecting concepts for inclusion, another important element of thesaurus construction is the identification of semanticrelationshipsamongselectedconcepts.Traditionally,thesaurienhancerecallandprecisionbyidentifyingthreetypes of semantic relations: equivalent, hierarchical,and associative. Since a thesaurus is not an independent tool but a tool intended to work in conjunction with other information-retrieval components, thesaurus-construction standards X  X uch as ANSI,
UNESCO, 3 BSI, 4 etc. X  X ecommend defining semantic relations by reflecting search context and retrieval effectiveness ( Clarke, 2001). However, when the existing image-specific thesauri are considered, there seems to be a discrepancy between logically organized concepts and the way that users utilize those relations during the image-search process. For example, the LC The-saurus for Graphic Material lists  X  X oves X  as a Narrower Term of  X  X irds ? Pigeons X  and identifies  X  X ovecotes X  as a Related Term of  X  X ove. X  However, for a user who tried a query  X  X ove X  for finding a peaceful image, images indexed under  X  X live branch, X   X  X ul-ticultural people, X  or  X  X eace X  can be more relevant than images of dovecotes or birds. As discussed before, an image document contains multiple levels of meaning and users searching for an image often have information needs involving more than one attribute. Therefore, thesauri that incorporate semantic relations extracted from the user X  X  perspective in addition to logically organized concepts within a hierarchical structure can be beneficial to users. Another image feature that supports the impor-tance of appropriate semantic relations is that it is practically next to impossible to assign for a comprehensive roster of index terms to satisfy the wide diversity of image users. Therefore, one way to improve exhaustivity is to enhance browsability using semantic relations. As some researchers (Cox, Miller, Omohundro, &amp; Yianilos, 1996; Fidel, 1997; Shatford, 1994 ) have insisted, it is important to index an image for displaying appropriate browsing sets, so that users can browse related sets of images that they could not get with their search queries. A thesaurus for image documents should not only help users to expand or revise their queries, but also facilitate browsing diverse sets of related images. 2.2. Social tagging
This study attempts to investigate a semantic space represented in user-supplied tags. Folksonomy, a social-tagging application that has become popular with the advent of Web 2.0, demonstrates a potential for user-oriented indexing. By assigning keywords, or  X  X ags, X  to the digital entities, users not only organize information for their own use, but also are able to share their organized collections with others. In other words, social tagging has become a new information-organization mechanism, providing access to various formats of digital resources, including images. One of the expected advantages of social tagging is that it has the potential to overcome, or at least decrease, the problem of information loss that occurs in traditional manual indexing. This is because, in folksonomies, the loss results from differing viewpoints of users and not from a single indexer X  X  discernment (Shirky, n.d. ). Also, users engaged with social tagging systems describe content using their own natural-language vocabulary, without referring to any formally structured taxonomy. Therefore, tagging systems may reveal the conceptual structure and terminologies of the current user community (Furnas et al., 2006 ). In addition, by offering opportunities to find related topics and users, tagging systems can increase the possibility of discovering unex-pected resources through browsing or serendipity (Kroski, 2005 ). These general advantages of social tagging demonstrate that user-supplied tags have a great potential in reflecting multiple levels of meaning of images with user-friendly index terms. In an attempt to harness the advantages of user-supplied tags, the Steve.Museum project integrated tags into its col-lection ( Bearman &amp; Trant, 2005; Trant, 2006 ).

Social tagging systems have been understood not as alternatives or successions of traditional indexing schemes but as a complementary approaches (Cambell, 2006; Guy &amp; Tonkin, 2006 ). In a sense, there have been lines of research that explore the potential of social tagging for developing controlled vocabulary systems. Spiteri (2007) evaluated tags on three folkson-omy sites (Del.icio.us, Furl, and Technorati) using the National Information Standards Organization (NISO)  X  X  Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies X . She found that user-supplied tags gen-erally correspond to the NISO guidelines except for inconsistency and ambiguity issues. Most other studies have focused on generating controlled vocabulary systems that speak the user X  X  language. Although it is somewhat ironic that manual tagging systems are manipulated by an automated data mining techniques, researchers in this line of study ( Bar-Ilan, Shoham, Idan,
Miller, &amp; Shachak, 2006; Heymann &amp; Garcia-Molina, 2006; Mika, 2005 ) have attempted to automatically extract concepts and their relations from user-supplied tags by adopting data mining and statistical algorithms ( Vo X , 2007 ). However, as
Van Rijsbergen (1979), Van Rijsbergen (1986) stated, in addition to simply making use of statistical word distribution, it is significant to understand semantics in enhancing information retrieval effectiveness. In a sense, this study conceptually examines features of semantic spaces that appear in user-supplied tags for image collection. 3. Research design 3.1. Data set
In order to examine a structure of semantic space expressed through user-supplied tags, this study collected a data set from the image-sharing Web site Flickr (www.flickr.com), which allows users to upload their photos with tags and to make those photos publicly viewable and searchable. Compared with other social tagging Web sites, in which users assign tags for digital resources created by others, Flickr users assign tags for their own photos. it can be easily observed from the Flickr image collection that the Web site is host to a wide diversity of user groups.
Characteristics of tags may differ depending on users X  cultural backgrounds; users X  special-interest groups (such as news photo groups, professional photography groups, groups taking photos of specific subjects, etc.); and users X  demographic features.
Although further exploration of these variations might make for an interesting and worthwhile analysis, this study left that to-pic for the future and focused instead on a semantic space for general users and non-domain-specific images. Flickr, launched in 2004, is a relatively new Web site; therefore, data were collected from two different time periods in order to examine if different 4499 photos uploaded between September and October of 2004 and the second set (hereafter referred as  X  X ew X ) was obtained from 4499 photos uploaded in May 2007. The data sets were collected using an Application Programming Interface (API),  X  X lickr.photos.search, X  provided by Flickr. Among the several arguments defined in the flickr.photos.search, the author used the  X  X ort X  argument to get  X  X ld X  and  X  X ew X  data. The  X  X ate-posted-asc X  and  X  X ate-posted-desc X  values were sent to the  X  X ort X  argu-ment, and the API returned the maximum number of 4499 photos and their tags and related information (photo id, owner id, owner name, title, licenseinformation, etc.) for each  X  X ate-posted-asc X  and  X  X ate-posted-desc X  value. The two data sets, each con-sisting of4499 photos and their tags, are denoted as  X  X ld X  and  X  X ew X , respectively. Table 1 provides a general summary of the two data sets.

As shown in Table 1 , the old and new data sets consisted of the same number of photos, but the difference in the number of users who uploaded those photos reflects an increase in the Flickr user population. There also were differences in the number of tags per photo. The average number of tags per photo was 4.46 in the old data set and 3.04 in the new data set. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the number of tags per photo. In the old data set, 201 photos had no tags, but the majority of photos had between one and seven tags; in the new data set, more than 1400 photos had no tags. In general, compared with the old data set, the new had a smaller number of tags per photo. In spite of the differences in the number of tags, there was not a big difference in the number of unique tags 6 between the two data sets; approximately 2400 unique tags were found in each data set. Among the unique tags, 85 X 87% of unique tags were each provided by a single user and only 13 X 15% of tags were shared by two or more users. The unique tags provided by two or more users accounted for 89 X 84% of total tag occur-rences, respectively. These results demonstrate that in both cases, a few tags were used by many users with high frequency, while many tags were used by a single user with low frequency ( Fig. 2). 3.2. Data analysis
As demonstrated above, approximately 13 X 15% of unique tags which were provided by two or more users accounted for 85 X 90% of total tag occurrences. Approximately 85% of unique tags were adopted by singer users, creating the potential for implementation of a variety of entry points for users as asserted by Bates (1986) . However, when considering that the pur-pose of this study is to explore how user-supplied tags can be applied to designing a thesaurus, the tags provided by a single user might be too subjective, personalized or contain misspelled tags. Therefore, this study analyzed tags used by two or more users.

The number of unique tags used for the old data set was 372, and that for the new data set was 321. Although two anal-yses were performed to see if there were different features between the old and new data sets, in order to answer the five research questions, old and new data sets were analyzed as a whole. Therefore, the old and new data sets were combined into one term, in order to focus on concepts and their semantic relations, plural/singular terms, spelling variants, and exact synonyms (e.g., bicycles and bike). As a result, 535 unique tags were used in investigating the research questions.
As indicated in the research questions, Flickr tags were analyzed in terms of image attributes and level of term specificity and compared with an existing thesaurus. Two of the most popular thesauri for image documents are the Library of Congress Thesaurus of Graphic Materials (LCTGM or TGM) and the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). Because the main focus of TGM is historical photographs, it does not include sufficient contemporary terminology. Nevertheless, compared with the AAT, which is a highly specialized thesaurus, the TGM is considered more suitable for general collection ( J X rgensen, 2003;
J X rgensen, 2004 ). In a sense, this study selected the TGM for comparing concepts and semantic relations between an existing thesaurus and Flickr tags.

Researchers in various disciplines have categorized messages included in an image for uncovering their structures and features ( Panofsky, 1962; Barthes, 1964/1977; Markey, 1988 ). Table 2 shows categories used in this study. It was developed based on the categorization by Shatford (1986) and revised by adopting other researchers X  user-query analysis results (Choi &amp; Rasmussen, 2003; Greisdorf &amp; O X  X onnor, 2002 ). In this study, categories of tags were coded by a trained graduate student from the School of Library and Information Science at the University of South Florida. After being coded, the tags were first sorted by category and then alphabetical order. The author reviewed the coding, and then discussed and corrected the anom-alous codes (error rate &lt;.01%) with the coder. In order to check the reliability of coding, another trained graduate student from the same school performed a coding check on 10% of the tags. The percentage of inter-coder agreement was 92%.
This study also examined the level of specificity of user-supplied tags by applying the basic-level theory. Since most re-search on basic-level theory has explored concrete objects and colors, this study also analyzed tags in the Generic and Color categories. Although Rosch and her colleagues demonstrated features of superordinate, basic, and subordinate categories through their empirical studies (Rosch et al., 1976 ), there are no established criteria that can obviously distinguish the three categories. Therefore, for categorizing collected tags into the superordinate, basic, or subordinate level, this study made use of the hierarchies that appear in the TGM by following three steps: First, nine taxonomies used in Rosch et al. X  X  (1976) empir-ical study were investigated to see how these taxonomies are designated in the TGM hierarchy. As can be seen in Fig. 3 ,it appeared inappropriate to determine superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels based on absolute depths of the TGM hier-archies. Therefore, instead of the depth of concepts, each concept was examined in relation to its higher-and lower-level concepts. For example, in case of a hierarchical structure of  X  X bject ? Furnishings ? Furniture ? Table ? Dining tables X   X  X b-ject, X   X  X urnishings X  and  X  X urniture X  are classified as superordinate and  X  X able X  and  X  X ining tables X  are basic and subordinate lev-els, respectively. In the case of an  X  X bject ? Food ? Fruit ? Apple X  hierarchy, the lowest-level word,  X  X pple X , obviously satisfies features of the basic level, the upper three concepts belong to superordinate level, and this hierarchy does not in-clude a subordinate level. The examples of  X  X ammer, X   X  X aws X  and  X  X rosscut saws X  also shows that depth of TGM hierarchy cannot be an absolute criterion for deciding basic-level categories, because two basic-level terms,  X  X ammer X  and  X  X aws, X  be-long to two different levels in the TGM and a subordinate term  X  X rosscut saws X  is placed at the same level with  X  X ammer X  in the TGM. In addition, some top-level concepts, though they were not included in the nine taxonomies, obviously satisfy fea-tures of basic-level concepts. For example, the TGM places  X  X eeth X  and  X  X ongues X  at the top-most level, but these two concepts have basic-level features rather than superordinate features. In short, the TGM hierarchy provides basic hierarchies, but ba-sic-level categorizations should be decided in relation to higher-and lower-level concepts. Second, based on the rough guidelines examined in the previous step, other tags not included in the nine taxonomies but found in the TGM were cate-gorized into one of three levels. Third, tags not included in the TGM were also categorized in a consistent way. Regarding basic-level colors, the analysis process was more straightforward because there is an established set of basic colors. Details will be discussed in Section 4.1. Again, the level of specificity was coded by the trained student who participated as a coder for categorical analysis, and a coding check was performed by the second trained student. The percentage of inter-coder agreement was 89%. 4. Findings 4.1. Features of concepts expressed in user-supplied tags 4.1.1. RQ1: What categories of concepts are most frequently represented in tags?
Figs. 4 and 5 show percentages of tag occurrences and the number of unique tags in terms of categories. Tags in the Gen-eric category (G) were most frequently used and those in the Specific category (S) were next. When considering subcatego-ries, tags in the Kind of thing (G1-3) and Specific location (S3) categories were frequently used. Tags in the Abstract, Color, and Flickr-specific categories occurred less than 10%. From Figs. 4 and 5 , it can be observed that percentages of tag occur-rence and percentages of unique tags were not proportional. For example, compared with the Generic category, individual tags in the Specific category had a high frequency on average. Individual tags in the Color category also showed a higher fre-quency than other categories. Fig. 6 shows the average individual tag occurrence of each category. Tags related to location, such the Abstract location (A3), the Generic location (G3), and the Specific location (S3), generally had a high frequency per tag, and this tendency can be explained as a unique feature of Flickr, where users upload travel/vacation photos. The Kind of event/action (G2) and the Specific time (S4) categories also had a high frequency per tag because of birthday photos, wedding photos, photos taken in a particular year, and so on. We also analyzed whether there are differences in category distribution of unique tags between the old data set and the new data set. As shown in Fig. 7 , it appears that there is no significant dif-ference between the two data sets. In the majority of the categories, compared with the old data set, the new set had a smal-ler number of unique tags. An exception is the Flickr  X  X elated category X , because as Flickr has become more popular, the Flickr user community has developed their own terms, such as geotag, zonetag, etc. 4.1.2. RQ2: What is the level of specificity of tags that are frequently used?
This study analyzed the level of specificity of tags that belong to Color and Generic categories. It seems reasonable that proper nouns in the Specific category cannot be classified into superordinate, basic or subordinate levels. Regarding the Abstract category, there have been studies on identifying basic levels for emotions (Fehr &amp; Russell, 1984; Shaver, Schwartz,
Kirson, &amp; O X  X onnor, 1987 ). Although there is agreement that there are basic levels of terms for emotions, there are differ-ences in defining fundamental emotions. In addition, this study included in the Abstract category not only emotions, but also general feeling/atmosphere (cold, beautiful); symbolic meanings (fuzzy, vintage, classic); and mythical or fictitious beings (dragon), however there are no studies examining basic levels for these subcategories. Therefore, RQ2 focused on the Color and Generic categories.

Regarding basic color names, it has been reported that there is no language that contains more than 11 basic color names: black, white, grey, red, yellow, green, blue, pink, orange, brown, and purple (Berlin &amp; Kay, 1969 ). The analysis showed that, except for two terms X  X  X olor X  and  X  X lack and White X  X  X ll tags classified as Color were basic-level terms. In other words, every tag that was used for expressing color belonged to the basic category. Because there are some terms for which secondary meanings are used in representing color, tags that could be used to express color were identified (brick, buttercup, cham-pagne, ivy, mustard, orchid, rose, forest, and sea) and examined for each image containing these tags to see if they were used to represent a color or the object itself. It appeared that only one term ( orchid ) was used for representing color and when reviewing other photos taken by the same author, it was inferred that he has an artistic and professional background. In con-clusion, it was found that the majority of Flickr users adopted basic color names for expressing the color of an image.
For the Generic category, on average, 80.47% of tags were basic level, 5.92% of tags were superordinate, and 13.61% of tags were subordinate-level terms. These results were fairly consistent with the theory of basic level explored by Rosch et al. (1976) , as well as J X rgensen X  X  (2003) study that examined the level of image descriptions. In her study, an average of 76% of image descriptions were at the basic level, 13% were superordinate, and 11% were subordinate levels. As insisted by Bates (1998) and J X rgensen (2003) , the results of this study also support that an image-retrieval and indexing mechanism should focus on providing access to basic-level terms. The differences in the term specificity level between the old and new data sets were examined. The old and new data sets had similar distributions; basic terms were dominantly used (78.93% and 83.71% for old and new data sets), and superordinate (7.44% and 5.62%) and subordinate (13.64% and 10.67%) terms accounted for only small portions. 4.1.3. RQ3: To what extent are there similarities and differences between concepts appearing in user-supplied tags and those employed in existing controlled vocabularies?
Figs. 8 and 9 present percentages of tags that matched TGM terms. When matching rates were calculated, various words (e.g., dragon in Flickr and dragons in TGM, lazy in Flickr and laziness in TGM) were considered a match. About 75% of tags in the General (G) category were included in the TGM. More specifically, except for two subcategories X  X ind of thing (G1-3) and
Kind of action (G2-2) X  X erms in subcategories of the General category showed more than 80% matching rates. Many terms not included in the TGM were very recent terminology or computer/technology-related terms. Although Kind of thing (G1-3) had a lower matching rate, it was not because the TGM rarely includes terms in that subcategory, but rather because the subcategory includes the largest number of terms. This naturally leads to a lower matching rate. The mythical or fictitious being subcategory (A1) showed a 100% matching rate, but this is meaningless, because the subcategory included only one tag (dragon), which appeared in the TGM. In general, it was found that the TGM rarely includes terms that frequently appear in user-supplied tags from the Abstract, Specific, or Color categories. Some Emotion terms (A2) were included in the TGM, but in the Color category only  X  X olor X  was included. We also examined if there were differences between the old and new data sets. For the Abstract category, both the data sets showed 30% matching rates, but for the Generic category, the matching rates were 80% and 75% for the old and new data sets, respectively. 4.2. Features of relations among concepts expressed in user-supplied tags 4.2.1. RQ4: What categories are frequently used as related tags?
Flickr automatically generates 10 related tags for each tag. included in the 145 most popular Flickr tags (as of September 17, 2007) were selected and their related tags collected. The distribution of 110 tags in terms of category was: Abstract (4), Color (8), Generic (54), Specific (36), Flickr related tag (7), and
Part of Speech (1). Tags in four major categories out of six categories were analyzed. Fig. 10 presents the distribution of Flickr related tags by category. As one might expect, generic terms were the most frequent related tags in every category.
Features of related tags were investigated in detail. First of all, related tags for Abstract tags were mostly object names, with a few related emotions, specific names, and color names. For example, related tags for  X  X un X  are  X  X ids, X   X  X ummer, X   X  X ater, X  70% of related tags for Generic tags belonged to the Generic category, while Abstract, Specific and Color tags accounted approximately 10% each. For example, related tags for  X  X irthday X  are  X  X un, X   X  X appy, X   X  X arty, X   X  X ake, X   X  X andles, X  and so on; related generic terms as related tags, whereas Abstract and Color tags were rarely used as related tags. Three dominant types of rela-tions were found: (1) related geographic location (Australia X  X ydney, Melbourne; Barcelona X  X pain); (2) proper nouns rep-resenting that location (France X  X iffel tower, Barcelona X  X audi, Boston X  X edsox); and (3) general nouns representing the location (California X  X cean, beach, Chicago X  X kyline, Texas X  X lower, India X  X oman). Finally, a unique feature of Color tags was that they had other colors as related terms. For example,  X  X hite X  is a related term for  X  X lack X ,  X  X reen X  is for  X  X lue X ,  X  X reen X  and  X  X ellow X  are for  X  X ed, X  and so on. Also, objects having remarkably colorful impressions appeared as related terms. For example,  X  X ky X  and  X  X ater X  are related terms for  X  X lue, X   X  X ree X  is for  X  X reen, X   X  X lower X  is for  X  X ellow, X  and so on. Another charac-teristic was that most objects related to color terms are natural objects rather than artificial ones. 4.2.2. RQ5: To what extent are there similarities and differences between relations identified by a social tagging system and semantic relations identified by an existing controlled vocabulary system?
Flickr related tags were compared with TGM related terms (hereafter, TGM related terms include UF (Used For), BT (Broader Term), NT (Narrower Term), and RT (Related Term)). Because the TGM does not include Color and Specific terms,
RQ5 investigated only Abstract and Generic categories. Twelve abstract terms and 240 generic terms, which appeared both in the Flickr data set and the TGM main entry, were analyzed. The number of generic tags matching with the TGM was 255, but some pairs of Flickr tags that are related to one TGM term were regarded as one term in this analysis. For example,  X  X ea &amp; Waves X  or  X  X unrise &amp; Sunset X  are each one main entry in the TGM, but Flickr uses two separate tags for each. In comparing
TGM terms and Flickr tags, such pairs of terms were considered one entry. In another example, Forest and Woods are iden-tified as a USE/UF relation in the TGM, but Flickr considers them two different terms. Again, they were considered one entry in this analysis.

Table 3 shows comparison results of the twelve abstract terms. The average number of TGM related terms per TGM main entry was 7.25. Among 87 TGM related terms, 12.64% matched with Flickr related tags, and RT demonstrated the highest matching rate. As one notices in Table 4 , most TGM related terms are symbolic or abstract concepts (natural phenomena, mental status, deadly sins, optimism, sadness, and so on) and some generic concepts (ice, land, families, and so on) are in-cluded. However, in Flickr, related terms are generic concepts (winter, snow, ice, tree, cat, pet, girl, and so on), some colors (blue and red), and some related emotions (cute, fun, love). In short, the TGM included abstract concepts such as BT, NT or RT, but the Flickr related tags showed that concepts in other categories should be included as related tags.

Table 5 shows the comparison results for the 240 generic terms. On average, 11.48 TGM related terms were identified per main entry, and NT and RT occurred frequently. Compared with the Abstract category, the Generic category had more NTs as related terms, because some superordinate terms, such as Animals, People, Food, Sports, and so on, list many NTs. The overall matching rate between TGM related terms and Flickr related tags was 7.59%. BTs demonstrated a high matching rate (22.32%). Compared with abstract terms, BTs of generic terms include more concrete terms, such as Animals, Flowers, and so on, which frequently appeared in Flickr related tags. However, less-concrete BTs, such as Disciplines, Organisms, Facilities, etc., were not found as Flickr related terms. USE/UF relations, such as Building/Construction, Dogs/Puppies, Gifts/Presents, and so on, were also found as related tags in Flickr. Although RT did not show a high matching rate (8.49%), one does notice that 101 out of 209 matching related tags were RT relations. This implies that, although the TGM provides a relatively large number of RTs that do not match with Flickr tags, when considering the Flickr related tags that match with TGM relations, about 50% were RTs. In other words, Flickr related tags included a large number of RT relations. One of the big differences between TGM RTs and Flickr related tags was that most of the RTs identified by TGM were other generic terms, but Flickr related tags included tags in other categories, such as  X  X hite X  and  X  X ove X  for  X  X ride, X   X  X ondon X  and  X  X ed X  for  X  X us, X  and so on. An-other feature of Flickr related tags was that they reflected recent events or topics, as one notices with the Hurricane tag (see
Table 6 ). NT demonstrated the lowest matching rate, seemingly because the TGM listed too specific terms as NTs that were not often used by Flickr users.
 5. Discussion
This study examined semantic features represented in user-supplied tags with the purpose of providing a guideline for developing a user-centered thesaurus that reflects features of image documents. Two major components of a thesaurus X  concepts and their semantic relations X  X ere analyzed in terms of tag categories. First, based on the findings explored in
RQ1-3, some suggestions were made about concepts that should be included in a thesaurus for each category. 5.1. Color
Of 535 unique tags provided by two or more users, there are 13 color-related terms, which accounts for 4% of total tag occurrences. It was found that there is a small pool of color-related terms frequently used in tagging images; 8 of 13 color terms were included in the 145 most popular Flickr tags, and the average frequency of each color tag was approximately 30.
It also was found that tags used to represent colors are all basic color terms. These findings are in accordance with J X rgen-sen X  X  (1998) study which demonstrated that people use only a small number of color-related terms in describing images. In her study, J X rgensen also showed that there is high consistency in color descriptors among participants. Therefore, one can conclude that only a small number of basic color terms can be effective index terms in representing and retrieving images, although the TGM does not contain color terms. 5.2. Abstract
The number of unique tags belonging to the Abstract category was 43, and those tags accounted for 6% of total tag occur-rences. Of the 43 tags, 6 were included in the most popular Flickr tags, and the average occurrence of individual tags was approximately 14. This suggests that it is difficult to specify a set of abstract terms frequently used. It also supports the asser-tion that abstract and emotional attributes are too subjective and inconsistent to be represented during the indexing process (Greisdorf &amp; O X  X onnor, 2002 ). If it is difficult to improve retrieval efficacy by assigning index terms that match search terms, it might be a more effective approach for abstract terms to enhance browsability through the use of hierarchical and asso-ciative relations. Although this study did not analyze the level of specificity for abstract tags, there are studies that explore emotional hierarchy (Fehr &amp; Russell, 1984; Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, &amp; O X  X onnor, 1987 ). A future study should investigate whether this hierarchical structure can be beneficial for users with abstract information needs to browse and navigate an image collection. More discussion on semantic relations is included below. 5.3. Specific
The Specific category includes individually named persons, animals or things (e.g., Chris, Heron, NASA); individually named events or actions (e.g., Olympics, Halloween); individually named geographic locations (e.g., Florida, Austria); and linear time (e.g., 2007, May 2007). The number of unique tags in this category was 105, and they accounted for 29% of total tag occurrences. Tags in the S3 (individually named geographic locations) and S4 (linear time) subcategories had high fre-quencies (on average, 49 and 26 per tag, respectively). Of the unique tags included in this category, 34 terms appeared among the most popular Flickr tags. As mentioned previously, the pattern of frequent tag occurrence is because of a unique feature in the Flickr collection. Therefore, term-frequency analysis alone cannot lead to a general conclusion as to whether those specific terms which frequently appear in Flickr should be included in a thesaurus. However, although Flickr Specific tags may not be generalized for other image collections, several studies have revealed how Specific terms can be important access points by analyzing search queries for different image collections (Armitage &amp; Enser, 1997; Choi &amp; Rasmussen, 2003;
Ornager, 1995 ). In addition, when considering searching and browsing activities, identification of specific names tends to require knowledge and inferential capacity, and it is often difficult to identify specific names based on visible evidence itself (Enser et al., 2007 ). Therefore, one can suggest that Specific terms are good index terms which improve accessibility as well as add information which cannot be extracted from the image itself. The subsequent discussion below on semantic relations supports including specific terms in a thesaurus. 5.4. Generic The number of unique tags in the Generic category was 338 and accounted for approximately 52% of total tag occurrences.
Of the 338 tags, 54 appeared among the most popular Flickr tags, and the average frequency of individual tags was approx-imately 15 occurrences. The number of tags that appear in the TGM was 255, and a large portion of the terms that were not included in the TGM were recent or technology-related terms. For example, under the Game main entry, the TGM lists 21
NTs, such as Billiards, Bingo, and Blind man X  X  bluff, but there is no entry for Video Games. As another example, although the TGM has an entry of  X  X omputers, X  its NT includes only Punched card systems, but more popular terms such as desktops or laptops are not included. This result was anticipated, because the difficulty of updating new terminologies has been rec-ognized as a major problem of a thesaurus. Thus, the result reassures the potential of user-supplied tags as a venue for add-ing new terminologies to a thesaurus.

The level of term specificity analysis results suggested that basic-level terms should receive attention in selecting con-cepts for a thesaurus, and this finding is consistent with previous studies which examined image descriptors by applying the basic-level theory (J X rgensen, 2003; Rorissa, 2008 ). Although this study did not categorize main entries of the TGM, according to J X rgensen X  X  (2003) TGM analysis results, generic terms are dominant (approximately 50%) in the TGM main en-tries. 8 Theoretically, if a thesaurus includes a large number of terms and provide appropriate semantic relations and cross references, it will support high-precision retrieval results. However, when considering the cost-effectiveness of developing and maintaining a thesaurus, it will be important to include index terms that can support information retrieval effectively.
Therefore, in selecting generic terms for a thesaurus, it would be reasonable to focus on basic-level terms. For subordinate-level terms, because there can be a large number of specific terms, it would be useful to include terms based on usage anal-ysis. The study also found that relatively concrete superordinate terms (such as Animal, Flower, and Fruit, rather than Organ-isms, Disciplines, and Facilities) were frequently found in Flickr tags.

Second, this study also explored semantic relations obtained from Flickr related tags (RQ4-5). A common finding across four major categories was that a concept holds semantically related concepts not only in its own category but also in other categories. This finding seems an expected result, because as Enser et al. (2007) demonstrated, a single image includes an admixture of messages which belong to different categories. Since this study did not investigate to what extent Flickr related tags are actually useful in supporting browsing or query expanding, it is impossible to provide evidence concerning the effec-tiveness of utilizing Flickr related tags. However, when considering that Flickr related tags are generated based on term co-occurrence analysis ( Specia &amp; Motta, 2007 ) which has been broadly used in the field of information retrieval, using Flickr related tags for identifying semantically related concepts is a promising solution. In other words, according to the main prin-ciple of the term co-occurrences,  X  X  ... if two or more terms co-occur in many documents of a given collection, the presump-tion is that these terms are related in some sense ...  X (Salton &amp; McGill, 1983, p. 228 ), a pair of Flickr tags which co-occur in many image documents should be related in some sense. From the samples presented in Table 4 and Table 6 , it is also pos-sible to observe the potential of Flickr related tags. For instance, for a user who tried to query  X  X  X azy, X  which related terms would be more useful in finding images among  X  X  X ental states, X   X  X  X eadly sins, X   X  X  X at, X  and  X  X  X leepy X ? A future study should examine the utility of Flickr related tags in helping users search and browse an image collection.

The TGM does not include color and specific terms; however, this study suggests that if terms in these categories are use-ful in establishing related tags, they should be included in thesauri. There have been several studies which have revealed the impact of colors on image viewers X  emotional reactions (Black, Massey, Gardner, &amp; Winer, 1984; Valdez &amp; Mehrabian, 1994 ), and the results of this study showed that color terms are related to not only emotional terms, but also generic and specific terms. Since only a small number of basic color terms are dominantly used, there would be no difficulty in including and maintaining these terms within the thesaurus. In the case of specific terms, it is practically impossible to include all specific terms in a thesaurus. However, it is desirable to include popular specific terms. As discussed before, specific terms have other specific terms and generic terms as related terms. Therefore, it would be useful for users to provide related specific or generic terms for enhancing their browsing. For instance, for a user who is looking for an image of Paris,  X  X iffel tower X  can be a good alternative search term. For a user who is searching for a representative image of an India, a related term  X  X oman X  can be a clue for narrowing down search results.

Whereas Flickr related tags are generated based on co-occurrence analysis (Specia &amp; Motta, 2007 ), the TGM provides more-structured relations using equivalent, hierarchical, and associative relations, and these kinds of relations seem useful for users to expand and revise their initial queries and browse an image collection. Therefore, future study is needed to ex-plore the semantic relationships between types of relations and types of user needs or tasks. Then, it would be necessary to integrate usage-based relations (e.g., Flickr-related tags) into conceptually structured relations (e.g., TGM-related terms). The idea of incorporating a user-centered thesaurus with an existing typical thesaurus was proposed by Bates (1986) . She pro-posed that indeterminate and various user queries can be supported through an end user thesaurus which enables users to access the information retrieval system with their own language and a dense semantic network, including more diverse and abundant term relations. She insisted that her model should be incorporated with a traditional thesaurus, in order to im-prove accessibilities. Although she proposed the model for online catalogs, the same principles can be applied to an image retrieval system of which users adopt unpredictable and diverse queries. 6. Conclusion
Following on the advent of online social tagging, this study examined whether user-supplied tags can be a helpful re-source for developing a user-centered thesaurus that considers the unique features of image documents. Although future study is needed to corroborate the effectiveness of this user-oriented approach, the current study provides promising results, demonstrating that user-supplied tags can be successfully employed in selecting concepts to be included in a thesaurus and in identifying semantic relations among those selected concepts. Also, the study found that there are some differences be-tween features obtained from user-supplied tags and those in an existing thesaurus, the TGM, and recommends the integra-tion of a user-oriented approach and the current structured approach. It is hoped that the results of this study will provide a practical guideline for designing a thesaurus for image documents that takes into account both the unique features of those documents as well as the unique information-seeking behavior of general users.
