 Most Web pages contain temporal information, which can be utilized by search engines to improve searching performance for users. However, traditional search engines have little support in processing temporal-textual Web queries. Aiming at solving this problem, in this paper we pres ent and implement a prototype system for time-sensitive queries, which is called TASE (Time-Aware Search Engine). TASE extracts both the explicit and implicit temporal expressions for each Web page, and calculates the relevant score between the Web page and each temporal expression, and then re-rank search results based on the temporal-textual relevance betw een Web pages and the queries. It is demonstrated that TASE can improve the effectiveness of temporal-textual Web queries. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval. Keywords: Web search, time, Re-ranking. Temporal information plays an im portant role in many research areas such as information extrac tion, topic detection, question answering, query log analysis, and Web search. Temporal information usually appears in Web pages as temporal expressions, which are typically di vided into two types, namely expressions, e.g., Today. Recent research on Web search shows that a lot of Web queries contain temporal keywords, either implicit temporal words [1] or explicit temporal expressions [2]. mainly focusing on textual search. They have very limited consideration on the temporal information contained in Web pages, i.e., they treat temporal information as textual keywords, or only support publication date based search. However, those ways both have some critical problems in dealing with time-related Web search. For example, the search engine cannot find the relevance between a query temporal expression  X 1990s X  and a document which mentions  X 1996 X . Aiming at solving this problem, in this paper we present and implement a prototype system for temporal-sensitive queries similarity between the temporal expressions in a query and a document, and it will be described in Section 3.3. source search engine Lucene. Therefore, we use the textual similarity determined by Lucene as the original textual similarity. similarity and the original textual similarity to determine the final relevant score of a documen t. Section 3.4 will give more details about it. Temporal information usually app ears in Web pages as temporal expressions, which are typically di vided into two types, namely expressions, e.g., Today. The e xplicit temporal expressions can be recognized by many time annot ation tools, such as GUTime, which is part of the TARS QI (Temporal Awareness and Reasoning Systems for Question Interpretation) toolkit (TTK) [3]. Differing from the explicit expressions, which can be directly found in a calendar, the implicit expressions need a transformation process and usually a referential time is required [4]. One is called Global Time (GT) whose temporal semantics is independent of the local context, and takes the report time or publication time as the referent. Another one, Local Time (LT), makes reference to the narrative time in text above on account of depending on the current c ontext. Table 1 gives some examples of GT and LT in real texts. Table 1. Common Global Temporal Expressions and Local to hold full reference time for the whole text, and we need to update and maintain it dynamically after each normalizing process. The time table consists of two parts: Global Reference Time (GRT) and Local Reference Time (LRT). dynamically and automatically c hoose references based on their respective classes rather than doing it using the fixed value or the inconsiderate rule unde r the static mechanism. In TASE, we consider two aspects when calculating the relevant score of a temporal expression, namely the term frequency of the temporal expression and th e relevance between temporal expressions. Here, we define the score of a temporal expression a query. t d is one of the temporal expressions d time in a document. expression model. To take all the temporal expressions in queries and documents into account , the temporal similarity can be defined by formula (4). One of the previous time-aware ranking methods is integrating the temporal similarity into ex isting language model [5, 6]. To integrate to the probabilistic relevance model and vector space model, we can use a mixture m odel linearly combining textual and temporal similarity as reported in the literature [7] and [8]. We re-rank the documents by a linear combination of the similarity score S X  X (q time |d time ) . Both similarity scores are needed to be normalized. For example, in this paper, all the similarity scores are divided by the maximum score of the Top-K documents. Given a temporal query q , a document d will be ranked according to a score computed by formula (5). The parameter  X  indicates the importance of textual similarity and temporal similarity. The corpus we use for demons tration consists of 1,812,933 English news articles crawled from the New York Times website. It contains 6,455,985 temporal expressions, and includes 3,763,923 (58%) explicit temporal expressions and 2,692,062 (42%) implicit temporal expressions. More specifically, it mainly cont ains 3,157,156 DAY expressions (49%), 2,317,796 YEAR expressions (36%), and 959,747 MONTH expressions (15%). Apache Lucene version 3.5.0. We will use two retrieval modes in the demonstration, namely the inclusive mode and the exclusive mode. For the inclusive mode, both query terms and a temporal expression comprise a query q text . For the exclusive expression is excluded from q text . shows the user interface of TASE. For more details, we provide a video to show the demonstration process, which can be found in http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~linsh/tase_demo/index.htm . In the demonstration, we will show the searching examples under different configurations, such as different time granularities, weights, retrieval modes, and so on. We will also show the comparison results of other competitor ranking algorithms, as well as the original Lucene results.
