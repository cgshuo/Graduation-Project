 The question of how best to identify children with language disorders is a topic of ongoing debate. One common assessment approach is based on cut-off scores from standardized, norm-referenced lan-guage assessment tasks. Children scoring at the lower end of the distribution, typically more than 1.25 or 1.5 Standard Deviations (SD) below the mean, are identified as having language impair-ment (Tomblin et al., 1997). This cutoff-based approach has several well-documented weaknesses that may result in both over-and under-identification of children as language impaired (Plante and Vance, 1994). Recent studies have suggested considerable overlap between children with language impairment and their typically developing cohorts on many of these tasks (e.g., (Pe  X  na et al., 2006b; Spaulding et al., 2006)). In addition, scores and cutoffs on stan-dardized tests depend on the distribution of scores from the particular samples used in normalizing the measure. Thus, the validity of the measure for chil-dren whose demographic and other socioeconomic characteristics are not well represented in the test X  X  normative sample is a serious concern. Finally, most norm-referenced tests of language ability rely heav-ily on exposure to mainstream language and expe-riences, and have been found to be biased against children from families with low parental education and socioeconomic status, as well as children from different ethnic backgrounds (Campbell et al., 1997; Dollaghan and Campbell, 1998).

This paper aims to develop a reliable and auto-matic method for identifying the language status of children. We propose the use of different lexico-syntactic features, typically used in computational linguistics, in combination with features inspired by current assessment practices in the field of lan-guage disorders to train Machine Learning (ML) al-gorithms. The two main contributions of this pa-per are: 1) It is one step towards developing a re-liable and automatic approach for language status prediction in English-speaking children; 2) It pro-vides evidence showing that the same approach can be adapted to predict language status in Spanish-English bilingual children. 2.1 Monolingual English-Speaking Children Several hypotheses exist that try to explain the gram-matical deficits of children with Language Impair-ment (LI). Young children normally go through a stage where they use non-finite forms of verbs in grammatical contexts where finite forms are re-quired (Wexler, 1994). This is referred as the op-tional infinitive stage. The Extended Optional Infini-tive (EOI) theory (Rice and Wexler, 1996) suggests that children with LI exhibit the use of a  X  X oung X  grammar for an extended period of time, where tense, person, and number agreement markers are omitted.

In contrast to the EOI theory, the surface account theory (Leonard et al., 1997) assumes that chil-dren with LI have reduced processing capabilities. This deficit affects the perception of low stress mor-phemes, such as -ed, -s, be and do , resulting in an inconsistent use of these verb morphemes.

Spontaneous narratives are considered as one of the most ecologically valid ways to measure com-municative competence (Botting, 2002). They rep-resent various aspects involved in children X  X  every-day communication. Typical measures for sponta-neous language samples include Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) in words, Number of Different Words (NDW), and errors in grammatical morphol-ogy. Assessment approaches compare children X  X  performance on these measures against expected performance. As mentioned in Section 1, these cut-off based methods raise questions concerning accu-racy and bias. Manually analyzing the narratives is also a very time consuming task. After transcribing the sample, clinicians need to code for the differ-ent clinical markers and other morphosyntactic in-formation. This can take up to several hours for each child making it infeasible to analyze a large number of samples. 2.2 Bilingual Spanish-English Speaking Bilingual children face even more identification challenges due to their dual language acquisition. They can be mistakenly labeled as LI due to: 1) the inadequate use of translations of assessment tools; 2) an over reliance on features specific to English; 3) a lack of appropriate expectations about how the lan-guages of a bilingual child should develop (Bedore and Pe  X  na, 2008); 4) or the use of standardized tests where the normal distribution used to compare language performance is composed of monolingual children (Restrepo and Guti  X  errez-Clellen, 2001).
Spanish speaking children with LI show differ-ent clinical markers than English speaking children with LI. As mentioned above, English speakers have problems with verb morphology. In contrast, Span-ish speakers have been found to have problems with noun morphology, in particular in the use of articles and clitics (Restrepo and Guti  X  errez-Clellen, 2001; Jacobson and Schwartz, 2002; Bedore and Leonard, 2005). Bedore and Leonard (2005) also found dif-ferences in the error patterns of Spanish and related languages such as Italian. Spanish-speakers tend to both omit and substitute articles and clitics, while the dominant errors for Italian-speakers are omis-sions. We use language models (LMs) in our initial inves-tigation, and later explore more complex ML algo-rithms to improve the results. Our ultimate goal is to discover a highly accurate ML method that can be used to assist clinicians in the task of LI identifica-tion in children. 3.1 Language Models for Predicting Language LMs are statistical models used to estimate the prob-ability of a given sequence of words. They have been explored previously for clinical purposes. Roark et al. (2007) proposed cross entropy of LMs trained on Part-of-Speech (POS) sequences as a measure of syntactic complexity with the aim of determining mild cognitive impairment in adults. Solorio and Liu (2008) evaluated LMs on a small data set in a preliminary trial on LI prediction.

The intuition behind using LMs is that they can identify atypical grammatical patterns and help dis-criminate the population with potential LI from the Typically Developing (TD) one. We use LMs trained on POS tags rather than on words. Using POS tags can address the data sparsity issue in LMs, and place less emphasis on the vocabulary and more emphasis on the syntactic patterns.

We trained two separate LMs using POS tags from the transcripts of TD and LI children, respec-tively. The language status of a child is predicted using the following criterion: d ( s ) = where s represents a transcript from a child, and P P T D ( s ) and P P LI ( s ) are the perplexity values from the TD and LI LMs, respectively. We used the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) for training the LMs and calculating perplexities. 3.2 Machine Learning for Predicting Language Although LMs have been used successfully on dif-ferent human language processing tasks, they are typically trained and tested on language samples larger than what is usually collected by clinicians for the purpose of diagnosing a child with potential LI. Clinicians make use of additional information be-yond children X  X  speech, such as parent and teacher questionnaires and test scores on different language assessment tasks. Therefore in addition to using LMs for children language status prediction, we ex-plore a machine learning classification approach that can incorporate more information for better predic-tion. We aim to identify effective features for this task and expect this information will help clinicians in their assessment.

We consider various ML algorithms for the clas-sification task, including Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Ma-chines (SVM), and Boosting with Decision Stumps. Weka (Witten and Frank, 1999) was used in our ex-periments due to its known reliability and the avail-ability of a large number of algorithms. Below we provide a comprehensive list of features that we ex-plored for both English and Spanish-English tran-scripts. We group these features according to the aspect of language they focus on. Features specific to Spanish are discussed in Section 5.2. 1. Language productivity 2. Morphosyntactic skills 3. Vocabulary knowledge 4. Speech fluency 5. Perplexities from LMs 6. Standard scores 4.1 The Monolingual English Data Set Our target population for this work is children with an age range of 3 to 6 years old. However, currently we do not have any monolingual data sets readily available to test our approach in this age range. In the field of communication disorders data sharing is not a common practice due to the sensitive con-tent of the material in the language samples of chil-dren, and also due to the large amount of effort and time it takes researchers to collect, transcribe, and code the data before they can begin their analysis. To evaluate our approach we used a dataset from CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000) that includes nar-ratives from English-speaking adolescents with and without LI with ages ranging between 13 and 16 years old. Even though the age range is outside the range we are interested in, we believe that this data set can still be helpful in exploring the feasibility of our approach as a first step.

This data set contains 99 TD adolescents and 19 adolescents who met the LI profile at one point in the duration of the study. There are transcripts from each child for two tasks: a story telling and a spon-taneous personal narrative. The first task is a picture prompted story telling task using the wordless pic-ture book,  X  Frog, Where Are You?  X  (Mayer, 1969). In this story telling task children first look at the story book  X  X o develop a story in memory X  and then are asked to narrate the story. This type of elicitation task encourages the use of past tense constructions, providing plenty of opportunities for extracting clin-ical markers. In the spontaneous personal narrative task, the child is asked to talk about a person who an-noys him/her the most and describe the most annoy-ing features of that person. This kind of spontaneous personal narrative encourages the participant for the use of third person singular forms ( -s ). Detailed in-formation of this data set can be found in (Wetherell et al., 2007).

We processed the transcripts using the CLAN toolkit (MacWhinney, 2000). MOR and POST from CLAN are used for morphological analysis and POS tagging of the children X  X  speech. We decided to use these analyzers since they are customized for chil-dren X  X  speech. 4.2 Results with Monolingual The performance measures we use are: precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure ( F 1 ). Here the LI cat-egory is the positive class and the TD category is the negative class.

Table 1 shows the results of leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) obtained from the LM ap-proach for the story telling and spontaneous personal narrative tasks. It also shows results from a base-line method that predicts language status by using standard scores on measures that have been asso-ciated with LI in children (Dollaghan, 2004). The three measures we used for the baseline are: MLU in words, NDW, and total number of utterances pro-duced. To compute this baseline we estimate the mean and standard deviation of these measures us-ing LOOCV with the TD population as our norma-tive sample. The baseline predicts that a child has LI if the child scores more than 1.25 SD below the mean on at least two out of the three measures.
Although LMs yield different results for the story telling and personal narrative tasks, they both pro-vide consistently better results than the baseline. For the story telling task the best results, in terms of the F 1 measure, are achieved by a bigram LM ( F 1 58.06%) while for the personal narrative the highest F 1 measure (51.85%) is from the trigram LM. If we consider precision, both tasks have the same increas-ing pattern when increasing LM orders. However for recall that is not the case. In the story telling task, recall decreases at the expense of higher precision, but for the personal narrative task, the trigram LM reaches a better trade-off between precision and re-call, which yields a high F 1 measure. We also evalu-ated 4-gram LMs, but results did not improve, most likely because we do not have enough data to train higher order LMs.

The results for different ML algorithms are shown in Table 2, obtained by using all features described in Section 3.2. The feature based approach us-ing ML algorithms outperformed using only LMs on both tasks. For the story telling task, SVM with a linear kernel achieves the best results ( F 1 = 72.22%), while Boosting with Decision Stumps pro-vides the best performance ( F 1 = 56.25%) for the personal narrative task. 4.3 Feature and Error Analysis The ML results shown above use the entire feature set described in Subsection 3.2. The next question we ask is the effectiveness of different features for this task. The datasets we are using in our evalua-tion are very small, especially considering the num-ber of positive instances. This prevents us from hav-ing a separate subset of the data for parameter tun-ing or feature selection. Therefore, we performed additional experiments to evaluate the usefulness of individual features. Figure 1 shows the F 1 measures when using different feature groups. The numbers on the x-axis correspond to the feature groups de-scribed in Section 3.2. The F 1 measure value for each of the features is the highest value obtained by running different ML algorithms for classification.
We noticed that for the story telling task, using perplexity values from LMs (group 5) as a feature in the ML setting outperforms the LM threshold ap-proach by a large margin. It seems that having the perplexity values as well as the perplexity differ-ences from all the LMs of different orders in the ML algorithm provides a better estimation of the target concept.
 Only the standard scores (group 6) yield a higher F 1 measure for the personal narrative task than the story telling one. The majority of the features (5 out of 6 groups) provide higher F 1 measures for the story telling task, which explains the significantly better results on this task over the personal narrative in our learning approach. This is consistent with pre-vious work contrasting narrative genre stating that the restrictive setting of a story retell is more reveal-ing of language difficulties than spontaneous narra-tives, where the subjects have more control on the content and style (Wetherell et al., 2007).

We also performed some error analysis for some of the transcripts that were consistently misidenti-fied by different ML algorithms. In the story telling task, we find that some LI transcripts are misclassi-fied as TD because they (1) have fewer fillers, dis-fluencies, and degree of support; (2) are similar to the TD transcripts, which is depicted by the perplex-ity values for these transcripts; or (3) contain higher MLU in words as compared to their LI peers. Some of the reasons for classifying transcripts in the TD category as LI are shorter MLU in words as com-pared to other TD peers, large number of fillers, and excessive repetitions of words and phrases unlike the other TD children. These factors are consistent with the effective features that we found from Figure 1.
For the personal narrative task, standard scores (group 6) and language productivity (group 1) have an important role in classification, as shown in Fig-ure 1. The TD transcripts that are misidentified have lower standard scores and MLU in words than those of their TD peers.

We believe that another source of noise in the transcripts comes from the POS tags themselves. For instance, we found that many verbs in present tense for third person singular are tagged as plural nouns, which results in a failure to capture subject-verb agreement.

Lastly, according to the dataset description, chil-dren in the LI category met the LI criteria at one stage in their lifetime and some of these children also had, or were receiving, some educational sup-port in the school environment at the time of data collection. This support for children with LI is meant to improve their performance on language related tasks, making the automatic classification problem more complicated. This also raises the question about the reference label (TD or LI) for each child in the data set we used. The details about which children received interventions are not speci-fied in the dataset description. In this section we generalize the approach to a Spanish-English bilingual population. In adapting the approach to our bilingual population we face two challenges: first, what shows to be promising for a monolingual and highly heterogeneous population may not be as successful in a bilingual setting where we expect to have a large variability of exposure to each language; second, there is a large difference in the mean age of the monolingual setting and that of our bilingual one. This age difference will result in different speech patterns. Younger children pro-duce more ill-formed sentences since they are still in a language acquisition phase. Lastly, the clini-cal markers in adolescents are geared towards prob-lems at the pragmatic and discourse levels, while at younger ages they focus more on syntax and mor-phology.

For dealing with the first challenge we are extract-ing language-specific features and hope that by look-ing at both languages we can reach a good discrim-ination performance. For the second challenge, our feature engineering approach has been focused on younger children from the beginning. We are aiming to capture the type of morphosyntactic patterns that can identify LI in young children. In addition, the samples in the bilingual population are story retells, and our feature setting showed to be a good match for this task. Therefore, we expect our approach to capture relevant classification patterns, even in the presence of noisy utterances. 5.1 The Bilingual Data Set The transcripts for the bilingual LI task come from an on-going longitudinal study of language impair-ment in Spanish-English speaking children (Pe  X  na et al., 2006a). The children in this study were enrolled in kindergarten with a mean age of about 70 months. Of the 59 children, 6 were identified as having a possible LI by an expert in communication disor-ders, while 53 were identified as TD. Six of the TD children were excluded due to missing information, yielding a total of 47 TD children.
 Each child told a series of stories based on Mercer Mayer X  X  wordless picture books (Mayer, 1969). Two stories were told in English and two were told in Spanish, for a total of four transcripts per child. The books used for English were  X  X  Boy, A Dog, and A Frog X  and  X  X rog, Where Are You? X  The books used for Spanish retelling were  X  X rog on His Own X  and  X  X rog Goes to Dinner. X  The transcripts for each separate language were combined, yielding one in-stance per language for each child.

An interesting aspect of the bilingual data is that the children mix languages in their narratives. This phenomenon is called code-switching. At the begin-ning of a retelling session, the interviewer encour-ages the child to speak the target language if he/she is not doing so. Once the child begins speaking the correct language, any code-switching thereafter is not corrected by the interviewer. Due to this, the En-glish transcripts contain Spanish utterances and vice versa. We believe that words in the non-target lan-guage help contribute to a more accurate language development profile. Therefore, in our work we de-cided to keep these code-switched elements. A com-bined lexicon approach was used to tag the mixed-language fragments. If a word does not appear in the target language lexicon, we apply the POS tag from the non-target language. 5.2 Spanish-Specific Features Many structural differences exist between Spanish, a Romance language, and English, a Germanic lan-guage. Spanish is morphologically richer than En-glish. It contains a larger number of different verb conjugations and it uses a two gender system for nouns, adjectives, determiners, and participles. A Spanish-speaking child with LI will have difficulties with different grammatical elements, such as articles and clitics, than an English-speaking child (Bedore and Pe  X  na, 2008). These differences indicate that the Spanish feature set will need to be tailored towards the Spanish language.

To account for Spanish-specific patterns we in-cluded new POS bigrams as features. To capture the use of correct and incorrect gender and num-ber marking morphology, we added noun-adjective, determiner-noun, and number-noun bigrams to the list of morphosyntactic features. 5.3 Results on Bilingual Children Results are shown for the baseline and LM threshold approach for the bilingual data set in Table 3. The baseline is computed from the same measures as the monolingual dataset (MLU in words, NDW, and to-tal utterances).

Compared to Table 1, the values in Table 3 are generally lower than on the monolingual story telling task. In this inherently difficult task, the bilin-gual transcripts are more disfluent than the monolin-gual ones. This could be due to the age of the chil-dren or their bilingual status. Recent studies on psy-cholinguistics and language production have shown that bilingual speakers have both languages active at speech production time (Kroll et al., 2008) and it is possible that this may cause interference, espe-cially in children still in the phase of language acqui-sition. In addition, the LMs in the monolingual task were trained using more instances per class, possibly yielding better results.

There are some different patterns between using the English and Spanish transcripts. In English, the unigram models provide the least discriminative value, and the bigram and trigram models improve discrimination. We also evaluated higher order n-grams, but did not obtain any further improvement. We found that the classification accuracy of the LM approach was influenced by two children with LI who were consistently marked as LI due to a greater perplexity value from the TD LM. A further analysis shows that these children spoke mostly Spanish on the  X  X nglish X  tasks yielding larger perplexities from the TD LM, which was trained from mostly English. In contrast, the LI LM was created with transcripts containing more Spanish than the TD one, and thus test transcripts with a lot of Spanish do not inflate perplexity values that much.

For Spanish, unigram LMs provide some discrim-inative usefulness, and then the bigram performance decreases while the trigram model provides no dis-criminative value. One reason for this may be that the Spanish LMs have a larger vocabulary. In the Spanish LMs, there are 2/3 more POS tags than in the English LM. This size difference dramatically increases the possible bigrams and trigrams, there-fore increasing the number of parameters to esti-mate. In addition, we are using an  X  X ff the shelf X  POS tagger (provided by CLAN) and this may add noise in the feature extraction process. Since we do not have gold standard annotations for these tran-scripts, we cannot measure the POS tagging accu-racy. A rough estimate based on manually revis-ing one transcript in each language showed a POS tagging accuracy of 90% for English and 84% for Spanish. Most of the POS tagger errors involve verbs, nouns and pronouns. Thus while the accu-racy might not seem that low, it can still have a ma-jor impact on our approach since it involves the POS categories that are more relevant for this task.
Table 4 shows the results from various ML algo-rithms. In addition to predicting the language status with the English and Spanish samples separately, we also combined the English and Spanish transcripts together for each child, and used all the features from both languages in order to allow a prediction based on both samples. The best F 1 measure for this task (60%) is achieved by using the Naive Bayes al-gorithm with the combined Spanish-English feature set. This is an improvement over both the separate English and Spanish trials. The Naive Bayes algo-rithm provided the best discrimination for the En-glish (54%) and Combined data sets and Boosting and SVM provided the best discrimination for the Spanish set (18%). 5.4 Feature Analysis Similar to the monolingual dataset, we performed additional experiments exploring the contribution of different groups of features. We tested the six groups of features described in Section 3.2 sepa-rately. Overall, the combined LM perplexity val-ues (group 5) provided the best discriminative value (
F the best for English. It even outperformed using all the features in the ML algorithm, suggesting some feature selection is needed for this task.

The morpohsyntactic skills (group 2) provided the best discriminative value for the Spanish language features, and performed better than the complete feature set for Spanish. Within group 2, we evalu-ated different POS bigrams for the Spanish and En-glish sets and observed that most of the bigram com-binations by themselves are usually weak predictors of language status. In the Spanish set, out of all of the lexical combinations, only the determiner-noun, noun-verb, and pronoun-verb categories provided some discriminative value. The determiner-noun category captured the correct and incorrect gender marking between the two POS tags. The noun-verb and pronoun-verb categories covered the correct and incorrect usage of subject-verb combinations. In-terestingly enough, the pronoun-verb category per-formed well by itself, yielding an F 1 measure of 54%. There are also some differences in the frequen-cies of bigram features in the English and Spanish data sets. For example, there is no noun-auxiliary POS pattern in Spanish, and the pronoun-auxiliary bigram appears less frequently in Spanish than in English because in Spanish the use of personal pro-nouns is not mandatory since the verb inflection will disambiguate the subject of the sentence.

The vocabulary knowledge feature (group 3) did not provide any discriminative value for any of the language tasks. This may be because bilingual chil-dren receive less input for each language than a monolingual child learning one language, or due to the varied vocabulary acquisition rate in our bilin-gual population. In this paper we present results on the use of LMs and ML techniques trained on features representing different aspects of language gathered from spon-taneous speech samples for the task of assisting clinicians in determining language status in chil-dren. First, we evaluate our approach on a monolin-gual English-speaking population. Next, we show that this ML approach can be successfully adapted to a bilingual Spanish-English population. ML al-gorithms provide greater discriminative power than only using a threshold approach with LMs.

Our current efforts are devoted to improving pre-diction accuracy by refining our feature set. We are working on creating a gold standard corpus of chil-dren X  X  transcripts annotated with POS tags. This data set will help us improve accuracy on our POS-based features. We are also exploring the use of socio-demographic features such as the educational level of parents, the gender of children, and enroll-ment status on free lunch programs.
