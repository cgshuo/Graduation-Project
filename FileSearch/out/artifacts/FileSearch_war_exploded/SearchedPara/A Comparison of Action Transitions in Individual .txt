 Traditionally, information seeking has been studied as an individual activity. It is now recognized that people do sometime act in a group context when trying to solve in-formation seeking problems (Hansen &amp; J X rvelin, 2005). Especially when the search task is exploratory, it may be in the searchers X  best interests to collaboratively explore collaborative search system need not only support the interaction between a user and the system, but also support the interaction among users. A successful collaborative in the search process. Studies which seek to describe collaborative search process can help developers understand the range of behaviors and activities that systems need to accommodate. Therefore, understanding the various manifestations of collaborative evaluating systems supporting collaborative information seeking. 
Collaborative information seeking has been studied in various environments in-cluding both organizational and Web setting. Our study focuses on collaborative ex-ploratory search in the Web search environment. Golovchinsky et al. (2008) classified the collaboration in Web search using three dimensions  X  location, concurrency and located. We are interested in remotely lo cated collaborative search, for which a colla-borative search system is needed in order to support both collaboration and search. Collaboration in web search can also be synchronous or asynchronous in terms of concurrency. In synchronous collaboration, team members can obtain instant feed-back from each other, whereas only those who search later in asynchronous collabora-tion can benefit from the work of earlier team members. We think that in synchronous such as verbal or text chatting. However, in asynchronous collaboration, the formats of communication are more likely to be implic it such as sharing a document or search history. Golovchinsky X  X  classification of implicit or explicit collaboration in terms of the search intent is somewhat different from our classification of explicit and implicit communication. In his definition, implicit collaboration occurs in collaborative rec-ommendation and filtering systems where users have no idea who the collaborators are and where the information comes from. Explicit collaboration occurs on smaller collaboration in a small group (two-member team). Particularly, we want to look into the differences between collaboration with explicit communication and collaboration without explicit communication when team users conducting exploratory search tasks. To serve as a baseline to test the effect of collaboration, individual search should also be included for comparison. formation search processes. 
In individual information seeking, researchers explored many methods to investi-gate single user X  X  search process. There are several well-known search process mod-els in individual information seeking, such as Kuhlthau X  X  (1991) and Ellis X  (1993) stage. Marchionini (1995) proposes an information-seeking process model of eight stages with possible transitions between each of them. Similar to Kuhlthau and Ellis, the information seeking begins with the recognition and acceptance of the problem and continues until the problem is solved. However, this model highlights the likelih-ood of a stage calling another stage in three types: most likely transitions, high-probability transitions and low-transition probabilities. 
In the Web environment, there are also studies examining the transition of search actions. Holscher and Strube (2000) compared action sequences between Internet experts and newbies. Xie and Joo (2010) investigate transitions of search tactics in the Web search process. They present the most common patterns of search tactic transition at the beginning, middle and ending phases in the search process. When activities associated with exploratory search process. Later, researchers (White and Roth, 2009) model exploratory search process as iterations between exploratory browsing activities and focused searching activities. 
Collaborative information behavior is a re latively new research area compared to individual information behavior research. Researchers conducted studies on colla-borative information behavior across a wide variety of domains, including academic (Blake &amp; Pratt, 2002; Talja &amp; Hansen, 2006), industry (Hansen &amp; Jarvelin, 2005) and medicine (Reddy and Spence, 2008). These studies showed that the collaborative information seeking behavior is as common and natural as individual information behavior. Collaborative information seeking has also been studied in the Web environment. Morris (2008) conducted a survey among 204 information workers about when they used Web search tools collaboratively and on what tasks they usually collaborate with others. In terms of collaborative search process, Evans and Chi (2008) conducted a survey among 150 people using Mechanical Turk to investigate collaborative search strategies involved in before search, during search and after search stage. Halvey et al. (2009) investigated frequency and temporal distribution of user interactions by ana-lyzing log data in an asynchronous collaborative search system for online video search. There are several studies attempt to explore Kuhlthau X  X  ISP model in colla-borative setting. Hyldegard (2006) explored ISP model in a group educational setting based on a qualitative preliminary case study. She found that collaborative search process cannot be modeled the same way as individual search process. She suggests that the ISP model should be extended to in corporate the impact of social and contex-study, Hyldegard (2009) further investigated the group based problem solving process in academic setting and concluded that the ISP model does not fully comply with the collaborative information seeking behaviors. Shah and Gonzalez-lbanez (2010) also attempted to map Kuhlthau X  X  ISP model to collaborative information seeking. Through a laboratory study with 42 pairs of participants, they investigated similarities and disparities between individual and collaborative information seeking process. Similar to Hyldgard, they also declared that social elements are missing when apply-ing the ISP model in a collaborative setting. 
Based on the above literature review, we can see that there are plenty of investiga-tions on search processes in individual user setting. Models of individual search process are well-established. Particularly, s earch processes have been examined in the Web environment and exploratory search in terms of transitions or sequences of search actions. However, current investigations on collaborative search processes are limited to exploring the application of individual search process model in collabora-group users are included in the user studies. There is lacking of comparisons of search processes between individual and collaborative search conditions. the experiments were conducted using CollabSearch, a collaborative search system developed by the authors. 3.1 CollabSearch: A Collaborative Search System CollabSearch 1 is a web search system for either a single user or a group of users. As an integrated collaborative search system, CollabSearch has both search and collabo-ration features, which can support both explicit and implicit communication among team users. In terms of explicit communication, users can use the chat box on the left side (see Figure 1) to send instant messages to each other. For implicit communica-tion, they can use the shared workspace and shared search history. 
CollabSearch X  X  interface contains three fram es: topic statement, search and team workspace. The topic statement frame shows the task description on which the user is currently working. Team members can also post their comments below the task de-team workspace. Users can click to view more details of an item in the workspace, or leave comments for an item. 3.2 Experiment Conditions We identified three experiment conditions. They are: Condition 1 (CEC): collaborative search with explicit communication. In this condi-They can communicate with each other by sending instant text messages, or reading we were trying to simulate remotely-located collaboration, P1 and P2 were in the other. Condition 2 (COC): collaborative search without explicit communication. In this con-dition, we have a new participant P3 to continue the work of P1. P1 here is the same person as P1 in CEC. When P3 worked on the exploratory search tasks, P1 had al-ready finished the tasks. P3 can see P1 X  X  search history and read P1 X  X  saved results in the team workspace. Similar design for colla borative search was used in (Paul &amp; Mor-However, we removed P2 X  X  results because we want to make sure the COC only in-volved two persons X  efforts in order to be fair in the comparison with ECE. tasks individually. More detailed information about how we handle participants X  logs in data analysis is introduced in data analysis method. 3.3 Participants 28 participants were recruited from the University of Pittsburgh for this study. Among them, 12 are female and 16 are male. Their ages are between 18 and 60. Despite the basis. 17 participants are graduate students whereas the other 11 are undergraduates. In terms of operating systems, 7 of them are Mac users and the other 21 are Windows users. According to a question asking them to rate their search experiences from 1-7 with 1 as the least experienced and 7 as the most experienced, the response range from 4-7, thus most of our participants are experienced searchers. 14 of the 28 participants worked under the condition CEC. Since explicit commu-nication will be employed in this condition, we believe that there should be familiarity between the team members. Therefore, we required participants CEC condition to be pairs who know each other. These 7 pairs of participants worked as 7 teams in CEC. They took the role as either P1 or P2. The rest 14 participants were randomly assigned to either COC or IND. For the 7 participan ts assigned to the COC condition, they took the role as P4. 3.4 Search Tasks Two exploratory web search tasks were used in this study. Both of them had been used in other collaborative web search studies (Paul, 2010; Shah &amp; Marchionini, (Shah and Marchionini, 2010) is related to academic work, which asks participants to collecting information for a report on the effect of social networking service and information for planning a trip to Helsinki. Morris X  (Morris, 2008) identified that travel planning and academic literature search are two common collaborative search need to collect and the goal is to collect as many relevant snippets as possible. 3.5 Experiment Procedure The experiment procedure was: experiments for CEC conditions are conducted first. 14 participants (7 teams) worked synchronously on the two tasks. During the experi-ment, after being introduced to the study and the system, and filling out an entry ques-tionnaire to establish their search background, these participants worked on a training task to get familiar with the system for 10 minutes, then they worked on task 1 or task 2, depending on the order assigned for each team. They had 30 minutes for each task. At the end of each task, they also worked on a post-search questionnaire for collecting information about their satisfaction levels. Before the end of the experiments, the participants were asked several open-ended questions for their experience with both tasks. The COC and IND experiments were conducted after the CEC experiments. The rest 14 participants were randomly assigned into COC or IND respectively. The experiment procedure in COC and IND is identical to the CEC condition. 4.1 Categorizing User Search Actions In terms of search process analysis, we are interested in what kind of actions the par-ticipants have taken during the whole pro cess of exploratory Web search. Typical types of search actions recognized in this study include Query, View, Collect, Work-were categorized and mapped from the transaction logs recorded in CollabSearch system. Prior to the analysis, we cleaned the transaction log data to remove some meaningless user actions. For instance, the main interface of CollabSearch consists of three tabs: the  X  X opic Statement X , the  X  X earch X  and the  X  X eam Workspace X . If a par-ticipant wants to issue a query after viewin g the Team workspace, he or she need to transition is from  X  X orkspace X  to  X  X uery X , rather than considering two steps of ac-tion transitions: from  X  X orkspace X  to  X  X earch X  and then from  X  X earch X  to  X  X uery X . As a result, we manually removed the action of clicking the  X  X earch X  tab. 
The purpose for categorizing user search actions is to calculate and compare the frequency of each type of search action in three different conditions. 4.2 Transition Analysis of Search Actions In order to understand users X  interaction duri ng the search process, it is not enough to look at each action in isolation. We need to examine the relationship between differ-ent search actions, which we call it the transitions of search actions. 
In the transition analysis of search actions, we consider the sequential dependence order of user actions. Each search action has one predecessor action and one succes-post-action analysis for some chosen search actions. Pre-action analysis is defined as, search action, analyzing the percentage distribution of its successor actions. and the post-action analysis. 5.1 Distribution of Search Action Pairs Since we have 6 types of search actions, in total there are 36 possible action transition pairs. The frequency distributions of all the action transition pairs in three conditions respectively were plotted in figure 1. The horizontal line denotes each action pair, in which for example Q-V means the action pair transit from Query (Q) to View (V). The abbreviation of each action can be found in Table 1. We can see some high fre-quent action transition pairs include Q-V, V-V, V-S, S-Q, S-V, S-S, W-W and C-C. They represents typical search behavior pattern. For example, after issuing a query, viewing the results is very likely to happen. And participants may continue viewing another query, continue viewing or collecting other results. The reason for the appear-the result list to directly collect it without opening that page for viewing. In fact par-ticipants should have read the abstract of the Webpage before collecting. It is just the viewing cannot be logged by the system. W-W represents continuous actions in  X  X eam workspace X  and C-C indicates persistent chatting activities. 
For the comparison purpose, we also list the top 6 frequent action (larger than 10%) transition pairs in each of the three conditions respectively in Table 2. Common actions in all three conditions are Q-V, V-V and V-S, which reflects a typical pattern of behavior in both collaborative and individual search. The participant first issues a query, then views the returned results, and then collects the result if it X  X  relevant. 
The differences among three conditions are obvious. In CSCW, researchers (Pi-nelle et al. 2003) have recognized that group activity can be divided up into two cate-gories: taskwork, the actions needed to complete the task, and teamwork, the actions needed to complete the task as a group  X   X  X he work of working together. X  Applying this to the information seeking environment, taskwork are actions that directly related there are more  X  X ndirect search X  than  X  X ir ect search X  actions in CEC. The indirect search tactics such as  X  X -C X ,  X  X -W X  and  X  X -C X  are not directly related to user X  X  task-work but more close to user X  X  explicit and implicit communication for supporting team partners to collaboratively finish tasks more efficiently. Chat represents explicit communication while the workspace represents implicit communication. C-C and W-tion pairs in COC. It might indicate the explicit communication also promotes implicit communication between team members. W-W appears more often in CEC and COC than in IND because there is only one member in IND. The fact that large percentages of  X  X ndirect search X  actions (C-C and W-W) in CEC make the percentages of  X  X irect search X  action pairs (Q-V, V-V, V-S) in CEC relatively less. This might suggest that actual search. Differences among three conditions are also existed on Save-related participants in CEC needed to reach agreement on what were relevant and they had more stringent criteria on what results to collect. 5.2 Pre-action analysis For a given action, the pre-action analysis uncovers the detailed information about what actions precede it. Our analysis focused on pre-actions of Chat in CEC because it is the explicit communication behavior for supporting search process. We also ex-amined pre-actions on Query in all three conditions for better understanding what caused the participants to query in all three conditions. Pre-chat Analysis in CEC common action before chat is chat itself, which suggests the continuousness of chat actions. The second common action before Chat is Topic. The reason might be after quirements and allocate sub-tasks. The next possible action before Chat is Workspace. This suggest that after viewing, editing or commenting the items saved in the  X  X eam workspace X , participants also need to exp licitly communicate with each other to in-form or discuss the updates and changes in the shared  X  X eam Workspace X . Pre-query Analysis in CEC, COC and IND Figure 3(b) visualizes the proportion of predecessors of Query action in three differ-ent conditions. The visualized result clearly shows the difference in three conditions. The most common action before Query is Chat in CEC while the most common ac-tion before Query is Save in COC and IND. This indicates that the explicit communi-cation in CEC helps participants to generate ideas of queries. However, in COC and IND, participants get ideas of queries from the previous collected results. The second common action before query is the same in all the three condition, which is Topic. It is easy to understand that participants need to check the task requirements before Query to Query is the lowest in CEC and highest in IND with COC in between. This may suggest that as the collaboration level increase, participants had higher chance of issuing good queries. Further analysis is needed to testify this hypothesis. 5.3 Post-Action Analy s Opposite to pre-action ana l tion about what actions su c of Chat in CEC.

However, pre-query analysis demonstrates the possible benefit of explicit communication in CEC condition on helping users to generate queries. The pre-ch at analysis revealed that the reasons that trigger the chatting might include needs for discussing task requirements and item collected. Further studies are needed to reveal the effect of explicit and implicit com-munication on the task performance. Chat represents explicit communication while the Workspace represents implicit communication. Our findings indicate that both types of communication are common in CEC. Th e fact that participants exhibit higher percentage of Workspace-related actions than participants in COC might indicate that the explicit communication between participants promote implicit communication in the mean time. Although not as many as in CEC, Workspace-related actions are still important proportions of participants X  actions in COC. Since users could not explicitly search system a shared workspace to su pport implicit communication. One difference we observed is that participants in COC used the workspace more than participants in IND. This confirms that a shared workspace is essential in supporting COC. 
We also found that transitions within direct search actions and within indirect search actions are more frequent than between direct search actions and indirect search actions in all three conditions. However, in CEC condition, transition between conditions. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons caused these different types of transitions and their effects on task performance in order to gain insights on how these transitions should be facilitated by the collaborative search system. In this study, we analyzed the patterns of action transitions by aggregating all the partici-pants X  actions in each condition in order to get the common patterns. Another way to analyze the data is to analyze the action and action transition patterns of each individ-the relationship between the participants X  actions patterns and their performance on the tasks. These are something we will do in the future work. 
We acknowledge some limitations of this study. First, we only considered teams with two members in CEC and COC. It would be different when more people are involved in collaboration. Second, the participants only performed one search session In sum, this study provides some guidance for designers on the range of behaviors and activities that a collaborative search system should support. Further studies are needed to fully understand them. Acknowledgements. This work was supported in parts by National Science Founda-tion grant IIS-1052773 and III-COR 0704628.
