Formation systems have been designed to facilitate the formation of optimal groups in learning. However, evaluating the quality of automated group formation is not always well report ed. In this paper we propose a metrics framework for evaluating group formation based upon a model for constraint satisfa ction-based group formation.

Collaboration has long been considered an effective approach to learning. Research in many disciplines has shown th at learning within groups improves the students X  learning exper ience by enabling peers to learn from each other. For a coll aborative activity to achieve its learning goal, student have to be allocated to appropriate groups that maximizes their individual learning goals in addition to their groups X  goals. In this context , the collaboration goal is usually associated with a set of requiremen ts that have to be satisfied to ensure that the formed groups achie ve this goal. 
In education, teachers often have to deal with grou p formation (GF) manually which can sometimes turn into a very complex task especially if the number of students in the cl ass is large. This has led researchers to investigate several techniqu es for automating this process through the use of computer -supported group formation (CSGF). However, in most existing r esearch, the applications developed are only evaluated against f ew metrics that do not always reflect their efficiency in forming a ppropriate groupings; but rather assume that a positive group output can be interpreted as a success of the followed group form ation approach. 
We believe that to conduct a group formation effici ency study, different measurement variables are required. In th is paper, we discuss the different metrics that have been consid ered in existing applications. We propose a framework where we descr ibe the set of possible metrics for evaluating group formation efficiency, how to measure them, and the relationship between them. The proposed framework is to be used to analyze the eff iciency measurements of a constrained group formation syste m that we previously introduced in [4]. 
There are different approaches to forming groups in education. In [4], we explained that although self selecting form ation, where the students get to choose their collaborators, is an e ffective approach in building networks and communities of students, i nstructor based formation, where the teacher is the initiator of the formation, is more effective in learning. In this c ontext, the instructor has to form balanced groups of students in terms of expected performance, such that no group will have all the top students, while another have weak ones. In other te rms, all groups will have an equal chance to perform well and achie ve the goals of the collaborative activity, although this may co nflict with the best interest of individual students. Therefore, to form the groups, the instructor has to think about modeling the coll aboration goal in a way that satisfies both the collaboration task that the students have to achieve as a group, in addition to their in dividual needs. 
In CSGF applications, most research is based on the mathematical modeling of agents X  coalition, team, club, or netwo rks formation algorithms. Efficiency in this context is usually m easured in terms of the algorithm used for the formation. In this pa per, we analyse group formation efficiency in learning regardless o f the algorithm used to generate it. This allows the possibility of evaluating different algorithms for the same collaborative goa l. 
Since the introduction of CSGF applications, effici ency of group formation systems has been measured in different wa ys. Examples of these measurements are given in the following li terature. In [6], Soh et al. introduced a multiagent intellig ent system called 
I-MINDS where the instructor, each student, and eac h group is represented by an agent. The student agents form co alitions dynamically in real-time where each bids to join it s favorite group based on their previous performance in group work. To evaluate their application, the authors measured the effectiveness of IMINDS in terms of how effective and easy to use th e system was for instructors and students. The group formation i tself was evaluated against the performance of the teams, which was measured based on the teams X  outcomes ( rewards ) and students X  responses in a series of questionnaires that evalua tes team-based efficacy , peer rating, and individual evaluation . The first metric was used to determine the perceived success of a te am by each member, the second metric was used to help evaluate individuals and how well a team has worked together, while the last metric was used as a self rating measure to check for resp onse consistency with the peer rating. The agent compute s a weighted score to each efficacy question, and each member X  X  score is tallied and multiplied with the peer-based weight. In [8], the authors introduced a web based system t hat forms the students groups using knowledge about the collabora tion context in real-time. Although the authors did not present any results evaluating their system, they mentioned that the comprehensibility of the group formation algorithms and the satisfaction of learning groups to be a key factor of the overall approach accepta nce. Redmond [5] introduce a computer program to aid the assignment of students X  projects groups using an instructor-ba sed approach. The students are grouped, using a greedy algorithm, based on the time slot they prefer to collaborate in, and then a llocate the projects to the groups based on the members X  prefer ences in the group. The groups are then manually checked for eve n distribution of grades, and the students who are le ft unassigned are manually allocated to groups. To measure the effici ency of the formation program, the author introduced an evaluat ion formula that calculated the rating of group assignments by subtracting an unassigned penalty representing the program failure in assigning students from the sum of all formed group overall rating . Where a group rating is the product of rating for the satisfaction of each condition . The rating of each constraint is calculated separ ately (context dependent). For example, group project rat ing is the product of squares of students X  rating of the assig ned projects. Another way to evaluate formation efficiency in CSG F systems is to compare the results (the formed groups) generate d by the system to manually generated results of the same pa rticipants X  sample [3]. This technique is usually used in exper t recommender systems where the formation is based on finding an expert to help a weaker learner [7]. In a different domain such as industrial organizati ons, group effectiveness is defined as the group X  X  productivity in relation to the needs of the organization [1]. Effectiveness in this context is measured in terms of the group X  synergy, performanc e objectives, skills, use of resources, and innovation. These var iables are measured using questionnaires designed to combine t he measurements of internal dynamics and external grou p outputs that facilitate the group X  X  self-assessment [1]. Th e team performance is assessed in terms of the mean and standard deviation of individual team members X  responses across the s ix domains. In the same domain, group formation ( team composition ) is calculated in terms of diversity of membership [2] as it has been shown that team composition has an i nfluence on the team cohesion, communication, conflicts, and cr eativity in terms of the team X  X  degree of diversity or homogene ity. In addition to these metrics, CSGF system can also be evaluated in terms of the traditional system quality measurem ents such as reliability, and robustness. Other metrics such as formation complexity in terms of complexity of the algorithm used to form the groups (i.e. complexity measures of memory spac e and time) can be considered if the algorithm is defined. In d ynamic groups such as coalition formation and social networks for mation, one of the metrics for evaluating efficiency is the stability of the groups, a measurement of the changing membership of the gro up. From the literature, we observe that the limitation of most GF applications is the exclusive reliance on the group s X  performance measures indicators such as members X  responses to q uestionnaires or post-tests to draw inference about the group for mation system performance. From a learning viewpoint at least, gr oup formation efficiency is clearly a multi-dimensional concept, which implies that multiple efficiency indicators besides perceiv ed performance need to be employed. While different formation constraints might result in different formulas for calculating efficiency, these constrai nts can be related to GF efficiency in a more abstract way. If so, consideration in defining this relation together wi th other group formation related measures is required. In this study, we are concerned with the evaluation of the group formation in terms of how well the groups were form ed rather than how well the groups performed. If the instruc tor models the collaboration goals for the individuals and the gro ups as a set of requirements (constraints), then, the success of gr oup formation in this context is defined by the satisfaction of the constraints that define these goals. To facilitate the evaluation of group formation, we propose an analytical metrics X  framework that de fines what we mean by formation success. To achieve this, we firs t make the following assumptions: each participant in the clas s should belong to exactly one group (i.e. non-overlapping group fo rmation), all groups should have the same optimal number of parti cipants (i.e. all groups have a similar size), and all formed gro ups are stable. Constraints : we define a constraint as any parameter, variable , or condition that affects the process of the group for mation (i.e. in CSGF, the variables that influence the system X  X  dec ision of allocating participants to appropriate groups). We define the finite set of all possible constraints as C = { }. Collaboration Task: we define task t as the task of the collaboration activity that the instructor intends for the students X  groups to perform. In education, the instructor usu ally selects a set of collaboration goals { , ... } that assist in achieving the task (i.e. helps the collaborative activity to achi eve maximum learning gain for the groups and individuals partic ipants). For example if the task is a software engineering group project, then example goals can be that all groups are to be bala nced in terms of students experience in the field; no female student can be allocated alone in an all-male group; and groups sh ould be multicultural in terms of students X  nationalities. Collaboration Goal: we define a collaboration goal  X  to achieve task t as a set of constraints = { that the instructor chooses to model the requiremen ts for achieving the goal, where each constraint is associated with a value  X  that represents the importance of the constraint in achieving the goal . We define A (C ) as the finite set of all possible goals. In the example above, the const raints for modeling the goals can be respectively: for each gr oup {average percentage of members X  experience average percentage of members X  experience in the next group} n o of females of international students n o of international from the same country &lt; n o of participants in the group}. The last goal is presented with two constraints. The constraints can overlap between the goals with different values for each goal: Participants : we define the finite set of all individual partic ipants (all students in the class) P = { , , ... }, where M = |P| &gt; 1 is the size of the class. Groups : we define a group as a set of participants that have at least 2 elements in it (i.e. | | &gt; 1), where each participant a member of the group. We define the set of all possible gr oups ! " #$%&amp;%'&amp; ! (P) ( ) *+ , Cohort: we define a cohort as the set of pairwise disjoint groups define G X  X  G as the set of all cohorts that have all their gr oups of size X ( ./01'%121314&amp; 54&amp;%1#1&amp;6 | = X 78 where d is the acceptable deviation for the group size). Therefore , each cohort in G has cardinality N ! 9 and X &gt; 1. Formation : We define a relation R from (A) to G X that maps a set of goals to a set of N disjoint groups. This re lation can be any algorithm applied to the set of goals. Therefore, f or each set of goals, there is more than one possible set of group ing (allocating students to groups) and therefore more than one pos sible cohort. This is because although if participants have similar characteristics in relation to the constraints mode ling the goals, then the cohort with in group : is not the same as the cohort with in group : . We refer to each single grouping of R as a formation . We say that a formation is defined by the set of goals that determines the cohort: ;&lt;=&gt; ? ? ? ! -. Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of the relation ships between the collaboration goals and the group formation. (t he values of constraints are not shown due to space limit). Productivity: we define productivity as the output of the group o r the cohort in relation to the task t that is measured on an absolute scale by the instructor or an examiner of the colla borative activity. We refer by constraint satisfaction quality to how well the constraints of a goal ? : were satisfied in the formation of the groups. We use this metric to evaluate the formation quality later.
Group Constraint Satisfaction Quality : we use this metric to refer to how well a group is formed in relation to how well the students X  allocation (to that group) satisfied a co nstraint . For each group in the formed cohort, and for each in the set of constraint of k ( k ) we define a function  X  cg ( , ) that determines whether satisfies the constraint such that: ; @A B C ! D 5. 5##'&amp;5#E51F  X 
Cohort Constraint Satisfaction Quality: we use this metric to refer to how well were all the groups formed in ter ms of satisfying the constraint of goal k . We define the function calculates the degree to which the formed groups ar e balances (i.e. clustered together) in terms of . The Cohort Constraint Satisfaction is therefore defined by ; JK BL C ! M where the = 0 , which is the maximum value for ; K ), and by the mean of the groups constraint satisfaction quality ; JQ R R R R ! O S ; We use this metric to refer to how well the formati on was perceived in terms of participants X  satisfaction wi th the allocations to groups:  X 
Individual Perceived Formation Satisfaction : we use this metric to refer to how pleased is the individual with bein g allocated a member of the group. Individual satisfaction is usu ally evaluated using self-assessment questionnaires. Since the que stionnaires are usually composed of statements on the Likert scale or the 6 points scale, the satisfactions can be given a weight s i for each individual p where s i can be the mean of the questions X  results.  X 
Group Formation Satisfaction: we use this metric to refer to the individual satisfactions of all the members of the group. We define the function U A that calculates the satisfaction balance among the members such that the group satisfaction is defined by U ! This metric can be also used to monitor the interac tions values of the collaboration such as assistance and conflicts.  X 
Cohort Perceived Formation Satisfaction: Similar to previous analysis, the cohort perceived satisfaction is defi ned in terms of U ! satisfactions U A and their mean U \ R R R = Y S U A 9 We refer by quality Q ( t ) to how well the group achieved the collaborative task t specified by the instructor. This is a measure of the quality of the group X  X  outcome (sometimes re ferred to as output or reward) against an absolute scale defined by the instructor or an examiner of the groups X  output. In learning, this is usually given in the form of grades or credit to th e group. If both the collaboration goal and quality measure are defi ned by the instructor, then this is a consistent measure. We use this metric to refer to how well the groups were formed in terms of satisfying a goal k within the collaboration task t .  X 
Group Goal Satisfaction Quality: we use this metric to refer to how well a group is formed, in terms of how well the students X  allocation (to that group) satisfied the goal ? : . We define Group Goal Satisfaction Quality for goal k as a function calculates the quality of a group in terms of ? : and therefore all constraints of goal k = {c 1 , c 2 ...c L } such that:  X  Cohort Goal Satisfaction Quality: we refer by Cohort Goal Satisfaction to how well were all the groups formed in terms of satisfying the collaboration goal ? : and hence the constraints that model it. We define the function ; K ? : that calculates the degree to which the formed groups are balances in relation the goal This metrics is therefore defined by: ; K ? : ! M] We refer by this metric to how well the groups were formed in terms of satisfying all the goals of the collaboration task t . 
Group Formation Quality: This metric evaluates how well was a group formed in terms of all the goals. Similar t o the previous calculation of group quality, for each group :  X 
Cohort Formation Quality: This metric evaluates how well the cohort was formed in terms of all the goals and the refore the task. We define the function ; bK c ! ; bK ? ? ? that calculates the degree to which the formed groups are balanced in relation the collaboration task c . The Formation Quality is hence defined by: ; ; R R R ! To analyze how useful (effective) are the constrain ts for a given goal, and the goals for a given task, we need to ev aluate the formation quality of all possible formations over m any runs using the same set of constraints for the goals. For each goal, if the resulting formation quality is constantly high, the n if the goal satisfaction quality is high, and the constraint sa tisfaction quality for that goal is low, we consider that constraint t o have a low significance in modeling that goal. Similarly, if t he quality of the goal satisfaction is low, but the quality of constr aint satisfaction for that goal is high, then the constraint has a lo w significance in modeling the goal. However, if the formation qualit y is low, then the constraint significance will be undefined despi te the state of the goal satisfaction and the constraint satisfacti on. For a large number of evaluated formations, we can evaluate the behaviour ( consistency ) and therefore the reliability of the constraints and goals, and consequently, the effectiveness of the formation using these constraints in the collaboration. Optimal Formation: we define the optimal formation ;&lt;=&gt; efg c of the relation R as the optimal cohort that can re sult from the set of goals, such that the formation qual ity metrics  X  and ; bQ R R R R are maximized. We refer by  X  optG objective functions of the quality of ;&lt;=&gt; efg c , So far, we assumed that to achieve the collaboratio n task, a CSGF system would apply the optimal formation to the giv en set of participants. However, unless the system is appoint ed to the optimal formation, it will select a formation at ra ndom. A possible way to know which formation is optimal is for the s ystem to search for the optimal formation by calculating the quality of each possible formation generated by the set of given go als as shown in Procedure 1. These calculations however, mean that the system has to generate all the possible formations in orde r to return the optimal one, which results in a high complexity, gi ven the number of formed cohorts, the number of groups in each coh ort, the number of goals, and the number of constraints for each goal. Procedure 1 Calculating group formation quality Given task t, ;&lt;=&gt; efg c  X  optG c for each formation ;&lt;=&gt; k for each group in the cohort for each goal ? : c calculate Q ? : and ; JQ R R R R calculate bQ c ! bQ ? ? ? and ; Q R R R calculate ; bK c ! ; bK ? ? ? and ; bQ R R R R then ;&lt;=&gt; efg l ;&lt;=&gt; k In this paper, we introduced a metrics framework fo r evaluating group formation based on constraint and goal satisf action for CSGF systems within the leaning domain. As discusse d before, the choice of constraints has a significant impact on the performance of the group. However, in this research , we consider the choice of constraints to be the responsibility of the formation initiator (in this case, the instructor) [4]. There fore, a successful group is a group that has been well formed in relat ion to the constraints of the formation, and not one that perf ormed well in the collaborative task. For future work, we intend to use this framework to evaluate the instructor based computer supported group formation system described in [4]. [1] Bateman, B., Wilson, C. &amp; Bingham, D.
