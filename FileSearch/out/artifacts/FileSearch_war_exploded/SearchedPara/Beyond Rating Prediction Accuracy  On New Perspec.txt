 This paper proposes a number of studies in order to move recommender systems beyond the traditional paradigm and the classical perspective of rating prediction accuracy. We contribute to existing helpful but less explored paradigms and also propose new approaches aiming at more useful recommendations for both users and businesses. Working toward this direction, we discuss the studies we have con-ducted so far and present our future research plans. In par-ticular, we move our focus from even more accurate rating predictions and aim at offering a holistic experience to the users by avoiding the over-specialization of generated recom-mendations and providing the users with sets of non-obvious but high quality recommendations that fairly match their interests and they will remarkably like.

Over the last two decades, a wide variety of different types of recommender systems (RSs) has been developed and suc-cessfully used across several domains [6]. During this time, many researchers have focused mainly on the development and improvement of efficient algorithms for more accurate rating prediction. Although the recommendations of the lat-est class of systems are significantly more accurate than they used to be a decade ago [7] and the broad social and busi-ness acceptance of RSs has already been achieved, there is still a long way to go in terms of satisfaction of users X  actual needs [14]. This is due, primarily, to the fact that many existing RSs focus on providing more accurate rather than more useful recommendations. Some of the main problems pertaining to this narrow rating prediction accuracy-based focus of many existing RSs [8] and the ways to broaden the current approaches have been discussed in [18].

Even though the aforementioned rating prediction per-spective is the prevailing paradigm in recommender systems, there are other perspectives that try to alleviate the prob-lems pertaining to this narrow rating prediction accuracy-based focus and have been gaining significant attention in the field of RS [10]. In particular, some of the most re-cent perspectives maintain that RSs should make the users familiar with the various product categories and the whole product catalog. In addition, recommender systems should provide personalized recommendations from a wide range of items and should also enable the users to find relevant items that might be hard to discover. Also, they should increase user satisfaction and engagement and offer a superior user experience. Moreover, RSs should also be able to reduce user search costs, improve the quality of decisions that consumers make, and increase their welfare. Besides, from a business perspective, RSs should increase the sales volume and con-version rates, as well as promote items from the long tail that usually exhibit significantly lower marginal cost and, at the same time, higher marginal profit.

Moving beyond the classical perspective of the rating pre-diction accuracy, the main objective of this stream of re-search is to contribute to existing helpful but less explored paradigms of RSs as well as to propose new approaches that will result in more useful recommendations for both users and businesses. Working toward this direction, we discuss the studies we have conducted so far and present our future research plans. In particular, we move our fo-cus from even more accurate rating predictions and aim at offering a holistic experience to the users by avoiding the over-specialization of recommendations and providing the users with non-obvious but high quality recommendation sets (not restricted to simple lists of individual items) that fairly match their interests and they will remarkably like.
Other streams of research that improve recommender sys-tems going beyond rating prediction accuracy include work on human-computer interaction (HCI), which involves the study and design of the interaction between users and RSs, diversification , which maximizes the variety of items in a recommendation list, group recommenders [19], which rec-ommend items for groups of people, rather than individuals, and recommendation sequences [17], where sequences of or-dered items are recommended instead of single items.
In this stream of research, we are moving beyond the clas-sical perspective of the rating prediction accuracy and we are aiming at providing even more useful recommendations for both users and businesses. Working toward this direction, we designed a number of research studies to explore issues re-lated to several new approaches for providing recommenda-tions. In particular, Section 2.1 proposes a concept of unex-pectedness and specific metrics to measure both unexpected-ness and quality of recommendations, as well as algorithms for generating such recommendations. Then, Section 2.2 in-troduces a method for generating recommendations based on recommendation opportunities using higher weighted per-centiles . Finally, Section 2.3 discusses recommendation sets where the generated recommendation lists are based on sets of candidate items, rather than just individual items, also taking into account various interactions among items, such as complementarity and substitution effects. All these re-search studies go beyond the classical perspective of RSs and aim at providing the users with non-obvious but high quality recommendation sets that fairly match their inter-ests and they will remarkably like. Thorough discussions of these concepts, implementation details, and experimental results are provided in [2, 5, 4, 3].
Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 address the over-specialization problem in recommender systems focusing on unexpected-ness and the related concepts of coverage, novelty, serendip-ity, and diversity of recommendation lists.
In [2, 3], we propose a concept of unexpected recommenda-tions as recommending those items that significantly depart from the expectations of the users and suggest a method for generating such recommendations, based on the utility the-ory of economics, as well as specific metrics to measure the unexpectedness of recommendation lists.

In particular, we formally define the concept of unexpect-edness in recommender systems taking into account the ac-tual expectations of the users and discuss how the concept of unexpectedness is differentiated from various related no-tions, such as novelty, serendipity, and diversity. Following the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, we approach this difficult problem of finding and recommending unexpected items by first capturing the items expected by the users. Toward this direction, we suggest several mechanisms for specify-ing users X  expectations that can be applied across various domains. Such mechanisms include the past transactions performed by the users, knowledge discovery and data min-ing techniques, and experts X  domain knowledge. Besides, we formulate and fully operationalize the notion of unexpected-ness and present an algorithm for providing unexpected rec-ommendations of high quality that are hard to discover but fairly match the users X  interests, based on the utility theory of economics. Moreover, we propose specific performance metrics to measure the unexpectedness of the generated rec-ommendation lists taking into account also the usefulness of individual items.

Using  X  X eal-world X  data sets, various examples of sets of expected recommendations, and different utility functions and distance metrics, we were able to test the proposed method under a large number of experimental settings in-cluding various levels of sparsity, different mechanisms for specifying users X  expectations, and different cardinalities of these sets of expectations. The empirical study showed that all the examined variations of the proposed method signifi-cantly outperformed in terms of unexpectedness the stan-dard baseline algorithms, including item-based and user-based k -Nearest Neighbors [13], Slope One [16], and Ma-trix Factorization [15]. This demonstrates that the pro-posed method indeed effectively captures the concept of un-expectedness since, in principle, it should do better than unexpectedness-agnostic methods. Furthermore, the pro-posed method for unexpected recommendations performed at least as well as, and in some cases even better than, the baseline algorithms in terms of the classical accuracy-based measures, such as root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the F-measure, as well as other popular performance measures, such as catalog coverage, aggregate diversity, serendipity, and the Gini coefficient. In addition, we presented a number of actual recommendation examples generated by the pro-posed method and the employed baseline approaches and provided insightful qualitative comments.

One of the main premises of the proposed method is that the users X  expectations should be explicitly considered in or-der to provide the users with unexpected recommendations of high quality that are hard to discover but fairly match their interests. Hence, the greatest improvements both in terms of unexpectedness and accuracy vis-`a-vis all other ap-proaches were observed in the experiments using the more accurate sets of expectations. Moreover, the use of a util-ity function of standard form illustrates that the proposed method can be easily implemented in existing recommender systems as a new component that enhances unexpectedness of recommendations, without the need to further modify the current rating prediction procedures.
In [4], we propose a new probabilistic method for neigh-borhood selection in collaborative filtering (CF) models. In particular, we illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed approach presenting a specific variation of the clas-sical k -nearest neighbors ( k -NN) CF method in which the neighborhood selection is based on an underlying probability distribution instead of just the k neighbors with the high-est similarity level to the target user. For the probabilis-tic neighborhood selection, we use an efficient method for weighted sampling [21] of k neighbors without replacement that also takes into consideration the similarity levels be-tween the target user and the n candidate neighbors. The key intuition for this probabilistic nearest neighbors collab-orative filtering method is two-fold. First, using the neigh-borhood with the most similar users to estimate unknown ratings and recommend candidate items, the generated rec-ommendation lists usually consist of known items with which the users are already familiar. Second, because of the multi-dimensionality of users X  tastes, there are many items that the target user may like and are unknown to the k most similar users to her/him. Thus, we propose the use of probabilistic neighborhood selection in order to alleviate the aforemen-tioned problems and move beyond the limited focus of rating prediction accuracy.

To investigate this claim, we conducted an empirical study and we tested the proposed method under a large number of experimental settings. In detail, we used a large number of probability distributions from different families of distribu-tions with various location and shape parameters, in order to compare the proposed probabilistic method for neighbor-hood selection against the standard collaborative filtering approach in terms of popular evaluation metrics for item prediction accuracy, utility-based ranking, coverage, diver-sity, unexpectedness, and dispersion of recommendations.
The experimental results illustrate that the proposed ap-proach indeed generates recommendations that are orthogo-nal to the classical CF method. We also demonstrated that the proposed method performs at least as well as, and in some cases even better than, the standard user-based CF approach in terms of popular item prediction accuracy and utility-based ranking measures, such as the F-measure and the normalized cumulative discounted gain, across various experimental settings. Besides, we showed that the perfor-mance improvement is not achieved at the expense of some other popular performance measures that go beyond the rat-ing prediction accuracy, such as catalog coverage, aggregate diversity, and recommendation dispersion and mobility.
In [5], under a definition of a recommendation opportunity as how much a user could realistically like an item, we aim at recommending items that the users will remarkably like. Moving beyond the standard perspective of rating prediction accuracy and exploring such recommendation opportunities can increase user satisfaction and engagement and offer a superior user experience through the discovery of items that the users will really like.

In particular, we illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed approach presenting a certain variation of the classical user-based k -NN collaborative filtering method in which the estimation of an unknown rating of the target user for an item is based not on the weighted averages of the k nearest neighbors but on the weighted percentile of the rat-ings of these k neighbors. For the estimation of the weighted percentile of the distribution of the ratings in the neighbor-hood of the target user, an efficient method is used that does not increase the computational complexity of the classical k -NN method. The key intuition behind the weighted per-centile method, instead of using weighted averages, is that high percentiles (such as in the 70% to 90% range) consti-tute more realistic estimates of how much a targeted user could possibly like the candidate item. As a consequence, the proposed approach not only provides more useful for the users recommendations of items that they remarkably like but also has the potential to let us better identify and serve any specific niches of the market.

To support this claim, we conducted an empirical study and showed that the proposed percentile method outper-forms by a wide margin, across various experimental set-tings, the standard user-based CF approach in terms of item prediction accuracy measures, such as precision, recall, and the F-measure, and also utility-based ranking metrics, such as normalized cumulative discounted gain and mean recip-rocal rank. Finally, we demonstrated that this performance improvement is not achieved at the expense of some other popular performance measures, such as catalog coverage, ag-gregate diversity, and the Gini coefficient. This illustrates that our proposed weighted percentile method for recom-mendation opportunities performs at least as well as, or even significantly better than, the classical user-based collabora-tive filtering method in terms of these important measures, in most of the experiments.

Nevertheless, apart from the user-based and item-based k -NN CF approaches, other popular RSs methods that can be easily extended, with the use of quantile regression [12], in order to allow us both to build models that predict high percentiles and to evaluate them with regard to the goal of predicting percentiles of estimated ratings, include content-based methods and Matrix Factorization [11].
In the classical recommendation system paradigms, the generated recommendation lists are based on the top-N items with the highest estimated ratings regardless of the possible interaction effects among the candidate items. One excep-tion of this paradigm is the concept of diversity, according to which the variety of items in a recommendation list is max-imized. However, in many recommendation settings there are important interactions among the candidate items that should be explicitly considered. For instance, in a clothing on-line retail setting the utility of recommending to a user a specific pair of pants depends on whether a matching shirt is also included in the same recommendation list or not. Sim-ilarly, in the case of a RS for a supermarket, the utility of recommending olive oil to a user might depend on whether feta cheese and tomatoes are recommended as well.

In our next study, moving beyond the classical recommen-dation lists of individual items with the highest estimated ratings and working toward our objective of providing the users with non-obvious but high quality recommendation sets that fairly match their interests and they will really like, we will propose to generate recommendation sets , rather than individual items, taking into account various interac-tions effects among the candidate items [9], the potential prerequisites and constraints of the items [20], and the lim-ited budget of the users [22]. In particular, we will focus on co-occurrence interaction effects, such as complementar-ity and substitution effects, aiming at developing effective methods for both accurately estimating the various effects and efficiently recommending such sets of items.

To experimentally test the proposed approach we plan to conduct a live experiment involving human subjects. In de-tail, we plan to design an on-line experiment and examine the proposed paradigm in the context of massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) [1]. As part of the experiment, we will generate personalized recommendations for MOOCs taking into account the academic major of the human subject, the various dependencies among the courses, such as the com-plementarity and substitution effects, and different prereq-uisites and constraints, such the difficulty and the estimated workload of each recommended course.
Successfully completing the aforementioned work will help the recommender systems field move further beyond the per-spective of rating prediction accuracy. Following the pro-posed stream of research and adhering to our main objective of providing more useful recommendations for both users and businesses, we both contribute to existing helpful but less explored paradigms for recommender systems and pro-pose new valuable approaches and perspectives. Working toward this direction of providing more useful recommenda-tions for both users and businesses, we discussed the studies we have conducted so far and also presented in detail some of our future research plans. In particular, the studies dis-cussed in Section 2 move our focus from even more accurate rating predictions and aim at offering a holistic experience to the users by avoiding the over-specialization of recom-mendations and providing the users with non-obvious but high quality recommendation sets that fairly match their interests and they will remarkably like.

In detail, Section 2.1 proposes a concept of unexpected-ness and specific metrics to measure both unexpectedness and quality of recommendations, as well as algorithms for generating such recommendations, Section 2.2 introduces a method for generating recommendations that the users will remarkably like based on recommendation opportunities us-ing higher weighted percentiles , and Section 2.3 discusses rec-ommendation sets , rather than individual items, taking into account various interactions among items, such as comple-mentarity and substitution effects.

As part of the future work, we would like to implement and evaluate the proposed approaches in a traditional on-line retail setting as well as in a platform for massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) [1]. Besides, we would like to con-duct a series of live controlled experiments with human sub-jects in order to study the on-line user behavior, examine and actively adjust the trade-off between exploration (e.g. unexpectedness, serendipity, diversity, etc.) and exploita-tion (e.g. accuracy) of recommender systems, and better evaluate the proposed perspectives in a user-centric frame-work. In addition, we plan to investigate how the proposed recommendation approaches and perspectives can be effec-tively combined with traditional approaches in hybrid rec-ommender systems aiming at accurate and non-obvious rec-ommendation sets that the users will remarkably like.
Furthermore, the generated recommendations should be useful for both users and businesses and, hence, as part of our future work, we would also like to focus more on the business perspective and the business value aspects of rec-ommender systems. Thus, we would like to design an em-pirical study in order to examine the economic impact of the proposed recommender system approaches and perspec-tives across various domains and recommendation settings. In particular, we would like to study and estimate the eco-nomic impact of both the direct effect of offering recom-mendations from a wider range of items that are harder to discover and the indirect effect of recommending items from the long tail and not focusing mostly on bestsellers that usu-ally exhibit higher marginal cost. Such a research study can shed more light on the usefulness of recommender systems for businesses and further promote the use of non-classical perspectives and approaches that go beyond the traditional paradigm of rating prediction accuracy.

Moreover, the proposed program of research can be ex-tended in various other valuable directions. For instance, the main strengths and weaknesses of the different existing recommender system algorithms, in terms of the multiple objectives of the aforementioned perspectives and metrics, should be thoroughly examined and, if possible, the  X  X est X  mixture in each context among all the existing and pro-posed approaches should be identified. Finally, the possible spillover effects of the proposed approaches on other impor-tant objectives and properties of recommender systems, such as the trustworthiness and persuasiveness of recommenda-tions, should be extensively examined as well.
