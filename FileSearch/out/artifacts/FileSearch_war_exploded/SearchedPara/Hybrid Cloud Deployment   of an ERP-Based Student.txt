 In many comprehensive universities, a student administration system used to support administrative workflows for over ten thousand students. Throughout an academic examination results, where a large number of concurrent accesses are recorded within a short period of time. These accesses are made both within and outside the campus. In order to accommodate a large volume of accesses, especially concurrent accesses, the capacity planning on system infrastructure must be done accurately. One difficult especially during some seasonal peaks of concurrent accesses. Cloud computing is a feasible solution to meet the challenge. 
Cloud computing is characterized by the ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources, such as networks, computer servers, operating systems, storage, applications and processing services, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort, control or service provider interaction [1]. Typically, cloud computing providers offer three models of services, and four models of deployment, namely, private cloud, community cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud [1, 2]. This paper describes a successful case of hybrid-cloud deployment of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) based student administration system at the Open University of Hong Kong [3]. The University is currently adopting an ERP solution, Peoplesoft Campus Solution which is a very popular in higher education institutions in the North America, for its student administration [4]. The University offer programmes in both full-time and distance-learning modes, and therefore, substantial customizations had to be made on the student administration system in order to support both the full-time and distance-learning student administration. Although a cloud option of Peoplesoft Campus Solution is available in the form of Software as a Service, it does not support customizations of the ERP functional modules [5]. 
Typically, a web-based ERP system adopts a three-tier architecture, namely, the Azure is subscribed for platform as a service [6]. The web tier and application tier are deployed to hybrid cloud while the database tier resides on premises (i.e. on campus). cloud is configured to support customization of functional modules of the system. Second, the databases are resided in the campus, where accesses are controlled by both external firewalls and internal firewalls. This hybrid-cloud deployment was successfully implemented in 2014. Evaluation with respect to cost and performance was conducted, and promising results are obtained. 
In this paper, our experience in the implementation is shared, and the benefits are motivation of hybrid-cloud deployment for the student administration system at the Open University of Hong Kong. Section 3 then describes the implementation of this hybrid-cloud deployment. Section 4 shows a technical evaluation of the hybrid-cloud deployment. Section 5 concludes this paper. Like many universities in the North America, the Open University of Hong Kong is using Peoplesoft Campus Solution, which is a major ERP solution in the market, to support its student administration workflows [4]. At present, the University has about 20,000 active students, 8,000 being full-time students and 12,000 being part-time and distance-learning students. The system is a web-based application, where all accesses are made through web browsers. There are on average thousands of accesses per day. About 80% of the accesses are made outside the campus while the rest 20% of the accesses are made within the campus. 
Throughout an academic year, there are se veral occasions where excessive volume of concurrent accesses is made within a short period of time. Typical examples are the accesses, the traditional way is to expand the capacity of web tier and application tier. The Internet bandwidth is also increased accordingly. However, the investment is only for several seasonal peaks of concurrent accesses, and the total duration of these seasonal peaks amounts to less than 20 days per year. Most of the time, the expanded capacity is not fully used. 
A definite advantage of cloud computing services is to pay as you go. With a high degree of leverage, this relieves the occasional high processing demands on the web investigate the possibility of subscribing cloud computing services and deploying its ERP-based student administration system on cloud, with an aim to devise a feasible implementation that achieves the cost-performance balance. 
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, cloud computing model exhibits five essential characteristics. They include on-demand self-services, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured services [1]. There are three service models of cloud computing, as listed below.  X  Software as a Service. This refers to the services provided for the customers to  X  Platform as a Service. This refers to the services provided for the customers to  X  Infrastructure as a Service. This refers to the services provided for the 
In general, there are four options of cloud deployment to be offered by the cloud computing services providers.  X  Private Cloud. This refers to a cloud infrastructure solely for an organization.  X  Community Cloud. This refers to a cloud infrastructure solely for a specific  X  Public Cloud. This refers to a cloud infrastructure that is open for the general  X  Hybrid Cloud. This refers a combination of two distinct cloud infrastructures, 
The Open University of Hong Kong is now using the Peoplesoft Campus Solution, version 9.0, with functional modules including academic advisement, campus self-service, contributor relations, financial aid, gradebook, recruiting and admission, student administration, student financials, and student records [4]. The Peoplesoft PeopleTools, version 8.53, is being used [7]. Besides, the back-end database system is running Oracle Database, version 12c, with the In-Memory option enabled [8]. Before moving to the cloud environment, the student administration system was deployed on premises. An in-house ERP infrastructure, comprising web tier, application tier and database tier, is used. 
The student administration system used to support two different sets of student administration workflows, one for full-time students and the other for part-time or distance-learning students. These workflows share common functionalities, such as on enrollment, tuition payment, examination arrangement and graduation processing, whilst having their own specific requirements. For example, the tuition fees for full-time programmes are calculated and collected on programme-base while the tuition fees for distance-learning programmes are calculated and collected on course-base. Full-time programmes and distance-learning programmes have different programme structures and graduation requirements. In order to fulfill the requirements of both full-time student administration and distance-learning student administration, some customizations were made on system. 
In exploring the possibility of subscribing cloud computing services and deploying the student administration system on cloud, the first consideration is to identify which service model is to be adopted. The ERP solution provider, Peoplesoft, offers a cloud option for its Campus Solution version 9.0, which is essentially Software as a Service, where the application can be accessible through a thin client interface such as a web browser [5]. Although it allows configuration the application and functional modules, there are many limitations. More important, customizations are not allowed. Hence, the Software as a Service model is not feasible. 
Among other service models of cloud computing, the Platform as a Service model customer-created applications. On this serv ice model, the University can retain the flexibility of deploying the configured and customized functional modules of PeopleSoft Campus Solution on the cloud. The service provisions of a number of cloud providers, such as Microsoft [6], Amazon [9] and Citric [10], were reviewed. Microsoft Azure was finally selected as the cloud computing services, operating on the model of Platform as a Service. 
At present, there are thousands of accesses to the student administration system every day. About 20% of accesses come from the campus while the majority (80% of accesses) are off-campus accesses. The hybrid cloud deployment essentially aims for these off-campus accesses. Among different options of cloud deployment, the hybrid cloud deployment option is selected because it can effectively balance the processing loads. Better system availability and data security can be attained. On the other hand, it supports customization of functional modules and offers good user experience. Table 1 shows a comparison of different cloud deployment models. It should be noted that, although the implementation of hybrid cloud is more complicated than private cloud and public cloud, the hybrid cloud deployment model yields maximal benefits in both the operation and technical aspects. This section shows the hybrid-cloud deployment of the student administration system at the Open University of Hong Kong. 
In general, an ERP system architectural framework comprises three tiers, namely, web while the database tier refers to the database management system resided in storage internal database management system, storage servers and an internal network. The public cloud portion includes VPN gateways, cloud-based storage, virtual machines, virtual networks, etc. A fast Internet link is also provided. On the other hand, the database the 3-tier architecture. 
This hybrid cloud deployment aims for off-campus accesses which account for the majority (80%) of accesses. For in-campus accesses, it may not be effective to route therefore implemented to cater for those in-campus accesses (20% of accesses). In essence, a dual-cloud environment is essentially implemented  X  a hybrid cloud for off-campus accesses, and a private cloud for in-campus access. For the hybrid cloud environment, Microsoft Azure is used for hosting the web tier and application tier whilst the database tier resides on premises. For the private cloud environment, both the web tier and application tier are hosted inside campus. Figure 2 shows the detailed configuration of dual-cloud environment. 
The handling of incoming accesses to the student administration system is outlined as follows. For each incoming access, a routing table will be looked up. This routing table contains all IP addresses or domain IP addresses which are regarded as internal accesses. Therefore, based on its IP address, an incoming access can be identified as either in-campus access or off-campus access. In-campus accesses will be routed to the private cloud environment while off-campus accesses will be routed to the hybrid cloud environment. Figure 3 shows the logic for processing every incoming access to the Student Administration System. 
For the hybrid cloud deployment, Microsoft Azure is subscribed [6]. It basically offers a Platform as a Service. The steps of the implementation are briefly described as follows.

The evaluation has two parts. The first part is to analyze the capacity of the hybrid cloud implementation for handling a large volume of concurrent accesses (up to 3,000 concurrent accesses) to the student administration system. The second part is to study the hybrid cloud deployment and the traditional on premises set-up. 
For the first part, the course enrollment use-case is selected for analysis. Typically, before the start of each semester, students are asked to enroll courses for the coming semester. In the Open University of Hong Kong, the course enrollment must be done online. All students need to login the student administration system through the web browsers, and then select their preferred courses from a list of available courses. After enrollment cart. Then, the student confirms the enrollment of the selected courses in the enrollment cart. 
For each semester, students must finish course enrollment within one week. As they need to compete for popular courses, it is often that several thousand concurrent accesses are recorded during the course enrollment period. 
Typical course enrolment transactions are simulated for technical evaluation. Two separate stress tests are conducted for 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500 and 3,000 concurrent similar on-premises set-up. For each transaction, the average request response time [11]. The technical configurations of the two environment are summarized as follows. The hybrid cloud environment comprised 9 virtual machines for the web tier and 9 virtual machines for the application tier on Microsoft Azure. Each virtual machine is equipped with 2-core CPU at 2.2GHz, 14G memory and 100G storage. A similar equipped with 8-core CPU at 2.9GHz, 24G memory and 150G storage. These servers are identical blade servers [12]. 
Table 2 shows the average request response time and average page response time (for each course enrolment transaction) reco rded in the hybrid cloud deployment from 1,000 concurrent accesses to 3,000 concurrent accesses. Table 3 shows the figures in the on-premises environment. 
For the hybrid cloud environment, the average request response time is maintained at around 3 second and the average page request response time at around 15 second for 2,000, 2,500 and 3,000 concurrent accesses. For the on-premises environment, the average request response time and average page request response time steadily grow with the number of concurrent accesses. When there are 3,000 concurrent accesses, the average request response time and average page response time reach 6.31 second and 24.40 second, respectively. 
The second part of the evaluation is a cost comparison between the hybrid cloud deployment and premise set-up. Suppose the performance benchmarks are set at no more than 10 second per request response time and no more than 30 second per page response time for each course enrolment tr ansaction. If fulfilling these performance accesses are estimated as follows. 
For the hybrid cloud deployment, in order to support 3,000 concurrent accesses, a equipped with 2-core CPU at 2.2GHz, 14G memory and 100G storage) on Microsoft Azure are required. The cost (including the subscription of virtual servers, network bandwidth, maintenance of load balancer and network firewall servers) is estimated to HK$200,000 per year. More virtual machines (same capacity) are required for more concurrent accesses. The cost will grow at a steady rate of around HK$10,000 per 1,000 additional concurrent accesses. 
For the on-premises environment, to support 3,000 concurrent accesses within the performance benchmarks, a total of 9 physical servers (for both the web tier and the application tier, each equipped with 8-core CPU at 2.9GHz, 24G memory and 150G storage) are required. The cost (including the server hardware, network bandwidth, maintenance of load balancer and network firewall servers, and assuming server hardware with a usage-life of 3 years) is estimated to around HK$270,000 per year for 3,000 and up to 6,000 concurrent accesses. More physical servers (same capacity) are required for more concurrent accesses. The cost will grow to HK$390,000 per year for 6,000 and up to 9,000 concurrent access, and HK$510,000 per year for 9,000 and up to 12,000 concurrent accesses. 
Figure 4 shows a graph projecting the annual cost of the hybrid cloud deployment and on-premises set-up from 3,000 to 12,000 concurrent accesses, based on the current price level. It is clearly shown that the hybrid-cloud deployment yields more cost-performance benefits than the on-premises set-up, and that the cost difference becomes more and more significant as the number of concurrent accesses grows. At 10,000 concurrent accesses, the cost of on-premises set-up is almost double of the cost of hybrid cloud deployment. This paper shows the implementation of an ERP-based student administration system, where the web and application tier is deployed as a hybrid-cloud model. This hybrid-cloud deployment effectively achieves cost -performance balance, especially during occasional peak periods of concurrent accesses. Whilst this hybrid cloud deployment is adopted for the web and application tier, the database tier is still maintained within the campus and protected by appropriate firewalls. This protects the student data from exposing the database server to the public cloud. 
Although the implementation of hybrid cloud is much more complicated than that of private cloud or public cloud, there are many benefits, such as achieving the right balance between on-campus and off-campus accesses and allowing customization of functional modules of the system for better user experience. Maximal benefits in both operation and technical aspects are yielded. All these are discussed, and the key steps of the implementation are described. Technical evaluation is reported to demonstrate the cost benefits of a hybrid cloud deployment. Our findings and experience would provide a useful reference for industrial practitioners in planning and designing a hybrid-cloud deployment for ERP-based systems.
