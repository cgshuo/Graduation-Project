 While content-based recommendation has been applied success-fully in many different domains, it has not seen the same level of attention as collaborative filtering techniques have. However, there are many recommendation domains and applications where content and metadata play a key role, either in addition to or instead of rat-ings and implicit usage data. For some domains, such as movies, the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation already, but for many other domains, such as books, news, scientific articles, and Web pages we still do not know if and how these data sources should be combined to provided the best recommendation performance. The CBRecSys 2015 workshop aims to address this by providing a dedicated venue for papers ded-icated to all aspects of content-based recommendation.

Content-based recommendation has been applied successfully in many different domains [5], yet it has not seen the same level of attention as collaborative filtering techniques have. In recent years, competitions like the Netflix Prize 1 , CAMRA 2 , and the Yahoo! Music KDD Cup 2011 [4] have spurred on advances in collabo-rative filtering and how to utilize ratings and usage data. However, http://www.netflixprize.com/ http://www.dai-labor.de/camra2010/ there are many recommendation domains and applications where content and metadata play a key role, either in addition to or in-stead of ratings and implicit usage data. For some domains, such as movies, the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation already (e.g. [6]) , but for many other do-mains, such as books, news, scientific articles, and Web pages we still do not know if and how these data sources should be combined to provided the best recommendation performance.
The CBRecSys 2015 workshop is the follow-up to the successful first edition of the workshop in Silicon Valley in 2014 [1, 2], which featured a varied high-quality program and was attended by over 60 participants.

CBRecSys 2015 will be organized as a full-day workshop. The workshop starts with a keynote by Frank Hopfgartner (University of Glasgow) on the challenges of news recommendation and the NEWSREEL living lab at CLEF 2015. The accepted papers are presented in 30-minute talks. The workshop will close with an in-teractive break-out session, with attendees split into smaller groups to discuss current and future challenges in content-based recom-mendation, and reporting back in a final plenary session.
The CBRecSys 2015 workshop aims to address this by provid-ing a venue for papers dedicated to all aspects and new trends of content-based recommendation. This would include both rec-ommendation in domains where textual content is abundant (e.g. books, news, scientific articles, jobs, educational resources, and Web pages) as well as dedicated comparisons and combinations of content-based techniques with collaborative filtering approaches.
Relevant topics of the workshop include:
A total of 12 full papers were submitted, focused on the fol-lowing topics. Several papers present hybrid systems combining collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation, finding them complementary, with content-based recommendation compo-nents especially suitable for tackling the cold-start problem. Other papers investigate how different content features can be used for similarity measures and explore ways to identify which features are the most relevant for a given context. Some papers present ap-proaches to mine user reviews for inferring user preferences on spe-cific attributes of items, essentially deriving more structured feature information from unstructured text. Finally, several papers look at semantic frameworks and Linked Open Data to measure item similarity across different domains. All submitted papers were re-viewed by a program committee of international experts in the field.
The workshop material (list of accepted papers, invited talk, and the workshop schedule) can be found on the CBRecSys 2015 work-shop website at http://humanities.uva.nl/~mkoolen1/ CBRecSys15 . The proceedings are published as a CEUR Work-shop Proceedings volume. Similar to last year X  X  workshop [3], we will also look into publishing a summary of the workshop in venues like the SIGIR Forum, to increase cross-disciplinary awareness of recommender systems research.
