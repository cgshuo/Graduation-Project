 1. Introduction
An increasing number of firms attempt to achieve intellectual property (IP) by acquiring and exploiting technologies and patents in particular from beyond the own firm boundaries as it can be more economically than internal technology development. These trends have increased both the opportunities and the necessity for companies to leverage the inno-vation potential of external partners ( Gassmann, Enkel, &amp; Chesbrough, 2010; Heider, 2012 ). Thus, the recently emerging innovation intermediaries aim to support this development, but however are insufficiently understood. As well as, the use of Internet innovation intermediaries, such as NineSigma, Innocentive, Innovaroor Yet2.com have been specifically helpful for technological problems requiring solutions from on distant and distinct innovation actors ( L X pez &amp; Van-haverbeke, 2010; Piller, 2009; Zamboni, 2011 ). There is however a gap in linking the type of participation common in Internet innovation intermediaries platforms. Yet still the current literature has not explored this field at an individual level or in UTAUT context.

We focus on how the Internet has impacted the process of collaborative innovation intermediaries. Hence, it is important to study how willing people are to try new Internet innovation intermediary platform services and do facilitating conditions have an effect on the consumers X  adoption readiness. Thus a better understanding of user motivations is crucial for Internet innovation intermediary mechanisms to match patent creators with patent users and facilitate transactions between them, the efficiency implications and integrations of the emergence of these intermediaries for the patent market, which will be used for future empirical research. 2. Literature review 2.1. Internet innovation intermediaries viduals, experts or advisors in the form of retailers, distributors, wholesalers, platforms, media companies, agencies and financial institutions. Internet innovation intermediaries are a new phenomenon. An innovation intermediary put together many different innovation community members to create the opportunity for firms to increase the feasibility of outsourcing innovation while mitigating the associated costs, and further, they can help overcome these barriers to commercialization by mediating between inventors, developers, and marketers. Innovation intermediaries provide many value-adding functions of innovation supporting links, for example IP or technologies trade, commercialization of patents to develop an appropriate business model and more generally for creations of different types of innovation partnerships and communities embed open innovation ( Howells, 2006; Lopez-Vega, 2009 ).
 mediaries X  context, there are only a few studies. Antikainen, M X kip X  X , and Ahonen (2010) and Bakici et al. (2011) resulted that intrinsic rewards are as decisive as monetary rewards. Similarly Antikainen &amp; V X  X tvj X  (2010) and Svensson (2011) re-sulted that Internet innovation intermediaries both use monetary and non-monetary rewards. However this is why a social psychological model is required to explore these motivations and their relations on the intention to participate. Thus with this research we aim to contribute to both Internet innovation intermediary and related models of technology adoption. 2.2. Related models of technology adoption researchers ( Garfield, 2005; Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis, 2003 ). The UTAUT aims to explain user intentions to use an IS and subsequent usage behavior. UTAUT could explain 70% of technology acceptance behavior ( Masrom &amp; Hussein, 2008 ). According to the number of prior studies, the UTAUT model is the benchmark and most predictive model in the tech-nology acceptance literature ( AlAwadhi &amp; Morris, 2008; Weerakkody, El-Haddadeh, &amp; Al-Shafi, 2011 ). ing the adoption these services is to be expected. However, we also argue that existing research directions provide valuable points of departure for further investigating and understanding the adoption of Internet innovation intermediary services.
Also, because of their design, Internet innovation intermediary present a unique set of circumstances. So more importantly, study is to further validate UTAUT in the context of open innovation and in regards to Internet innovation intermediary, be-cause the new service testing cannot be seen as a diffusion of new technology. As is pointed out, adoption of end-user ser-vices in Internet innovation intermediary platforms may be treated as technology adoption. 3. Conceptual model of Internet innovation intermediary 3.1. Research model behavioral intention by other determinant factors like: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facil-itating conditions ( Garfield, 2005; Venkatesh et al., 2003 ). As shown in Fig. 1 , these determinants and moderators have all been adapted for use in the proposed research model. As is pointed out Ristola, Koivum X ki, and Kesti (2005) , adoption of end-user services in Internet innovation intermediary may be treated as technology adoption. 3.2. Sample selection and descriptive statistics tion intermediaries. Given the novelty of the research problem, an explanatory study has been chosen as the research meth-od. Data will be collected via a questionnaire survey. We test the validity of our hypotheses with data that comes from a recent international survey on open innovation practices. In order to conduct this research we examined the Theory of
UTAUT model in the case of China and Taiwan, the data were collected through email and a paper survey, and also by phone in a few cases from March to August 2012. We test the validity of our hypotheses with data that comes from a recent inter-national survey on open innovation practices.
 in China and Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan from March to August 2012. Of the responses received 735 responses were found to be useful (73.5% of total survey). The majority of the responding firms (59.3%, 436 firms) belong to the manufac-turing sector, but the service sector and information technology sector also represents a significant industry segment among the respondent firms (16.9%, 124 firms; 16.9%, 175 firms). Most of the users were male (74.3%), while female users comprised 25.7% of the test user population. Users were relatively young, 67.8% were under 35 years old. Among China and Taiwan cit-izens, 76.1% said they used this intermediary service every day, and 15.2% reported used intermediary service several times a week. 8.3% of respondents reported used the Internet innovation intermediary several times a month or less. 4. Data analysis 4.1. Reliability and validity analysis
Following Anderson and Gerbing (1988) , we also conducted confirmatory factor analysis to further establish the reliabil-of the measurement items in the research model. All have Cronbach X  X  a greater than 0.7, which is the normally agreed upon minimum value.
 A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to check the statistical validity of the constructs. As shown in Table 1 , all AVE values are greater than 0.8, which indicates that the model had convergent validity. The square-root values of AVE were greater than the correlations between the corresponding constructs and the confidence intervals of the coefficients did not include 1.0, which indicated that the constructs had discriminant validity. 4.2. Results of hypotheses tests
The regression was conducted using a hierarchical two-step method. The overall fit of the regression models can be seen in Table 2 .

Overall, the research model explains 51.7% (adj. R 2 = 0.221) of the variance in the dependent variable, Internet innovation intermediary platforms services usage. The main effects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facil-itating conditions and behavioral intention account for 19.6% (adj. R 2 = 0.205) of the explained variance, while the moderat-ing variables gender, age, prior experience and voluntariness of use. 4.3. Model testing with moderators
A regression analysis was used to measure the influence of independent variables on behavioral intention to adopt Inter-net innovation intermediary platforms services that is promoted by intermediaries X  roles in China and Taiwan.
A total of 735 responses were analyzed. From the analysis, Table 3 shows a significant model emerged ( F (3735) = 24.389, on behavioral intention. For the moderator variables, statistically significant beta path coefficients were indicated. Gender and age did not exhibit significant interactions performance expectancy.

 5. Discussion 5.1. Summary of results The Study has indicated that companies using Internet innovation intermediary platforms X  services value in China and Taiwan and their roles as consultants, brokers, intelligence gatherers and technology scouts acting on their behalf, as well as the financial resources that can be provided. In addition, the implementation of Internet innovation intermediary plat-forms will help increase the transparency of open innovation, in particular the protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Our findings indicate that economic systems and institutions may have large effects on the behavior of firms with respect to their engagement in open innovation practices. Fig. 1 presents the model proposed and supported. Fig. 2 presents a summary of the findings. A key objective of the study was to validate the UTAUT model in the context of consumer adop-tion of the online communities. The model explained 51.7% of the variance in behavioral intention to use Internet innovation intermediary platforms. The key findings of the UTAUT analysis in the study and their influences on practice are outlined below.

First, regression analysis provided evidence that the performance expectancy construct has a significant positive influ-ence on the behavioral intention to adopt Internet innovation intermediary platforms. The finding of this research confirms that performance expectancy remains significant and a strong predictor of behavioral intention ( Venkatesh, Thong, &amp; Xu, 2012; Venkatesh et al., 2003 ). Effort expectancy factor also has a significant positive influence on the behavioral intention to adopt Internet innovation intermediary platforms. For the moderator variables only prior use Internet innovation inter-mediary platforms X  experience exhibited strongly positive interacting affect with the predictor variable. The findings of this ioral intention ( Nassuora, 2012; Shao &amp; Siponen, 2011; Venkatesh et al., 2003 ).

Second, Within the Internet innovation intermediary platforms X  services context, social influence construct is one of the adopt Internet innovation intermediary platforms, is the highest among the independent constructs in the research model. Whereas the finding implies that knowledge derived from acceptance and use of technology studies in the Developed World should be applied cautiously to intermediary platforms X  services. The role of social influence in technology acceptance and use intention is subject to a lot of erroneous influences and moderations such as gender, age and experience ( Venkatesh &amp; use Internet innovation intermediary platforms X  experience exhibit significant interactions with social influence upon behav-ioral intention.
 nificant influence on the actual adoption of the Internet innovation intermediary platforms. Also, the findings suggest that moderator variables, gender, age, and prior experience did not exhibit significant interactions with facilitating conditions upon Internet innovation intermediary platforms usage behavior. Thus, the findings of the current study are in line with the previous study. Moreover, behavioral intention has a positive influence on Internet innovation intermediary platforms X  the present study adds to our understanding of the role of intermediaries in working in parallel with different constructs in explaining behavioral intentions with regard to the adoption of Internet innovation intermediary platforms and confirms lowing propositions to those who lead knowledge management within online intermediary platforms. This is confirmed by tries as they develop their infrastructure to bridge technical gaps and digital divide. Actively support the collaboration and networking among members during contests in online platforms. In particular, the purpose was to ascertain any possible benefits users expected as a result of accepting and using intermediary platforms X  services. 5.2. Managerial implications
We have been focussing in this study on one particular problem, i.e. how companies in search for external technical solu-innovation intermediaries are interested in how to attract and sustain more people for the participation into their open inno-crucial for innovation intermediaries. Based on our results, it is acknowledged that intrinsic motivations such as enjoyment collaboration and networking among members during contests in innovation intermediary platforms.

Next, our findings show that the most influential construct outside UTAUT model influencing the behavioral intention of firms X  users to accept and use Internet innovation intermediary platforms in China and Taiwan is attitudes towards use of platforms. Moreover, the social nature in technology adoption among firms infers that using individual based theory is inap-mance, a general means of measuring Internet Innovation Intermediaries performance would provide many practical benefits.

Finally, management needs to support any technology adoption initiatives, for example encouraging employees to use the The practical implications resulting from the resistance to change is that although it does not directly affect intention to adopt a new technology, it is a construct that definitely could prevent the general adoption of a technology. However, in an age of creative and cultural industries, taking both economic development and social valuation into consideration will be the greatest challenge that contemporary creative workers and firms will face. 5.3. Limitations and future research
One potential limitation of the present research is that our findings may well be vulnerable to the threat of single source may not be able to fully capture the intention and require longitudinal studies to examine how these dynamic measures evolve over time.

This contrasts sharply with the established motivations in the actual platforms and the lack of elements allowing the expression and development of what, according to the model, constitute the main motivators. Longitudinal observation in different settings is also encouraged. Future similar researches may be conducted in other countries. Furthermore, our empirical study results conducted in China and Taiwan might not be applied to general. Future similar researches may be It is worth further studying as well.
