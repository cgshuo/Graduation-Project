 The goal of predicting query pote ntial for personalization is to determine which queries can benefit from personalization. In this paper, we investigate which kind of strategy is better for this task: classification or regre ssion. We quantify the potential benefits of personalizing search results us ing two implicit click-based measures: Click entropy and Potential@N . Meanwhile, queries are characterized by query features and history features. Then we build C-SVM classification mode l and epsilon-SVM regression model respectively according to these two measures. The experimental results show that th e classification model is a better choice for predicting query potential for personalization. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  search process Measurement, Experimentation, Performance Query potential for personalizati on, Classification, Regression In contrast to the traditional retrieval models usually focusing on the topical relevance, a strong motivation of personalized Web search is further to take the user relevance into account. It is a subtle issue to implement a fully personalized Information Retrieval (IR) model because of different requirements on the same queries by users. A number of research groups have built models personalizing search results by individual interests [1, 2, 3]. Regardless of the details, they typically apply the same algorithm and parameter settings to all queries. However, Dou et al. [4] reveal that current pers onalization models can improve the results for some queries while act ually harming others. This is somewhat reasonable since pe rsonalization models can be expected beneficial to queries w ith a substantial gap between the personal requirement and the aggregate group preference. To measure this kind of gap, Teevan et al. [5] examined the variability among user intents by both explicit relevance judgments and large-scale log analys is of user behavior patterns. They found that the click-based implicit measures correspond well with the explicit measures and suggested two implicit measures assessing query potential for pe rsonalization. The first is Click entropy , which measures the variability in clicked results across individuals [4]. The second is the NDCG-based Potential@N , which describes the gap between the optimal rating for an individual and the optimal rating for the group [6]. Both of them can be easily calculated from the query logs. The value for Click entropy and Potential@N are generally continuous, and the regression ma y be a good choice since the goal of regression is to predict th e value of continuous variables. However, the previous studies [5] treat query potential prediction as a classification problem which a ssigns an input query to one of multiple discrete classes wit hout any justification. The classification approach, as a loose and approximate measure, is robust and stable in prediction, while the regression model can greatly help practical applicati ons due to its nearly accurate prediction. In this paper, we tent atively investigate which kind of model is better for predicting qu ery potential for personalization on AOL (American Online) query logs. Results show that the classification model is more effe ctive than the regression model. To compare the classification and regression model for predicting query potential for personaliza tion, we choose Support Vector Machine (SVM), a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, as a fair framework of a case study. Though SVM is a classification model in essence, it has been successfully extended into a regression version. We apply C-SVM as the classification model and epsilon-SVM as the regre ssion model because they have similar structural loss function and optimization method. After that we evaluate and compare the performance of these two models in a unified way. Click entropy and Potential@N are two implicit measures which quantify query potential for pe rsonalization by user clicks. Assuming the user click as an indication for the relevance, these measures regard that queries with great variations in the click also have great variations in what people consider relevance. Click entropy is calculated as: where p(c u |q) is the probability that URL u was clicked on a query q . In contrast, the Potential@N describes the potential gain that can be achieved by pe rsonalizing rankings in terms of the NDCG difference between the ideal individualized ranking and the best group ranking. Note that N is the size of a group. Both Click entropy and Potential@N are generally continuous measures. Naturally, we can le arn epsilon-SVM regression model straightforward with the training data. For the classification task, we follow the approach described in [5] and bin the data into four equal-sized bins according to th e above two measures. With such obtained gold standard for classifi cation, the C-SVM is applied to identify which bin a sample belongs to. To compare the two models, we again divide the regr ession results into four equal-sized bins in the same way, enabling a direct comparison with the gold standard. Therefore, the precision of classification can be chosen as the final evaluation metric for both models. We employ similar query features a nd history features as in [5] to predict Click entropy and Potential@N . Table 1 presents the detailed features, which are extracted from the AOL query log. 
Table 1. Query and history features used to predict query Feature Class Feature Name To verify which kind of model fi ts better for query potential prediction, we look at a large sa mple of queries issued to AOL (American Online) search engine from March 1 to May 31, 2006. We extract queries which are issued by at least ten people to ensure sufficient data to understand the variability across users on the same query. Table 2 shows the statistics of the whole collection and data for experiments. # of query instances 21,011,340 3,390,310 # of unique queries 10,154,742 57,103 # of unique users 657,426 414,034 We learn C-SVM and epsilon-SVM that best explain the training data by libSVM toolkits [7]. The learning targets are Click entropy and Potential@N . The group size is ten. We predict these two variables using query features and history features. All results are reported by using five-fold cro ss validation, as shown in Table 3 and 4. In these two tables,  X  X  X  denotes query features,  X  X  X  means history features,  X  X  X  represents the features employed and  X  X  X  indicates features removed. Following the work [5], we have the data divided into four equal-sized bins, and the baseline of a random guess is 25%. According to Table 3 and 4, we can find that the results are consistent in both the Click entropy and the Potential@10 . Compared with the baseline, we can somewhat identify queries which benefit from pe rsonalization using query features alone, although the overall level of pred iction precision is moderate. Meanwhile, we can find that the history features extracted from query logs can strongly improve th e effectiveness of both models and produce a sizeable jump in precision. It should also be noticed that in the case of using both query features and history features, classification method is only s lightly better, while about 5% improvement using the query feat ures only. Therefore, when predicting query X  X  potential for pers onalization, it is reasonable to believe that the classification is more suitable than the regression.

We follow the previous work and divi de data into four equal-sized bins. The comparison is made between C-SVM as a classification model and epsilon-SVM as a regression model with query features and history features. In the future, more substantial comparisons between the classification and regression model under other framework are scheduled. And we will enrich the model with more features mined from query logs and other resource to better resolve query potential prediction. Finally, the way of classifying data into eq ual-sized groups deserves further examination.
