 Uri Shalit uri.shalit@mail.huji.ac.il Daphna Weinshall daphna@cs.huji.ac.il Gal Chechik gal.chechik@biu.ac.il In our work we used three sets of features. Two sets are sets of local features, pertaining to a short audio segment:  X  chroma : A 12-component vector corresponding  X  timbre + max. loudness : A 13-component  X  global features : The third is a set of global fea-In order to assess the relative contribution of each feature type, we conducted an ablation study. We trained the model using one set of features at a time, and evaluated the mean Spearman correlation with allmusic.com  X  X  influence rank (described in Section 5.3 of the main text). For the timbre and chroma fea-tures, the bag-of-words representation was built in the same manner explained in the main text, by quantizing the per-segment descriptors. We used the same value for the K-means, K = 5000. The global features are 33 separate words describing each song, as described in section 4 of the main text.
 The results are presented in Figure 1 . Using all 3 sets of features gives a mean Spearman correlation of 0 . 15; using only timbral features gives a correlation of 0 . 12; using only chroma features or only global features yield Mermelstein, P.
