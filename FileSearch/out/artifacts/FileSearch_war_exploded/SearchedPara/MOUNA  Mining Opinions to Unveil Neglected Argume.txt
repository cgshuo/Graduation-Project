 A query topic can be subjective involving a variety of opin-ions, judgments, arguments, and many other debatable as-pects. Typically, search engines process queries indepen-dently from the nature of their topics using a relevance-based retrieval strategy. Hence, search results about sub-jective topics are often biased towards a specific view point or version. In this demo, we shall present MOUNA , a novel approach for opinion diversification. Given a query on a sub-jective topic, MOUNA ranks search results based on three scores: (1) relevance of documents, (2) semantic diversity to avoid redundancy and capture the different arguments used to discuss the query topic, and (3) sentiment diversity to cover a balanced set of documents having positive, neg-ative, and neutral sentiments about the query topic. More-over, MOUNA enhances the representation of search results with a summary of the different arguments and sentiments related to the query topic. Thus, the user can navigate through the results and explore the links between them. We provide an example scenario in this demonstration to illustrate the inadequacy of relevance-based techniques for searching subjective topics and highlight the innovative as-pects of MOUNA .

H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval] Diversification, Ranking, Algorithms, Sentiment Analysis
Querying subjective topics often returns results that are biased towards specific view points. Hence, diversification of search results is a crucial ingredient for improving the satis-faction of information seekers. While there is a considerable effort on diversifying search results of ambiguous queries, there is a little effort on covering different view points in the result set of queries on subjective topics, such as  X  X s-sisted suicide X ,  X  X uman evolution X ,  X  X FOs existence X , and queries looking for different versions of the same breaking news such us  X  X reece bailout X . Users seeking for such type of knowledge are not necessarily interested in a specific way of looking at a given issue, but possibly learning about that topic and interested in finding all different view points. To this end, it is important to focus on how best to produce a set of diversified results that cover different arguments and sentiments.

Search result diversification has been investigated exten-sively [5, 1, 2, 8] aiming to produce a set of results that cover different interpretations of ambiguous queries, mainly based on relevance and novelty. Few attempts addressed the problem of queries on subjective topics [3] by introducing a diversification model based on positive, negative, and neu-tral opinions. However, identifying different opinions goes beyond just finding positive and negative sentiments. It in-volves additionally the arguments used to discuss a topic. For example, two documents can be both negative about  X  X reece bailout X  but for completely different reasons. One is negative because bailout forces Greece to accept unfair con-ditions , while the other is negative because Greece bailout is not fair to European taxpayers . These two documents are not diverse with respect to their sentiments, but they are diverse with respect to the arguments they provide. To the best of our knowledge, we were the first to define an opinion as a combination of sentiments and arguments, and intro-duce a diversification model to find the different opinions about subjective topics [6].

Identifying diverse opinions with different sentiments and arguments faces two main challenges. First, finding docu-ments discussing similar arguments without being mislead by the difference they might exhibit in presenting them. Second, diversifying a set of documents by maximizing the number of discussed arguments without being biased against specific sentiments. In this paper, we demonstrate MOUNA , a system that solves the above problems by using a novel ranking model based on (1) relevance to select relevant doc-uments for the query topic , (2) semantic diversity to avoid redundancy and cover a diverse set of documents present-ing different arguments, and (3) sentiment diversity to cover different types of sentiments that can be positive, negative, or neutral. Additionally, MOUNA provides a summary of opinions, including the different arguments and sentiments, covered by the result set of each query. Using this summary representation, the user can explore the links between the results sharing the same, opposing, or complementary view points. In this demonstration, we show a user scenario to illustrate the inadequacy of relevance-based techniques for searching subjective topics, and highlight the innovative as-pects of our approach.
From documents about subjective topics, we extract a set ferent arguments of the topic discussion. Concretely, topic elements are assumed to be the noun phrases that occur in the text. Each topic element occurs within a set of sen-tences. These sentences give the context in which the topic element was discussed. We define the context C i of a topic element e i by the set of words composing the sentences to which it belongs. We call these words, context words and we write C i = { cw 1 ,cw 2 ,...,cw m } where cw j is a context word of topic element e i . We restrict context words only to nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. For each context word, we define its sentiment orientation, which will be used to predict the sentiment assigned to the corresponding topic element. Combining topic elements, context words, and sen-timent orientations, we define a document as a set of triples: where e i is a topic element, cw j is a context word associated with e i , and o j is the sentiment orientation of cw j .
As a first component of opinion diversification, we need to compute semantic dissimilarity to detect documents that have dissimilar arguments. To this end, we do not use the whole vocabulary of a document to compute the semantic distance.We rather use only the topic elements to compute the distance between two documents. The main reason is that two pages can discuss the same argument of a subjec-tive topic but using different context words. Therefore, our approach can capture similar opinions even if they are pre-sented in two different ways as shown in [6] . Another key aspect is that we can effectively combine semantic dissimi-larity that uses only topic elements (i.e., nouns) with sen-timent dissimilarity that uses context words with adverbs and adjectives as described further. Formally, we define an opinion-based Jaccard similarity function O Jaccard as fol-lows: where E ( a ) and E ( b ) are the set of topic elements of docu-ment a and document b respectively. As a second component of opinion diversification, we need to compute sentiment dis-similarity between documents. To this end, documents are classified into one of the three classes positive , negative , or neutral based on the sentiment orientations of their con-text words. Thus, two documents belonging to two different classes are dissimilar.

Based on the previously defined semantic and sentiment components, we propose an opinion diversification model as an extension to the Max-sum model presented in [5]. The goal of this model is to maximize the sum of the relevance, the semantic dissimilarity, and the sentiment dissimilarity of the selected set. The function we aim at maximizing can be formalized as follows: f ( L ) =  X  ( k  X  1) X where | L | = k , and  X , X , X  &gt; 0 are parameters specifying the trade-off between relevance, semantic diversity, and sen-timent diversity. r ( a ) is a BM25 scoring function, d(a,b) is the O Jaccard distance, and s ( a,b ) is binary distance func-tion that returns 1 if a and b belong to the same class and 0 otherwise. Note that we need to scale up the three terms of the function. The reason is that there are k ( k  X  1) 2 numbers in the semantic similarity sum, and k ( k  X  1) 2 in the sentiment sum as opposed to k numbers in the relevance sum. Figure 1 shows an overview of the architecture of MOUNA . Data from a search engine or a database are im-ported and precomputed into data structures used for query processing. Given a query entered by a user through a Tomcat servlet, the query processor computes the topk rele-vant documents. Then, it applies the opinion diversification model to obtain a set of diverse documents which is returned through Tomcat. The system consists of four major compo-nents:
The demo presents a full implementation of MOUNA , a hybrid search system for subjective topics, where the user can perform diversification of search results to cover various opinions based on arguments, sentiments or hybrid com-bination of them. We showcase a dataset crawled from http://debatepedia.idebate.org/ , an encyclopedia of pro and con arguments and quotes on critical issues. We have gath-ered the different sections of each debate and all the web pages of the external links forming a dataset of 17637 docu-ments on 621 topics. Alternatively, we have the possibility to pose queries to a search engine and then apply the diver-sification on the result set.

A visitor of the demo can provide a query consisting of one or multiple terms using the interface shown in Figure 2. The visitor can choose the diversification mode to be ei-ther semantic, sentiment, or both (using checkboxes in the interface that set the parameters to predefined values). The visitor can also search without any diversification, an im-portant feature that helps to demonstrate the impact of our approach. The system evaluates the query, performs the re-quested diversification, and then produces a set of results (i.e., documents) together with a description of their char-acteristics. First, for each document, it shows its sentiment with a positive or a negative symbol, the topic discussed in the document, and few sentences extracted from its content. Second, the interface provides a summary of the opinions covered by the returned results. The summary contains a pie chart showing the distribution of sentiments of the re-trieved documents. This chart demonstrates a possible bias in the results and the impact of diversification. Additionally, the topk arguments are displayed togther with the context in which they were discussed (positive or negative). Using the arguments summary, the visitor can browse the doc-uments related to each of the arguments and sentiments. This feature helps moving away from a row list of results to a more structured way of presenting the resulting doc-uments and how they relate to each other. Moreover, it demonstrates the difference between the various diversifica-tion methods in covering which and how many arguments and sentiments. Third, the interface provides the list of related topics to the submitted query based on the topk re-sults. In this way, the visitor can navigate through other topics to have a broader view. This feature demonstrates the effectiveness of the search strategy. The more related are these topics the more the ranking model is effective.
Figure 2 shows an example query on human evolution without and with diversification. We can observe the change in opinion distribution from Figure 2(a) that shows biased results with 20% of negative documents vs 80% positive documents to Figure 2(b) where the percentage of negative documents is increased to 40%. Additionally, more rele-vant arguments were covered in both negative and positive contexts. A key observation is that without diversification, some topics and arguments are not related to human evolu-tion like punishment of adults and capitalism , whereas with diversification all the topics and arguments are related to human evolution .
