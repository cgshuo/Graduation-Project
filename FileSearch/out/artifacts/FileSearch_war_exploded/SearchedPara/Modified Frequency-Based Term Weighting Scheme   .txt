 and easy access environment. Extremist g ro u ps are exploitin g the latest Internet based expensive development and maintenance broadcastin g stations, to spread their propa-g anda, instr u ctions, and to enco u ra g e others to join the extremism [1]. The Septem-ber 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks motivated the information technolo g y researchers to st u dy, trace, and analyzin g different types of online content, in order to prevent and red u ce the potential terrorism aro u nd in the world. The hidden part of the web u sed by terror-ist and extremist g ro u ps online is named to as the dark web (DW) [2]. As the non-dark web, the content of DW is cate g orized into text-based and m u ltimedia types. Text-based content which is the lar g e cate g ory in web data [3] and in DW collection other hand, m u ltimedia contents consist of ima g es, a u dio, and video files. 
Over the recent years, many information sec u rity techniq u es are proposed to detect the terrorism on the web, since it was fo u nd that the g ro u p known as  X  X amb u r g Cell X  that was mainly responsible for the preparation of the September 11 attacks a g ainst the United States u sed Internet intensively [5]. Text analysis based-techniq u es has been u sed intensively in detectin g potential terrorism on the web based on statistical methods [3]. Commonly, in statistical methods, the text is represented as vectors of wei g hted feat u res (words). TF-IDF term wei g htin g al g orithm is the most commonly other cases, text is represented statistically base on lexical, syntactic, domain specific thods to u nderstand the semantic meanin g s of text written by h u man [3] ca u se the low performance of these methods in text classification. In g eneral, the performance of TF-IDF and other statistical methods is not s u fficient [3],[12],[13]. 
In this research we propose a modified freq u ency-based term wei g htin g techniq u e, and compare its performance as a feat u re selection methods to the common term wei g htin g techniq u es s u ch as Term Freq u ency Inverse Doc u ment Freq u ency (TF-IDF), Term Freq u ency (TF), Term Freq u ency-Relevance Freq u ency (tf.rf), Doc u ment Freq u ency (DF), Entropy, and Glas g ow in dark web content classification. 
The paper is or g anized as follows: Section 2 reviews the term wei g htin g schemes u sed in this st u dy, while Section 3 presents the proposed freq u ency-based term wei g htin g scheme. Section 4 describes the datasets and experiment. Section 5 dis-c u sses the res u lts, and finally, concl u sions are drawn in Section 6. In information retrieval and web-classification domain, the TF-IDF, Entropy [14], term-wei g htin g techniq u es are u sed widely besides TF, DF, and IDF [12] and the Glas g ow [15] techniq u es. The tf.rf scheme is one of the newest s u pervised term wei g htin g schemes u sed in text classification [16,17]. However, there are many other term-wei g htin g al g orithms proposed and u sed in the domain [15],[18]. Here is the description of the techniq u es u sed for benchmarkin g in this st u dy. 2.1 Term Frequency (TF) TF is concerned with the normalized freq u ency of a certain term. More occ u rrences of a term indicate more si g nificance of the term.  X  X   X , X  is defined as in eq u ation (1) [19]: where  X  X   X , X  is the n u mber of occ u rrences of term t in doc u ment d , while the denomi-nator is known as the E u clidean norm of the doc u ments in which  X  X   X , X  is the freq u ency of t t h term in doc u ment d , and n is the n u mber of distinctive terms in doc u ment d . 2.2 Document Frequency (DF) the collection in which the term t is fo u nd. D F is expressed by eq u ation (2): defined as in eq u ation (3): 2.3 Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) q u ent term in the collection is considered less important. IDF is defined as in eq u ation (4): doc u ments within the collection in which the term is fo u nd. Since lo g is a monotonical-ly increasin g f u nction, it can be safely u sed to make the factor less insensitive, and IDF is always positive beca u se the denominator ( D F t ) is always less than or eq u al to N . 
In contrast to TF scheme, IDF is a g lobal term wei g htin g scheme, in which the doc u ments. This case of wei g htin g ca u ses tho u sands of terms to have the same wei g ht tioned here beca u se of its importance to next wei g htin g scheme. 2.4 Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) TF-IDF is an u ltimate rankin g meas u re that represents the terms within the collection of doc u ments that reflect the ass u mption that a less freq u ent term in the collection is the most si g nificant term and vice versa. TF-IDF is u sed by many information-retrieval applications [20]. TF-IDF of a term t in doc u ment d , denoted by (TF-IDF t,d ), is the dot prod u ct of the Term Freq u ency (TF) and the Inverse Doc u ment Freq u ency (IDF) of the term, as in eq u ation (5): 2.5 Glasgow Glas g ow wei g htin g scheme was proposed by [21]. The main aim of this wei g htin g scheme is to prevent lon g er doc u ments to be more favored beca u se of the existence of defined as in eq u ation (6): where le ng t h d is the len g th of vector that represents the distinctive terms of doc-of doc u ments in the collection, and D F t is doc u ment freq u ency of term t . 2.6 Entropy Based on the probabilistic analysis of the text, Entropy techniq u e considers that a more freq u ent term in the collection is the more important term [14] after removin g the stop words. Entropy is defined as in eq u ations (7) 2.7 Term Frequency-Relative Frequency (tf.rf) tf.rf scheme is proposed by [16] as a s u pervised term wei g htin g techniq u e. In s u per-vised wei g htin g methods some prior statistical information s u ch as  X   X  are involved in calc u latin g the term wei g ht [17]. In [16] the doc u ment distrib u tion and the n u mber of positive and ne g ative doc u ments containin g the term to calc u late the wei g ht of term t in doc u ment d as in eq u ation (10) where  X  is the n u mber of doc u ments in the positive cate g ory that contain this term t and c is the n u mber of doc u ments in the ne g ative cate g ory that contain this term t . main idea behind the proposed scheme is to incl u de the proportion of the total n u mber of the collection. In addition the proportion of the len g th of the doc u ment to the total n u m-ber of distinctive terms in the collection is considered in the normalization, when calc u -latin g the wei g ht if term t in doc u ment d . the proposed scheme is named modified Term Freq u ency and denoted as (  X  X  X   X , X  ). The form u la is expressed as shown in eq u ation (11). in the d t h doc u ment in the collection. However, T t stands for the total n u mber of term m u la is defined as the n u mber of distinctive terms in the doc u ments. 
As mentioned in Section 2.1, the standard TF form u la considers the more freq u ent term in the doc u ment as the more si g nificant term. In the proposed m TF the propor-terms in the collection is also considered, since the n u meric val u e of the fraction  X   X   X   X  will g row u p by the increment of term freq u ency on the collection level. Moreover, the n u mber of distinctive terms in the coll ection in the normalization. The fraction  X  dered as the n u mber of the distinctive terms in the doc u ment. 
Since the proposed form u la is and extinction of the standard TF form u la, the pro-scheme disc u sses in section 2.4. The new form of the TF-IDF form u la will be denoted as m TF-IDF and the its form u la will be as in eq u ations (13) and (14). 4.1 Dataset Many of existin g works in DW classification and detection depend on the Dark Web P ortal For u m (DW P F) as so u rce of experimental datasets [22-28]. DW P F is the lar g est collection of crawled terrorist related doc u ments, collected from 17 Arabic for u ms and many other En g lish, German, French, and R u ssian for u ms [4]. O u r dataset consists of 500 dark doc u ments in addition to same n u mber of non-dark doc u ments. As in pre-vio u s st u dies s u ch as [13],[29] the dataset u sed is balanced dataset. In this research we foc u s on Arabic dark web content classification, so tho u sands of Arabic doc u ments were downloaded from DW P F. Then, native Arabic experts examined the doc u ments and labeled 500 doc u ments as Da r k . Finally, the non-Dark doc u ments were imported from the Ope n S o u rce Ar a b dataset incl u des doc u ment s Health, History, and Reli g i o
As in many of existin g concern in identifyin g the d not important. However, t h show the diversity of cate g o 4.2 Experiments Fi g . 2 shows the framewor k SVM classifier is proven to be s u perior in comparison with other classifiers s u ch as C4.5 in the domain of DW analysis [8],[31]. Moreover, SVM has been shown to be one of the best performin g and acc u rate classification approaches in many other dif-ferent domains [32]. Applyin g SVM for DW content text classification req u ires many steps to be performed s u ch as text pre-processin g , doc u ments indexin g and then cal-c u latin g the terms wei g htin g matrix in which each row represents one doc u ments while col u mns form the terms incl u ded by the doc u ments. Then wei g htin g matrix is divided into two parts: one for trainin g and the other is for testin g . The SVM classifier is another techniq u e commonly u sed in classification, in which the matrix is divided remainin g fold is u sed for testin g iteratively. In this research, classification in 10 fold cross validation approach is applied. 
As shown in the experimental framework, the pre-processin g step incl u ded filter-word (also known as stop words), removin g non-Arabic characters, removin g n u m-bers, symbols, and special characters s u ch as p u nct u ations, Arabic diacritics, and other characters [33-35]. However, stemmin g is the process of removin g s u ffixes, prefixes, and infixes from the words [36]. other parameters were applied. 4.3 Performance Evolution In the domain of DW content classification, P recision, Recall, f_ m e a s u re , and Acc u -racy are widely u sed in eval u atin g sol u tions and approaches [3],[4],[13],[38],[39]. In the context of dark content classification eval u ation, precision that meas u res the  X  X x-actness X  is defined as the n u mber dark doc u ments correctly labelled, divided by the total n u mber of all doc u ments labelled as dark. Recall, which meas u res the  X  X om-pleteness X  of the method, is defined as the ratio of n u mber of doc u ments labelled recall into a sin g le meas u rement as the wei g hted harmonic mean. While acc u racy classification to indicate the correspondin g definitions:  X  Tr u e P ositive (T P ): N u mber of doc u ments correctly labeled as dark by the  X  False P ositive (F P ): N u mber of doc u ments incorrectly identified as dark by the  X  Tr u e Ne g ative (TN): N u mber of doc u ments correctly identified as non-dark by the  X  False Ne g ative (FN): N u mber of doc u ments incorrectly identified as non-dark by 
The eval u ation meas u res are calc u lated as in eq u ations 15-18: Fi g . 3 shows the precision eval u ation meas u re, while Fi g s. 4, 5, and 6 show the recall, f_ m e a s u re and acc u racy res u lts respectively. 
Fi g . 3 shows that the precision meas u re based on the proposed term wei g htin g scheme m TF is hi g her in g eneral, and m TF-IDF based precision is also hi g her than the ori g inal TF and TF-IDF based classification precision. Moreover, it can be seen that the Entropy, Glas g ow and tf.rf based precision are close to each other, however it is g eneral means that a hi g h n u mber of dark doc u ments are correctly labeled as dark by the classifier. 
It can be seen in Fi g . 4 that the classification recall based on the m TF -IDF wei g htin g wei g htin g form u las based recall. The hi g hest classification recall meas u rements means the hi g her  X  X ompleteness X  of the sol u tion. 
As mentioned in Section 4.3, f_ m e a s u re is the wei g hted harmonic mean that com-bines precision and recall into a sin g le meas u rement. In Fi g . 5, it is seen that the m TF indicates the hi g h  X  X ffectiveness X  of the form u la. seen in Fi g . 6, the classification acc u racy based on the m TF form u la is the hi g hest amon g 350 term as classification feat u res. Moreover, it can be seen that the classification acc u -racy based on m TF-IDF also is hi g her than DF, TF, and TF-IDF based acc u racy. Al-m TF-IDF based acc u racy, the m TF-IDF acc u racy is close to 90% based on 500 feat u res. This paper proposed a modified freq u ency based term wei g htin g scheme ( m TF) ex-tended from TF wei g htin g form u la. The proportion of s u m n u mber of occ u rrences terms in the collection is involved in calc u latin g the local term wei g ht t in doc u ment d . Moreover, a new variant form of the standard TF-IDF form u la is introd u ced by replacin g the TF part by the proposed modified scheme. Both of proposed form u las were benchmarked with many different term wei g htin g schemes u sed a dataset based on the DW P F and OSAC dataset. The experimental eval u ation meas u rements res u lts show that the proposed m TF consistently o u tperform other form u las in the classifica-tion acc u racy, precision, and recall. Moreover, the proposed TF-IDF variant o u tper-forms the ori g inal TF-IDF form u la in all eval u ation meas u rements. O u r f u t u re work is foc u sin g on testin g and bench markin g the proposed form u la with standard text classi-Ohs u med corpora and in Arabic s u ch as Watan, Khaleej, BBC, and CNN datasets.
