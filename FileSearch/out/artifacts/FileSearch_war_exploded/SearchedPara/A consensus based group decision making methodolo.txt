 1. Introduction
One of the most significant changes in the paradigm of business management is the fact that individual businesses no longer compete as solely autonomous entities, but as supply chains. A supply chain (SC) is a wide (national/global) network of suppliers, manufactures, warehouses, distribution centers and retailers through which raw materials are acquired, transformed and delivered to customers. Supply chain management (SCM) deals with the coordination of manufacturing and logistic activ-ities between autonomous decision making units ( Wong et al., 2004 ).

SCs are generally complex with numerous activities usually spread over multiple functions or organizations and sometime over lengthy time horizons. Therefore, it is necessary to overlay a coordination system. Coordination in SC management refers to the integration of different parts of an organization or different organizations in SC to accomplish a collective set of tasks for mutual benefits. It involves more formal relationships, objectives and actions which are mutual, compatible and common, not necessary a centralized authority ( Gaudreault et al., 2009 ).
There seems to be no unique definition of supply chain coordination (SCC), although different SCC perspectives have been presented in literature. Larsen (2000) defined SCC as  X  X  X ollaborative working for joint planning, joint product development, mutual exchange of information and integrated information systems, cross coordination on several levels in the companies on the network, long-term cooperation and fair sharing of risks and benefits X  X . According to Simatupang and Sridharan (2002) ,  X  X  X  collaborative SC simply means that two or more independent companies work jointly to plan and to execute SC operations with greater success than when acting in isolation X  X . However, the most accepted definition of coordination is  X  X  X he act of managing the dependencies between entities and joint effort of the entities working together toward mutually defined goals X  X  ( Malone and Crowston, 1994 ).
According to Arshinder et al. (2008) different issues of SCC addressed in literature are: (i) ro le of coordination in supply chain and various models, (ii) coordination across functions of supply chain tion at SC interfaces i.e., procurement X  X roduction, production X  inventory, production X  X istribution, and distribution X  X nventory, etc., and (iv) coordination mechanism like contracts, information tech-nology, information sharing, joint decision making, etc., in context of resource sharing, risk and reward sharing, joint promotional activ-ities, forecasting, joint decision making, etc. Interested readers can refer Arshinder et al. (2008) , for detailed review and perspectives of various SCC issues.

Other than the aforementioned issues of supply chain coordi-nation, the supply chain partners often collectively make a number of tactical and strategic decisions to achieve mutually defined goals. Some of these decisions are for selection problems i.e., selection of machine tools, selection of supply chain partners, selection of suppliers X  X uppliers, selection of transportation sys-tem, etc., which require consideration of a number of criteria for evaluation. Due to this reason, the supply chain coordination problem is considered as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem in group decision making environment in this article. 1.1. Motivations
The quality of the solution of MCDM problems depends upon the preferences of decision makers. However, due to the vague-ness of human being X  X  thought, the preferences are often based on inadequate information or personal judgments resulting in inap-propriate and biased decision. The fuzzy MCDM (fuzzy multi-criteria decision making, FMCDM) approach can explain more appropriately decision maker X  X  evaluation of available alterna-tives for the selection of best solution when critical criteria have subjective perceptions. Several approaches have been developed to solve fuzzy MCDM problems ( Hadi-Vencheh and Mokhtarian, 2009a , b; Yang et al., 2008 ; Dimova et al., 2006 ). Therefore, the evaluation process must be conducted in a fuzzy environment taking into account linguistic variables. In this article, selection problem of supply chain coordination is formulated as MCDM problem and is solved by a version of TOPSIS in fuzzy environ-ment. Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is an ideal method for evaluating alternatives simultaneously on the basis of cost criteria X  X  and benefits criter-ia X  X . It bases upon the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS), i.e., the solution that maximizes the cost criteria and minimizes the benefit criteria.

Recently, many authors have proposed different approaches for solving the MCDM problems of SCM i.e., TOPSIS and data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach for supplier selection and evaluation ( Chen, 2011 ), modified TOPSIS for supplier selection ( Toloie Eshlaghy and Kalantary, 2011 ), fuzzy extent analysis benchmarking for selection of third-party reverse logistics provi-der ( Govindan and Murugesan, 2011 ), TOPSIS method with sensitivity analyses for Supply chain disruption risk evaluation ( Zheng, 2010 ), etc. However, as there are many stake holders in SC, generally these SC problems are solved collectively by them.
This leads the scenario where the preferences of the criteria for different alternatives are obtained by consensus between differ-ent decision makers. This is a typical group decision making (GDM) situation, where decision makers differ in their choice of alternatives.

The complexity of the problems exasperated when the number of criteria, alternatives and decision makers are large and the group is nominal. The problem further magnifies when the decision makers are geographically dispersed. Various approaches have been developed to assist a group of decision makers to arrive at decision. Most of these approaches have resolved the problems with interacting groups, where experts can actively exchange their ideas and opinions. In contrast, the methodology comprising of non-interacting groups, employs various levels of structure to facilitate the decision making process ( Bordogna et al., 1997 ;
Herrera et al., 1996 ). However, all these approaches have some weaknesses like effect of moderator X  X  biasness, excess time requirement, inaccuracy, etc.

Various researchers have focused their attention on increasing the ability of the group to make the quality decisions ( Choudhury et al., 2006 ; Bordogna et al., 1997 ; Herrera et al., 1996 ; Bryson, 1996 ; Keeny and Raiffa, 1993 ). In this regard, with the exponen-tial growth of the Internet, the present day computer-supported asynchronous meetings are increasingly used to complement or replace the traditional face-to-face group meetings. Such an approach can help conflicting groups move from disagreement to consensus. In this article, first a soft-consensus based approach is used for interactive exchange and elicitation of participants preferences taking into account the benefits and interests of all the concerned stake holders of the supply chain involved. The decision matrix is obtained by consensus between the decision makers (SC stake holders) and finally the multi-criteria SCC selection problem is solved by a version of fuzzy TOPSIS. The weights of the criteria are determined by CCSD method ( Wang and Luo, 2010 ) objectively without the interference of the decision makers. 1.2. Contributions (iii) A soft consensus based methodology is proposed for making (iv) Correlation coefficient and standard deviation (CCSD) based brief literature review dedicated to SCC, SC selection problems, Fuzzy TOPSIS and consensus based group decision making;
Section 3 deals with the theoretical background of the proposed methodology; Section 4 presents the proposed methodology in algorithmic form; Section 5 illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology with an numerical example; and Section 6 concludes the paper with future perspectives. 2. State of the art 2.1. Supply chain coordination partners habitually work as an individual firm based on local perspective and opportunistic behavior results in mismatch of supply and demand ( Fisher et al., 1994 ). This mismatch may result in disagreements over goals and objectives, domain of decisions and actions and differences in perceptions of reality used in joint decision making between SC partners. The lack of coordination may result in poor performance of SC due to imprecise forecasts, poor capacity utilization, huge inventory pileup and inventory cost, poor customer service, time to market, order fulfillment response, quality, customer focus and customer satisfaction ( Ramdas and Spekman, 2000 ).
 be accomplished by joint consideration of the system wide costs ( Hennet and Arda, 2008 ; Huq et al., 2006 ), sharing cost and price information ( Piplani and Fu, 2005 ; Boyaci and Gallego, 2002 ) and synchronizing processing time and delivery quantity ( Barron, 2007 ; Zou et al., 2008 ). These policies may sometime upset interests of one of the SC partners. To compensate losses, different mechanisms have been proposed as quantity discounts, revenue-sharing contracts and incentive alignment policies ( Li and Wang, 2007 ; Chen and Chen, 2005 ). The different models result in reduction in ordering cost, holding cost, purchasing cost, and SC system wide costs and improvement in customer service level and product availability and variety.

The SC partners coordinate by sharing information regarding demand, orders, inventory, POS data, etc. ( Reddy and Rajendran, 2005 ). A coherent decision making helps in resolving conflicts among SC partners and in exceptions handling in case of any future uncertainty. To improve the performance of SC many authors have proposed various approaches taking into considera-tion different problems of SSC for joint decision making, some of them are as follows: coordination games ( Cason et al., 2011 ; Calabuig and Olcina, 2009 ); mutual coordination ( Klein and Orsborn, 2009 ), channel coordination ( Choi et al., 2008 ; Lee and
Rhee, 2007 ), project coordination ( Jha and Iyer, 2006 ), costs and and Kannan, 2006 ), construction ( Xue et al., 2007 ), joint con-sideration of replenishment ( Chen and Chen, 2005 ), product development ( Kim and Oh, 2005 ), inventory holding costs with dynamic demand ( Boctor et al., 2004 ), B2B electronic markets ( Wang and Benaroch, 2004 ); orders frequency ( Yang and Wee, 2002 ), batch size ( Boyaci and Gallego, 2002 ), collaborative plan-ning ( Aviv, 2001 ), cooperative design ( Wilson and Shi, 1996 ).
Other than these coordination problems, there are many selection problem which may be strategic in nature and need coordination for a joint decision making by various supply chain partners i.e., supplier selection ( Van der Rhdd et al., 2009 ; Wu et al., 2009a , b; Onut et al., 2009 ), distribution center selection ( Lee, 2005 ; Chen, 2001 ), transportation mode selection ( Tuzkaya and O  X  n  X  ut, 2008 ; Ulengin et al., 2007 ; Punakivi and Hinkka, 2006 ; Eskigun et al., 2005 ), etc.

To our knowledge, most of the developed approaches take into account only the interest of major stake holder and interests of other partners is ignored. However, many of these decisions may interest of many partners. Due to this reason , in this article the SC coordination problem of selection which is MCDM in nature is solved by making consensus between the supply chain partners . 2.2. Consensus based group decision making
In group decision making problems, DMs X  opinions may differ substantially. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a consensus process in an attempt to obtain a solution of consensus. Classi-cally, consensus is defined as the full and unanimous agreement of all the experts (DMs X ) regarding all the possible alternatives. It is dynamic and iterative group discussion process, coordinated by a moderator, who helps the experts to make their opinions closer.
In each step of this process, the moderator knows the actual level of consensus between the experts, by means of the consensus measure, which establishes the distance to the ideal state of consensus. If the consensus level is not acceptable, that is, if it is lower than a specified threshold, which means that there exist a great discrepancy between the experts X  opinions, and then the moderator would urge the experts to discuss their opinions further in an effort to make them closer. On the contrary, when the consensus level is acceptable, the moderator would apply the selection process in order to obtain the final consensus solution to the MCDM problem. In this framework, a question to solve is how to substitute the actions of the moderator in the group discussion process in order to model automatically the whole consensus process. The literature is very rich with models that guide the moderator and the experts in achieving the consensus process for GDM problems. The well-known consensus models can be classi-fied in three main categories respectively  X  X uzzy preference X  ( Xu and Cai, 2011 ; Alonso et al., 2010 ; Herrera-Viedma et al., 2007 ),  X  X inguistic preference X  ( Cabrerizo et al., 2010 ; Mata et al., 2009 ; Herrera-Viedma et al., 2005 ) and  X  X ultiplicative preference X  ( Dong et al., 2010 ; Yeh et al., 2001 ; Bryson, 1996 ).
Xu and Cai (2011) developed goal programming models and quadratic programming models to derive the importance weights of fuzzy preference relations and multiplicative preference rela-tions. Moreover, iterative algorithms with fuzzy preference rela-tions are proposed for establishing acceptable levels of consensus in group decision making.

Cabrerizo et al. (2010) analyzed the different approaches to compute soft consensus measures in fuzzy GDM problems and discussed their advantages and drawbacks. Mata et al. (2009) studied the consensus processes in GDM problems under multi-granular linguistic information, and proposed an adaptive con-sensus support system model to guide it and reduce the number of consensus rounds.

Dong et al. (2010) explored the internal relationship among three operators respectively the linguistic ordered weighted averaging (LOWA), the 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging (TOWA) and the extended ordered weighted averaging (EOWA). Furthermore, they proposed a consensus operator under the continuous linguistic model or the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model.

Herrera-Viedma et al. (2007) presented a new consensus model for GDM problems with incomplete fuzzy preference relations using consistency and consensus measures. The model uses two different kinds of measures to guide the consensus reaching process and generates advice to experts in a discriminate way. This consensus model applies a feedback mechanism to give personalized advice to the experts on how to change and complete their fuzzy preference relations which could be used like an estimation procedure of missing values because it gen-erates possible values to complete the missing values in the incomplete fuzzy preference relations. Therefore, it could act as an estimation procedure based on consistency/consensus criteria. Herrera-Viedma et al. (2002) proposed a consensus model for MCDM with different preference structures, preference orderings, utility values, fuzzy preference relations, and multiplicative pre-ference relations. The main improvement of this consensus model is that it presents a consensus support system to model the moderator X  X  actions in the consensus reaching processes which guides the consensus process automatically. In this article , we have adopted the Herrera-Viedma et al. (2002) model for consensus forming between the DMs X  without the interference of moderator. 2.3. Fuzzy TOPSIS applications
Technique for Order Performance by similarity to Ideal solu-tion (TOPSIS), one of the most classical methods for solving MCDM problem, was first developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) . It is based on the principle that the chosen alternative should have the longest distance from the negative-ideal solution i.e., the solution that maximizes the cost criteria and minimizes the benefits criteria; and the shortest distance from the positive-ideal solution i.e., the solution that maximizes the benefit criteria and minimizes the cost criteria. In classical TOPSIS ( Hwang and Yoon, 1981 ), the rating and weight of the criteria are known precisely. However, under many real situations crisp data are inadequate to model real life situation since human judgement are vague and cannot be estimated with exact numeric values. To resolve the ambiguity frequently arising in information from human judgement fuzzy set theory ( Zadeh, 1965 ) has been incorporated in many MCDM methods including TOPSIS. In fuzzy
TOPSIS all the ratings and weights are defined by means of linguistic variables.

A number of fuzzy TOPSIS methods and applications have been developed in recent years. Chen and Hwang (1992) first applied fuzzy numbers to establish fuzzy TOPSIS. Triantaphyllou and Lin (1996) developed a fuzzy TOPSIS method in which relative closeness for each alternative is evaluated based on fuzzy arith-metic operations. Liang (1999) proposed Fuzzy MCDM based on ideal and anti-ideal concepts. Chen (2000) considered triangular fuzzy numbers and defined crisp Euclidean distance between two fuzzy numbers to extend the TOPSIS method to fuzzy GDM situations. Chu (2002) and Chu and Lin (2002) further improved the methodology proposed by Chen (2000) . Jahanshahloo et al. (2006) and Chu and Lin (2009) extended the fuzzy TOPSIS method based on alpha level sets with interval arithmetic. Chen and Lee (2010) extended fuzzy TOPSIS based on type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method in order to provide additional degree of freedom to represent the uncertainties and fuzziness of the real world. The fuzzy TOPSIS approach is applied to verity of problems like evaluation of initial training aircraft ( Wang and Chang, 2007 ), industrial robotic system ( Kahraman et al., 2007 ), plant selection researcher.

In this article, we have modified Wang and Lee (2009) approach which is extension of the Chen (2000) approach. In the proposed approach weights of the criteria are automatically calculated using CCSD method ( Wang and Luo, 2010 ) without direct involvement of the decision makers. 3. Theoretical background of solution methodology
Collective decision making in supply chain coordination is a dynamic and iterative GDM process and it is coordinated by a moderator. The moderator helps the experts/decision makers to readjust their opinions so as to reach an accepted level of consensus. In this paper, we have incorporated the concept of soft consensus measure, owing to its closer resemblance to the real life ( Choudhury et al., 2006 ; Bordogna et al., 1997 ; Herrera et al., 1996 ).

The Decision Makers (DMs X ) provide their opinion regarding each alternative of the selection problem as fuzzy linguistic variable which is referred as criteria vector. In this article, a soft consensus based GDM approach is proposed to enumerate the collective preferences of decision makers without the help of moderator by internet based meetings when decision makers are at different geographical locations. The decision matrix formed by collective opinion is evaluated by a version of fuzzy TOPSIS method whose weights are enumerated by CCSD method.

Although fuzzy MCDM/TOPSIS is a well discussed concept with several applications, in this section the theoretical background of the proposed methodology is highlighted. In many situations where performance rating and weights cannot be given precisely, the fuzzy set theory is introduced to model the uncertainty of human judgments and such problems are known as fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (FMCDM) problems. Zadeh (1965) first introduced fuzzy set theory into MCDM as an approach for effectively dealing with the inherent imprecision, vagueness and ambiguity of the human decision making process.

In this section, theoretical background of fuzzy set, neat OWA operator based soft consensus method; fuzzy TOPSIS and CCSD based objective weight determination method used for the proposed solution methodology are presented. 3.1. Fuzzy set and fuzzy number was introduced by Zadeh (1965) for dealing with uncertainty and imprecision associated with information. The preliminary of fuzzy set theory used for development of fuzzy TOPSIS method used in this article is as follows:
Definition 1 (Fuzzy Set). In a universe of discourse X a fuzzy set ~ a is characterized by a membership function m ~ a  X  x  X  which associate each element x in X , a real number in the interval [0, 1].
Membership function m ~ a  X  x  X  is termed as the grade of membership of x in ~ a . ~ a  X f x , m ~ a  X  x  X  9 x A X g X  1  X 
Definition 2 (Fuzzy number). A fuzzy number is a quantity whose value is imprecise, rather than exact as is the case with  X  X  X rdinary X  X  (single-valued) numbers. Any fuzzy number can be thought of as a function whose domain is a specified set usually the set of real numbers, and whose range is the span of non-negative real numbers between, and including, 0 and 1. Each numerical value in the domain is assigned a specific  X  X  X rade of membership X  X  where 0 represents the smallest possible grade, and 1 is the largest possible grade.
 triangular fuzz number is described by a triplet ~ a ( a , b , c )as shown in Fig. 1 .
 membership function:
Definition 3. Let ~ a 1 ( a 1 , b 1 , c 1 ) and ~ a 2 ( a fuzzy numbers, then the vertex method is defined to calculate the distance between them as: d  X  ~ a 1 , ~ a 2  X  X 
Definition 4. Assuming that ~ a 1 ( a 1 , b 1 , c 1 ) and ~ a real numbers, then the distance measurement d  X  ~ a 1 , ~ a to the Euclidean distance ( Chen, 2000 ).

The fuzzy number ~ a 2 is closer to fuzzy number ~ a 1 than other fuzzy number ~ a 3 if and only if d  X  ~ a 1 , ~ a 2  X  o d 3.1.1. Arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers
Some main operations of triangular fuzzy numbers are ( Kaufmann and Gupta, 1991 ): ~ a  X  ~ a 2  X  X  a 1  X  a 2 , b 1  X  b 2 , c 1  X  c 2  X  X  4  X  ~ a ~ a 2  X  X  a 1 a 2 , b 1 b 2 , c 1 c 2  X  X  5  X  ~ a ~ a 2  X  X  a 1 a 2 , b 1 b 2 , c 1 c 2  X  X  6  X  ~ a = ~ a 2  X  X  a 1 = a 2 , b 1 = b 2 , c 1 = c 2  X  X  7  X   X  ~ a k  X  X  X  a 1 k , b 1 k , c 1 k  X  , for k A X  X  8  X  3.1.2. Linguistic values
A linguistic variable is a variable whose values are expressed in linguistic terms. The linguistic variable is a very helpful concept for dealing with situations which are too complex or not well-defined enough to be reasonably described by traditional quanti-tative expression Zadeh (1965) . For example, Chen and Hwang (1992) considered  X  X  X elevance X  X  as a linguistic variable whose values include VH (Very high), H (High), MH (Medium high), M (Medium), ML (Medium low), L (Low) and VL (Very low) which can be further represented by triangular fuzzy numbers such as
VH (0.8, 1, 1), H (0.65, 0.8, 0.95), MH (0.5, 0.65, 0.8), M (0.35, 0.5, 0.65), ML (0.2, 0.35, 0.5), L (0.05, 0.2, 0.35) and VL (0, 0, 0.2). The fuzzy linguistic terms and their corresponding values proposed by
Cheng and Hwang (1992) are shown in Table 1 . 3.2. Neat OWA operator based consensus method
First, we enumerate the crisp value for the opinions by defuzzification and then the assessments of the DMs X  for different criteria corresponding to various alternatives are aggregated. In the aggregation phase, a collective solution is calculated by incorporating the individual opinions. The collective solution indicates the global preference of different alternatives according to the opinion of experts X  in that round.

The aggregation operation is carried out by means of an ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator ( Choudhury et al., 2006 ). The concept of fuzzy linguistic quantifiers that represents the idea pertaining to fuzzy majority is used to calculate the weighting vector to facilitate the aggregation process. Linguistic quantifiers are defined as Q and their range is given symbolically by ( a , b ). The most common linguistic fuzzy quantifiers used are given as (0.3, 0.8), (0, 0.5) and (0.5, 1) respectively. The consensus model is based on two soft consensus criteria: (1) Consensus measure : A measure to evaluate the agreement of all the decision makers. It is used to guide the consensus process which continues in cycle until the consensus measure becomes higher than a predefined consensus level. (2) Proximity measure : It is used to guide the opinion making
Both measures are calculated by comparing the individual solutions with the collective solution. The comparison is done on the basis of positions of the alternatives in the individual as well as collective solution. In the aggregation phase, the collective solu-tion of all the decision makers for each alternative is evaluated. After enumerating the position of each alternative in each indivi-all the DMs X  for each alternative, called degree of proximity  X  X  F is evaluated by comparing the position of that alternative in the decision makers individual solution and the collective solution. This comparison is done by using a function F t ( j )  X  f ( reflects the proximity to both positions. The next step is to calculate the consensus degree R ( j ) of all the DMs X  for each alternative  X  X  j  X  X  on the basis of degree of proximity. The consensus measure ( R X ) over the set of alternatives, can be calculated by aggregating the above degree of consensus for alternatives using neat OWA operator. The consensus level (CL), required for the solution is determine in advance. When the consensus measure reaches this level, the decision making session is finished and the solutions are obtained Herrera-Viedma et al. (2002) . Fig. 2 illus-trates the various steps of the soft consensus methodology used.
A feedback mechanism based on proximity measure has been applied to modify the DMs opinions. Proximity measure for each decision maker is evaluated aggregating the proximity degree of the decision makers by using neat OWA operator. Re-evaluation of the opinions is carried out by suggesting the DMs to increase or decrease their value of preferences regarding the alternatives. This suggestion is based on the comparison of the ranking of the individual solutions with the collective solution of the particular round. Only the DMs lying below a fixed proximity level are asked reassess their views. A concept of maximum number of rounds called MC (Maximum Cycle) is also incorporated in the consensus model to avoid prevents endless rounds of discussion to reach the consensus ( Herrera-Viedma et al., 2002 ; Herrera et al., 1996 ).
After developing the consensus model, the collective prefer-ences of decision makers regarding each alternative for each criterion are used to form the decision matrix of the MCDM problem of the SCC selection problem to meet the SC objective. 3.3. Correlation coefficient and standard deviation integrated (CCSD) method
Wang and Luo (2010) proposed CCSD method for determining the weights of criteria in MCDM. CCSD method determines the weights of criteria by considering the standard deviation of each criterion and their correlation coefficients with the overall assess-ment of decision alternatives. The correlation coefficients are determined by removing each criterion from the overall assess-ment of decision alternatives. If the correlation coefficient for a criterion turns out to be very high and close to one, then the removal of this criterion will have little effect on decision making; otherwise, the criterion should be given an important weight. The CCSD method is formulated as a system of nonlinear equations that are transformed into a nonlinear optimization model for solution.

Suppose there are m decision alternatives A 1 , y , A m to be evaluated in terms of n selection criteria C 1 , y , C n , which forms a crisp decision matrix denoted by X  X  ( x ij ) n m , where x performance value of A i with respect to C j . Due to the incommen-surability among different criteria, the decision matrix X  X  ( x needs to be normalized to eliminate its dimensional units and bring them in range of [0 X 1]. The crisp criteria are normalized into the range of [0 X 1] using Eqs. (9) and (10). (i) Benefit criterion (larger the better type): r  X   X  x ij (ii) Cost criterion (smaller the better type) r  X   X  min f x ij g x ij  X  max f x
Let the normalised decision matrix Z  X  X  z ij  X  m n  X  W Z 0 and
The overall assessment value r i of each A i is a linear function of criteria weights.  X 
The best decision alternative is the one with the highest value.

Remove criterion C j from the set of criteria and consider its impact on decision making. When C j is dropped out, the overall assessment value of each decision alternative can be redefined as: above overall assessment values can be expressed as: where z j  X  1 m given more important weights than those with small standard deviations. In another word, if a criterion has equal utilities on all the alternatives considered, then it can be removed from the set of criteria without any impact on decision making. Based upon Consensus Measure&gt;CL Proximity Measure&lt;  X  the above analyses, weights of criteria are defined as: w  X  where s j is standard deviation of the value of C j determined by  X  v u u t j  X  1 , ... , n  X  18  X 
In order to shorten the difference between the largest and the smallest weights 1 x j is root squared. Eq. (17) is a system of nonlinear equations. It contains n equations, which can uniquely determine n weight variables. To solve the equation, we convert it into the following nonlinear optimization model for solution: Minimize J  X  Subject to P n j  X  1 w j  X  1 w j Z 0, j  X  1,..., n
The resultant weights of criteria are referred to as CCSD weights. 3.4. Fuzzy TOPSIS
Technique for Order Performance by similarity to Ideal solu-tion (TOPSIS), one of the most classical methods for solving
MCDM problem, was first developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) . It is based on the principle that the chosen alternative should have the longest distance from the negative-ideal solution i.e., the solution that maximizes the cost criteria and minimizes the benefits criteria; and the shortest distance from the positive-ideal solution i.e., the solution that maximizes the benefit criteria and minimizes the cost criteria. In classical TOPSIS, the rating and weight of the criteria are known precisely. However, under many real situations crisp data are inadequate to model real life situation since human judgments are vague. In fuzzy TOPSIS all the ratings and weights are defined by means of linguistic variables. A number of fuzzy TOPSIS methods and applications have been developed in recent years ( Chen et al., 2006 ; Yong, 2006 ; Wang and Chang, 2007 ; Kahraman et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2009 , 2003 ). The approach extending TOPSIS method to fuzzy data used in this study can be outlined as follows ( Wang and Lee, 2009 ; Chen, 2000 ).
 Step 1 : Construct the fuzzy decision matrix
Assume there are m alternatives (bidders) A i ( i  X  1,2, y evaluated against n selection criteria C j ( j  X  1,2, y , n ). The fuzzy
MADM can be concisely expressed in matrix format as Eqs. (20) and (21).
W  X  ~ w 1 , ~ w 2 , ... , ~ w n  X  21  X  triangular fuzzy numbers, ~ w j  X  X  ~ w j 1 , ~ w j 2 , ~ w ~ b , ~ c ij  X  . ~ x ij is the performance rating of the i th alternative A i with respect to j th criteria C j and ~ w j represent the weight of the j criteria C j .
 Step 2 : Normalize the fuzzy decision matrix
The raw data are normalized to eliminate anomalies with different measurement units and scales in several MCDM problems. However, the purpose of linear scales transform normalization function used in this study is to preserve the property that the ranges of normalized triangular fuzzy num-bers to be included in [0, 1]. If ~ R Denotes the normalized fuzzy decision matrix, then
R  X  X  ~ r ij m n , i  X  1 , 2 , ... , m and j  X  1 , 2 , ... , n  X  22  X  where, for fuzzy data denoted by triangular fuzzy number as and cost-related criteria are calculated as follows: where, c  X  j  X  max i c ij if j A B a j  X  min i a ij if j A C Step 3: Construct weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix
The weighted normalized decision matrix can be computed by multiplying the importance weights of the evaluation criteria and the values in the normalized fuzzy decision matrix. The weighted normalized decision matrix ~ V is defined as:
V  X  X  ~ v ij m n , i  X  1 , 2 , ... , m ; j  X  1 , 2 , ... n  X  25  X  where ~ w ij is fuzzy weight of the criteria C j .

Step 4: Determine the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution.

Because the positive triangular fuzzy numbers are included in the interval [0, 1], the fuzzy positive ideal reference point ( FPIRP , A  X  ) and fuzzy negative ideal reference point ( FNIRP , A ) can be defined as:
A  X   X  X  ~ v  X  1 , ~ v  X  2 , ... , ~ v  X  j  X  X f X  max i v ij 9
Step 5: Calculate the distances of each initial alternative to FPIRP and FNIRP
The distance of each alternative from fuzzy positive ideal reference point and fuzzy negative ideal reference point can be derived respectively as: d i  X  where, d  X  ~ v ij , ~ v  X  j  X  denotes the distance between two fuzzy numbers and is calculated by Eq. (3). d  X  i represents the distance of alternative A i from FPIRP, and d i is the distance of alternative A i from FNIRP .

Step 6: Obtain the closeness coefficient and rank the order of alternatives Calculate the closeness coefficient ( CC ) of each alternative as:
CC i  X  d i
An alternative with index CC i approaching 1 indicates that the alternative is close to the fuzzy positive ideal reference point and far from the fuzzy negative ideal reference point. Rank each CC of each alternative in descending order. The alter-native with the highest CC value will be the best choice. 4. Proposed methodology
The steps of the proposed methodology in algorithmic form are given as follows:
Step 1: Collect the fuzzy preferences of the decision makers for each criterion and alternative.

Step 2: Generate the crisp preference values using defuzzyfica-tion equation x  X  ( a  X  2 b  X  c )/4.

Step 3: Aggregate the individual opinions of DM X  X  for each criterion and alternative using the OWA operator f Q for getting the collective solution with respect to each alternative A S c ij  X  f Q f X  cv ij  X  1 ,  X  cv ij  X  t , ... ,  X  cv ij  X  where, S c ij is collective solution of T decision makers for criterion C j and alternative A i , Q is fuzzy linguistic quantifier that represents the concept of fuzzy majority and is used to calculate the weighting vector of f Q , W 00  X  w 00 1 , ... , w 00 linguistic quantifier, defined by parameters ( x , y ) as (0.3, 0.8).

Step 4: For each criterion follow the steps mentioned below: 5. Illustrative example the decision making process. Due to the multi-person, multi-criteria decision making nature of the collective decision making problem of supply chain management, it is considered as a suitable case for application of consensus based fuzzy TOPSIS methodology proposed in this article. The decision makers have been asked to give their preferences regarding the im portance of the criteria; C 1 and C 5 pertaining to various alternatives while taking into account various benefits as fuzzy linguistic variables depicted in Fig. 3 and into triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN X  X ) and defuzzified into crisp values using the formula x  X  ( a  X  2 b  X  c )/4. Judgment of the four DMs in crisp defuzzyfied values for ten different alternatives and five criteria are given in Table 2 .

Taking the evaluations of all the alternatives pertaining to each decision maker, a collective preference is enumerated for the entire criteria. On the basis of these global values, fuzzy TOPSIS is used for ranking and selection of the best solution. The collective solution for each criterion is enumerated using Step 3 of the proposed methodology. This is done with the help of OWA operator ( Yager, 1994 , 1997 , 1998 ). We have adopted fuzzy quantifier of type  X  X  X s many as possible X  X  with pair (0.5, 1). The corresponding OWA operator with the weighting vector is W  X  (0, 1/2, 1/4, 1/4). Collective solution of the various DMs X  enumerated using Step 3 is presented in Table 3 .

Now, in the next step the rank of each alternative in individual solution ( Z s ) and collective solution ( Z c ) for each criterion is enumerated. The, results of execution of Step 4a showing the rank of each alternative in individual and collective solutions for criterion C 1 are shown in Table 4 .

The degree of proximity of each DM with respect to all the alternatives is enumerated on the basis of Step 4a and Step 4b of the proposed methodology. The ranking difference of different
DMs X  solution with respect to collective solution of criterion C shown in Table 5 . The proximity table constructed on the basis of rank difference is given in Table 6 .

The degree of consensus related to all DMs X  is calculated using the Step 4c and the results are given in Table 7 .

The consensus measure is calculated using the degree of consensus with the help of neat OWA operator as given in Eq. (36) of the Step 4d. The a parameter used here has a value of 0.8.
The Consensus Measure R X of the present round for different criteria is calculated by Step 4d is shown in Table 8 .
Here, we have considered a soft consensus level (CL) of 0.9; hence there is a need to change the opinions of the DMs X  whose proximity measure is lying below the fixed priori. The proximity measure of each DM is enumerated using the degree of proximity given in Table 6 and Eq. (37) of Step 4e. The aggregation is carried out with the help of neat OWA ( Choudhury et al., 2006 ; Herrera-
Viedma et al., 2002 ). These results are given in the Table 9 . The fixed proximity level set by the company is 0.7.

From the results shown in Table 9 it is clear that for criteria C proximity measure of DM 3 and DM 4 are below the threshold value of 0.7. Similarly for all the other criteria the proximity measure of one or more DM X  X  are less than the threshold value. This leads to the re-evaluation phase (Step 6) of the above process. Therefore, on the basis of results calculated in Table 9 ,
DM 3 and DM 4 are requested to change their opinion taking into consideration their ranking difference ( Z c Z s ) with respect to the collective solution ( Table 5 ). Similarly, DM 1 is asked to change his opinion for C 2, C 3, C 5 ; for DM 2 all the proximity measures are above the threshold value in the first round so he is not asked to change opinion; DM 3 is asked to change his opinion for C
C and DM 4 is asked to change his opinion for all the criteria as his proximity measure is less than 0.7 for all the criteria by referring the rank differences of his opinion from the collective solution.
The revision in the opinion is done on the basis of Step 6a to Step 6f of the proposed methodology.

After, the re-evaluation phase is completed; once again the degree of proximity, degree of consensus and consequently consensus measure are calculated and all the steps from Step 1 to Step 6 are repeated. After three rounds of consensus making, finally the consensus measure for all the criteria becomes higher than the threshold value of 0.9 in the fourth round. The consensus measure R x of the fourth round are shown in Table 10 .
Since, this consensus measure is above the fixed level, the discussion would be stopped and this temporary collective solu-tion would be the final result. The final consensus solution representing the collective preferences of the four DMs X  regarding the score of ten alternatives with respect to five criteria is given in Table 11 (Step 7).

Criteria C 1 and C 3 are cost criteria which auctioneer wants to minimize where C 2, C 4 , and C 5 are benefit criteria which auction-eer wants to maximize.

The next stage (Step 8) is determination of weights of the criteria using correlation coefficient and standard deviation inte-grated (CCSD) method. Table 11 shows the crisp decision matrix.
Further, the crisp decision matrix is normalized using Eqs. (9) and (10) for benefit and cost criteria respectively, same is depicted in
Table 12 . The weights of importance of various criteria are determined using Eqs. (11) X (18) and solving the nonlinear opti-mization problem given by Eq. (19). The enumerated weights are w 1  X  0.185246015, w 2  X  0.149161027 , w 3  X  0.24316378 , w 4  X  0.226636406 , w 5  X  0.195792772 .
 are actually in the range of [0 X 1] ( Table 11 ), can be transformed into the fuzzy linguistic variables. By using membership function shown in Fig. 3 the collective preferences of all the criteria for every alternative given in Table 11 are converted in linguistic variables. The resulting fuzzy linguistic variables decision matrix for the problem is shown in Table 13 .

By converting the fuzzy linguistic variables into triangular fuzzy membership numbers using Table 1 , the fuzzy decision matrix is obtained. The fuzzy decision matrix is shown in Table 14 . Since, the triangular fuzzy numbers are in the range of [0 X 1], they are not normalized further.

In the next step (Step 10) weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix,  X  ~ v ij m n is enumerated. Table 15 shows, the fuzzy weighted decision matrix which is calculated by using Eqs. (23) X (26). From Table 15 , it is established that the elements ~ v , 8 i , j are normalized positive triangular fuzzy numbers in closed interval [0 X 1]. Thus in Step 11, the fuzzy positive ideal solution ( FPIS , A  X  ) and the fuzzy negative ideal solution ( FNIS , A ) can be
The distance d  X  and d of each alternative from A  X  and A is derived respectively by using Eqs. (29), (30) and (3) in Step 12. In next step (Step 13), the closeness coefficient (CC i ) for each alternative is obtained using Eq. (31). The final results obtained by proposed fuzzy TOPSIS analysis are shown in Table 16 . As last step (Step 14), the best performer among the ten alternatives is alternative 10 (A 10 ). The overall performance ranking is A10 4 A5 4 A2 4 A6 4 A3 4 A9 4 A4 4 A8 4 A1 4 A7. 6. Conclusion and future work
Supply chain coordination (SCC) helps in making joint deci-sions in planning and execution of SC operations with greater success than when acting in isolation. In this paper, a fuzzy
TOPSIS based MCDM methodology is proposed for selection problems of SCC where the decision makers are geographically separated and give their preferences using internet. In order to bring consensus among the decision makers regarding the pre-ferences, a soft consensus based GDM methodology is proposed in this paper. The decision matrix is formed by consensus of all the concerned supply chain partners. As, the meeting is based on internet an objective weight determination methodology namely
CCSD is used for evaluation of the weights of the criteria without interference of the decision makers.

To illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, a numerical example of four decision makers, five criteria, and ten alternatives is demonstrated. Alternative ten A 10 is identified as the best among the ten.

In future some issues like incomplete preferences by decision makers may also be addressed and mechanism for avoidance of deadlock between the DMs X  may be devised. As perspective, we are expecting to apply the proposed methodology to real life case studies dealing with supplier selection, distribution center selec-tion, transportation mode selection etc. Agent based framework can also be developed for extending the present work.
