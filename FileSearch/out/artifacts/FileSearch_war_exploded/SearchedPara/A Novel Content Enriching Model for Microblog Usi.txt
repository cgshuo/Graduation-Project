 During the past decade, the short text represen-tation has been intensively studied. Previous re-searches (Phan et al., 2008; Guo and Diab, 2012) show that while traditional methods are not so powerful due to the data sparseness problem, some semantic analysis based approaches are proposed and proved effective, and various topic models are among the most frequently used techniques in this area. Meanwhile, external knowledge has been found helpful (Hu et al., 2009) in tackling the da-ta scarcity problem by enriching short texts with informative context. Well-organized knowledge bases such as Wikipedia and WordNet are com-mon tools used in relevant methods.

Nowadays, most of the work on short text fo-cuses on microblog. As a new form of short tex-t, microblog has some unique features like infor-mal spelling and emerging words, and many mi-croblogs are strongly related to up-to-date topics as well. Every day, a great quantity of microblogs more than we can read is pushed to us, and find-ing what we are interested in becomes rather dif-ficult, so the ability of choosing what kind of mi-croblogs to read is urgently demanded by common user. Such ability can be implemented by effective short text classification.

Treating microblogs as standard texts and di-rectly classifying them cannot achieve the goal of effective classification because of sparseness prob-lem. On the other hand, news on the Internet is of information abundance and many microblogs are news-related. They share up-to-date topics and sometimes quote each other. Thus, external knowledge, such as news, provides rich supple-mentary information for analysing and mining mi-croblogs.

Motivated by the idea of using topic model and external knowledge mentioned above, we present an LDA-based enriching method using the news corpus, and apply it to the task of microblog clas-sification. The basic assumption in our model is that news articles and microblogs tend to share the same topics. We first infer the topic distribution of each microblog based on the topic-word distri-bution of news corpus obtained by the LDA esti-mation. With the above two distributions, we then add a number of words from news as additional information to microblogs by evaluating the relat-edness of between each word and microblog, since words not appearing in the microblog may still be highly relevant.

To sum up, our contributions are: (1) We formulate the topic inference problem for (2) We enrich the content of microblogs by infer-(3) We evaluate our method on the real dataset-Based on the idea of exploiting external knowl-edge, many methods are proposed to improve the representation of short texts for classification and clustering. Among them, some directly utilize the structure information of organized knowledge base or search engine. Banerjee et al. (2007) use the title and the description of news article as two separate query strings to select related concept-s as additional feature. Hu et al. (2009) present a framework to improve the performance of short text clustering by mining informative context with the integration of Wikipedia and WordNet.

However, to better leverage external resource, some other methods introduce topic models. Phan et al. (2008) present a framework including an approach for short text topic inference and adds abstract words as extra feature. Guo and Diab (2012) modify classic topic models and propos-es a matrix-factorization based model for sentence similarity calculation tasks.

Those methods without topic model usually re-ly greatly on the performance of search system or the completeness of knowledge base, and lack in-depth analysis for external resources. Compared with our method, the topic model based method-s mentioned above remain in finding latent space representation of short text and ignore that rele-vant words from external knowledge are informa-tive as well. We formulate the problem as follows. Let edge consisting of M e documents. V e = task is to enrich each microblog with additional information so as to improve microblog X  X  repre-sentation.

The model we proposed mainly consists of three steps: (a) Topic inference for external knowledge by (b) Topic inference for microblogs by employing (c) Select relevant words from external knowl-3.1 Topic Inference for External Knowledge We do topic analysis for EK using LDA esti-mation (Blei et al., 2003) in this section and we choose LDA as the topic analysis model because of its broadly proved effectivity and ease of under-standing.

In LDA, each document has a distribution over all topics P ( z k | d j ) , and each topic has a distri-bution over all words P ( w i | z k ) , where z k , d j and w i represent the topic, document and word respec-tively. The optimization problem is formulated as maximizing the log likelihood on the corpus: max
In this formulation, X ij represents the term fre-quency of word w i in document d j . P ( z k | d j ) and P ( w i | z k ) are parameters to be inferred, cor-responding to the topic distribution of each doc-ument and the word distribution of each topic re-spectively. Estimating parameters for LDA by di-rectly and exactly maximizing the likelihood of the corpus in (1) is intractable, so we use Gibbs Sampling for estimation.

After performing LDA model ( K topics) esti-mation on EK , we obtain the topic distribution-s of document d e j ( j = 1 , . . . , M e ), denoted as P ( z e lies on the word distributions of topics we have obtained here. 3.2 Topic Inference for Microblog In this section, we infer the topic distribution of each microblog. Because of the assumption that microblogs share the same topics with external corpus, the  X  X opic distribution X  here refers to a dis-tribution over all topics on EK .

Differing from step (a), the method used for topic inference for microblogs is not directly run-ning LDA estimation on microblog collection but following the topics from external knowledge to ensure topic consistence. We employ the word distributions of topics obtained from step (a), i.e. P ( w e lem in a similar form to Formula (1) as follows: max where X ij represents the term frequency of word Obviously most X ij are zero and we ignore those words that do not appear in V e .

Compared with the original LDA optimization problem (1), the topic inference problem for mi-croblog (2) follows the idea of document gener-ation process, but replaces topics to be estimated with known topics from other corpus. As a result, parameters to be inferred are only the topic distri-bution of every microblog.

It is noteworthy that since the word distribution of every topic P ( w e be further solved by separating it into M m sub-problems: microblogs and can be easily proved convexity. After solving them, we obtain the topic distribu-tions of microblog d m j ( j = 1 , . . . , M m ), denoted as P ( z e 3.3 Select Relevant Words for Microblog To enrich the content of every microblog, we s-elect relevant words from external knowledge in this section.

Based on the results of step (a)&amp;(b), we calcu-late the word distributions of microblogs as fol-lows: where P ( w e i | d m j ) represents the probability that words, though some words may not actually ap-pears in a microblog, there is still a probability that it is highly relevant to the microblog. Intuitively, this probability indicates the strength of associa-tion between a word and a microblog. The word distribution of every microblog is based on topic analysis and its accuracy relies heavily on the ac-curacy of topic inference in step (b). In fact, the more words a microblog includes, the more accu-rate its topic inference will be, and this can be re-garded as an explanation of the low efficiency of data sparseness problem.
 P ( w e i | d m j ) in descending order. Having known the top L relevant words according to the result of sorting, we redefine the  X  X erm frequency X  of every word after adding these L words to microblog d m j as additional content. Supposing these L words of word w  X  X  w e lows: where RT F (  X  ) is the revised term frequency.
As the Equation (5) shows, the revised term fre-quency of every word is proportional to probabili-ty P ( w i | d m j ) rather than a constant.
So far, we can add these L words and their re-vised term frequency as additional information to the same role as TF in common text representation vector, so we calculate the TFIDF of the added words as: T F IDF ( w, d m j ) = RT F ( w, d m j )  X  IDF ( w ) (6)
Note that IDF ( w ) is changed as arrival of new words for each microblog. The TFIDF vector of a microblog with additional words is called en-hanced vector . 4.1 Experimental Setup To evaluate our method, we build our own dataset-s. We crawl 95028 Chinese news reports from Sina News website, segment them, and remove stop words and rare words. After preprocessing, these news documents are used as external knowl-edge. As for microblog, we crawl a number of microblogs from Sina Weibo, and ask unbiased assessors to manually classify them into 9 cate-gories following the column setting of Sina News. After the manual classification, we remove short microblogs (less than 10 words), usernames, links and some special characters, then we segmen-t them and remove rare words as well. Finally, we get 1671 classified microblogs as our microblog dataset. The size of each category is shown in Ta-ble 1.
 Table 1: Microblog number of every category
There are some important details of our imple-mentation. In step (a) of Section 3.1 we estimate LDA model using GibbsLDA++, a C/C++ imple-mentation of LDA using Gibbs Sampling. In step (b) of Section3.2, OPTI toolbox on Matlab is used to help solve the convex problems. In the clas-sification tasks shown below, we use LibSVM as classifier and perform ten-fold cross validation to evaluate the classification accuracy. 4.2 Classification Results Table 2: Classification accuracy with different rep-resentations
In this section, we report the average preci-sion of each method as shown in Table 2. The enhanced vector is the representation generated by our method. Two baselines are TFIDF vec-tor (Jones, 1972) and boolean vector (word oc-currence) of the original microblog. In the table, our method increases the classification accuracy from 75.52% to 84.53% when considering addi-tional information, which means our method in-deed improves the representation of microblogs. 4.3 Parameter Tuning 4.3.1 Effect of Added Words Figure 1: Classification accuracy changes accord-ing to topics and added words
The experiment corresponding to Figure 1 is to discover how the classification accuracy changes when we fix the number of topics ( K = 100 ) and change the number of added words ( L ) in our method. Result shows that more added words do not mean higher accuracy. By studying some cas-es, we find out that if we add too many words, the proportion of  X  X oisy words X  will increase. We reach the best result when number of added words is 300. 4.3.2 Effect of Topic Number Figure 2: Classification accuracy changing ac-cording to the number of topics
The experiment corresponding to Figure 2 is to discover how the classification accuracy changes when we fix the number of added words ( L = Microblog (Translated) Top Relevant Words (Translated)

Shenzhou Nine will carry three astronauts, including the first Chinese female astronaut, and launch in a proper time during the middle of June. day, satellite, launch, research, technology, system, mission, aerospace, success, Chang X  X  Two 300 ) and change the number of topics ( K ) in our method. As we can see, the accuracy does not grow monotonously as the number of topic-s increases. Blindly enlarging the topic number will not improve the accuracy. The best result is reached when topic number is 100, and similar ex-periments adding different number of words show the same condition of reaching the best result. 4.3.3 Effect of Revised Term Frequency Figure 3: Classification accuracy changing ac-cording to the redefinition of term frequency
The experiment corrsponding to Figure 3 is to discover whether our redefining  X  X erm frequency X  as revised term frequency in step (c) of Section 3.3 will affect the classification accuracy and how. The results should be analysed in two aspects. On one hand, without redefinition, the accuracy re-mains in a stable high level and tends to decrease as we add more words. One reason for the de-creasing is that  X  X oisy words X  have a increasing negative impact on the accuracy as the propor-tion of  X  X oisy words X  grows with the number of added words. On the other hand, the best result is reached when we use the revise term frequen-cy. This suggests that our redefinition for term fre-quency shows better improvement for microblog representation under certain conditions, but is not optimal under all situations. 4.4 Case Study In Table 3, we select several cases consisting of microblogs and their top relevant words .

In the first case, we successfully find the country name according to its leader X  X  name and limited information in the sentence. Other related coun-tries and events are also selected by our model as they often appear together in news. In the other case, relevant words are among the most frequent-ly used words in news and have close semantic re-lations with the microblogs in certain aspects.
As we can see, based on topic analysis, our model shows strong ability of mining relevan-t words. Other cases show that the model can be further improved by removing the noisy and mean-ingless ones among added words. We propose an effective content enriching method for microblog, to enhance classification accuracy. News corpus is exploited as external knowledge. As for techniques, our method uses LDA as its topic analysis model and formulates topic infer-ence for new data as convex optimization prob-lems. Compared with traditional representation, enriched microblog shows great improvement in classification tasks.

As we do not control the quality of added words, our future work starts from building a filter to se-lect better additional information. And to make the most of external knowledge, better ways to build topic space should be considered.
