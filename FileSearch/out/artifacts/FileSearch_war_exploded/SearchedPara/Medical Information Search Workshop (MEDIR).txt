Medical information search refers to methodologies and technologies that seek to improve access to medical infor-mation archives via a process of information retrieval (IR). Such information is now potentially accessible from many sources including the general web, social media, journal ar-ticles, and hospital records. Health-related content is one of the most searched-for topics on the internet, and as such this is an important domain for research in information retrieval.
Medical information is of interest to a wide variety of users, including patients and their families, researchers, gen-eral practitioners and clinicians, and clinicians with spe-cific expertise such as radiologists. There are several dedi-cated services that seek to make this information more eas-ily accessible, such as Health on the Net X  X  medical search systems for the general public and medical practitioners Despite the popularity of the medical domain for users of search engines, and current interest in this topic within the information retrieval research community, development of search and access technologies remains particularly challeng-ing. One of the central challenges in medical information search is diversity of the users of these services. These chal-lenges can be summarized as follows: 1. Varying information needs: Understanding various types 2. Varying medical knowledge: The different categories http://www.hon.ch/ 3. Varying language skills: Given that much of medical The objective of this workshop is to provide a forum to en-able the progression of research in medical information re-trieval to provide enhanced search services for all users with interest in medical information search.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers inter-ested in medical information search with the goal of identi-fying specific research challenges that need to be addressed to advance the state-of-the-art and to foster interdisciplinary collaborations towards the meeting of these challenges. To enable this, we will encourage participation from researchers in all fields related to medical information search including mainstream information retrieval, but also natural language processing, multilingual text processing, and medical image analysis.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to: Users and information needs; Semantics and NLP for medical IR; Re-liability and trust in medical IR; Personalised search; Eval-uation of medical IR; Multilingual questions in medical IR; Multimedia technologies in medical IR; The role of social media in medical IR.

The workshop programme includes an invited presenta-tion by Pr Bill Hersh, and short research and position pa-pers describing approaches or challenges on the topics of the workshop. The programme aims to encourage interaction and discussion to develop a shared understanding of the re-search challenges facing the area of medical information re-trieval. The workshop will seek to identify specific actions necessary to advance this field, and to hopefully foster fur-ther collaborations between the participants.
 We would like to thanks the European Science Foundation project ELIAS for supporting this workshop.
