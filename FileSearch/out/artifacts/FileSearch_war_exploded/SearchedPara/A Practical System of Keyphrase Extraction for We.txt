 Keyphrases can be used to facilitate Web users grasping the main regression model was first trained based on a set of human-labeled documents. Then it was used to extract keyphrases from new the structure information in a Web page was investigated for with a Web page collected by a search engine server were used to help keyphrase extraction. Third, a method was put forward in this paper in order to evaluate the similarity of phrases. H.4.m [ Information Systems Application ]: Miscellaneous; I.5.4 [ Pattern Recognition ]: Applications-Text processing ; General Terms: Algorithms, Experimentation, Verification Keywords: Keyphrase extraction, Logistic Regression, Web page processing automatically extract keyphrases from Web pages. The purpose of the main topics of a Web page [2]. In this section we introduce our algorithm of extracting keyphrase generation, phrase feature representation, and key phrase extractor training. First, all text content in a given web page is extracted and is split these initial term sequences up to a given length are enumerated to keyphrases set, phrase whose length is more than four never that begin or end with a stopword are eliminated. editor assigned keyphrase of the web page. So does the title. If the take them as candidate phrases. of our feature set. They are explained as follow. PF, phrase frequency, is the occurrence frequency of the complete phrase in the web page. the terms in the phrase. The ATF calculated as follow: Where i Seg is a text segment, TF w denotes the frequency of word. Okapi is the most familiar IR model. It involves a TF part, an IDF Okapi formula is suggested, which has a more stable performance: 
Okapi w d the parameters setting suggested in [1]. has a different visualization style, it can contain much description information. Based on above assumption, we construct three structure features as follow. either title or keyword metadata. SS, structure score, is a score to describe the context environment of candidate phrase. It is defined as follow: Let 1 i Seg  X  and 1 i Seg + be the text segments contained in the adjacent field of i Seg in the HTML file. VSS, visual style score, is a score to discriminate term sequences in different visual styles. VSS Seg candidate phrase, we also calculate its MatchDegree with the editor labeled keyphrases as the candidate phrases X  salience score. used to train a model. called logit. We propose the MatchDegree as a measurement of similarity of follows: Where N p1 , N p2 are the word numbers contained in P P , P 2 . N inv is the inverse-order-number of two phrases P Inverse-order-number is the number of word pairs that have different orders in different phrases. In our experiments, we compare performances of our algorithm with another well known keyphrase extraction system, Kea [3]. The data set consists of 381 web pages from www.msn.com. Five editors are asked to label and rank the key phrases in a given Web page. We randomly choose a training set of 190 documents. Others are used as a test set. among human. HTML files as input documents. are called Kea-HTML. The results that Kea is trained by using the text contents of web pages are called Kea-Text. We also evaluate our algorithm in different experimental settings. The results that only use the common features: PF, ATF, OKA are called Kex-Common. The results that use all six features are all the results on precision metric. We can see from the results that our algorithm performs better than Kea on precision. 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 Figure 1: Overall comparison on Precise Precision metric Figure 1 show the overall comparisons between all the results on performs better than Kea on precision. From figure 1, we can see that when extracting more keyphrases, the improvement of our algorithm is bigger. Further more, on each top n level our number. Kex-Full approximate the Cross-User upper bound on extracting Top 1, 3 and 5 keyphrases. keyphrase extraction. In this approach, we introduce Query-log-based method and HTML structure-based methods to enhance the between phrases. Experiments show that a big improvement over performance compared to human behavior. [1] H. Fang, T. Tao, C.X Zhai. A formal study of information [2] P.D.Turney.
