 Social media on the Internet has become a preponderant channel for the public to ex -press their emotions and share their opinions. By November 2015, the amount of netizen s has been up to 688 million in China [1] . Increasingly netizens tend to comment the public affairs on social websites such as Weibo and Tieba with their own langu age styles, particularly in extremely strong statements. 
The public opinion on Internet is the comprehensiv e expression of individual X  X  be-liefs, attitudes, opinions and emotions, which reflect the most netizens  X  viewpoints fac-ing various emergencies and h ot issues . However, cybermob s according to U rban D ic-tionary 1 a nd D efinithing 2 refer to  X  persons acting in cyberspace as to hold someone accountable for a real or imagined misdeed or social faux pas and join together to humiliate or manipulate via the I nternet  X  . And as the main sponsor of the cyber vio-lence or rumors , they always post aggressive, provocative and insulting remarks when-ever a public event occurs, which spread negative emotions and falsehoods on the In-ternet in order to express somewhat ext reme private mood or only indulge in flattering by other followers in such an eye -catching way . For example, in the case of t he brawl between fans of Sichuan (  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) and players of Liaoning (  X  X  X  X  X  ) (Both are fa-mous basketball teams in CBA ) after the 3 rd game of CBA -F inal s, s ome cybermob s threw vicious curse -messages on the Weibo of Sichu an Players, which caused the fur-ther fierce conflict on social websites among fans from Sichuan P rovince , Liaoning Province and even the whole country. Besides, instead of payi ng attention to the truth, cybermobs attack government or people from other region only by virtue of their sub-jective imagination. Meanwhile, there is a saying  X  a lie told a thousand times become the truth  X  . The follow -up netizens would rather believe it w ithout verifying the authen-ticity of the message, which indire ctly contribute to the rapid spread of rumors and cause social panic. Th o se netizens who spread fake info rmation are also suspect ed cybermob s essentially .

I dentifying those rumor -makers or filthy language speaker s who could be defined as  X  suspected cybermobs  X  in this paper as early as possible is able to make us get ahead of the diffusion of falsity information from the source, help avoid the outbreak of the negative mass mood and cut off th e spread of rumors. Aiming at identifying suspected cybermob s , f irst ly, we automatically collect user information and content information through web -crawler from Baidu Tieba. After collecting user information and content information, and annotating suspec ted cybermob s , we build a cybermob corpus which is composed by internet users labeled as suspected cybermob s o r general netizens with all their post ing s and their user information . B y analyzing the difference s of user -based feature s , content -based feature s and unique characteristic s of suspected cybermob s be-tween suspected group and general ones , we construct a feature set. Finally , we intro-duc e ma chine -learning methods with features described above to generate several clas-sifier s that are use d to identify suspected cybermob s automatically.
 The rest of the paper is structured as followed: we will introduce the related work in Section 2. We take cybermobs and general netizens into comparison and collect the fea tures that can distinguish them in Section 3. In Section 4 we train and select a clas-sifier that identify cybermob s correctly with 3 different machine learning method s Then we present our experiment, analyze t he results and verify the effec tiveness of this ap-proach with actual events. At last we draw a conclusion and point out our future work in Section 5 . 2.1 Baidu Tieba Baidu Tieba was e stablished on December 3, 2003 and now is t he world's largest Chi-nese Communicative platform . Here, Tieba is a place on the internet allowing use rs to do interactive s ocial net work site activities. The slogan of Baidu Tie ba is "Born for your interest" . As of 2014 there have been more than eight million Tieba , mostly created by fans cover ing popular stars, films, comics or books. And m ore than one b illion post ing s have been published in Tieba . 
Baidu Tieba ever used to allow anon ymous posting which just shows IP address, but now it only allows posting by account, and anonymous posting is not allowed. Users can post with at most 10 pictures and 1 vide o that can be quoted from certain broadcast websites. 2.2 E xisting research es The research es on cybermob are carr ied out earlier in Sociology Science and generally can be divided int o three aspects: the definition, the causes and the guidance of cyber-mobs . According to the present research es as we know , t here isn X  X  an agreement for the definition of cybermob, and h ere we use the definition of cybermob described in Sec-tion 1 in this paper . Stud ies on the cause of cybermob formation are mainly to measure the n egative influence of subjective attitude s and objective factors to the netizens with v arious method s [2 -4]. T he guidance of cybermob s is to discuss the possible s ol ution with legislation and education [5 -7] .

At present , there are not many researches directly on identif ying suspected cyber-mobs . Comparing with the studies on identifying suspected cybermob s , research es on spammers are much deeper. T here are mainly 3 kinds of method s for spammer detection [8] . One is based on content feature, For example , Lau RYK et al. [9] utilize s the sim-ilarity of contents to find fake reviewers. L iu et al. [10] find s the fake reviews with the help o f sentiment classification. Jindal N et al. [11] collect s different pattern s to auto-matically find the fake review s . A not her method for spammer detection is based on user feature. Benevento et al. [12] collect s 62 features from user X  X  behavior s a n d detect s spammer with them. Zhu [13] propose s a model that automatically select s feature s based on matrix factorization. User relationship is also used as user feature. Moh et al. [14] gather s user relationship in social media to quantify the user's credibility wit h which they measure whether a user to be a spammer. Facebook [15] introduce s Ea-geRank into this task. The highe r the weight, the lower the probability of the candidate user to be a spammer. However, not all cybermob s are born cybermob s , they may have already build their social network before they suddenly become cybermob s . So i t may hard to apply th ese method s into our system. Due to methods based on a specific feature cannot cover all aspects , some method s with i ntegrated multiple specific feature s are proposed to detect spammers in order to improve the precision [16 -18] .

Compared with spammer s that m echan ic ally publish similar comments, the remarks of suspected cybermobs are full of vulgar speech, region discrimination and c riticism of the government . Learning these unique features can improve suspected cybermobs identification system. Suspected cybermobs an d general netizens also have differences in user information and content form s . So with user feature and content feature, it will further improve s the identification accuracy . spammers, especially some suspected cybermob s are directly transformed from spammers, this paper combine s methods of traditional method s which are based on user feature and content feature with unique characteristic of suspected cybermob s . After constructi ng classifier s with machine learning model s , we can automatically identify suspected cybermob s . And with actual events, we verify the method of this paper can provide effective data support for the prediction of group emotion. According to existing research es , general feature s including use r -based feature s and content -bas ed featur e s are common but effective static feature s that often used for iden-tification. T he number of followers , the number of followees , and whether the avata r is a cartoon picture or a default picture could measure the credibility of general netizens [19] . The r atio that posting s with web terminal or mobile terminal is also different in different group s [20] . And even user s  X  location or gender also have an impact on the quality of the ir post ings [21] .Besides, suspected cybermobs also have their unique char-acteristics. Vulgar speech , r egion d iscrimination and c riticism of the government are nothing new in their postings. In this paper, from labeled corpus , we randomly select 400 labeled as general netizens and 400 labeled as suspected cybermobs each of which is assigned randomly from 1 to 400. We analyze the difference s between cybermob s and general netizens from user information , posting s X  content and unique characteris-tic s of cybermob s with dataset collected. 3.1 G eneral feature User -based feature (UF) . In the following, cumulative distribution function (CDF) is introduced to analyze the user feature of suspected cybermobs and general netizens, as shown in Figure. 1.

Figure 1 ( a ) and 1( b ) analyze the different number of followers and followees be-tween general netizens and suspected cybermobs which illustrates that m ost the latter ones do not have many followees and they do not care about other user s . F igure 1 ( c ) shows the different distribution s of average level , which illustrates suspected cyber-mobs have a higher average level compared to general netizens . As for the number of Tieba post ings , suspected cybermobs publish more post ing s and get more replies tha n general ones . This maybe because suspected cybermobs always post controversial re- X  X iv X  rather than posting any replies . T hat X  X  why general netizens post less and why their levels are relatively lower. Analysis on the number of created days from Figure 1 ( e) indicates that suspected cybermobs tend to create new accounts in a short period . This may be because of their controversial content with which their accounts are ea sily blocked. While general netizens cherish their accounts and will not change their ac-count frequently.
 Content -based F eature (C F) . Tieba allows users to use function s like posting picture s , emoji, URL links and mention (@) with web terminal or computer terminal. We discuss each of them, and the results are shown in figure 2.
As we can see in figure 2(a), most users, no matter suspected cybermob s or general netizens do not like to use mention (@).Th e reason may be that Tieba is not an ac-quaintance circle , and people do not tend to communicate with each other directly . I t is found in figure 2(b) that more than 90% general netizens do not post with emoji. However d ue to the characterist ics of vent ing emotions , suspected cybermob s post ap-proximately four times on average emoji higher than general one s. As for image shown in figure 2(c), most cybermob s post no more than 0.2 image s per posting, while general netizens post at least 0.2 image s per posting. Figure 2(d) indicates both suspected cyber-mob s and general netizens do not like to add URL links into their postings. Maybe it does not work for most time. The ration that people use computer terminal is shown in Figure 2(e). More than half of the general users prefer to post and reply with mobile terminal that is more convenient . While in order to post /reply more and faster, sus-pected cybermob s tend to post with computer terminal 3.2 U nique characteristic of suspected cybermob (UC) Vulgar Speech . In the social media, without supervision , people are free to make re-mark s . U nscrambling post ings in their own view s , their comments are full of charac-teristic s of grassroots with curr ent popular i nternet new vulgar words like  X   X  X  X   X  (means loser),  X   X  X   X  (means p rofartssor) which will spread negative emotions and may finally lead to group negative emotions . Therefore, this paper take s the usage of these i nternet vulgar words into comparison. T he results shown in figure 3 ( a ) indicates that almost every post ing of suspected cybermob s contains at least one vulgar word which is many more than that of general ones . Region D iscrimination. There is a prominent region discrimination phenomenon on the internet, namely people due to some nati ve concept of their hometown suffer attack s from ne tizens who are in other region s , or people take the initiative to attack other areas only because of their  X  X arrow region love  X  . For example, some region discrimination remarks like  X  X X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (means people in XX province are all s hameless dogs) X  appear in the comments of the news . P ost ings from suspected cyber-mob s often change the topic into abusing each other regardless of the truth, which se-riously affect the harmony on the I nternet. Therefore, we use these as feature to reveal the cybermobs ( as shown in Figure 3( b ) ). Compared to ordinary users, cybermob s are much more inclined to carry out regional attacks. Criticism of the Government. There is a nother phenomenon that some people prefer to discredit the government on the I nternet. No matter what happen, no matter it is right or wrong, they will attract people to the so -called unreasonable policies and blame the government for all mistakes . For example, a m edical disputes in Cameroon get to the following comment  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  ! ( means It is the hospital under the jurisdiction Chinese government )  X  So aiming at this phenomenon , we first select words associated with government and policy . And compare th e frequency between suspected cybermobs and general netizens with negative emotion . The results shown in figure 3 ( c ) illustrate that only cybermob s tend to express negative emotion or directly attack the government and the policies f requently . 4.1 Data set We craw l postings and replies from  X  X BA  X  and  X  X ota X  in Tieba by the end of April 20, 2015 . A nd we get 3,524,584 post ing s in total. Then we collect all the users X  information and post ing s with each specific user. We asked two annotators to label the users. The two annotators were requested to judge whether a candida te user to be a suspected cybermob with all his postings and his user information . If there is a disagreement be-tween the two annotators , we ignore this candidate user. We randomly select 400 cyber-mob s and 400 general netizens as training data. And 150 sus pected cybermob s and general users as test data . 4.2 Suspected cybermob identification with SVM Based on the feature above, we introduce SVM (Support Vector Machine) into our suspected cybermob identification system. Figure 4 illustrate s the overview of our sys-tem: W e first collect feature s as we describe in Section 3 from training data, and con-struct classifier with machine learning model using these feature s . After training, the classifier is applied to distinguish whether a candidate u ser is a general netizen or a suspected cybermob . S upport V ector M achine (SVM) . S VM is a supervised learning model with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non -probabilistic binary linear classifier. SVM model is a repre-sentation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the sepa-rate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of t he gap they fall on.

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non -linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high -dimensional feature spaces. 4.3 Benchmark Maximum Entropy (ME) . The maximum entropy principle [22] points out that for an unknown situation, we need to predict the probability distribution of a random event, satisfy all known conditions, and uniform distribution of probability for the unknown situation. Because in this case, method of maximum entropy c an minimum risk s for prediction.
 In the process o f classification, X is set of feature selection, C is one of the categories, P( c | X ) is a probability with feature s predicted in category c. Under the restriction of the constraint conditions, the maximum val ue of the formula ( 1 ) is the maximum entropy: Na X ve Bayes (NB) . NB is a common technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set using Bayes' theorem:
All naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independ-ent of the value of any other feature given the class variable. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability. 4.4 Results and analysis We first compare SVM with ME and NB . For each classifier, the same evaluation met-rics (precision, recall and F -measure) is calculated for suspected cybermob identifica-tion.

As shown in table 1, i t is obvious that SVM classifier achieve s the best f -measure which indicates SVM could separate training data into two parts with a maximum mar-gin. Besides, NB and ME also achieve a high precision with all features. It shows that good fe ature s including content -based feature, user -based feature and unique charac-teristic s of cybermob s are good contribution to our system . 
What X  X  more, we compare the influence of different kinds of feature s on our sus-pected cybermob identificat ion system. A s shown in Table 1, we achieve the best re-sults with all kinds of features. In addition, compared to the single kind of feature s , the combination of features can always get better performance s , which indicates each kind of feature has a positive effect on the identification of the suspected cybermobs . Com-pared to user feature and content feature, with unique characteristic s , we reach precision at least 88.23%. Th is result also highlight s the unique characteristic s that cybermob s tend to vent emotion s with vulgar speech , region discrimination and criticisms of the government , with which it is easy to be identified from general netizens. 4.5 Prototype implementation. We apply the system into hot spots happen ed recently in real environment to explore its practical value.

We introduce our system into a hot spot  X  brawl between fans of Sichuan and players of Liaoning  X . First, we crawl all the post ing s from Tieba of  X  SICHUANJINQIANG (  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  )  X ,  X  LIAONINGBENXI (  X  X  X  X  X  X  )  X  and  X  CBA  X  from March 17 th to March 24 th 2016 . We extract all users who post at least 3 postings in Tieba mentioned above . After collecting user feature, content feature and unique characteristic s of sus-pected cybermob s , we automatically identify w hether the user s to be suspected cyber-mob s with our system. 3 annotator s are asked to label the users to be suspected cyber-mob s , a nd finally we get 103 users (36 cybermob s and 67 general netizens) . And t he identification results are shown in table 2 .
 As shown in table 2 , we also achieve the best f -measure with all kinds of feature s. We get high er recall but low er precision with unique characteristic s of cybermob s . This maybe because the two teams involved in the b rawl are the representative s of Sichuan Pr ovince and Liaoning Province , regional vocabularies appear everywhere in posts. And due to the r egion discrimination, many general netizens are falsely identified as suspected cybermobs . While w ith user feature and content feature, we get higher pre-cision but lower recall. So in this way , we propose a hypothesis that people play differ-ent role s in different events. T here may not always be so many suspected cybermob s . B ut when an unexpected event related to themselves happens, they may turn into cyber-mob s to defeat what they support quickly .
 4.6 F urther application
We crawl all the postings by users who are mentioned in S ection 4.5 in 2016 ex ce pt in  X  SICHUANJINQIANG  X  ,  X  L IAONINGBENXI  X  and  X  X BA X . In total, we get 3174 postings with these 103 users (36 labeled as general n e tizens and 67 labeled as sus-pected cybermobs) and we identify these netizens with their postings in other Tieba using our system again , the results are shown in table 3.

Table 3 illustrate that only 1/3 of those who are automatic ally recogni zed as cyber-mob s with our system before are still identified as cybermob s . And most general netizens identified as general netizens in brawl between Sichuan and Liaoning are still identified as general netizens. Only 2 in 67 wh o are labeled as general netizens turn into cybermob s because they are involved in other emergencies .
 Considering the above analy sis, we ensure most cybermob s are not born cybermobs . Nevertheless, when an emergency that may threat to them happens , they wil l turn into cybermob s in a short period time .
 Aiming at cut ting off the diffusion of vulga r -speech es or rumors from source on social websites , w e propose an approach for identifying suspected cybermob s who used to be the previous make r s or major contributors of the cyber violence or rumor s , and always post aggressive, provocative and insulting remarks . W e analyz e and extract the differ-ences of user -based / content -based feature and unique characteristic of cybermob s firstly . Then we introduce machine -learning method into a p ractical system based on suspected cybermob s corpus constructed with feature s above . According to c omp ar ison between different model s ( SVM , ME and NB , we take ME and NB as benchmark model ) and different feature s restricted, t he empirical results show our a pproach can detect suspected cybermob s correctly and efficiently .

A ll features play positive role s in our system. However they are all statistic feature s , we are going to consider applying more cognitive feature s which are proved to be ef-fective in social psychology into our system to improve the accuracy in next work. Meanwhile , we may miss the golden hours to guide public opinion due to relative hys-teresis of social media once events have occurred. So we will take postings -sequence on the Internet into co mparison in order that we can identify suspected cybermob s ear-lier for coming emergency issues.
