 Wikipedia has millions of articles, many of which receive li ttle at-tention. One group of Wikipedians believes these obscure en tries should be removed because they are uninteresting and neglec ted; these are the deletionists . Other Wikipedians disagree, arguing that this long tail of articles is precisely Wikipedia X  X  advanta ge over other encyclopedias; these are the inclusionists . This paper looks at two overarching questions on the debate between deletion ists and inclusionists: (1) What are the implications to the long tai l of the evolving standards for article birth and death? (2) How is vi ew-ership affected by the decreasing notability of articles in the long tail? The answers to five detailed research questions that ar e in-spired by these overarching questions should help better fr ame this debate and provide insight into how Wikipedia is evolving.

Wikipedia has emerged as one of the world X  X  most popular dest i-nations on the web. With millions of articles on a staggering variety of topics, Wikipedia has successfully established itself a s a useful compendium of general knowledge, and is read in excess of 150 million times per day [15]. Some might even consider its plet hora of information to be an addictive time sink 1 . http://xkcd.com/214/
The fascination with Wikipedia extends beyond its readers. Re-searchers from numerous academic fields have also taken noti ce of Wikipedia, recognizing it as a ecosystem consisting of many inter-esting processes that are ripe for study.

Community Collaboration. Wikipedia X  X  core idea is that any-one can edit just about anything on the site, and that all of its con-tent comes from the people who use it. At first thought, this so unds like a recipe for disaster  X  how can a group of ordinary people write a good encyclopedia? Why would someone volunteer to do this? What about people who do not know what they are doing? How can we know whether people are writing good articles?
Despite these challenges, Wikipedia X  X  reliance on its user com-munity seems to be working, and researchers have worked to le arn more about how and why. A study by Kittur, et al. found that as much as 50% of the early work on Wikipedia was done by a tiny group of  X  X lite X  contributors making up less than 5% of its ed i-tor population [10]. However, the study finds that in recent t imes, the balance has shifted toward a larger number of infrequent con-tributors, with the work done by the elites declining to less than 30%. Bryant, et al. studied several individuals X  motivatio ns for  X  X ecoming Wikipedian, X  learning about difficulties and suc cesses they experienced along the way [4]. Viegas, et al. introduce d a vi-sualization tool to help understand patterns in how people X  s edits to an article have shaped and reshaped the article over time [16 ].
Conflict and Vandalism. Of course, letting anyone edit any ar-ticle also has downsides. There can be disagreement among th ose who are working on an article, leading to conflicts and argume nts about the article X  X  content. Kittur, et al. have studied way s to iden-tify and visualize conflict, finding that it has been on the ris e as Wikipedia grows [11]. Vuong, et al. developed models to dete ct the presence of controversy by looking at how people add and dele te words when editing an article [17].

Also, some users are malicious and will vandalize Wikipedia ar-ticles by deleting content, adding nonsensical content, or inject-ing misinformation. Viegas, et al. used their visualizatio n tool to identify and study the edit patterns commonly used by vandal s and the response they receive from the rest of the community. The ir results suggest that Wikipedians are fast at repairing the d amage vandals cause, with more than half of mass content deletions being addressed within three minutes [16]. Priedhorsky, et al. di scovered that the visible impact of vandalism in Wikipedia to its read ers is small but rising rapidly [14].

Governance. Dealing with issues such as conflict and vandal-ism lead to the need for governance. There must be policies ab out what types of behavior are acceptable or unacceptable, proc esses to guide how conflicts are resolved, and guidelines regardin g ar-ticle content and style. Wikipedia is largely self-governi ng, with many decisions being made by the users themselves. A number o f studies have focused on this self-governance, seeking to le arn about things such as about how consensus forms and evolves [6, 12], or how policies are used to guide collaboration [3].

Content Quality. Finally, the content itself in Wikipedia is also of much interest. Some see it as a vast source of general knowl edge and wonder if the semi-structured content can be used in inte resting ways. For instance, Milne, et al. developed ways to automati cally generate domain-specific thesauri from Wikipedia articles . They found that the generated thesauri offered good coverage and more contemporary language usage than expert-created ones [13] .
However, because Wikipedia X  X  content is not necessarily wr it-ten by experts, much debate exists whether it is complete, ac cu-rate, and high-quality. Giles compared the quality and accu racy of Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica and found that to the sta-tistical limits of the study, the number and distribution of errors in the two encyclopedias was comparable [7]. Wilkinson and Hub er-man find that one distinguishing factor of high-quality Wiki pedia articles is a larger number of editors [18], which is perhaps coun-terintuitive given the old adage:  X  X oo many cooks spoil the b roth. X 
In our work, we look at an area related to the wide breadth of article content on Wikipedia, but that has ties to the other p rocesses described above as well: community collaboration, conflict s, and policies. Specifically, we explore the long tail of Wikipedia arti-cles. We look at what the long article tail is and how it is evol ving as people create more articles. We also study how the long tai l is being affected by the policies that govern what topics are su itable for articles, and the ongoing conflicts among people who disa gree about these policies.

Before we formally state our research questions, we describ e the phenomenon of the long tail and how we apply it in the context o f Wikipedia. The Long Tail is a term introduced by Chris Ander-son, the editor-in-chief of Wired , that refers to a business strategy that received much attention in recent years [2]. The long ta il gets its name from the natural long-tailed and heavy-tailed dist ributions appearing in consumption rates of many types of products suc h as books, songs, or movies. In these distributions, a small num ber of popular  X  X its X  dominate, while a large number of items tha t in-dividually have little consumption form the so-called  X  X on g tail. X  Many of these distributions are power laws.

The long tail strategy is to bolster a business X  X  performanc e by finding ways to offer items from the long tail at little to no co st to the business. The theory is that while each long tail item o nly gets purchased a few times, their aggregate sales can signifi cantly increase revenue. Traditionally, this strategy has not bee n viable for physical stores because selling everything in the tail requ ires too much floor space. Thus, retail stores must carefully choose w hat items they stock, and they naturally gravitate toward high-volume  X  X its X  from the head of the distribution.

However, the long tail strategy is usable by web-based retai lers because physical storefronts are not required. Warehouse s pace is cheaper than retail space, so it becomes possible to stock an d offer more items. Furthermore, in some domains such as digital mus ic, the cost of storing items is negligible since the items consu me little to no physical space.

The long tail has also been used to describe phenomena in non-commerce domains such as blogs, social networks, and taggin g. Here, the long tail often refers to the natural long-tailed d istribu-tions found in these domains rather than to a business strate gy. For instance, the influence of blogs is described as a long tail by Agar-wal, et al in their work to identify influential bloggers [1]. Golder and Huberman found that in collaborative tagging systems, d istri-butions of tag usage can be modeled using a stochastic urn pro cess that naturally yields long-tailed distributions [8].

In the context of Wikipedia, we apply the long tail to its coll ec-tion of encyclopedia articles and the viewership that each a rticle receives. As a point of reference, consider that the 2008 Bri tannica Encyclopedia Suite contains 65,000 articles 2 , which is well less than 5% of the millions of articles in the English Wikipedia. Using a Wikipedia web log dataset that we describe in section 2, dur -ing the last three months of 2007 the top 65,000 Wikipedia art icles ranked by visits comprise less than 60% of all visits to Wikip edia articles. So, if we consider the remainder of Wikipedia arti cles to be the long tail, it makes up over 40% of Wikipedia traffic, whi ch is about 60 million article views per day as of late 2008 [15]!
Other researchers have explored different manifestations of the long tail in their studies of Wikipedia. Kittur, et al X  X  anal ysis sug-gested the emergence of a long tail of user participation in w hich much work is being done by a large group of people, each of whom only does a small amount of work [10]. Wu, et al. found that the use of infoboxes, a specific type of structured data found in Wiki pedia articles, follows a long tail distribution, and proposed wa ys to im-prove automated information extraction methods in the pres ence of such a skewed distribution [19]. The present paper is the fi rst research to look deeply at the questions of the long tail in ar ticle readership, combined with an exploration of how issues of ar ticle mortality influence the evolution of the long tail.
In the rest of the paper, we first discuss the datasets we use fo r our analysis, and then address the following five research qu estions, in one section each.

RQ Long Tail Visits : To what extent do Wikipedia viewers look at articles in the tail?
RQ Wikipedia Growth : How have article birth and mortality rates changed over time?
RQ Topic Notability : As time passes, are the articles that survive in Wikipedia increasingly on obscure topics?
RQ Deletion Reasons : What are the reasons given for deleting articles? How do these reasons relate to the long tail?
RQ Article Life Span : When in the life of an article is it most likely to be deleted?
The present research is different from many other projects t hat study group dynamics in that it is a study of a single distinct ive community. Because of the distinctive  X  some say unique  X  pro per-ties of Wikipedia, it is not obvious how to extrapolate these results to other communities. We argue that Wikipedia is such an impo r-tant group activity, with millions of visitors every day , that research that helps understand how and why it works is independently i nter-esting, even if it is not obviously generalizable. We furthe r specu-late that the successes of Wikipedia, if deeply understood, can lead to the design of computer support for other groups that can sh are some of those successes. However, the scope of the present pa per is limited to deepening our understanding of Wikipedia.
Most of our analyses are performed using the information sou rces that are described below.

English Wikipedia data dump files. These are several datasets that were made available on the Wikipedia database download site at various times between 2006 and 2008. Each dump contains a http://tinyurl.com/britannica-size http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiki/ Figure 1: Complementary cumulative distribution function of Wikipedia article visits on log-log scales. Visits between Octo-ber 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007 are counted. The dashed and dotted lines are maximum-likelihood estimate fits to the log-normal and power-law distributions. snapshot of all articles that existed on Wikipedia when the d ump was created. The data provides information about every arti cle re-vision (i.e., time of creation, author, and edit comments).
In this paper, all of our analysis is confined to the Main names-pace. We make this distinction because we are interested spe cifi-cally in the encyclopedic content available on Wikipedia, w hich is stored in the Main namespace. Other Wikipedia namespaces are not considered in our analyses. These namespaces include on es such as: Talk , which contains meta-discussions about articles; User , which contains personal information about Wikipedia users ; and Wikipedia , which contains information specific to Wikipedia itself (e.g., help pages, community standards, content guideline s).
English Wikipedia event log. The Wikipedia download site also provides a log of special events that have occurred on Wikipe dia. These events include administrative meta-actions such as b locking abusive users, renaming articles, or granting users with sp ecial flags or privileges. Of particular interest to our analysis, this log also contains information about article deletions, including t he given reason for deletion.

We note that by deletion, we mean the case where an adminis-trator has removed the article and all of its revision history from public view. We do not consider cases where a user simply eras es all the text from an article, since the removed text is still r eadily available by browsing the article X  X  revision history.

Sample of Wikipedia web logs. The Wikimedia Foundation has graciously supplied us with an anonymized feed of the web acc ess log for their web servers. The feed contains the URL and times tamp of every 10th HTTP request. This log allows us to accurately e s-timate how many people are reading each Wikipedia article. N ote that because of this sampling, all reported viewership figur es are approximately a factor of ten below their actual values. First, we will look at the overall distribution of visits acr oss Wikipedia articles to get a sense of what Wikipedia X  X  long ar ticle tail looks like. For this analysis, we used a web log sample fr om October 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007.

To visualize this distribution, we present it as a complemen tary cumulative distribution function (CCDF), which is shown in fig-ure 1. The value of the CCDF is equal to one minus the value of cumulative distribution function. When plotted on a log-lo g scale, Figure 2: Rank-frequency plot of Wikipedia article visits o n log-log scales. The top two most visited pages, which appear to be outliers, are the  X  X ain_Page X  and  X  X iki X  articles. this representation of the data allows us to see whether the d istri-bution is a power law by looking at whether the CCDF is a straig ht line. Furthermore, this representation is more robust agai nst biases and noise in the data than the probability density function o r rank-frequency plots [5, 9].

Figure 1 also shows maximum-likelihood estimate fits to the power law and log-normal distributions. The CCDF shows a dis -tinct curve, and is a much better fit to a log-normal distribut ion than to a power law. This result is in apparent conflict with a Wikip edia article that examines the traffic of the top 1,000 most visite d arti-cles and concludes that beyond the top few articles, the dist ribution looks like a power law 4 . The reason for the disagreement is that of-ten power law and log-normal distributions appear the same w hen looking at only a few orders of magnitude on a log-log scale. W hen the Wikipedia data are extended to the full set of articles, r ather than just the top 1,000, the function is clearly non-linear (figur e 2), and a power law fit can be ruled out.

The observation that Wikipedia traffic is not a power law rais es interesting questions about Wikipedia X  X  evolution. The co nditions lend themselves naturally to a long tail power law scenario: prac-tically unlimited storage for articles, low barrier to entr y, and ef-ficient digital distribution. Yet, the empirical results su ggest the distribution is much closer to log-normal, which manifests itself as a truncated power-law distribution or a  X  X rooping tail X  i n which there is a deficiency of low-readership articles. One possib ility is that the natural distribution would be a power law, but that o ther factors such as efforts to deter creation of low-value artic les have  X  X runcated X  the distribution such that it has become log-no rmal (for a discussion of the evidence on this point, see section 6).
Overall, in answer to RQ Long Tail Visits , Wikipedia traffic does show a long-tailed distribution, especially over the first t housand ar-ticles, but do not follow the classic power law over the entir e six or-ders of magnitude of article popularity. A log-normal distr ibution is a better description of the data. Some authors argue that onl y power law distributions should be called long-tailed, while othe rs argue that log-normal distributions should share the name. We won  X  X  get caught up in argument about terminology here, but will no te that excluding the 65,000 most popular articles from Wikipe dia  X  65,000 is the number of articles in the entire Encyclopedia B ri-tannica  X  still leaves 60 million article views a day for the r est of Wikipedia. So, Wikipedia traffic is substantially increase d by the long tail phenomenon. http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=222154521 Figure 3: Daily rates of surviving article creation, and art icle deletion. Rates are smoothed using a ten-day moving average .
Before we delve deeper into Wikipedia X  X  evolution over the y ears, we first look at the big picture  X  how has Wikipedia grown? What broad patterns have there been in the creation and deletion o f arti-cles over time?
A major issue with the article dumps is that they do not con-tain any information about articles that were deleted prior to the time that the snapshot was made. The deletions are captured i n the event log, but information about the articles that were dele ted is not present. This leads to several challenges in performing ana lyses of article deletion behavior, since there is limited informat ion about the vast majority of articles that have been deleted.

Data about deletions occurring prior to December 2004 are un -available, so we only focus on the period between December 20 04 and December 2007 for which we have both creation and deletio n data. Also, robots and users of semi-automated editing tool s sionally perform tasks that introduce substantial noise to our data. These tasks include one-off projects such as creating artic les about politicians or animal species by copying information en mas se from outside sources. Because the these tasks undergo advance re view by administrators and fellow community members 6 , the created ar-ticles are typically not scrutinized, and are rarely subjec t to dele-tion. In order to focus on how Wikipedia X  X  long article tail i s af-fected by the actions of human users, we exclude articles cre ated by known automated processes in our analyses that involve de le-tion of articles.
Figure 3 shows the birth rate of surviving articles 7 and the death (deletion) rate of articles, expressed as a ten-day moving a verage to smooth out noise. We present the birth rate of surviving ar ticles because the true article birth rate is not known due to the lac k of data on deleted articles. Specifically, we do not have data th at tells us when deleted articles were originally created, so we cann ot de-termine the total number of articles created during a given i nterval. However, the available data do yield some interesting patte rns. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AWB http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BOT
Our article counts differ from Wikipedia X  X  published stati stics due to differences in the definition of an article. We only exclud e bot-created articles, whereas Wikipedia includes bot-created articles, but excludes some shorter entries that they consider  X  X on-a rticles. X  Figure 4: Estimated article mortality rate, smoothed using a ten-day moving average.

Note that the death rate tends to follow the surviving birth r ate, rising and falling mostly in lockstep. This correlation sug gests that if an article death occurs, it tends to be near the time that th e ar-ticle was created. Later, in section 7, we use other datasets to en-able careful measurement of survival rates and allow us to va lidate this conjecture. For now though, we will simply assume that a rti-cle deletions occur near the time of article creation. Makin g this assumption allows us to estimate the total article birth rat e during some period by summing the death rate and the surviving birth rate.
With estimates of article birth and death rates, we can compu te an estimated article mortality rate and see how it changes ov er time. Figure 4 shows this relationship. While there is much fluctua tion in the mortality rate, there is a modest upward trend in morta lity, suggesting that new articles are being increasingly subjec t to dele-tion as Wikipedia grows and evolves. This is consistent with results presented in Kittur, et al. that show that Wikipedians are sp ending an increasing amount of their efforts on indirect work  X  enfo rcing policy, dealing with vandalism, and so on [11].

We also find that there is noticeable movement in this mortali ty rate that correlates to actions taken by the Wikimedia Found ation or its members. In particular, we found the following two insta nces.
First, in December 2005, the Wikimedia Foundation made the decision to restrict article creation to users who have a Wik ipedia account 8 . This was done in response to a high-profile vandalism incident involving an article about former USA Today editor John Seigenthaler, Sr. In May 2005, somebody created a hoax artic le about Seigenthaler that linked him to the John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy assassinations. The article was left unto uched for several months before Seigenthaler learned about it fro m a col-league. After working with the Wikimedia Foundation to have the article removed, Seigenthaler published an op-ed article i n USA To-day describing the incident and criticizing Wikipedia 9 .

Figures 3 and 4 show that during December 2005, the article mortality rate fell by roughly 30%, while the surviving arti cle birth rate remained unaffected. It is plausible that the new restr iction dis-suaded would-be vandals or pranksters from creating questi onable articles such as the hoax about Seigenthaler, and therefore reduced the number of articles that required deletion. However, the reprieve was only temporary, as the mortality rate began rising again soon afterward. Perhaps the barrier of account creation was insu fficient as a long-term deterrent to undesirable articles. http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=136017357 http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/200 5-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm
Second, in August 2006, Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedi a, gave a keynote talk at the Wikimania conference during which he urged Wikipedia contributors to focus on article quality ra ther than article quantity. Wales X  keynote received coverage by the m ain-stream media, with articles appearing in the New York Times Wired 11 , and other outlets. Looking back at figures 3 and 4, we see that in August 2006, Wikipedia X  X  article birth rate deceler ated and the death rate accelerated, leading to a noticeably elevate d article mortality rate that remained high for about ten months. It se ems that Wikipedians agreed with Wales and raised the bar for wha t constituted an acceptable Wikipedia article.

We stress that we have no solid evidence that these actions we re directly responsible for the changes observed in Wikipedia activity. These are interesting correlations that suggest that exter nal factors may have a profound effect on the evolution of Wikipedia.

In answer to RQ Wikipedia Growth , we can say that while the number of articles in Wikipedia is growing, their mortality rate is also slowly increasing over time. Of course, from these data we cannot say whether the Wikipedians are applying tougher cri teria to new articles, or whether the newly created articles are le ss ap-propriate for Wikipedia. We shall return to that question in the next section.
The observation that over one-quarter of Wikipedia article s are ultimately deleted leads us to look at a long-running conflic t that has been taking place on Wikipedia for years. The constant in -flux of thousands of articles per day is a source of concern for some Wikipedians who believe that many articles are about to pics that are too obscure and that are not interesting enough to wa r-rant a Wikipedia article. These people see such articles as d i-luting the overall value and credibility of Wikipedia. Othe rs be-lieve that the ever-growing set of articles is a good thing si nce it allows more opportunities for people to participate, and em pha-sizes Wikipedia X  X  strengths as a digital resource that has n o prac-tical limit on size. These two philosophies have been labell ed as deletionism and inclusionism , respectively, and the results of their influences on Wikipedia and its long tail will be the primary f ocus of the remainder of this paper.

We now look more closely at how Wikipedia and its long ar-ticle tail have evolved over time. How do articles that were c re-ated years ago compare to more recently created articles? Ho w true are deletionist concerns that Wikipedia X  X  newer artic les are in-creasingly about obscure topics? What did Jimmy Wales see th at triggered his call for focusing on quality rather than quant ity?
To approach these questions, we need a way to measure the rel-ative obscurity or popularity of an article. For this, we firs t turn to Wikipedia X  X  standards regarding this issue. Wikipedians u se a ba-sic criterion called notability to decide whether a particular topic is worthy of an article. There are a wide range of opinions on the definition of notability and how much it should be taken in to account when deciding whether an article belongs in Wikiped ia. Much debate between inclusionists and deletionists has tak en place on Wikipedia regarding notability, and the notability guid elines are often invoked when discussing whether to keep or delete an ar ticle that has come under scrutiny. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/technology/07wiki .html http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/ 08/71535 Figure 5: Geometric mean of the readership of articles plott ed by month of article creation.

To pass Wikipedia X  X  general notability guideline 12 as of late 2008, an article X  X  topic must have  X  X eceived significant coverage in re-liable sources that are independent of the subject X . Wikipe dians have also established additional domain-specific notabili ty guide-lines for things such as books, films, and numbers 13 . These guide-lines, while well-articulated, are often imprecise and ope n to inter-pretation (e.g., what exactly constitutes  X  X ignificant cov erage X ?).
Thus, in this paper, we do not propose a way to directly op-erationalize notability. Instead, we will use metrics that measure popularity , which is a related notion that may correlate well with notability in practice. While it is true that popularity is n ot exactly the same as notability, and that the metrics we use are unreli able in individual cases, we believe that our metrics are a good prox y for notability if taken in aggregate.
The first metric we will consider is readership. We measure this by counting the number of visits to each article as given in the Wikipedia web log sample, again using the interval Octob er 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. Articles that are read more f re-quently are presumed to be about things that are more well-kn own and interesting to Wikipedia readers, so this metric estima tes how popular or obscure an article X  X  subject is.

Figure 5 shows the average readership of Wikipedia articles as a function of when the articles were created. There is a strik ing downward trend indicating that newer articles are being vie wed far less frequently on average than older ones. This suggest s that newer articles tend to be about topics that draw less interes t from Wikipedia readers, and are thus more likely to be in the long t ail.
One confound here is that newer articles are disadvantaged b e-cause they have had less time to integrate themselves into th e link structure of Wikipedia, and thus, have fewer backlinks (i.e ., other Wikipedia pages linking to them). This deficiency of backlin ks may result in newer articles receiving less traffic since use rs brows-ing Wikipedia encounter fewer links to new articles than to o ld ones. In turn, one might surmise that traffic to new articles w ill start low and accumulate over time as more links are created. To inv es-tigate, we control for the backlink effect by repeating our a nalysis but grouping sets of articles that have similar numbers of ba cklinks. Figure 6 shows that a similar downward trend still holds, alt hough http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:N
This particular guideline was, in part, prompted by a deleti on de-bate over an article about the number 3.14, a common approxim a-tion of the mathematical constant Pi. Figure 6: Geometric mean of the readership of articles plott ed by month of article creation, grouped by articles with simil ar numbers of backlinks. Plots of articles with 1 backlink, 2-3 backlinks, 4-7 backlinks, and 8-15 backlinks are shown. Figure 7: Relative change in total readership share between October-December 2007 and July-September 2008, plotted by month of article creation. Only articles created between Ja n-uary 2003 and October 2007 are considered. the drop over time is smaller, and now appears more linear for each group. Apparently there is an important effect of number of b ack-links in explaining article traffic, but it alone does not ful ly explain the readership differences between older articles and newe r articles.
Additionally, we did an analysis to quantify how article rea der-ship changes over time. (Articles may gain readership becau se of increases in backlinks within Wikipedia, because of links f rom the Web as a whole, because of improving position in search engin es, etc.) We hypothesize an asymptotic effect exists where arti cles gain readership for some time before approaching a stable state t hat rep-resents its  X  X rue X  popularity. Thus, over time, newer artic les should gain readership while older articles remain stable (effect ively los-ing readership relative to the whole population).

To test our hypothesis, we compared the readership figures de -scribed above with figures from July 1, 2008 through Septembe r 30, 2008 to see what had changed after six months. Figure 7 sho ws the relative change in article readership share between the two data sets, again as a function of article creation date. We see tha t con-trary to expectation, older articles increased their reade rship share at the expense of newer articles, which actually lost reader ship share as they aged! One possible explanation for this is that newer Figure 8: Geometric mean of results of Search Engine Test plotted by month of article creation. Geometric standard er -ror bars and a best-fit line computed from unaggregated log-transformed data are plotted as well. articles tend to be about things that naturally have initial bursts of interest, such as current events and new movies or video game s. Overall interest in such topics then declines over a period o f time before reaching some stable state. Further research is need ed to confirm or refute this explanation, but in any case, our resul ts do not show evidence that measuring popularity using the reade rship metric is biased against newer articles.
A second metric that we use to approximate notability is the search engine test. This is also known on Wikipedia as the Goo gle Test 14 . This metric is defined as the number of results that a search engine returns when queried for web pages about a particular topic. The search engine test provides an estimate of popularity th at has the advantage of being mostly independent of Wikipedia. (Th e presence of Wikipedia and sites that copy its content inflate the values, but their effect is probably small compared to the si ze of the web.)
However, Wikipedia X  X  article about the search engine test g ives several caveats in using it to establish the popularity or no tability of a topic, and states that the test X  X  result alone should not be consid-ered to be authoritative. One major issue described is that  X  search engines do not disambiguate, and tend to match partial searc hes. X  The Wikipedia discussion provides a simple example: the Ren ais-sance painting Madonna of the Rocks . Depending on how a search engine query is formulated, there might be many search resul ts about the pop singer Madonna , which would inappropriately make it appear as if this painting was much more popular than other well-known Renaissance paintings.

We attempt to control for this problem by restricting our ana lysis to articles that have single-word titles. While there is sti ll opportu-nity for ambiguity (e.g., jaguar could refer to an animal, car manu-facturer, or football player), we believe it reduces the eff ects of the problem sufficiently for our purposes. Also, using single-w ord ti-tles eliminates the challenge of formulating queries for mu lti-word titles (i.e., word order or use of quotes), as well as confoun ds aris-ing from differences in the distribution of the number of sea rch re-sults for multi-word searches versus that for single-word s earches.
We chose a random sample of 5,758 articles with single-word t i-tles and issued basic queries against the Yahoo! search engi ne using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Google_test Class Deletion Reasons PROD/AFD/VFD Proposed deletion; articles for deletion; votes for deleti on
Unknown No recognized key words or key phrases their API 15 . We were unable to test all single-word title articles in a reasonable amount of time due to limitations imposed by Yaho o! X  X  usage policy. Figure 8 shows the relationship between the me an number of search engine results and the Wikipedia article cr eation date. We see a downward trend similar to the one shown previou sly for article readership, thus reinforcing the support for th e results ob-tained using the readership metric: newer articles tend to b e more concentrated in the long tail and are effectively lengtheni ng it.
The readership data and the search engine test both provide t he same answer to RQ Topic Notability . Apparently new articles that are added to Wikipedia are increasingly obscure, and are thus likely to be less notable. We do note that these data alone do not reso lve the debate between inclusionists and deletionists. After a ll, the long tail of not-so-popular articles is responsible for a substa ntial num-ber of Wikipedia page views. However, the data might provide a principled way to reason about the cost versus value of addin g ar-ticles to Wikipedia. For instance, this question could be pu t on an economic footing by valuing article readership in dollars, and by estimating the monthly cost of the resources required to mai ntain each article. Ones attracting insufficient interest to just ify their cost would be deleted. (Economic motivations are not the only way to select articles that belong in an encyclopedia; this is just one possi-ble way to frame the debate.)
The deletionists have likely seen evidence of these notabil ity trends, and argue that Wikipedia is increasingly becoming a haven for irrelevant material that should have failed the test for notability. Some deletionists are working hard to seek out articles they feel are not notable, and to remove them from Wikipedia. In this secti on we study their success at this task, looking at the frequency of deletes, the reasons for deletes, and the changes across time in these charac-teristics. We are particularly interested in the effect the se changes are having on the evolution of the long tail in Wikipedia.
Wikipedians have established several different processes for delet-ing articles 16 .

Criteria for Speedy Deletion. This is the most lightweight pro-cess for deletion. There are several dozen reasons for which an article can be deleted without requiring a discussion. Amon g these include vandalism, advertising, or insufficient content. T his pro-cess is intended to be used for uncontroversial deletions.
Proposed Deletion (PROD). This process is used when some-body believes that an article should be deleted, but for a rea son not covered by the Criteria for Speedy Deletion. If no one object s to the proposed deletion, then the article is deleted. If there is an ob-jection, the issue is escalated to the Articles for Deletion process. http://developer.yahoo.com/search/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:DP Figure 9: Overall frequency of classes of reasons given for Wikipedia article deletions. PROD/AFD/VFD denotes dele-tions occurring as a result of the Proposed Deletion or Artic les for Deletion processes.

Articles for Deletion (AFD). In this process, interested mem-bers of the community examine the article under scrutiny and dis-cuss what should happen to it. Discussions last at least five d ays, after which time an administrator reviews the debate and tak es ap-propriate action. This process was previously also known as  X  X otes for Deletion X  (VFD), but was renamed because the goal is to ma ke decisions based on community discourse rather than majorit y vote.
To analyze why articles are deleted, we use the event log data set, which includes the comment left by the deleter for each delet ion event. The comment is intended to convey the reason that the a rticle was deleted. By analyzing these comments, we can gain insigh t into why over one-quarter of all created articles are delete d.
We scanned deletion comments for key words or phrases that re -fer to Wikipedia X  X  article deletion policies. For example, the dele-tion comment for an article that was deleted via the Proposed Dele-tion process typically contains a link to the Wikipedia poli cy page that describes the process, WP:PROD . Thus, we can identify such deletions by looking for a WP:PROD link. We also looked for other textual indicators of this process, such as  X  X roded X ,  X  X rod ded X , and  X  X roposed deletion X . We created similar lists of key words f or iden-tifying other reasons for deletion. Approximately 85% of th e dele-tions studied could be categorized in this way.

In total, we looked at 1,567,543 deletion comments for delet ions occurring between December 2004 and March 2008. Using our approach, we classified deletions into seven broad classes, which are summarized in table 1.

Figure 9 shows the overall frequency that each of these class es of deletion reasons was observed in the deletion comments. Onl y 12% of deletions go through the more heavyweight processses (Pr o-Figure 10: Frequency of classes of reasons given for Wikiped ia article deletions by month. PROD/AFD/VFD denotes deletion s occurring as a result of the Proposed Deletion or Articles fo r Deletion processes. posed Deletion, Articles for Deletion, or Votes for Deletio n). A large majority of deletions are considered uncontroversia l and are covered by the Criteria for Speedy Deletion. We see that the m ost frequently-cited reasons for deleting an article are notab ility-related, making up over a quarter of all deletions. Next, deletions du e to inappropriate content (25%) or insufficient content (9%) to gether make up just over a third of article deletions. Wiki Maintena nce and Other are both around 5% each. Finally, 15% of deletions, labelled  X  X nknown X  in the figure, could not be categorized us ing simple keyword analysis.

Figure 10 shows the relative frequency of deletion reasons a cross time. We see two noteworthy trends here.

First, the proportion of unknown deletion reasons is declin ing, which means an increasing proportion of deletions are accom pa-nied by recognized citations to Wikipedia policy. This tren d is con-sistent with the findings in Beschastnikh, et al. that show an tempo-ral increase in policy citations on Wikipedia discussion pa ges [3]. Second, the proportion of deletions due to reasons classifie d as Notability/Significance has increased over time. As we saw i n sec-tion 5 (figures 5 and 6), there has been a lengthening of the lon g tail as article creators push the boundaries for what is consider ed no-table. Our observations here suggest that some in the commun ity are pushing back, actively scrutinizing articles and delet ing those that are deemed not notable enough.

One thing that we cannot tell from studying deletion reasons , however, is whether interpretation and application of the n otabil-ity guidelines has been consistent. Are the articles that ar e being deleted actually less notable than the articles that survive? One way to approach to this question is to apply our notability pr oxy metrics to articles that have been deleted due to lack of nota bility.
The readership metric is difficult to use here, because as we w ill see in section 7, the lifetime of an article before it is delet ed is usually too short to gather meaningful data. We can easily ap ply the search engine test though, as it does not depend on Wikipe dia-specific data. On a random sample of 959 articles with single-word titles that were deleted due to lack of notability, the geome tric mean of the number of search results is 6,832. This is below the ave rage number of search result for surviving articles in Wikipedia , which, according to figure 8, is well over 10,000, even for the most re -cently created articles. The comparison suggests that the d eletion decisions being made regarding notability are generally co nsistent with the search engine test.

However, we note that if the downward trajectory seen in figur e 8 continues at its historic pace, then articles created in mid -2008 will have an average number of search results of around 6,000, whi ch is comparable to that of articles that have been deleted in th e past for lack of notability! Over the long term, the declining not abil-ity of new articles will lead to one of two possible outcomes. An inclusionist might hope that notability standards will bec ome less stringent. On the other hand, a deletionist might hope that n otabil-ity criteria will remain stable, and that a higher percentag e of newly created articles will be deleted.
 These data provide a mixed answer to RQ Deletion Reasons . Overall, the  X  X ack of notability X  reason has dramatically i ncreased in usage between 2005 and the present. However, its increase has been very slow since early 2006, and nonexistent since early 2007. The distribution of reasons given for article deletions app ears to have reached a steady state. Also, deletion decisions seem t o be consistent with the search engine test for topic notability .
Finally, we explore the life span of Wikipedia articles and l ook at when articles get deleted during their lifetimes. How quickly do es the community scrutinize new articles and make decisions ab out them? Was the Seigenthaler incident the norm or the exceptio n? Are deletionists trimming the long tail, or is it here to stay ?
Recall that our data is deficient in that we do not know the cre-ation date of most deleted articles. We overcome this limita tion of our datasets in three ways:
Direct Data Analysis. First, we directly use the Wikipedia dumps to obtain what information we can about article life span. By com-bining an older snapshot of Wikipedia articles with a newer e vent log, we can see which of the older articles have been deleted a fter the time that the snapshot was taken. This gives us life span i n-formation about long-lived articles, but only provides lim ited and flawed information about short-lived articles.

To illustrate this issue, suppose that we want to learn about ar-ticles with a life span of less than 2 days. The only articles w e could examine are those that were created during the 2 days im me-diately preceding the time that the article snapshot was tak en. If an article was created before this interval and was deleted w ithin 2 days, then it would not have appeared in the snapshot. To mak e matters worse, there is an additional confound: articles th at were created and deleted during the window of interest would also be absent from the snapshot and missed by the analysis, which le ads to an undercount of articles with a life span of less than 2 day s.
Inference-Based Analysis. To help augment our knowledge about very short-lived articles, we also use an inference-b ased ap-proach using the article snapshots and event logs. Consider a snap-shot taken at time t containing the set of all articles A existing at time t , and an article deletion event for some article a that occurs at time u = t + 1 day. If a  X  A , then we know the creation date of a , and can use the log analysis approach previously described.
On the other hand, suppose a /  X  A . Then we do not know the creation date of a . However, we do know that a must have been created after time t , since by definition A contains all articles that existed at time t . We also know that a must have been created be-fore time u because an article cannot be deleted before it is created. Therefore, despite not knowing its exact creation time, we i nfer that a  X  X  life span is less than 1 day.

Applying this logic to all articles deleted in the first n hours after an article snapshot allows us to count how often articles wer e cre-ated and deleted during that n hour interval. This provides a basis Figure 11: Survival curves of Wikipedia articles created du ring three 24-hour spans. The first-day death rates are estimated as described in section 7, while all remaining data is observed . for making estimates about articles that have very short lif e spans. However, this approach can be used just once for each article snap-shot, and only provides information about articles over a sm all slice of time. It is, therefore, subject to the same issues that pla gue small sample sizes  X  high variability and questionable precision .
Near Real-Time Observation. To help solidify our data about short-lived articles, we turned to the Wikipedia API 17 , which can be queried for information about article creations that occ urred dur-ing a given interval. This data is subject to the same shortco mings as the data dumps: articles that have been deleted do not appe ar in article creation listings. However, the adverse effects of missing data can be greatly reduced by issuing API queries often, thu s cap-turing article creation events in approximately real-time . For our analyses, we collected article creations every five minutes over a two week interval in September 2008. We then used an event log from October 2008 to determine whether the created articles had been deleted, and if so, when.
Combining all the amassed information, we found that most ar -ticles have either a very short life or a very long life. If an a rticle is deleted, then the deletion usually occurs very early in the a rticle X  X  life, quite often within the first few days. Recall that in sec tion 4, we conjectured that if an article is to be deleted, then the de letion will occur near the time that the article was created. Here, w e will present data that supports this supposition.

Analysis of our inference and real-time observation data sh ows that for any given 24-hour period, about 61% of deletions dur ing the period are targeted at articles that were created during that pe-riod. This allows us to generate estimated survival curves w ith our article snapshots. The bottom-most line plotted in figure 11 shows our estimated survival curve for articles created during th e last 24 hours before the November 2006 article snapshot. The first-d ay deaths are estimated, but the remainder of the curve is actua l data. Interestingly, over 20% of articles survive less than a day, and about 25% survive less than two weeks. Beyond that, just another 5% of articles are deleted over the following two years.
 Figure 11 also shows survival curves generated similarly fr om October 2007 and January 2008 snapshots. The shapes of the cu rves are similar, although they  X  X latten out X  at different percen tage lev-els. This reflects the volatile mortality rates shown previo usly in figure 4. In all three survival curves, we see that a large majo r-http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API Figure 12: Persistence of deletions of Wikipedia articles, plot-ted by age of article at deletion. ity of deaths occur during the first few days of an article X  X  li fe. Wikipedians make inclusion and deletion judgments about ar ticles very quickly, and it is uncommon for the community to return t o articles later and delete them.

We also examined the question of whether deletions are  X  X er-sistent X   X  that is, if an article is deleted, does it stay dele ted, or does someone create the article again later? To measure dele tion persistence, we compared our 2006 and 2008 article snapshot s and looked at which of the articles existing in 2006 had been dele ted in the interval between the snapshots. Of the deleted articl es, we looked at what proportion of them exist in the 2008 snapshot t o determine whether the deletion was persistent.

The results of this analysis are shown in figure 12, which show s the proportion of deletions that are persistent as a functio n of the article X  X  age at the time it was deleted. We see a trend that sh ows deletions occurring early in an article X  X  life are more like ly to be persistent than deletions that occur later in an article X  X  l ife. So, not only are articles unlikely to be deleted late in their life, b ut if a deletion does occur, it is less likely to be persistent. A com mon reason that a deletion is non-persistent is that the deletio n was done for maintenance reasons that are tangential to whether the a rticle is appropriate for Wikipedia. For example, an article might be deleted if a related article is being renamed to replace it.
 These observations lead us to an answer to RQ Article Life Span . Wikipedia X  X  articles are here to stay, including those in it s long tail. Once an article has survived the first few days of life, the cha nce that it is persistently deleted at some later date is small.
In each of the preceeding sections we gave a nuanced answer to one of the five research questions. Here we briefly summarize t hose questions and answers.

RQ Long Tail Visits : To what extent do Wikipedia viewers look at articles in the tail?
The visit distribution to articles in Wikipedia follows a lo g-normal curve. The top articles are by far the most popular, but the lo ng tail accounts for a substantial fraction of visits to Wikipedia.
RQ Wikipedia Growth : How have article birth and mortality rates changed over time?
Wikipedia X  X  article count continues to grow by thousands of ar-ticles per day. However, the birth rate is steady and the arti cle mor-tality rate is slowly increasing, suggesting that the rate o f growth has peaked and may begin declining.
RQ Topic Notability : As time passes, are the articles that survive in Wikipedia increasingly on obscure topics?
Yes. New articles that are added to Wikipedia are increasingly on obscure topics as measured by our readership and search en gine test metrics.

RQ Deletion Reasons : What are the reasons given for deleting articles? How do these reasons relate to the long tail?
The most common reason for deleting articles is  X  X ack of nota -bility X . The use of the notability argument is evidence of re sistance within the community to including articles that are arbitra rily far down the long tail of potential Wikipedia subjects.

RQ Article Life Span : When in the life of an article is it most likely to be deleted? Most articles either have a very short life or a very long life . There is little evidence to date that the long tail is effecti vely being trimmed over time.

Analysis alone cannot resolve the debate about whether the d i-versity of  X  X ong tail X  articles strengthens Wikipedia, or w hether these obscure articles weaken its encyclopedic nature. Thi s debate is over what determines the health of an online user-maintai ned en-cyclopedia. Since such encyclopedias have only existed for about seven years, it is no surprise that there is as of yet no clear a nswer.
Analysis can, however, help frame the debate. For instance, it is interesting that the probability of a new article being de leted has been increasing steadily over the past three years. The a rti-cles deleted for  X  X ack of notability X  that were analyzed usi ng Ya-hoo! Search for this paper had average estimated notability less than that of surviving articles. However, since the estimat ed nota-bility of newly created articles that survive has been decli ning in recent years, Wikipedia seems to have reached an intriguing inflec-tion point: the articles that survive may be of comparable no tability to those that are deleted. How will the conflict be resolved?
The Wikimedia Foundation could enhance prospects for furth er research by making records of deleted articles available wh enever appropriate. Combining this data with the viewership log da ta that is now becoming available will enable rich new analyses. Oth er re-search that would be interesting include an analysis of arch ived pol-icy debates and inclusion/deletion discussions, a user-ce ntric anal-ysis of who is involved in these processes, and finally, quali ty and accuracy assessments of long tail articles. The latter is pa rticularly important, because there is reason to predict that articles that are seldom viewed will have low quality on average.
