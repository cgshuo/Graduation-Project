 We propose a method for finding impressive creators in on-line social network sites (SNSs). Many users are actively engaged in publishing their own works, sharing visual con-tent on sites such as YouTube or Flickr. In this paper, we focus on the Japanese illustration-sharing SNS, Pixiv. We implement an illustrator search system based on user im-pression categories. The impressions of illustrators are esti-mated from clues in the crowdsourced social-tag annotations on their illustrations. We evaluated our system in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain and found that us-ing feedback on motifs and impressions for illustrations of relevant illustrators improved illustrator search by 11%.

Many users are actively engaged in sharing visual content via social network sites (SNSs) such as YouTube, Flickr, and deviantART 1 . In this paper, we focus on the Japanese illustration-sharing SNS, Pixiv 2 . On an illustration-sharing SNS, users can publish their own illustrations. We can also request illustrations from illustrators through the SNS, as shown in Figure 1. h ttp://www.deviantart.com/ http://www.pixiv.net/
In existing illustrator search systems 3 , users have to search for illustrator candidates manually. If users find suitable il-lustrators on the SNS, they can request access to their illus-trations.

We propose a method of searching for illustrators on an illustration-sharing SNS that is based on user impression categories. Impressions of the illustrator X  X  work are esti-mated from the crowdsourced social-tag annotations on his/her illustrations. We clarify the effectiveness of the illustrator ranking strategy using motifs and impressions. In addition, to solve the problem of sparseness in input queries, we pro-pose a query expansion method that uses feedback from the motifs and impressions for illustrations of relevant illustra-tors.

In Section 2, we describe related work. In Section 3, we in-troduce our interface, investigate inter-annotator agreement about selected impressions, and describe an experiment that estimates impressions via SVM and decision tree (DT) in-volving crowdsourced clues. In Section 4, we evaluate our ranking strategy that uses motifs and impressions as rele-vance feedback. We conclude our paper in Section 5. For research into social tagging, Sun et al. [10] proposed Tag-based Image Retrieval (TagIR), that is, the task of rank-ing images that match a given query tag in descending order of relevance. To our knowledge, however, the task of finding content creators has not been studied. The difficulty with TagIR is that knowledge diversity leads to different interpre-tations of the meaning of tags. In this work, we focus not on the images (visual content) directly but on the creators of visual works as retrieval targets. As we discuss in Sec-tion 3.2, different users tend to annotate the visual works of a particular creator in terms of a common set of tags. That is, knowledge tends to be less diversified by focusing on the creators, rather than on their work. Lee et al. [3] considered a social tagging index as an essential user X  X ag h ttp://www.illustrationmundo.com/ relationship, in the same way as traditional frameworks use the relationship between documents and their terms. We focus on the relationship between tags and the creator and use it to propose a creator search framework.

When searching for people such as experts, Macdonald [5] clarified that dealing with topic drift is necessary to apply a query expansion framework to the expert search. We apply a relevance feedback technique to the creator search frame-work by focusing on relevant creators that have motifs. Liu et al. [4] suggested that a relative expertise score is essen-tial when seeking experts in community question answering. In our framework, creators can be compared in terms of 12 impression dimensions. Sharma et al. [9] exploited the Lists (user collection) features to infer the user X  X  attributes in Twitter. We exploit social tags that are more generalized to infer creator attributes.

In existing illustrator search services 4 , illustrator profiles are registered manually, which makes interactive searching for potential illustrators difficult. In our study, users can search for promising illustrators through their impressions on the SNS.
We propose an illustrator search framework that is based on the motifs and impressions of illustrations published on illustration-sharing SNSs. The interface is shown in Figure 2 . Users enter motifs and check the impressions of illus-trators, and can compare impressions of illustrators using a cobweb chart. Illustrator impressions are estimated from the social-tag annotations on their illustrations, as described in Section 3.3.

We defined 12 illustrator impressions (cute, beautiful, nice, cool, funny, heartwarming, sexy, stylish, happy, dignified, formidable, and calm) by reference to social-tag annota-tions on 1,800 illustrations from Pixiv. We investigated inter-annotator agreement ( value) for these impressions in terms of both illustrator and illustration. Four assessors annotated the impressions for 28 illustrators and for 10 il-lustrations from each illustrator. The results are shown in Figure 3. Inter-annotator agreement by illustrator is sig-nificantly superior to agreement by illustration (two-tailed t -test, significance level 5% ). From this, we concluded that impressions could be recognized clearly by looking at the illustrations from the same illustrator. Of the 12, four im-pressions agreed either almost perfectly or substantially (0.6 &lt; ) and six impressions agreed moderately (0.4 &lt; 0.6).

Ames et al. [1] suggest that organization for retrieval and social communication are the key motivations for social tag-ging. In illustration-sharing SNSs, a variety of emerging mo-tifs has begun to appear frequently and the social context is changing according to the new trend. To estimate the impressions of illustrations dynamically, we implement an estimation framework based on machine learning (SVM[6] and DT[7] in Weka 6 ) using 427 crowdsourced social tags that reflect impressions (called evaluation tags 7 ). We pre-pared 3,300 items of illustrator data for training. For com-parison, we also collected some general Japanese clues (705 adjectives, 2,321 adverbs, and 2,100 adjectival verbs) from a morpheme dictionary UniDic 8 . These features are summa-rized in Table 1. In addition, we implemented a rule-based impression estimation framework, which used 520 clues that were manually selected from 1,800 illustrations. We eval-uated the systems using an accuracy measure and the test data for 28 illustrators described in Section 3.2. The re-sults are shown in Table 2, and show that crowdsourced evaluation ([hyouka] in Japanese) tags are more effective in estimating impressions than the terms collected from a dictionary, and based on their parts-of-speech. We also sug-gest the results with combined clues from crawdsourced tags and from dictionary entries. For several impressions, the machine learning based estimation with combined clues is comparable to the manually coded rule-based estimation. h ttp://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html http://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E8%A9%95%E4%BE%A1%E3%82 %BF%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7 http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/unidic/
Our system ranks illustrators by considering motifs and impressions. Users specify motifs via an input query and impressions via a checkbox, as illustrated in Section 3.1. Query motifs are simply matched with social tags annotated on the illustrations by the illustrator, and impressions are estimated from the annotated social tags. Illustrators are ranked according to the number of their illustrations that match the motifs and impressions. We clarify experimen-tally the effectiveness of the ranking strategy for the illus-trators that combines motifs and impressions.

Social tags for a single motif, however, can be expressed in a variety of styles, which may not be sufficient to match an entered motif. Twelve of the impressions are also not differentiated clearly, but are interrelated. To solve these problems, we can use one of the query expansion methods X  namely, the relevance feedback approach of Rocchio[8].
We extend this idea by regarding the documents as il-lustrators and the terms as social tags. With this exten-sion, we can find more illustrators similar to relevant illus-trators. The illustrators are re-ranked using the feedback of tag weights, by expanding the social tags for relevant il-lustrators, and de-noising them on nonrelevant illustrators.
We (authors) prepared 20 illustrator search tasks in Ta-ble 3 and evaluated the ranking effectiveness using normal-ized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) [2]. The relevance judgment is based on four grades A to D, depending on the number of illustrations relevant to the task that illustrators post (A, more than five; B, three or four; C, one or two; D, none). The judge was conducted by the second author. We compared three tag-expansion strategies (for motifs, for im-pressions, and for both) using relevance feedback [8] against a baseline system, with illustrators ranked according to their relevance regarding the motifs and impressions estimated from social tags.
Results are shown in Table 4. We find that the nDCG value improved by a significant 11%, and the motif-tag ex-pansion contributed to this improvement.

In Table 4, the nDCG value improved for Tasks 10, 13, 19, and 20.
 On the other hand, nDCG10 is slightly decreased in Tasks 5, 11, 14, and 15.

In this work, we propose a framework for finding content creators via motifs and impressions, which are estimated from the social-tag annotations on their works. The main contributions in our work are summarized as follows. 1. We propose a framework to find impressive contents 2. We specify impressions for the illustrator search and 3. We clarify that re-ranking with relevance feedback is
In future work, we plan to apply this framework to SNS services for different visual content, such as movies, art works, and photographs.
