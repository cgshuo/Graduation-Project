 Medical knowledge extraction has great potential to improve the treatment quality of hospitals. In this paper, we propose a clinical problem-action relation extraction me thod. It is based on clinical semantic units and event causality patterns in order to present a chronological view of a patient X  X  problem and a physician X  X  action. Based on our observation, a clinical semantic unit is defined as a conceptual medical knowledge for a problem and/or action. Since a clinical event is a basic concept of the problem-action relation, events are detected from clinical texts based on conditional random fields. A clini cal semantic unit is segmented from a sentence based on time expressions and inherent structure of events. Then, a clinical sema ntic unit is classified into a problem and/or action relation based on event causality features in support vector machines. The e xperimental result on Korean medical collection shows 78.8% in F-measure when given the answer of clinical events. This result shows that the proposed method is effective for extracting clinical problem-action relations. I.2.7 [ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ] Natural Language Processing -Text analysis Relation extraction; Clinical semantic unit; problem-action relation; causal relationship As the digitalization of clinical information is one of the major trends in the healthcare domain, there is an increasing demand in utilization of the information. In digitalized healthcare environment the medical data mining and automatic summarization will be a key element for the improvement of care quality. Clinical narrative texts include information that relate to a patient X  X  medical history such as chronological progression of medical problems and clinical treat ments. It would be extremely useful if relevant knowledge could be extracted from clinical texts and presented in structured form for physicians to identify effective treatments and for patients to receive better and more affordable services. In recent years, a lot of research has been done on effectively analyzing clinical data due to i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) challenge [1, 2]. The challenges include identifying temporal relation betw een two events. Many research groups have participated and pr oposed technologies of natural language processing for medical texts [1, 2, 3, 4]. On the other hand, Park and Choi [5] introduced a V-Model to chronologically visualize narrative clinical texts by grouping clinical events and plotting on a timeline. The usability study on the timeline model by medical students showed very useful in effectively understanding a patient X  X  history. Based on our observation that a c linical text is described in chronological order of a patient X  X  medical problems and a physician X  X  treatments at a time, we define a problem and/or action relationship as a clinical semantic unit. In this paper, we propose an extraction method of clinical problem-action relation in order to present the causal relationship of a problem and an action in clinical texts. Our research focuses on clinical semantic units and event causality patterns. A clinical semantic unit is segmented from each sentence by considering inherent structure among events and classified into problem and/or action relation based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) [6] and event causality patterns that consider a causal relationship between clinical events that occurred simultaneously in a point on a timeline. To see the effectiv eness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on th e 150 discharge summaries from a division of Rheumatology/Nephrology of a general hospital in South Korea. Recent technologies in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning have enabled a variety of semantic components such as clinical events, temporal relations and time expressions to be extracted automatically from electronic medical texts. Clinical narrative texts have various facets of relationship. Recent research on relation extraction pr oposed the relationship based on utilization. Savova et al. [7] proposed the temporal relationship between two clinical events as CONTINUE, INITIATE, REINITIATE and TERMINATE using Aspectual Link. In the i2b2 2010 challenge [1] on concepts, assertions, and relations, relation classification aimed to classi fy relations of a pair of given concepts from a sentence such as problem-treatment, problem-test and problem-problem. In the 2012 i2b2 challenge [2], temporal relations such as BEFORE, AFTER and OVERLAP are extracted from medical text. The difference between our problem-action relation extraction and relation extr action of i2b2 is described in Table 1.
 Most participants of the i2b2 te mporal relation extraction used SVM with contextual features and/or rules to classify temporal relationship between two events [3, 4]. Our approach is based on SVM with event causality features and rules to classify a semantic unit into a causal relationship. The overall system architecture for the problem-action relation extraction is shown in Figure 1. Since a clinical event is a basic concept consisting of a problem-action relation, a clinical event is detected from clinical texts based on conditional random fields (CRF) [8] with conventional features [9] and lexical patterns to consider properties of Korean clinical texts. The categories of clinical events include Symptom, Purpose, Finding, Diagnosis, Dr ug, Treatment, Test, Time, and Visit. The discharge summaries in our experiments are described in a mix of English and Korean words. The primary tendency for language use was that most medical event terms are written in English and descriptions of an event are written in Korean. Conventional features are used fo r CRF such as word features, symbol features, contexture features, and UMLS matching features [3] for English and Kor ean. To deal with the language properties, co-occurrence words and lexical patterns are used for the mixed Korean and English narratives. To improve the performance of event detection, we have used Wikipedia category features and Korean-to-English translation features for concept-level matching. Based on our observation that some lexical clues are deterministic to classify events such as drug, diagnosis and symptom, the lexical patterns are used to correct event categories and to extract additional events as post pr ocessing after CRF results. We have applied regular expressi ons to detect a time which could not be detected by CRF since expressions of a time in discharge summaries are diverse depending on clinicians. A basic semantic structure of a problem-action relationship between events is composed of a time and clinical events that occurred at a relevant time. We define this basic unit as a clinical semantic unit (CSU). A clinical semantic unit is segmented from each sentence based on time expressions and inherent structure of events.
 Since a time anchoring point (TAP) represents temporal information when problems and actions took place, the range CSU. A CSU can contain one or more events and events appear in order of occurrence. For example, when TAP is an expression of a time and E is an event, a CSU can be several forms such as ( TAP 1 , E 1 ), (E 1 , TAP 1 ), (E 1 , E 2 , TAP 1 E ). There are four cases according to the position of a TAP: 1) a time appears at the beginning position, 2) a time appears at the end position, 3) a time appears between events, and 4) a CSU contains no time. When a CSU contains only a TAP by case 2) and 3), it should be combined with the near est CSU. The CSUs are detected from each sentence by the following straightforward algorithm. 1. Detect a sentence boundary using a punctuation mark. 2. Find time expressions (TAPs) from the sentence. 3. Segment a CSU, range from a current TAP until the next TAP. 4. Do for each CSU Figure 2. Examples of segments of clinical semantic units The CSUs segments make it po ssible to recognize clinical situations by the component events. Clinical semantic units are classified using multiclass SVM [10] with event causality features as well as lexical and context features into four classes such as  X  X AP, X   X  X roblem, X   X  X ction X , and  X  X roblem-Action X  relation. Figure 3 shows the four templates to be classified: TAP is a case when there is only a Time or Visit in the CSU. Problem is a case when an event in the CSU is a symptom, diagnosis or finding about a patient. Action is when an event in the CSU is a treatment, drug or test to treat a patient. Finally, Problem-Action is a case when an order of events in the CSU is a treatment for a symptom. A CSU can be classified according to an order of event tags since a causal relationship is described by the inherent relation of semantics of events and a time. The following sets of features are used in our SVM classification: lexical, context, frequency and event causality features as shown in Table 2. Lexical features are binary features whether a clue word appears in each CSU template. For examples, clue words such as  X  X ince X ,  X  X rom X ,  X  X efore X , and  X  X fter X  are for TAP, words  X  X oubt X ,  X  X ppeal X , and  X  X pinion X  are clues for Problem, and words  X  X ake a dose X ,  X  X uantity X ,  X  X g X , and  X  X x X  are used for Action.
 Context features represent contextual information of a CSU. Three events are given as the context of a CSU. The first event tag can imply a medical situation for a CSU .
 Frequency features are for the frequency information of events in a CSU. This feature includes the frequency number of each semantic tag, the total number of tags in a CSU and whether each tag is emerged or not. Event causality features are important clues to express the problem-action relation. We defi ned event occurrence patterns to detect the causal relation that ex ists among events such as the cause and the effect. Table 3 shows our event causality patterns used for the SVM features. Since the causal relationships impl y semantics of events as well as the implicit structure, they can be also used for the assignment of the problem and action part (in the next section). The event causality patterns are used to determine the positions of events (problem side or action side) for the CSU classified. The event occurrence patterns in discharge summaries imply causality relations with the cause event and the effect event such as Drug-Effect, Treatment-Effect, Symptom-Treatment, Symptom-Disease, Diagnosis-Treatment, and Test-Treatment. The following Figure 4 shows the extraction examples for the original clinical text and CSUs of the Figure 2. problem side, and &lt;Treatment&gt; is assigned for the action side. The representation by the causal relation enables a reader to easily infer that a patient took the diagnosis due to the test even though the medical term may not be known. To see the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have experimented on a Korean clinical test collection. The collection contains 150 discharge summaries of patients diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and discharged from the division of Rheumatology/Nephrology. As the answer set, clinical events, time expressions, CSU segments, a nd problem and/or relations are manually annotated by human experts. Table 4 shows the statistics of our test collection for 5-fold cross validation. The performance is measured in precision (P), recall (R), and F measure (F). For the event detection, the performance is measured annotations to have an identical span, where lenient matching accepts a partial match. Table 5 shows the performance of event detection based on CRF. Table 6 shows results of the segmentation of CSUs. The comparisons are conducted when ev ent tags are given with human answers. Our system is affected by the extraction of Time event. Table 7 shows the effectiveness of each feature for the classification of CSUs. Here the events and CSUs are given as answers. The baseline is the resu lt by the classification with the event causality patterns. When combining all features, the performance shows 87.8% in F-m easure. The result shows that context, frequency and causality features are effective in classifying CSU templates. Table 7. Results of classificati on of clinical semantic units Table 8 show results of the extraction of problem and/or action relations for each template. Table 8. Results of extraction of Problem-Action relations The upper bound analyses for the CSUs classification and relation extraction are shown in Table 9. The performance comparisons are conducted when event tags a nd CSUs are given with human answers. The result indicates that the classification of CSUs and relation extraction needs further research to improve performance. In this paper, we proposed the event causality relations to classify clinical semantic units and extract the problem and/or action relation. The structured knowledge could be extracted from clinical texts and presented in chronological order for physicians to identify effective treatments. The experimental result on the Korean medical test collection showed 78.8% in F-measure when given the answer of clinical events. The upper bound analysis indicates that each procedure of our system is effective. In the future work, similar patients can be detected by searching similar medical histories such as making a treatment for a patient, and/or making a diagnosis with problem-action relations.
