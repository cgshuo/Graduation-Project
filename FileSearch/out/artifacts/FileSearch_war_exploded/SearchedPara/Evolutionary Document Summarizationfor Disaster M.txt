Natural calamities such as hurricanes are chaotic events that pose immense threat to businesses, human lives and properties and can inflict huge economic damages. For those disastrous events, numerous news and reports are generated as the events evolve through time. One problem that arises from this fact is that of the information overflow. Imagine, for example, that one wants to keep track of the development/story-line of a hurricane. The vast amount of news/reports makes it difficult to follow the rate at which they are being produced. In addition, it is also very challenging to extract the changes of the event at different phases for disaster management.

In this paper, we develop a novel evolutionary summarization system to summarize the changes/differences of different phases as the event evolves along time. Specifically, given a collection of document streams describing an event, we generate a short sum-mary delivering the main development theme of the event by ex-tracting the most discriminative sentences at each phase. This problem is related to the traditional document summarization problem since both of them extract sentences from documents to form a summary. However, traditional document summarization aims to cover the majority of information among document collec-tions, while our goal is to identify the changes and differences over time. Our work is also different from the temporal summarization described in [1]. Allan et al. [1] addressed temporal summariza-tion of news stories by extracting a single-sentence from each event within a news topic. While their summary is temporal and the summary sentences contain useful and novel information, their work did not explicitly model the changes/difference in different phases and thus did not deal with evolutionary summarization.

Given a sequence of documents D = { d 1 , d 2 , . . . , d n ) associated with a class indicator c which represent the time period the documents belong to. The set of sentences contained of evolutionary summarization is to find a subset of sentences, V  X  S , to accurately discriminate the documents over different time periods, i.e. to predict the document class, given that the cardinality of V is k ( k &lt; m ).
Figure 1 demonstrates the framework of our evolutionary sum-marization system. The input of the system is a sequence of documents with labels which indicate the time period each doc-ument belongs to. First of all, the documents are preprocessed by removing formatting characters and stop words. Then these documents are trunked into sentences, and both document-term matrix and sentence-term matrix are created by calculating the term frequency of each term for each document. The document-sentence similarity matrix is constructed using cosine similarity, and both the document-sentence matrix and the document label vector are input into our sentence selection engine. The details of the sentence selection method are proposed in Section 4. Fi-nally, an evolutionary summary is generated using the selected sentences which represent the evolution of the documents.
A straight-forward solution for the sentence selection problem described in Section 2 is to select a set of sentences with the highest relevance to the target class, which is called the max-relevance method [4]. Given s i which represents the i -th sentence, and the class label c , their mutual information is defined in terms of their frequencies of appearances p ( s i ), p ( c ), and p ( s The max-relevance method selects the top k sentences in the de-scent order of I ( s i , c ), i.e. the best k individual sentence features correlated to the class labels.
Although we can choose the top individual sentences using the max-relevance algorithm, it has been recognized that  X  X he k best sentences are not the best k sentences X  since the correlations among those top sentence features may also be high [2]. In order to remove the redundancy among sentences, a min-redundancy and max-relevance (mRMR) framework is proposed in [4]. In mRMR, the mutual information between each pair of sentences is taken into consideration. Suppose set S represents the set of sentences and we already have V k  X  1 , the feature set with k -1 sen-tences, then the task is to select the k -th sentence from the set { S  X  V k  X  1 } . In the following formula, we see that minimizing the redundancy and maximizing the relevance can be achieved concordantly [4]. The computational complexity of this incremental sentence selec-tion method is O ( | V | X | S | ) = O ( km ).
The dataset we use is the collection of press releases obtained from Miami-Dade County Department of Emergency Manage-ment and Homeland Security during Hurricane Wilma from Oct. 19, 2005 to Nov. 4, 2005. The collection contains approximately 1,700 documents, which have been categorized into 4 phases based on the status of the hurricane: (1) preparation before hurricane Wilma, (2) damage during the growth of Wilma, (3) reduce of the hurricane, and (4) the recovery after the hurricane.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed evolution-ary summarization system (called MRMREvoSum), in the exper-iments we implement the following baselines and compare them with our system: (1) Centroid based summarization system (Centroid) : ranks sentences by computing their centroid values computed as the average cosine similarity between the sentences and the rest of the sentences [5]; (2) Graph based summarization system (Graph) : selects sentences by voting from their neighbors in the sentence graph [3]; (3) Max-relevance based evolutionary summarization system (MREvoSum) : selects the most impor-tant sentences using the max-relevance algorithm [4].
Table 1 demonstrates a case study of the two-sentence evolu-tionary summary generated by our proposed system. The words and phrases representing different phases of the hurricane growth are highlighted in Table 1. From the results, we observe that (1) the selected sentences concretely reflect the status of the hurri-cane; (2) the summary summarizes the advisory and notification during different time periods; (3) the two sentences extracted for each phase are informative and minimally redundant.
We ask domain experts to categorize the key words and phrases in the documents into five classes which represent each of the four phases of the hurricane growth and also a class of general terms. In this set of experiments, we calculate the term and phrase dis-tribution of the selected sentences for each phase. Figure 2 illus-trates the results visually. From the results, we can see that (1) the term distribution changes significantly over different phases of the hurricane growth, which indicates that our generated evo-lutionary summary can capture the hurricane evolution; (2) tra-ditional summarization methods such as Centroid and Graph can not clearly capture the term change with different time periods. This is because the traditional summarization methods usually extract sentences delivering general information among the docu-ments; (3) our MRMREvoSum method also outperforms MREvo-Sum method due to the redundancy minimum criteria used in our method.
