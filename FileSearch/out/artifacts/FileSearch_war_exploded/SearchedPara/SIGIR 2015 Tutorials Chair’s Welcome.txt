 This year X  X  conference received twelve submissi ons, of which eight were accepted, and one was day tutorials, and two morning-afternoon sequences. It was important for us to build a diverse yet comprehensive program that would address the needs of all attend ees from newcomers, eager to acquire critical knowledge, to experts curious ab out side or emerging areas of research in Information Retrieval. the Foundations of IR X ) to timely ones such as formal models ( X  X uilding and Using Models for Information Seeking, Search and Retrieval X ), the handling of verbose queries ( X  X nformation Retrieval with Verbose Queries X ), or related to leveraging Wikipedia ( X  X xploiting Wikipedia for Information Retrieval Tasks X .) We also decided to allow for non-mainstream topics in order to expand the horizons of Information Retrieval prac titioners and researchers with a full-day tutorial on  X  X usic Retrieval and Recommendation X . program as well as learning about timely topics. We thus included this year two morning-the morning with  X  X n Introduction to Click Models for Web Search X , while the afternoon session dives deep into  X  X dvanced Click Models and their Applications to IR X . The other sequence covers the always-critical topic of IR evaluation, with a morning session dealing with  X  X esigning an End-to-End Evaluation Pipeline X , and an afternoon session tackling user behavior in  X  X odeling User the morning and afternoon sessions of these two tutorials are each consid ered as stand-alone tutorials and can be taken independently. We would like to thank the seventeen presenters, from Academia and Industry, who will travel to Chile from various parts of the world in order to give their tutorials, namely from Australia (Guido Zuccon), Austria (Peter Knees and Markus Schedl), Canada (Charles Clarke and Mark Smucker), India (Manish Gupta), Israel (Nir Ofek, Vi ctor Makarenkov, and Bracha Shapira), United Kingdom (Leif Azzopardi, Emine Yilmaz), The Netherlands (Ilya Markov and Maarten de Rijke), Switzerland (Aleksandr Chuklin) and the United States (Michael Bendersky, Paul Kantor and Jin Young Kim). with a valuable opportunity to learn from some of the most famous and experienced researchers in the ever-evolving field of information retrieval.
