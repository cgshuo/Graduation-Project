 Text analysis technologies aim at automatically extracting knowledge and uncover-ing information buried under seas of text documents, including academic publications, news articles, emails, and patient records. Complex analysis results of these technolo-gies, however, are often difficult for average users to digest and leverage. Furthermore, such results may be inaccurate or contain ambiguous or even misleading information. This special section presents several visual interfaces for text analytics technologies designed to help users better consume text analysis results.

In the past, most work focused on either using basic visualization (e.g., bar charts and pie charts) to present the final results of complex text analysis or inventing visual metaphors to illustrate the results of simple text analysis (e.g., tf-idf measure of key-words). Based on the type of information visualized, these systems have been classified into two categories: metadata-based and content-based text visualization.

Metadata-based text visualizations focus on visualizing the metadata of text doc-uments. For example, in email analysis, there are thread-based email visualizations [Kerr 2003; Venolia and Neustaedter 2003] and relationship-based visualizations of email senders and receivers (e.g., Nardi et al. [2002] and Perer and Smith [2006], www.enronexplorer.com, and jheer.org/enron). Similarly, in text search, document metadata such as document length and query term frequency can be visualized [Hearst 1995]. Metadata-based visualization aids in text analysis are inadequate in uncover-ing deeper insights buried in the text; they especially do not work for documents with little associated metadata. Thus, researchers have developed content-based text visu-alization. For example, Viegas et al. [2006] use Themail to visualize keywords based on their TF-IDF scores in an email collection. Similarly, Strobelt et al. [2009] use a mixture of images and TF-IDF-based keywords to create a compact visualization of a document. There are also many other general-purpose text visualization systems that transform a collection of text into a visual illustration [Wise et al. 1995]. These sys-tems include the Galaxy of News [Rennison 1994], Jigsaw [Stasko et al. 2008], and WordTree [Wattenberg and Viegas 2008].

While text analysis and text visualization have separately received much attention, little work has focused on tightly integrating interactive visualization with text min-ing techniques for information exploration and scalable decision support. This is an important research field that directly addresses real-world problems in many domains, including but not limited to business intelligence, fraud detection, emergency manage-ment, customer relationship management, market intelligence, and healthcare ana-lytics. For this reason, it has started to attract the attention of both academia and industry and will continue to do so in the future.

To highlight the work in this emerging area, this special section includes seven excellent articles from the leading researchers in the field. These articles cover most key aspects of visual text analytics, including interactive text search and clustering, text browsing driven by user interests, as well as interactive exploration of large text collections with topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
 In  X  X atch the Story Unfold with TextWheel: Visualization of Large-Scale News Streams X , Cui et al. study how interactive visualization can help users understand keyword-based searching and clustering of news articles. The proposed TextWheel sys-tem aims at conveying multiple attributes of news articles and the macro/micro rela-tionships between news streams and keywords in context. In  X  X isual Abstraction and Ordering in Faceted Browsing of Text Collections X , Thai et al. consider facet navigation based on a set of entities that are of interest to users. Their method does not require the metadata of documents. Instead, it treats documents as content-bearing items. A multi-dimensional visualization is then developed to represent the items of interest. The major feature of this visualization is that it leverages both a conceptual structure and the structural equivalence of documents to visually illustrate a large number of items. In  X  X hC: Multi-Resolution Visualization and Exploration of Text Corpora with Parallel Hierarchical Coordinates X , Candan et al. argue that the parallel coordinates (PC) technique, which maps multi-dimensional vectors onto a 2D space, can be used to help users discern patterns in document collections. The inherent reduction in dimen-sionality during the mapping from multi-dimensional points to 2D lines, however, may result in visual clutter. To avoid such clutter, the authors propose a controlled clutter reduction approach, called parallel hierarchical coordinates, to reduce the visual clut-ter in PC-based visualizations of text corpora. In  X  X opicNets: Visual Analysis of Large Text Corpora with Topic Modeling X , Gretarsson et al. present a Web-based system for visually and interactively analyzing large sets of documents using statistical topic models. Several visualization components and control mechanisms such as corpus-and document-specific views, interactive topic modeling, and visual filtering, are developed to support knowledge discovery and reasoning. In addition, rich interactions are used to allow users to analyze the document collection at various levels of granularity. In the fifth article,  X  X ClusterE: A Framework for Evaluating and Understanding Doc-ument Clustering Using Visualization X , Zhang and Li develop a visualization toolkit for better evaluating and understanding the document clustering results. The major feature of this toolkit is that it integrates cluster validation with interactive visualiza-tion to allow users to examine document clustering results from multiple persepctives. In particular, LinLog layout view, matrix view, and cluster view work together to pro-vide not only various inter/intra-clustering structures at different levels, but also the corresponding relationships between the clustering results and the ground truth (the externally derived cluster label information). In our sixth article,  X  X IARA Interactive, Topic-Based Visual Text Summarization and Analysis X , Liu et al. build an interactive, visual text analysis tool to help users perform topic-based analysis of large collections of text. This tool marries state-of-the-art topic modeling technologies with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. The authors propose an enhanced LDA-based topic analysis technique, which automatically derives a set of topics to sum-marize a collection of documents and their content evolution over time. A time-based visualization is designed to visually illustrate the topic modeling results from multiple perspectives. A set of rich interaction tools are also provided to help users further inter-pret the visualized results in context and examine the text collection from multiple per-spectives. In our seventh and last article,  X  X eature-Based Visual Sentiment Analysis of Text Document Streams X , Rohrdantz et al. address a feature-based visual analysis pipeline that tightly couples methods from text mining, visual analytics, and informa-tion visualization. The authors first extend automatic sentiment analysis approaches to extract sentiments for different features. Then interactive visualizations are intro-duced to provide an overview, as well as to derive detailed insights into temporal sen-timent patterns about the features of interest. And finally, an algorithm is designed to facilitate analysts to detect interesting time interval patterns for different features.
Text data is still growing at an incredible rate, which is far beyond the human capac-ity to perceive, understand, and reason about. Not surprisingly, users X  expectations on visual text analytics systems are also increasing. As a result, visual text analytics must develop solutions to enable users to (1) synthesize information and derive insights from massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting text data; (2) detect the expected and discover the unexpected; (3) provide timely and understandable assessments to augment their discovery process; (4) communicate assessment effectively for action. We believe text visualization research will continue to grow in the years to come, help-ing users analyze large collections of documents more efficiently and effectively.
