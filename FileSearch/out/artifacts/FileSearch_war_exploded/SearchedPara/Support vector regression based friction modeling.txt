 1. Introduction been the major sources of performance degradation in terms of slow responses, steady state accuracy, and or limit cycles near the reference position ( Armstrong-Helouvry, 1991 ). Hence the need for its accurate compensation has become important in high precision position control. Various techniques have been devel-oped to eliminate the effects of the friction such as presented in ( Dupont and Armstrong-Helouvry, 1993 ; Armstrong-Helouvry et al., 1994 ; Wahyudi, 2003 ; Tjahjowidodo et al., 2004 ; Canudas de Wit et al., 1986 ). Among the successful methods is the well-known model-based friction compensation. In this method, the effect of the friction is canceled by applying additional control signal which generates a torque/force. The generated torque/force has the same value (or approximately the same) with the friction torque/force but opposite in direction. This method requires the precise modeling of the characteristics of the friction to provide a good performance. Therefore, in the context of model-based
In addition, the recent development in artificial intelligent approaches makes it adaptable for system modeling base on the data training and expert knowledge. It has been shown that the major AI-paradigms (Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic, Neuro-fuzzy, Support vector machine etc) have the capability of approximating any nonlinear function to a reasonable degree of accuracy, and have been applied in several engineering applications ( Cheng 2009 ). To this end, AI techniques have been identified and proposed as appropriate alternative for friction model and com-pensation in motion control systems, ( Gao and Ovaska, 1999 ; 2007 ; Gomes et al., 2005 ; Wahyudi and Tijani, 2008 ). Therefore, non-parametric models base on artificial intelligence approaches can be used as an alternative for friction identification so that the difficulty in friction model selection can be avoided. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence based friction model may also reduce both the complexity and time consumed in the friction modeling and identification. With recent advancement in statis-tical learning theory, support vector Regression (SVR) proposed by Vapnik (1995) has been identified as effective modeling tools in machine learning.

Support Vector Regression is generally an extension of the well developed theories of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to regres-sion problems with introduction of e -insensitivity loss function by Vapnik (1995) . Unlike traditional learning algorithm for function estimation such as Neural Network that minimizes the error on the training data based on the principle of empirical risk minimization, SVR embodies the principle of Structure Risk minimization which minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk. Hence, it is characterized by better ability to generalize, and at the same time less prone to the problems of overfitting and local minimal. It has was applied for long-time prediction of discharge in ( Lin et al., 2006 ), for forecasting of the daily metrological pollution in ( Osowski and Garanty (2007) ) and recently in fault detection in industrial environment ( Gryllias and Antoniadis, 2012 ). Due to these unique advantages, it has been proposed and employed for non-linear function approxima-tion, and recently for friction identification in Haptic Display system ( Bi et al., 2004 , Ahmed and Lee, 2008 ). However, besides the problem of specifying the trade-off between empirical error and model capacity (i.e. Model Selection), there also exists the problem conventional e -SVR. This has led to the formulation of other version of SVR known as v -SVR with the introduction of another parameter v . By the introduction of parameter v in the objective function, v-SVR provides automatic computation of the optimal e -insensitivity cost function parameter, e , and besides having the advantage of being able to automatically determine e , it can be used to pre-specify the number of support vectors ( Smola and Scholkopf, 2001 ; Sch  X  olkopf and Smola, 2002 ).

To this end, this study proposes the development of v -SVR based friction model to overcome the problem of friction model selection and development in motion control system. And in addition, the difficulty in e -SVR development is addressed with simplicity of v -SVR model development. Hence, a non-parametric friction model using the novel v -Support Vector Regression ( v -SVR) with Gaussian Kernel function is proposed in this study to estimate and compensate the non-linear friction dynamics in a Direct Current (DC) motor driven motion control system. The effectiveness of the proposed SVR-based friction model to com-pensate the frictional effects in positioning control is evaluated experimentally on a rotary experimental motion system for both Point-to-Point (PTP) and Tracking Positioning control. According to Armstrong-Helouvry et al., 1994 , control tasks involving regu-lator and tracking positioning are mainly affected by stiction, system is shown in Fig. 2 and the parameters of the DC-motor (Graphite commutation, 3863H024C 1507), used is listed in
Table 1 . The input to the motor is the armature voltage u driven by a voltage source. The measurable variables are the angular position of the shaft, y in radian, while the angular velocity of the motor shaft ( _ y in radian/s) is estimated using an appropriate digital filter.
 linear parts (here friction), based on this the problem can thus be formulated as follows. Given a dynamic system represented as
J eq  X  y  X  u f  X  _ y  X  X  u m  X  1  X  where u m  X  K t i a represents the force due to motor torque, J eq denotes the total inertial due to the motor and external loads, and u f  X  _ y  X  is the overall nonlinear friction force present. that ^ u f u f as required in model-based friction compensation both electrical and mechanical parts respectively, the linear transfer function of the plant is obtained as: y  X  s  X  u  X  s  X   X  a system identification process as described in ( Ljung, 1987 ) with Pseudo Random Binary Signal (PRBS) excitation signal. The resulting model with best performance gives A  X  275 and mapping to a high dimensional feature space by the application of the kernel trick defined as: K  X  x i , x j  X  X  j  X  x i  X  T j  X  x j  X  X  11  X 
The constrain optimization problem in the primal weight space is min Subject to : y i o T j  X  x  X  b r e  X  x i i  X  1 , 2 ::: , N
By defining the Lagrangian and applying the conditions for optimality solution, one obtains the following v -SVR dual opti-mization problem max Subject to : and
The regression estimates is thus given by f  X  x  X  X  to the quadratic optimization problem, and b follows from the complementary Karush X  X uhn X  X ucker(KKT) conditions which state that at the point of the solution, the product between dual variables and constraints has to vanish ( Sch  X  olkopf and Smola, 2002 ):  X  e  X  x i y i  X  / o , j  X  x i  X  S  X  b  X  X  0 n  X  e  X  x i n  X  y i / o , j  X  x i  X  S b  X  X  0 , and  X  b  X  y i / o , j  X  x i  X  S e for a i A  X  0 , C = N  X  b  X  y i / o , j  X  x i  X  S  X  e for a i n A  X  0 , C = N  X  X  15  X 
From the foregoing review, it is clear that the choice of Kernel function and the optimization parameters to be selected and tuned play important roles in overall performance of the regression process. The range of 0 r v r 1has been identified as an effective range of parameter v for control of errors ( Sch  X  olkopf and Smola, 2002 ), thereby simplified the selection range of parameters combi-nation compared to e  X  X VR. 4. SVR friction modeling The first stage in friction modeling, and generally in supervised AI-based modeling is availability of representative data. In this work, two main experiments were conducted in order to acquire the velocity-friction data. Fig. 3 shows the experimental set-up implemented in MATLAB Xpc-target environment. The major hardware apart from the host and target PCs are the NI multi-function I/O DAQ PCI6024E, with BNC-2110 adapter for data acquisition to and from the Target-PC. A Scancon incremental shaft encoder with resolution of 1.5 10 4 (in quadrature mode) was used for measuring the position in radian. With 2 A maximum current rating of the motor, 0 X 5 Amp rating current sensor was selected and connected across the motor terminal for measuring negative direction of motion. Table 2 shows the resulting values for all the runs with their mean value. and 2 o _ y o 0 radian/s for positive and negative direction of motion respectively.
 A stiff velocity control scheme was developed using the Pseudo-Derivative Feedback with Feedforward (PDFF) controller ( Ohm, 1990 ) in order to achieve the steady state velocity control especially at low velocities. In this study, the PDFF gave better control response compared to its PI counterpart. The control tuned according to the procedures described by Ohm (1990) for high performance stiff velocity control as 100, 1 and 0.75 respectively.

The control input is then given by: u  X b K Vi
The feedback velocity was obtained using digital form of the high pass analog filter given by: G  X  z  X  X 
For each constant velocity, the average of armature current and steady state velocity were computed after the transient period of 0.1 s. Five different runs were carried out for each velocity input, and the overall mean computed. Total of 108 data sets were obtained for each direction of motion. 4.3. Data transformation
The actual current is computed from the voltage response of the sensor using the relationship given in Eq. (16), the friction torque is then obtained using t f  X  K t i f where K t is the motor torque constant
The complete experimental data set for both directions is shown in Fig. 5 4.4. Development of SVR-friction model The SVR-model was developed with reference to the original Matlab toolbox codes by Canu et al. (2005) . The overall procedures are as follows:
Partitioning of data into training (60 points) and validation (48 points) data sets.

Selection of Kernel function: Based on prior knowledge about the friction characteristic a Gaussian kernel (19) was selected. K  X  x i , x j  X  X  exp where s is determines the width of the kernel function
Selection and tuning of the regression parameters: three main parameters to be tuned are (i) s -Kernel parameter, and C ) were iteratively tuned and used for both positive and negative directions, the combinations that gave the least e , best of benchmarking. The data set was fit into the three models represented respectively by Eqs. ((20) X (22)) F  X  _ y  X  X  F c sgn  X  _ y  X  X  F o _ y  X  20  X  F  X  _ y  X  X  F c  X  F s F c F  X  _ y  X  X  F c  X  X  F s F c  X  e  X  X  _ y = _ y s  X  X   X  F o _ y  X  22  X  where F c is the minimum level of Coulomb friction, F s is the level friction parameter. It is assumed here that the viscous path has been modeled with the linear part of the plant; hence it was not included in the model parameter search. The model parameter set b F c F s _ y s c were estimated using MATLAB optimization tool by minimizing the mean square error of the friction force prediction with nonlinear least square optimization algorithm. The esti-mated parameters for both directions are shown in Table 4 . The performance comparison of both v -SVR and the parametric models on training and validation data in terms of RMSE is given in Table 5 . 5. Friction compensation
The resulting v -SVR model parameters (difference of Lagrange multipliers and bias) were integrated in an embedded Matlab function for online real-time friction compensation. The compen-sation schemes comprising of a linear Proportional Derivative (PD) controller with and without the developed v -SVR and the parametric friction models in feedback loop as compensator were steady state error and RMSE tracking error, respectively. The perfor-mance improvements recorded with each of the friction compensator over only linear PD controller indicates the important and require-ment of friction compensator for precision positioning control especially at low reference input. Lorentzian model generally out-performed other parametric mode ls. Coulomb model recorded least performance especially at low velocity control. This can be under-stoodfromthetypeoffrictioncha racteristic accounted for by the coulomb model; though it is the simplest parametric model of all. models, the proposed and developed v -SVR-based friction model gives best improvement in both modeling of the friction and error reduction in the positioning control. However, the non-smoothness in the tracking responses especially at low reference input was attributed to the effect of velocity estimation and imperfection in the positioning sensor used in the compensation scheme.
This could be improved upon with the used of observer based estimation or other more sophisticated velocity estimation scheme.
Also it is believed that future work will extend the application to micro scale positioning control,and incorporate dynamism into the model for application in areas where variation of friction char-acteristics are greatly affected by factors such as temperature, surface deformation, and/or dwell time. 7.
