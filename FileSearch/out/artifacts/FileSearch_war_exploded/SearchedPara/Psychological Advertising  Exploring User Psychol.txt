 Precise click prediction is one of the key components in the spon-sored search system. Previous studies usually took advantage of two major kinds of information for click prediction, i.e., relevance information representing the similarity between ads and queries and historical click-through information representing users X  previ-ous preferences on the ads. These existing works mainly focused on interpreting ad clicks in terms of what users seek (i.e., relevance information) and how users choose to click (historically clicked-through information). However, few of them attempted to under-stand why users click the ads. In this paper, we aim at answering this  X  why  X  question. In our opinion, users click those ads that can convince them to take further actions, and the critical factor is if those ads can trigger users X  desires in their hearts. Our data analy-sis on a commercial search engine reveals that speci fi c text patterns, e.g.,  X  X f fi cial site X ,  X  x % off X , and  X  X uaranteed return in are very effective in triggering users X  desires, and therefore lead to signi fi cant differences in terms of click-through rate (CTR). These observations motivate us to systematically model user psycholog-ical desire in order for a precise prediction on ad clicks. To this end, we propose modeling user psychological desire in sponsored search according to Maslow X  X  desire theory, which categorizes psy-chological desire into fi ve levels and each one is represented by a set of textual patterns automatically mined from ad texts. We then construct novel features for both ads and users based on our de fi -nition on psychological desire and incorporate them into the learn-ing framework of click prediction. Large scale evaluations on the click-through logs from a commercial search engine demonstrate that this approach can result in signi fi cant improvement in terms of click prediction accuracy, for both the ads with rich historical data and those with rare one. Further analysis reveals that speci fi cpat-tern combinations are especially effective in driving click-through rates, which provides a good guideline for advertisers to improve their ad textual descriptions.

 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Economics, Algorithms, Experimentation Online Advertising; Sponsored Search; Click Prediction; User Psy-chological Desire
As an online advertising system, sponsored search [10] [14] has been one of the most important business models for commercial Web search engines. It generates most of the revenue of search engines by presenting to users sponsored search results, i.e., adver-tisements (ads), along with organic search results. To deliver the most interesting ads to the users, a sponsored search system con-sists of a couple of technical components, including query-to-ad matching [1], click prediction for matched ads [8] [11], fi ltration of the ads according to thresholds for relevance and click probabil-ity, and auction to determine the ranking, placement, and pricing of the remaining ads [9]. In today X  X  industry, generalized second price auction (GSP) [9] is the most widely-used auction mechanism, in which the price that an advertiser has to pay depends on the pre-dicted click probability of his/her own ad as well as the bid price and predicted click probability of the ad ranked in the next position. As can be seen from the above descriptions, accurate prediction of click probability is an e ssential problem in sponsored search, since it is widely used in the fi ltration, ranking, placement, and pricing of the ads.

State-of-the-art sponsored search systems typically employ a machine learning model to predict the probability that a user clicks an ad. In previous studies [8] [2] [11], the historical click in-formation for each ad is shown to be effective for predicting the future click probab ility of the ad. In practi cal sponsored search systems, however, there are many ads without adequate historical click-through data (even after aggregation at different levels, e.g., campaign, advertiser, and query levels). To tackle this data sparsity issue, it is necessary to explore other information than the clicks. Several types of features have been considered for this purpose, which we call relevance features . The relevance features are mostly based on the similarity between query and ad, and the quality of the ad [7] [23] [21] [20] [24]. By incorporating these relevance features into the process of click predictions, improved prediction accuracy have been obtained. Figure 1: Example ads for two queries,  X  nike  X  X nd X  perfume  X , and two ads under the same query yield similar relevance to the query.

Despite the usefulness of the relevance and historical click fea-tures, we would like to point out that they are constructed from the perspective of what users click and how users click. Speci fi cally, relevance information can indicate what relevant content users seek to click. However, as it is well-known that users are not active to search for ads, the search engine , instead, has to recommend ads to users during their generic Web search. Therefore, the relevance between query and ad cannot perform as the key driver for click. Moreover, historical click information implies how users click, un-fortunately, this information is not applicable for all of the users due to the data sparsity. In our opinion, in order for more accu-rate click prediction, we need to examine why users click. Some previous studies [21] [15] have proposed some features to describe the attractiveness of ads. They have made some attempts to touch the question of why users click ads. However, those features are simply arbitrary uni-grams extracted by some heuristics. It is still dif fi cult to explain the reason of users X  clicks merely based on those term based signals without systematic knowledge on users X  desire behind ad clicks. To this end, we would like to answer the  X  why  X  question from the perspective of user desire by applying psycho-logical theories.

Two kinds of literatu res about psychological research shed light on our analysis of user desire in sponsored search. First, according to literatures on consumer behavior analyses [13] [22] [19], many factors will in fl uence the decision making for consumption, includ-ing thought-based effects and feeling-based effects. Thought-based effects are basically win/loss analysis (e.g., trade-off between price and quality); while feeling-based effects are more subjective (e.g., brand loyalty and luxury seeking). Note users clicking the ad usu-ally are with the intention to purchase something. In this situa-tion, it is natural that the factors mentioned in consumer behavior analyses will in fl uence their click behaviors. Moreover, as being widely leveraged by advertisers when designing their ad descrip-tions to meet different users X  needs, psychological theory on hu-man desire, especially Maslow X  X  hierarchy of needs [16], can per-form as an important theoretical foundation to model user desire behind ad clicks. Further data analysis, as shown in Section 2, will demonstrates how these factors take effects on users X  clicks on ads in sponsored search.

Our data analysis reveals that when different ads yield similar relevance features, there can be big differences in terms of click-through rates. Here we would like to give some intuitive exam-ples. Figure 1(a) shows two ads for the query  X  nike  X . We can observe that these two ads are both relevant to the query. How-ever, the sponsored search logs show that the fi rst ad gives rise to much more clicks than the second one. In particular, the fi rst ad generates a click-through rate of 0.073 while the second one only results in a click-through rate of 0.005. For another exam-ple, Figure 1(b) shows two ads for the query  X  perfume  X . We can also fi nd that these two ads are both relevant to the query. But the sponsored search logs demonstrate that the fi rst one yields a much higher click-through rate (i.e., 0.167) than the second one (0.005). To understand such differences from the perspective of users, we conduct a user study and ask 100 common web users (diverse in their jobs and ages) to compare the corresponding two ads under each of the queries above, and to tell us why they prefer an ad than the other. Under the study of the query  X  nike  X , 81% users who at-tended the study chose the fi rst ad and told us that this is because they would like to take petty advantage by using the  X  coupon  X  X  s mentioned in the ad. Under the study of the query  X  perfume  X , 85% users who attended the study chose the fi rst ad and their major rea-son was that they feel more trustable on the  X  of fi cial site  X  X smen-tioned in the ad.

Note that, taking petty advantage and feeling trustable are both desires as mentioned in [13], on the other hand, we can naturally map them into  X  X hysiological X  needs and  X  X afety X  needs as intro-duced in [16]. These fi ndings give us a strong hint that certain tex-tual contents in the ad descriptions can trigger speci fi c psychologi-cal desires, and therefore affect the click behaviors of the users. We call such factors for search ad clicks as  X  psychological desires fac-tors  X . If we can extract effective features representing such  X  psy-chological desire factors  X , we should be able to greatly enhance the click prediction accuracy, especially for those ads with inadequate historical click information.

In this paper, we propose to model user psychological desire for both ads and users based on textual patterns, which are mined from ad texts and representative for the psychological desires. In partic-ular, we fi rst take deeper data analysis to verify that the user psy-chological desire, especially in the form of special textual content, can affect the click-through rates in sponsored search. After that, we propose a data mining based method to automatically extract the textual contents (i.e., n-grams) representative for user desires from the ad descriptions. We then cluster different textual contents into clusters(i.e textual patterns) according to heuristics. To make further generalization on the user desires, we organize all desire patterns into a hierarchy of users psychological desires by follow-ing the principle of Maslow X  X  hierarchy of needs [16].

Based on extracted textual patterns and generalized hierarchy of user desires, we extract new features describing ads, users, and their correlation in terms of psychological desire and incorporate these features into the learning framework of click prediction in spon-sored search. We have conducted a large scale evaluation on the ef-fectiveness of these new features using the click-through log from a commercial search engine. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed new features can give rise to signi fi cant improvement in terms of accuracy of click prediction. Additional experiments show that our proposed features are especially useful for the ads without rich histor ical data. Moreover, furt her analysis illustrates that speci fi c pattern combinations are quite effective for driving up click-through rates, which provides a good reference for advertisers to improve the textual descriptions of their ads..

To sum up, the contributions of our work include: The remainder parts of this paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our data analysis on how user psychological desires affect the CTR in sponsored search. Section 3 introduces our proposed approach for extracting textual patterns representing user desires. The click prediction modeling will be presented in Section 4, in which we will propose to incorporate extracted pat-terns as new features into the whole modeling. Experimental setup and results are presented in Section 5. At last, we conclude the paper and discuss the future work in Section 6.
To gain more understanding on why user psychological desire is important to click prediction, in this section, we will take dis-cussions on the user decision making process and its relationship with sponsored search. Based on some speci fi c examples, we will demonstrate how user psychological desires are usually re fl ected in the ad content. After that, by conducting some data analyses, we try to understand how those user psychological desires affect click be-haviors. As all of discussions in this section will be provided based on data analysis on real sponsored search data, we fi rst introduce the settings for our data analysis.
All of our data used in this work are collected from a commercial search engine. In this section, we will use two datasets for the following purposes: Dataset 1 : In order to study whether the decision making only relies on relevance, we randomly sample a set of queries with all the ads displayed under them from the entire dataset of June, 2012. Then, we compute both CTR and the relevance score of each query, ad pair. To get a reliable CTR, we fi lter those query, ad pairs with fewer than 100 impressions. Finally, we collect 10 queries and 44 , 079 query, ad pairs.
 Dataset 2 : In order to explore the user desires in the ad, we sample about 20M ad impressions from those occurred in the log of June, 2012. We compute CTR for each ad in the set based on the click-through log. In Section 3, this dataset will be used again as source to mine out those patterns. Finally, we collect 5 , 296 , 935 ads, generated by 171 , 495 advertisers.
In sponsored search, once a user clicks the returned ads, the natu-ral goal of him/her would be conversion. Thus, ad clicking becomes a critical step on the consuming behavior chain since it pre-selects what will be potentially consumed. To predict users X  click behav-iors on ads, it is necessary to investigate what people will consider during their consuming behaviors.

As a widely adopted course on consumer behavior, authors of the book [13] formulate the process of making consumption decisions into four stages: problem recogn ition, information search, decision making, and post-purchase evaluation. Through the fi rst two stages, consumers will identify candidate consumption, while in the most important stage, i.e., decision making, they will take thorough con-sideration and decide whether to complete the consumption. Ac-cording to [13], the decision making is affected by three effects: contextual, thought-based, and feeling-based effects. In particular, contextual effects correspond to environmental effects which are usually treated as the background of consumption; thought-based effects, such as pricing discount, deliver time limitation, etc., are more quanti fi able; feeling-based effects, such as brand preference, trustworthiness, luxury seeking, etc., are more related to subjec-tive. Among these three types of effects, thought-based and feeling-based effects play as the more critical factors in decision making and form up consumer psychological desires. Moreover, since con-sumer psychological desires are diverse, it is naturally to organize them into a hierarchy to model consumer behaviors in a more effec-tive way. As being widely leveraged by advertisers when designing their ad descriptions to meet consumers X  needs, psychological the-ory on human desire, especially Maslow X  X  hierarchy of needs [16], can perform as an important theoretical foundation to model and organize user desires behind ad clicks.

In sponsored search, ad clicking can be viewed as selecting po-tential consumption. Thus, user psychological desires obviously play important roles in deciding the click behaviors. Unfortunately, most of state-of-the-art works rely on relevance and historical click features. Although historical click information implies how users click, unfortunately, this information is not applicable for all of the users due to the data sparsity. Moreover, relevance can indicate what content users seek, but it is just a preliminary condition to fi nd candidate consumption and cannot answer why users click ac-cording to the decision making process. It X  X  highly possible that some ads, though with high relevance to the query, could not fi t on the user desires. To verify that user desires do affect ad clicks beyond relevance, we conducted a data analysis to investigate that whether ads with the same relevance level under one query will get quite different CTR values 1 .
 Here, the CTR is computed based on the click-through log in Dataset 1. To measure the relevance between the query and ad, we fi rst build a relevance model via learning-to-rank approach. In par-ticular, for each query, ad pair, we generate a vector of relevance features, such as BM25, language modeling, category matching etc, and each pair is associated with a human judged label represent-ing the degrees of relevance of the ad with respect to the query. There are fi ve levels of relevance: perfect, excellent, good, fair, and bad. We apply a widely-used learning-to-rank algorithm, i.e., RankSVM, to learn the relevance model. All parameters are tuned based on 5-fold cross-validation.

After obtaining the CTR for each ad and the relevance score for each query, ad pair, we conduct further data analysis on Dataset 1. Particularly, among the ads under one speci fi c query, we fi nd those ad pairs satisfying that the relevance scores of both ads yield small difference (in practice, we normalize the relevance scores into the scale of [0, 1], and we judge the normalized relevance scores differ-ing less than 0.01 as small difference.) Then, we checked the CTR difference of ad pairs with small relevance difference. Figure 2 demonstrates the distribution of relative CTR difference among all the ad pairs with similar relevance. The relative CTR difference between two ads, a i and a j , is computed as | CTR a i  X  CTR From this fi gure, we can fi nd that about 75% of ad pairs yield more than 20% CTR difference between two ads. This analysis result indicates that relevance is not adequate to provide accurate click prediction. According to the aforementioned decision making pro-cess, it becomes necessary to explore the other complimentary fac-tors, i.e., user psychology desire, to achieve better click prediction.
In this subsection, we examine the effects of user psychology de-sires on click behaviors in sponsored search. Actually, advertisers are pro fi t-seekers and really pioneers in employing such user de-sires. After browsing a sample of ads from the commercial search engine, we fi nd that there are a number of textual contents that are often used by advertisers in the ad text. Table 1 illustrates some ex-amples of the user desires under thought-based and feeling-based effects, which are extracted from ads by human experts in this fi eld. From this table, it is obvious that advertisers do put speci fi ctex-tual contents in ad texts to target user psychological desires. In the fl uence the click probability of ads. In order for accurate compari-son, all the CTR values used in our work are normalized based on ads X  display positions. The normalization coef fi cients are obtained based on the analysis from a random online fl ight in the commercial search engine. Figure 2: Distribution of CTR difference among all the ad pairs with similar relevance. following of this section, we study some examples of these con-tents and investigate how they can affect the CTR of ads. This part of analysis is conducted based on Dataset 2 as mentioned in Sec-tion 2.1.
 Table 1: Examples of the user desires under thought-based and feeling-based effects.

One example of thought-based effects that affects user decision is petty advantage (in other words price temptation), which is a widely-observed textual content in the ads. In particular, to let more users pay attention to the speci fi c products or services, some adver-tisers usually emphasize discounts or sales information in the text of their ads. Table 2 shows some examples of ads aiming at users psychological desire of taking petty advantages which have been found in a large number of ads. From this fi gure, we can fi nd that  X  coupon  X  X nd X  x % off  X  are two textual patterns which can be in-stantiated by various text content. Taking  X  coupon  X  X sexample, there exist at least the following variations:  X  coupon code  X ,  X  on-line coupon  X ,  X  free coupons  X , etc. To investigate if these textual patterns will affect the users X  clicks, for each of these two patterns, we separately compute the CTR of those ads containing the pattern compared with the average CTR of all ads, the results of which are shown in Table 3. From this table, we can fi nd that the ads matched with either the pattern  X  coupon  X  X r X  x % off  X  yield CTR which is signi fi cant larger than the average CTR over all ads. Be-sides of average CTR, Figure 3(a) compares the CTR distribution of ads matched with pattern  X  coupon  X  with those without this pat-tern. From the fi gure, we can observe that the pattern  X  coupon  X  can cause a big difference in the shape of CTR distribution as well. We can fi nd the similar observation for the pattern  X  x% off  X , as shown in Figure 3(b).

Toward the feeling-based effects, we also fi nd some textual con-tent in ads which are often employed by advertisers to target user Table 2: Examples of ads catching the user desires of taking petty advantages.
 Table 3: CTR difference between the ads matched with the cer-tain desire pattern and overall ads.
 psychological desire. Taking the trustworthy as example,  X  of fi cial  X  and  X  return guarantees  X  are often utilized to attract users X  atten-tions in this category. Table 4 shows some related examples. There are also quite a few variations in textual content to express  X  of fi cial  X  and  X  return guarantees  X . Taking  X  return guarantees  X  X sexample, we can fi nd  X  365 Day Returns  X ,  X  30 Day Right of Return  X ,  X  No-Hassle Returns  X , etc. And after conducting similar CTR analyses,  X  of fi cial  X  X nd X  return guarantees  X  yield signi fi cantly larger average CTR compared to that of all ads, as shown in Table 3. Signi fi cant changes in CTR distribution of ads matched with pattern  X  of fi cial  X  or  X  return guarantees  X  can also be observed as shown in Figure 3(c) and 3(d).
 Table 4: Examples of ads catching the user desires of trustwor-thy.

Based on all these studies, we can fi nd that user psychological desire has been well utilized by advertisers to lead users to click more on their ads. Therefore, it has become necessary to leverage user desire information to improve the accuracy of click prediction, since those textual patterns catching user psychological desire can drive up the CTR signi fi cantly. To take advantage of this impor-tant information, it is essential to fi nd an effective way to extract those patterns from ads. In the next section, we will propose a data mining method to automatically extract those patterns from ads ac-cording to the heuristics get from data analysis.
To extract content re fl ecting user desires from ad texts, we need to fi rst understand the textual content of ads. Usually, there are two parts of content in one ad X  X  text. One targets at indicating the rele-vance between the query and the ad; while the other part, according to de fi nitions in Section 2.2, contains the content re fl ecting the user psychological desires. Therefore, our target is to mine out the tex-tual content re fl ecting user psychological desires from the part not indicating relevance. To this end, our fi rst step is to fi lter out the relevance part.

After extracting text content re fl ecting user psychological de-sires, we will summarize the corresponding desires of these text contents from the nature of their functionality. And, we will follow 3 principles:  X  The text content should cover enough volume in real ad traf fi c, as quite a few experienced advertisers and even ad agents are very likely to add similar content to trigger user desires. In fact, we can fi nd content like  X  get a free coupon  X  covers over 10K ads in our Dataset 2 .  X  Similar content can re fl ect the speci fi c same desire. As ad is formed as free text content, advertisers have many choices to ex-press the same meaning. For example, as to the coupon, there can be  X  coupon code  X ,  X  get coupon  X ,  X  free coupons  X  . These variants actually share the same text phrase. Therefore, many text contents re fl ecting a speci fi c same desire can be organized in a cluster of text phrases. To easiness of reference, we call one cluster a user desire pattern .  X  Content from experienced advertisers are more important. Expe-rienced advertisers are more likely to put text content representing desires in their ads since they are more familiar with user behaviors than new advertisers. Moreover, they might even actively create novel text phrases to represent user psychological desires. Thus, text content from these advertisers will be highly possible to form useful desire patterns.

Accordingly, we propose a three-step approach to automatically extract user desire pattern from ad texts. In the following of this section, we will introduce it step by step, followed by a demonstra-tion of the mining results with further human validation. Step 1 : Cleaning up content targeting for relevance Basedonthede fi nition of user psychological desires, the content re fl ecting such desires will not directly contribute to the relevance between user X  X  search query and ads. In some cases, e.g., the search query is  X  X heap car X , some words in query, e.g.,  X  X heap X , might contribute to both relevance and user psychological desires. But, it is obvious that the noun word  X  X ar X  should not be related to such desires. Hence, in our approach, we fi rst fi lter out the noun words matched with search queries from ads, which can greatly reduce thecontentinadtexts.
 Step 2 : Finding n-grams with high frequency Ads content contains two major parts, one targeting for relevance, while the other aiming at convincing users to consume. According to our de fi nition, text patterns related to user psychological desire will be mined from the second part. After step 1, we have roughly removed contents targeting for relevance. To further discover ef-fective patterns for user desires, the most straight forward way is to fi nd out n-grams from ads corpus as the candidate contents to form patterns. Note that each useful pattern should not be too long, otherwise it can be split into several shorter patterns. Therefore, we limited each n-gram to be at most of 6-gram. Then, we scan all ads from our collected data and extract all the n-grams. According to the fi rst principle discussed above, useful n-gram should cover enough volume. Hence, we only keep those patterns that can cover 1000 ads and 100 advertisers. These parameters are tuned manually via cross validation in a sampled data set.
 Step 3 : Pattern generalization via clustering After fi rst two steps, there are still a large number of extracted n-grams. And it is uneasy to judge whether these n-grams are re-ally related to user desires. Considering the hints from the second and third principles, we leverage a dedicatedly designed clustering algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 1, to further process remained n-grams towards a better representation of user desires. The intu-ition of the clustering method lies: 1) Those n-grams sharing some words are usually variations of the same user desires; thus, textual similarity based clustering method will tend to group those varia-tions into one cluster, named as a textual pattern for user desire. 2) Those advertisers with more experience will tend to incorporate user desire patterns in their ad texts; thus, we can put more weight on n-grams extracted from their ads when computing the clustering center. In this work, we describe the mature status of an adver-tiser as the number of clicks targeting at any of his/her ads in one month, and the weight of an n-gram is accordingly set as the maxi-mum mature status among advertisers who ever used the n-gram in their ads.

In the clustering process, we need to determine the cluster num-ber K , i.e., the number of textual patterns for user desires. Since we are aiming at enhancing click prediction, we fi nally set the K = 300 basedoncrossvalidateonthe fi nal click prediction per-formance.

By using our clustering algorithm, we are able to extract a set of general user desires. To reduce the sparsity of user desires for each individual ad, we further organize extracted general desires into a hierarchy of user psychological desires according to Maslow X  X  hi-erarchy of needs [16]. In particular, Maslow X  X  hierarchy of needs de fi ne humans X  needs as fi ve levels: Physiological, Safety, Belong-ingness, Esteem, and Self-Actualization . We can directly map user psychological desires into these fi ve levels, and each level is spec-i fi ed with a set of textual patterns, as shown in Figure 4. From this hierarchy, we can fi nd that the lower level represents more basic user psychological desires while the upper level represents higher levelofuserdesires.
As we have discussed in the data analysis part, textual patterns in ads which re fl ect user desire patterns will greatly drive the CTR. So after extracting textual patterns for user psychological desire, we are going to integrate such information into the click prediction modeling. In this section, we will fi rst brie fl y outline our approach for click prediction. Then, we will discuss how to model the user psychological desire as new features for both ads and users into click prediction modeling.
We formulate click prediction in sponsored search as a super-vised learning problem. In this paper, we will apply the maximum entropy model [3] for click prediction. We collected both click and non-click events from sponsored search logs as training samples, where each sample represents a query, ad, user, position tuple, representing that the ad was presented to the user at the certain po-sition after she submits the query to search engine. Assume there is a set of N training samples, where f ( q i ,a i ,u i ,p i )  X  R d represents the d -dimensional feature space for the i -th tuple and c i  X  X  0 , 1 } denotes the corresponding class label, i.e., 1 for click while 0 for non-click.

Given a query q ,anad a ,auser u , and ad X  X  displayed position p , the problem is to compute the probability of click p ( c The maximum entropy model [3] is well suited for this task since its strength in combining diverse forms of contextual information, and formulates the click probability for a query, ad, user, position tuple as follows: where f j ( q,a,u,p ) is the j -th feature derived for query, ad, user, position tuple and  X  j  X  w is the associated weight. Given the training set D train , the maximum entropy model learns the weight vector w by maximizing the likelihood of exponential models as: where the fi rst part represents the likelihood function and the sec-ond part utilizes a Gaussian prior on the weight vector w to smooth the maximum entropy model. There are many approaches available in the literature [17] to solve this kind of optimization problems in-cluding iterative scaling and its variants, quasi-Newton algorithms, and conjugate gradient ascent. Given the large collection of sam-ples and high dimensional feature space, we use a nonlinear conju-gate gradient algorithm [18].

An accurate maximum entropy model relies greatly on the de-sign of features. According to the state-of-the-art works in click prediction, there are two major ki nds of features, which are rele-vance features and historical click features. In this work, we use some representative features according to previous work [5] [21]:
Beyond all the features described above, we aim at incorporating user desire information as new features into the click prediction modeling, since those user desires can result in more in fl uence on users X  click behaviors.
As we have mined a set of n-gram clusters as textual patterns, which are representative for user desires, we are able to match each ad against these textual patterns, so as to produce a series of binary features, each of which indicates the existence of a certain desire in the particular ad X  X  text. Moreover, since we have generalized fi ve levels of user desires to reduce the feature sparsity, it is possible to match each ad against these desire levels, so as to generate another fi ve binary features, which imply the belongingness of an ad to the certain desire level. Speci fi cally, these binary features are deter-mined as follows:  X  Ad desire pattern features : For each ad a , we will check if matched with each of textual patterns by checking the existence of any n-gram belonged to this textual pattern P .If a is matched with one desire, i.e., it contains a speci fi c n-gram belonged to the certain desire pattern P , the corresponding feature D a ( P ) will be set as 1, otherwise, it will be set as 0.  X  Ad desire level features : For each ad a , we will check if matched with textual patterns belonging to each of desire levels. If a is matched with one desire level L , i.e., it contains a desire pat-tern that is included in the speci fi c desire level, the corresponding feature value D a ( L ) will be set as 1, otherwise, it will be set as 0.
These binary values will be directly used as binary feature in the maximum entropy model for click prediction. As describe above, we have generated 300 textual patterns and generalized them into 5 levels. Therefore, for each ad a , we will employ 300 desire pattern features as well as 5 desire level features to represent ad psycho-logical desire in the click prediction modeling.
Our mined psychological desire patterns can also be leveraged to represent each user X  X  interests from the perspective of psycho-logical desire. Intuitively, if the user tends to click ads containing a certain psychological desire pattern frequently, it is very likely that this user has a strong demand on the corresponding psychological desire. Therefore, we could determine user features representative for the user X  X  demand on each desire pattern or desire level as fol-lows:  X  User desire pattern features : To describe a user X  X  demand on a speci fi c desire pattern, we take advantage of position normalized CTR of this user on all the ads containing the speci fi cdesirepat-tern. Particularly, for a user  X  u and a desire pattern P on P is computed as: where I (  X  ) denotes an indicator function; and,  X  ( p ) position normalized coef fi cient, which gives larger weight to the  X  User desire level features : To describe a user X  X  demand on a speci fi c desire level, we take advantage of the CTR of this user on all the ads containing any of desire patterns belonging to this speci fi c desire level. Particularly, for a user  X  u and a desire level  X  u  X  X  demand on L is computed as: As describe above, for each user, we can obtain 300 user desire pat-tern features corresponding to each desire pattern and 5 user desire level features for each desire level. Consequently, we will integrate these new features representative for user psychological desire into the click prediction modeling.
After extracting psychological desire features for both ads and users, we are able to generate features to describe desire matching between users and ads.  X  Desire pattern matching features : After representing an D a ( P 1 ) , D a ( P 2 ) ,  X  X  X  , D a ( P 300 ) , and representing a user u D u ( P 1 ) , D u ( P 2 ) ,  X  X  X  , D u ( P 300 ) , we could compute the desire pattern matching features between a and u based on the similarity  X  Desire level matching features : After representing an ad a D a ( L 1 ) , D a ( L 2 ) ,  X  X  X  , D a ( L 5 ) , and representing a user u D u ( L 1 ) , D u ( L 2 ) ,  X  X  X  , D u ( L 5 ) , we could compute the desire level matching features between a and u based on the similarity between D l a and D l a . Note that, our desire pattern and desire level matching features are quite general in that we could apply any sim-ilarity function when compute these two kinds of features. In this paper, we will apply cosine similarity to compute the desire pattern and desire level matching features. 2 Similar to [4], we obtain  X  ( p ) based on the analysis from a ran-dom online fl ight in the commercial search engine.
In this section, we fi rst describe the settings of our experiments and then report the experimental results.
To validate whether user psychological desire features we mined out can really help enhance the click prediction accuracy, we con-duct experiments based on the click-through logs of a real world commercial search engine. In particular, we collect the whole click-through logs of a two-week period from this search engine as our experimental dataset. And, we randomly sample a set of query events from the original whole traf fi c. We fi nally collect about 20M ad impressions in each of these two weeks. After that, we divide this dataset into two parts, each containing the data of one week. Then, we use the fi rst week X  X  data to train the click predic-tion model, and use the second for testing. Detailed statistics of the dataset can be found in Table 5.
 Table 5: Statistics of the datasets for training and testing the click prediction model.
As mentioned in Section 4, we employ maximum entropy mod-eling to train the click prediction model. In our experiments, we will compare the performance of different click prediction models trained with different feature sets. In order to show the effective-ness of those desire features, we employed the following feature settings: (details about the feature sets can be found in Section 4)
We set HF and HF-RF as a baseline because previous stud-ies [6] [12] have demonstrated that the historical click features and relevance features play the most important role in the click predic-tion task. Further experiments compare the performance of HF and HF-DPF/HF-DPLF to examine whether the proposed user psycho-logical desire features can bene fi t click prediction beyond historical features. Comparison between HF-RF and HF-DPF/HF-DPLF will provide us with more understanding on the predicting power of rel-evance features and user desire features, respectively. Experiments on HF-RF-DPF/HF-RF-DPLF aim at recognizing the contributions of user desire features to click prediction beyond both historical click features and relevance features. Moreover, we compare the performance between HF-RF-DPF and HF-RF-DPLF to investigate if desire level features are good complement to desire pattern fea-tures.
In our work, the Maximum Entropy modeling is applied to pre-dict click probability for every ad impression. We use recorded user actions, i.e., click or non-click, in the log data as labels. To evaluate the overall performance for the model, we employ average Relative Figure 5: Relative gain of different methods over HF in terms of CTR and RIG.
 Information Gain(RIG) [11] as the evaluation metric. Moreover, we employ CTR as another evaluation metric. Since it is a little dif fi cult to run real online experiment, we apply a replay-based sim-ulation method for evaluation. In particular, for each query event in the log data, we re-rank ads list according to our new click predic-tion model and use the real clicks as ground-truth to compute the CTR for the speci fi c model. Figure 5 demonstrates the relative gain of HF-RF, HF-DPF/HF-DPLF, and HF-RF-DPF/HF-RF-DPLF over HF in terms of CTR and RIG. From this fi gure, we can fi nd that user desire patterns can lead to signi fi cant improvement on click prediction over the base-line method HF. In particular, in terms of RIG, there are about 3% relative improvement by using both desire features and historical click features over only using historical click features, while there are only about 1 . 2% relative improvement by using both relevance features and historical click features over historical click features only. And, there is also more than 3% improvement by using HF-RF-DPF or HF-RF-DPLF over HF-RF.

Figure 5 also reports the comparison between different models in terms of CTR. From the fi gure, we can found there are about 0 CTR improvement by HF-DPF over HF-RF while there are about 1 . 1% improvement by HF-DPLF over HF-RF. Moreover, HF-RF-DPF generates a relatively 1 . 6% CTR improvement by using both desire features and relevance features over HF-RF; meanwhile, HF-RF-DPLF, after adding desire level feature, gives rise to more CTR improvement, i.e., relatively 2 . 1% , over HF-RF. These re-sults imply a big impact of desire features on click prediction accu-racy improvement. Furthermore, the results showing that HF-RF-DPLF/HF-DPLF outperform HF-RF-DPF/HF-DPF, respectively, also indicates that desire level features are good complements to desire pattern features. We hypothesize the reason is that desire level features can reduce the sparsity of desire features for individ-ual ads.

Actually, in real sponsor search system, increasing 1% on the click-through rate is already a big improvement. According to [9], 1% ctr improvement will drive a dditional hundred s of million rev-enue per month. In this sense, 2 . 1% relative improvement is really signi fi cant in click prediction.
Click prediction task typically faces two kind of data: ads with rich history and ads with rare history. Usually, when an ad is with rich history, its click prediction can achieve good performance by referring to its historical CTR; while relevance features are often used to help the click prediction especially for those ads with rare historical information.
 In this experiment, we would like to examine the impacts of new Figure 6: Relative gain of different methods over HF in terms of RIG, conducted on ads with rich or rare history. desire features with regarding to these two cases, respectively. In particular, we fi rst separate all query, ad pairs into two subsets: rich history set includes all query, ad pairs with more than 70 historical impressions in one month; and, rare history set contains all the other query, ad pairs. Figure 6 reports the scaled RIG by three methods on these two sets. From this fi gure, we can fi nd that, by adding desire features, HF-RF-DPF can increase the RIG performance over HF-RF by 5 . 2% for rich history set and 3 rare history set .

For those ads in the rare history set , click prediction is mainly based on the understanding on users X  click intents. Although rel-evance features can describe textual similarity between the query and the ad, it may not indicate if the user consider the ad as a po-tential fi t for consuming the product associated with the ad. Nev-ertheless, user psychological desires can better re fl ect this kind of user desires. Therefore, our extracted textual desire patterns can effectively predict users X  clicks on those ads with rare history. For those ads in the rich history set , Figure 6 illustrates that HF-RF results in a decreasing RIG compared HF, which indicates that relevance features fail to help click prediction when historical in-formation is rich. On the contrary, we can fi nd user desire features can help to further increase the accuracy in this part by more than 4% with respect to HF. Basically, the ad X  X  textual content is usually quite stable along the history. It is highly possible that the CTR already encoded the relevance features since intuitively users do not click irrelevant ads. Therefore, when historical data is rich, we can directly predict the CTR according to history while ignoring the relevance features. However, those user desire related patterns might change rapidly since advertisers will adjust ad text slightly for promoting speci fi c features according to their knowledge. Even the ad was just created one month, some user desire related patterns might already change multiple time in the period. If we consider the effect of the current pattern, it is straightforward that the CTR of the ad will be predicted more accurately.
Intuitively, we hypothesize that the user psychological desires do in fl uence the CTR. In particular, if the ad description can fi t user X  X  desire well, the corresponding CTR will be driven up. Thus, user desire features can lead to more accurate click prediction. It is natural that speci fi c desires will work differently in different cate-gories of ads. In this experiment, we employ the widely-used text categorization, i.e., ODP 3 . And, we apply a basic text classi fi ca-tion model to automatically categorize ads into different concept categories. Then, we study several combinations between desire patterns and ads categories to verify the click prediction accuracy lift caused by new desire features. We listed some observations in Table 6, an interesting fi nding from which is: When Physiological level patterns matched in ads related to jewelry, the click prediction accuracy will be decreased slightly by 1 . 58% . While when such level patterns matches in ads related to travel and hotel, the click prediction accuracy will be increased largely ( 3 . 60% ). Table 6: RIG improvement of example combinations between Physiological level desire patterns and diverse ads categories.
According to our discussion in Section 3, desire patterns can be further organized into 5-level hierarchy, including Physiological, Safety, Belongingness, Esteem, and Self-Actualization . Usually, successful advertisers will combine desire patterns from different levels together to achieve a higher CTR. In this section, we would like to check what kind of combinations between desire levels will provide better impacts on users click behavior.

In our experiment, we fi rst select the top 500 effective pattern combinations according to their corresponding lift to prediction ac-curacy, then we match the detailed patterns in these combinations into desire levels. After that, we can get a set of combination of general desire levels which is effective in enhancing the click pre-diction accuracy. We listed the hottest fi ve combinations of desire levels in Table 7.

Generally, advertisers might take advantage of these combina-tions to enhance their ads copy so as to achieve better CTR. How-ever, the second order effect does exist in the economic world, which indicates that if every one follows the same golden rule, the advantage will be vanished. Hence, it becomes necessary to address this potential issue in optimizing the ads copy with those patterns in identical way. Fortunately, on the other hand, it X  X  not that hopeless since these combinations are actually conceptual and the detail pat-terns might be created by advertisers actively along the time. And that X  X  the reason for us to use data mining algorithms to get those patterns automatically. As long as we can periodically get the latest patterns, we can help the click prediction effectively.
Advertising by natural focuses on commercial values, and it is indeed out of the scope of information retrieval. This paper takes an earlier attempt to connect click prediction in sponsored search with user behavior analysis. And, our research explores a new way for computational advertising to embrace the traditional psychological analysis to enhance the computational advertising through its real nature. In particular, we aim at answering  X  why  X  users click search ads by exploring user psychological desire according to consumer behavior analysis and Maslow X  X  desire theory. We construct novel features for both ads and users based on our de fi nition on psycho-logical desire and incorporate them into the learning framework of click prediction. Large scale evaluations demonstrate that it can signi fi cantly increase the accuracy of click prediction by incorpo-rating mined desire features into the learning framework of click prediction.

Leveraging psychology knowledge for improving online adver-tising, especially computational advertising, is still at early stage. But, it is indeed valuable to incorporate these cross discipline knowledge to push the boundary of the ads research. We will keep investigating on this direction. In details, 1) we will study if users X  psychological desire is dependent with queries or other kinds of search context and study how to model context-aware users X  de-sire. 2) As Maslow X  X  theory mentioned, desires can be organized into a hierarchy. We will examine whether this hierarchical rela-tionship can be leveraged when we are going to match users X  and ads X  X esire. 3) As users X  desire may change along the time, we plan to study how to model users X  temporal psychological desire and detect their emerging interests in terms of desire at real-time.
