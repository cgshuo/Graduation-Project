 1. Introduction
The concept of relevance and its role in information retrieval (IR) has been a complex subject which has received continual attention virtually since the inception of information science as a distinct domain. The nat-ure of understanding of relevance has changed along with the different paradigms of IR over the years. Recent research treats the IR process from a user-centered, cognitive approach. Using this approach, the IR searcher is assumed to progress through a series of stages in an effort to fulfill an information need. This user-centered
IR research has yielded several sets of user-defined relevance categories, but how these relevance criteria might change as the user moves through the stages of the IR search process has been the subject of only a few recent studies. The purpose of this study is to use statistical analysis to determine how relevance criteria choices might change in relation to the user X  X  progress through that process. 2. Related research Human information behavior defines a broad category of human information seeking and user activities.
While early research focused on the IR system, more recent research has focused on IR from the user X  X  per-spective. A key element in the user X  X  interactions with IR systems is that of relevance judgments. The common
IR system evaluation measures of recall and precision are based on underlying relevance judgments that match terms in documents with terms in queries and have come under increased scrutiny recently ( Saracevic, 1975, 1995, 1996; Su, 1994 ).

Recall and precision measurement techniques commonly use binary relevance judgments (the document is relevant or not) and do not take into account the multi-faceted nature of user relevance assessments. Early studies by Belkin and Kwasnik (1986) and others acknowledged the role of  X  X  X he user X  X  situation, problems, goals X  X  and how these might require different  X  X  X anking rules X  X  ( Belkin &amp; Kwasnik, 1986, p. 11 ). Schamber,
Eisenberg, and Nilan (1990) followed by examining various approaches to relevance judgments. They noted that there are various views of relevance: topical, user-oriented, multi-dimensional and cognitive. The topical approach to relevance is the legacy of early IR systems using the  X  X  X est match X  X  approach. Saracevic (1975) notes that this topical approach had more to do with the mechanics of early IR systems than with goals of improving recall or precision. Current topically based search engines generally perform poorly when measured by precision and recall and suffer from other user satisfaction problems ( Kobayashi &amp; Takeda, 2000 ).
Saracevic notes that relevance is a  X  X  ... complex human cognitive and social phenomenon ... . [which] is elu-level, an output level and a user and use level. Saracevic points out that some IR researchers feel that a par-adigm shift is needed to move from one level to another to correct these evaluative problems. Saracevic, how-ever, insists that these evaluative distinctions are valid and that synergistic research should continue on all of these levels.

Cosijn and Ingwersen (2001) built on the work of Saracevic (1996) and others to develop a revised table of identified are topical, cognitive/pertinence, situational/utility and socio-cognitive. These are categorized as affective relevance (from Saracevic, 1996 ). Saracevic (1996) notes that relevance assessments (inferences) are strongly influenced by the affective level. These affective manifestations of relevance represent expressions of cognitive changes so it is not surprising that they can be associated directly with the relevance criteria 1998; Park, 1993 ).

Cosijn and Ingwersen (2001) emphasize that  X  X nteraction X  as an attribute of relevance is dependent on time indicating that as a user progresses through a search process, affective relevance manifestations may change. context and inference) through the cognitive changes wrought by interaction. Cosijn and Ingwersen note that it p. 544 ). Theoretical work by Mizzaro (1998) also makes this observation and studies by Vakkari (2000), Spink, Greisdorf, and Bateman (1998) and Wang and White (1999) provide some confirmation of this influence.
If the interaction of time and affective and cognitive aspects of the user can affect relevance judgments, then relevance can be considered situational . This definition defines relevance as composed of the user X  X  perceptions of the document X  X  importance to their information need and is multi-dimensional (varying among users), dynamic (varying over time) and complex but systematic ( Borlund, 2003; Schamber et al., 1990 ). This concept of relevance has been embraced by a number of researchers and provides a perspective of relevance suitable for information science research ( Borlund, 2003; Borlund &amp; Ingwersen, 1998; Harter, 1992; Saracevic, 1996; Wil-son, 1973 ) and will be used in this paper. For purposes of this study, relevance judgments are defined as the process of a user evaluating a document or document representation as being relevant or not relevant to their information need using a categorical scale. Relevance criteria are those factors that contribute to the user X  X  relevance assessment.

Schamber et al. (1990) also note the importance of cognitive changes of the user and renew the emphasis on situational relevance as identified by Wilson (1973) . They encourage closer examination of  X  X  X nternal cogni-tions X  X  and suggest that an approach which is holistic and dynamic is required to improve searches. The authors propose future research to examine criteria used by searchers in relation to  X  X  X nformation seeking and use situations X  X  and the consistency of those choices ( Schamber et al., 1990, p. 773 ).

A holistic approach to information retrieval implies the recognition of the search process as dynamic and multi-faceted, thus involving multiple steps in an extensive cognitive process. Studies including Kuhlthau (1991) shifted the focus of study to the user and examined the information search process (ISP) from the per-spective of the user. Kuhlthau built upon previous studies and developed a model of information seeking which identified cognitive and affective aspects of information seeking. The information search process was identified as a  X  X  X eries of encounters with information X  X  which ultimately result in  X  X  X  transformation of infor-mation into meaning X  X  ( Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 361 ).

Recent research has continued to examine the ISP as a dynamic, multi-faceted process where a user X  X  sub-jective evaluation of relevance varies. These studies have created relevance assignment categories which reflect the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of the ISP and have yielded several classifications and groupings of relevance.

Barry and others ( Barry, 1994; Barry &amp; Schamber, 1998; Park, 1993 ) have studied the subjective evaluation of relevance and have identified a number of relevance criteria. Barry (1994) performed a study with a com-bination of students and faculty who were questioned at length about the selection of documents during a search process. The results of the study identified 23 categories of relevance with numerous criteria within these categories. These criteria applied not only to the information content of the document, but to subjective aspects of the document interpretation such as the user X  X  beliefs and previous knowledge, and to contextual factors such as other sources of information in the environment and the user X  X  situation, and the quality of the source of the document (reputation, visibility, authority). This research helped to clarify the relevance assessment process and provided additional insights into the cognitive processes involved.

Park (1993) reports on a study of 10 subjects including a cross-section of college faculty, doctoral and mas-ters students across several different disciplines. Subjects were asked open-ended questions concerning their information-seeking context such as the problem-area, the stage of research, the expected result, and the selec-tion of citations. The author reports on a number of qualitative factors concerning the study and identifies several criteria consistent with Barry (1994) .
 A later study by Barry and Schamber (1998) combined the data collected from the Barry (1994) study with
Schamber X  X  previous research of 30 users in three occupational fields. Despite the diversity of subjects X  back-grounds, there was consistency in the criteria selected by the groups in the two different studies. The authors X  intention was to consolidate and provide additional analysis on their individual research efforts. Despite this narrow focus, this study represents one of the most comprehensive in this area of information science research.
Su (1994) sought to examine the measures of recall and precision and as part of the process analyzed users X  criteria for evaluation of the success of their search yielding 26 success dimensions used as relevance criteria.
Schamber and Bateman (1996) used results of the Su (1994) study and studies by Schamber (1991) and Barry (1994) in an attempt to reduce and synthesize the number of relevance criteria used and produce a measure-ment instrument involving user X  X  relevance criteria. Subjects performed a series of sorting tasks using criteria.
The authors note that some subjects had a problem with negative applications of criteria and appeared to have underreported that in their results. There were also some inconsistencies in the sorting possibly based on sub-ject X  X  unfamiliarity with terms. The results, however, provided some indication that users understood the con-cept of relevance criteria and could understand and use categorizations of those criteria.

Xu and Chen (2006) conducted a relevance criteria study using a subset of the criteria identified in previous studies in an attempt to find the core criteria used by searchers in making relevance judgments. The authors identified five such criteria: topicality, novelty, understandability, reliability, and scope.

Tang and Solomon (1998) performed a naturalistic study of the search behavior of a single user. The researchers focused on examining the mental model of the subject as they progressed through a search in a series of sessions and identified a number of common relevance criteria choices. Tang and Solomon (2001) conducted additional relevance criteria studies using both laboratory and naturalistic approaches. Researchers worked with a limited number of relevance criteria consistent with previous research and sought to identify patterns in the user X  X  selection of clusters of criteria.

Maglaughlin and Sonnenwald (2002) performed a study in which 12 graduate students examined 20 doc-uments and identified relevant passages in each document. The criteria of  X  X urrency X  was eliminated from the reported results, but it is reported that nine participants indicated that they wanted current documents, so for 75% of the sample (9/12), a total of 180 documents, currency is in fact an implicit relevance criteria.
The results identified 29 relevance criteria consistent with previous research. 2.1. Relevance criteria in relation to the ISP
That relevance is multi-faceted and the ISP is a multi-stage process is reflected in the current body of infor-mation science research. A few recent studies have investigated how relevance behavior changes according to stage in the ISP and related characteristics of the user X  X  situation.

Tang and Solomon (2001) compressed the search process into two stages: evaluation of document surro-gates and evaluation of full-text documents. The laboratory experiment results showed a change in use of rel-evance criteria choices moving from the two stages for the criteria of clarity, importance, newness, recency, topical focus, topical relatedness.

Vakkari (2000; Vakkari &amp; Hakala, 2000) studied relevance criteria choices of students during a term-long project, and found systematic differences in those choices. Results from these studies suggests that users iden-tified more documents as relevant early in the search process and identified fewer relevant documents later in the search process. The authors speculated that this change in relevance assessment may be due to the users store of knowledge improving during the search process and the users being more discerning in relevance judg-ments as their store of knowledge improves.

Spink et al. (1998) examined the relationship between user X  X  relevance judgments and the user X  X  information problem and information search process. Partially relevant documents appeared to be more important in the early stages. More knowledge and better focus on a problem, potentially gained during the search process, meant the users were more likely to judge items  X  X elevant X  instead of  X  X artially relevant X  later in the search process.
 Wang and Soergel (1998) studied the use of documents by subjects for the duration of a research project.
They identified a number of relevance criteria and assessed them along five dimensions (epistemic, functional, conditional, social, and emotional). They identified  X  X pistemic value X  as the primary relevance criteria dimen-sion to which all other relevance criteria are related. The researchers identified a number of the relevance cri-teria found in previous studies and used their results to formulate a model for decision making in the document selection process.

Wang and White (1999) conducted a long term study of searching using ISP stages identified as  X  X  X electing, X  X   X  X  X eading X  X  and  X  X  X iting X  X . Researchers identified topicality, novelty and recency as the most commonly selected relevance criteria and added a new topic of  X  X  X ognitive requisite X  X  (the ability to comprehend a document).
Researchers also indicated that subjects tended to select more documents as relevant than they actually used and subjects applied more diverse relevance criteria in later stages with the  X  X iting X  stage showing the greatest variety of selection criteria.

Hirsh (1999) also reports changes in relevance criteria with topicality being less important in later search stages. The subjects for her study were younger (ages 10 X 11) than in the other studies reported but results are similar to those of other researchers and suggest changes in the search behavior of users in later search stages may be a result of the accumulated effects of the search process.

Yuan, Belkin, and Kim (2002) examined the relationship between Anomalous States of Knowledge (ASK) and relevance criteria and identified several relationships between relevance criteria chosen and ASK types.
These studies examined relevance criteria choices and to some extent relevance criteria choice changes during the ISP This project continues the research of relevance criteria choices and is intended to increase understanding of information behaviors by examining the relationships of relevance criteria choices during the
ISP using statistical methods to provide additional insights into these associations. 3. Research questions
The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of how users X  perceptions of relevance change as they move through the ISP. Given that the ISP is dynamic and involves progression through various cog-nitive stages, assessments of relevance should also change. These assessments of relevance should be reflected in different relevance categories assigned to documents. Information on how those assessments might change and how they might relate to the selection of a particular document for further study will be provided by answers to the following research questions: 1. What are the relationships between assignment of relevance categories and the information search process? 2. What types of relevance are important to users and when are they important as part of the information search process? 4. Methods
This project used the data set collected in Cool, Belkin, Frieder, and Kantor (1993) . This study used a con-venience sample of approximately 300 undergraduates taking an introductory computer science course at a US university. Students were required to write an essay on a topic of general computer science interest using at least five sources. As students evaluated each potential source, they were instructed to fill out a questionnaire about the document (see Appendix ). The students were asked to specify when (date and time) they considered the document, whether they thought that they would use it for their paper (No, Yes, Don X  X  know), and to give as many reasons as they could that explained why they made that decision. The students were also asked to specify where they were in the process of completing the paper, at the time of judging each document. Thus, these data provide the following, with respect to the purposes of this study: relevance judgments 1 for several documents with respect to a single project; a set of reasons for each relevance judgment; a rough indication of where the person was in the project completion process at the time of making the relevance judgment.

For the purposes of this study, 40 randomly selected student responses were selected from the data collected for the 1993 study, yielding 330 survey entries, an average of 8.25 documents judged per student (or, alterna-tively, per essay).

Since the goal of this study was to examine relevance category assignments in relation to ISP stages using statistical techniques, relevance categories which were as detailed as possible were required. Our goal was to build on the original preliminary 1993 study adding additional details from other relevance research which considered categories of relevance criteria. Cool et al. (1993) performed content analysis on their data and identified six facets of criteria for judgment of usefulness. The values in the facets are examples of the factors students identified as impacting their decision whether or not they planned to use a document in their papers (which we interpret as whether the document is relevant) These facets, and examples of statements which were coded as isolates or arrays within them, are shown in Table 1 .

In order to generalize beyond the analysis of Cool et al., and in particular both to take account of other empirical research on relevance criteria, and to make as specific a list of criteria as possible, we used the relevance categories identified by Barry (1998) and Barry and Schamber (1998) to augment the categories (i.e., values in the facets) identified by Cool et al. (1993) .
Our goal in this study was to analyze the incidence of as many distinct relevance category concepts as pos-sible but yet provide a usable content analytic coding scheme. Where categories between the sources appeared to overlap, one category was chosen for our analysis. We were limited in this effort by two factors. One was the relevance category judgments reported in our sample; if a relevance category was not reported by the subjects, we could not analyze its frequency in our analysis, except to indicate a zero value. This appeared to be the case with a number of the relevance categories reported by ( Barry, 1998 ). Our selection of relevance categories was also limited by the type of analysis performed. While Barry (1994, 1998) and Barry and Schamber (1998) reported the results of interviews where relevance judgments were discussed at length, our relevance judgments were limited by the self-reported descriptions provided by subjects. These descriptions were often brief and limited in scope. Others overlapped or used distinctions which could not be determined with the information available. The result of this merging process is the set of category codes listed in Table 2 , together with their source(s). While this is not an exhaustive list, we did feel it was an adequate and meaningful list of category codes for our sample. Our study was exploratory and intended to apply empirical analysis to the interactions of relevance and ISP stage; an extensive and exhaustive list of relevance category codes was not required to perform this statistical analysis.

In the coding process relevance choices were not treated as mutually exclusive. It was quite common for subjects to provide multiple expressions of relevance criteria in their relevance assessments. Additionally, cat-egory code assignments could be both positive assessments ( X  X  X he book is specific X  X ) or negative assessments ( X  X  X he book is not specific X  X ). In either case the document relevance code assigned would be  X  X  X pecificity X  X .
The stage in the ISP was identified on the survey instrument as the question  X  X  X ow far along are you in doing your assignment? X  X , giving five choices: picking a specific topic, learning about the topic, formulating your thoughts, writing the paper, something else (please specify).
 These stages correlate closely with Kuhlthau X  X  stages in the ISP ( Table 3 ).

All codes listed here were nominal measures. Statistical analysis was therefore limited to appropriate cor-relation techniques for nominal to nominal comparisons. Coded entries were expanded to allow for the multi-ple relevance criteria assessments for a single document by users. Descriptive and non-parametric statistical analysis was then applied to the results to evaluate the interaction between user relevance assessments and the user X  X  progression through the ISP. 5. Results
The first author was the primary coder of the data concerned with the relevance criteria chosen by the sub-ject; the stage in the ISP was reported directly by the subject on the form they submitted with their paper.
A Cohen X  X  Kappa reliability assessment was performed on the relevance criteria data with two independent coders each of whom coded a 10% sample of the units with the results computed as .30, considered a fair strength of agreement ( Landis &amp; Koch, 1977 ).
 An evaluation of the descriptive statistics generated from the sample revealed patterns in the data collected.
The counts of the relevance categories coded for the study as shown in Table 4 reveal that for this sample, subjects most often chose  X  X  X pecificity X  X  of the document as a relevance criterion. The second most common choice was  X  X  X eneral topical X  X  and the third most common was  X  X  X epth/scope X  X . (Note that the sums of the count column in Table 4 exceeds the number of survey documents analyzed since many surveys identified multiple relevance categories for a single document.)
The students X  identification of the  X  X  X here they were in the search process X  X  was most commonly identified as  X  X  learning about the topic X  X  as shown in Table 5 . The second most common was  X  X  formulating your thoughts X  X  and the third most common was  X  X  writing the paper. X  X  Subjects in this sample rarely chose  X  X  picking a topic X  X  as a stage in the search process.

The cross-tabulation of the relevance category assigned to the document and the subject X  X  stage in the ISP reveals some patterns as shown in raw counts in Table 6 and the in-group percentages in Table 7 (relevance in the  X  X  X earning X  X  stage but does not seem to have the same level of importance in later ISP stages. In later stages,  X  X  X epth, X  X   X  X  X cope X  X  and  X  X  X ource novelty X  X  are more commonly selected as relevance criteria by the sub-jects of this sample. These descriptive statistics point towards a trend and provide suggestions on areas of anal-ysis, but a more sensitive statistical analysis is required to establish significance.

Our analysis of the frequencies of Table 6 begins with an assessment of the strength of association between the subject X  X  stage in the ISP and relevance category chosen. Correlation coefficients are normally calculated for this purpose. Since we are working with categorical data, we calculate the correlation coefficient phi prime ( U 0 ) square ( Agresti, 2002 ) which gives a point estimate of the variance accounted for in predicting relevance category chosen from subject X  X  stage in the ISP.

For Table 6 , U 0 2 = 0.077 which indicates that subject X  X  ISP stage accounts for about 8% of the variance observed in the relevance category chosen. This is an indication that relevance category chosen is clearly a complex phenomenon which depends upon many variables, one of which is the subject X  X  stage in the ISP.
We believe the value of this coefficient is small in relation to the full process of the relevance decision, with the stage in ISP accounting for only 8% of the relevance category chosen. But this small value is due to the multi-dimensional nature of relevance which identifies numerous other variables which impact relevance deci-sions. Since our research is exploratory we do not require high coefficient values to provide suggestions for associations. We believe the values reported here point towards potential associations between relevance cri-teria category choices and ISP stage.

By examining the fractional U 0 2 values in each cell, we can identify dichotomies in Table 6 which have pre-dictive power. For example, the Source Novelty-Writing cell has the largest U square statistic for the 2  X  2 contingency table which collapses all row cells except Source Novelty and all col-umn cells except Writing is 9.93 which is significant at the p = 0.00163 level. The direction of the prediction is that subjects in the Writing stage choose Source Novelty as a relevance category more often than we would expect if we assume Source Novelty and Writing are independent (no relationship). Table 8 shows the dichot-omies representing the five highest fractional phi-square values (five largest amounts of explained variation) along with the level of significance of the resulting chi-square statistics.

Interest was chosen more frequently than expected under the assumption of independence in the Picking stage versus all other stages. Recency was chosen more frequently than expected under the assumption of inde-pendence in the learning stage versus all other stages. Specificity was chosen more frequently than expected under the assumption of independence in the learning stage versus all other stages and less frequently than expected under the assumption of independence in the Writing stage versus all other stages. 6. Discussion
Our results indicate that for this sample, the learning stage involves selection of documents which not only contain specific information on their topic, but were recent. These results may be partially influenced by the searches these subjects were conducting. The topics assigned were within the computer field where technology changes quickly, therefore recency (currency) of the document or text about the technology would be a part of the students evaluation process.

During the ISP stage of Picking, the subjects X  interest in the document appears to play a role in their selec-tion process. Once a subject has determined that a document is on topic, it is this interest that appears to be a significant part of the decision on whether or not to proceed further with the document.

During the Writing stage the novelty of a source appears to influence the subject X  X  decision whether or not to use the document. This could be because the subject has accumulated a number of documents on his/her topic and then as they prepare to write their paper, they look for documents that would add to what they have already, and are thus new (novel) sources. In the Writing stage, we also find less interest in specificity (note that in content analytic coding this was interpreted as  X  X pecific to the topic X ). Again, this could be because the subject has already accumulated a number of documents and has learned the topic. We have evidence then that subjects are more interested in the presentation of the paper in the Writing stage than in the details of the content.

As to the question of what relevance criteria are important during the Writing stage our results point towards several possibilities. In-group percentages in Table 7 reveal depth/scope , informs , specificity and gen-eral topical to be common choices in this stage. This suggests that subjects may be rejecting documents (and choosing others) based on the depth/scope of the document, its ability to inform and its specificity (for their topic). Our results however only found specificity and source novelty to be statistically significant factors at the Writing stage. These results are intuitive; as subjects near the completion of their research, they seek new sources of information to fill remaining portions of their information gap. It is also intuitive that seeking a novel source involves some additional relevance criteria. Future research should pursue this area since understanding these criteria could improve later ISP stage searches.

These results provide some statistical confirmation for other studies which report variations in relevance criteria selection across ISP stages ( Hirsh, 1999; Tang &amp; Solomon, 2001; Vakkari, 2000; Vakkari &amp; Hakala, comparisons. 6.1. Limitations
Our results presented above may be limited by several factors. Many of the subjects responded to the open-ended questions concerning usefulness assessments with vague entries about topicality. It is possible that with different survey instruments using more specific survey questions a more diverse set of answers could be collected.

The sample used in this study was biased towards the undergraduate student population from which it was drawn. The Cool et al. (1993) study on which this was based expanded on this set of data and also examined the information seeking behavior of humanities scholars at a US university. According to the authors, the results of the scholars study contrasted with the results gathered from the undergraduate students. The under-graduate students were enrolled in an introductory computer science course and were most likely at the fresh-man or sophomore level of matriculation. It is possible that they were not experienced researchers and thus had more limited research skills than senior or graduate level university students. This fact is alluded to in
Cool et al. (1993,  X  X ummary of Results X ) where significant differences are cited between the two study groups in  X  X  X he kinds of decisions that are made and the categories used to support them. X  X  Further research should findings are generated from groups of subjects with different research skills. Further research should also use more specific instruments designed to capture relevance categories and assessments in tandem with ISP stage for both relevant and non-relevant documents. 7. Conclusion
This study provided results to support the contention that relevance is multi-dimensional and dynamic. We omon, 1998; Vakkari, 2000; Vakkari &amp; Hakala, 2000; Wang &amp; White, 1999; Yuan et al., 2002 ) also noted changes in relevance choices as users progress through the ISP. This study adds additional detail to those find-ings and provides some indication that relevance criteria choices are a significant part of these changes in rel-evance assessments. This study also suggests that the selection of relevance category varies as the user progresses through the ISP.

Results indicated that users X  relevance assessments are multi-faceted, with users identifying a variety of cri-teria beyond simple topicality for document selection. As reported previously in this paper, specificity, depth and scope of the document all play a prominent role in document selection and the selection of these criteria varies as the user progresses through the ISP. The selection of  X  X pecificity X  in the sample reported in this study appears to be important early in the ISP but diminishes in later stages. This finding is consistent with Vakkari (2000) , which also reports relevance category changes in later ISP stages. Vakkari reports that  X  X ovelty X  and  X  X nterest X  appear to be more important criteria later in the ISP, suggesting as this study does that the user has partially filled their information need and now seeks new or  X  X ovel X  information to add to the information collected in the earlier stages of the ISP. However unlike Vakkari (2000) our results did not show  X  X nterest X  to be statistically significant later in the ISP. Wang and White (1999) also report changes in relevance criteria in later stages but are not specific about the selection of these criteria, only indicating that they are more
ISP stages and that other criteria are more important to the user. These results are also consistent with Tang and Solomon (1998) who report that users appear to be more certain of the search later in the search process.
As applied to our results, we find that user X  X  being more certain of their search are thus more likely to look for source novelty and other criteria in their selection of documents.

This study provides some indication that the IR process is dynamic and the users X  relevance assessments change in measurable ways as they progress through the ISP. As others, e.g., Spink et al. (1998) , have pointed out, simple binary relevance assessments are inadequate measures of these changes. Understanding this pro-cess in depth is essential to the development of better IR systems. Future research should continue to focus on the cognitive changes of the user, examining relevance categories and ISP stages and the relations between the two, within the context of non-binary relevance assessments. Such research could provide a better understand-ing of the dynamics of the IR process leading to IR systems which are more adaptive to the users X  needs and provide greater user satisfaction.
