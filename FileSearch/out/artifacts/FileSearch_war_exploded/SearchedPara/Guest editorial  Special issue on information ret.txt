 1 Information retrieval for social media As is known to us all, media is an instrument on communication, such as newspaper, radio or video. Thus social media would be a social instrument on communication. Kaplan and Haenlein ( 2010 ) define social media as  X  X  X  group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content. X  X  The key difference between social and con-ventional media is the user relationships and activities. This clearly poses new challenges to traditional information retrieval technologies including:  X  Evaluation of item similarities . This is the key for information retrieval. In a social  X  Data scalability . In social environment, we not only care about the scale of the items,  X  Time sensitivity . Because of the participation of the users, information (e.g., breaking
We need to design new information retrieval technologies for social media that can handling the above challenges, and this is also the reason why information retrieval for social media emerges as a new hot research direction. 2 The special issue Recently, we started some activities to establish the platform for exchanging on data analysis for social media. We have successfully organized the workshop on social and behavioral networked media access (SBNMA) (Ramzan et al. 2011 ) held in conjunction with ACM Multimedia Conference 2011. This special issue provides a leading focused forum for timely, in-depth presentation of recent advances in algorithms, theory and applications on information retrieval for social media. The selected papers underwent a rigorous extra refereeing and revision process.

As we stated in the introduction, similarity evaluation is still the key to information retrieval for social media. The paper by Markus Schedl presents a systematic and com-prehensive evaluation of different term weighting measures, normalization techniques, query schemes, index term sets, and similarity functions for the task of inferring simi-larities between named entities, based on data extracted from microblog posts. The author analyzes different combinations of choices for those dimensions influencing the similarity calculation process, and investigates in which way they impact the quality of the similarity estimates.

Another important factor for information retrieval is query . Effective query manipu-lation will also affect the performance of social media retrieval. The paper by Dong Zhou, Se  X  amus Lawless and Vincent Wade presents a novel personalized query expansion method for retrieving social media. The query expansion is based on individual user profiles mined from the annotations and resources the user has marked. The underlying theory is to regularize the smoothness of word associations over a connected graph using a regularizer function on terms extracted from top-ranked documents. The experimental evaluations suggest that the proposed approach significantly benefits personalized web search by leveraging users social media data.
The paper by Wouter Weerkamp and Maarten de Rijke proposes to incorporate the credibility of information into the blog post retrieval process. Specifically, the credibility of information refers to its believability or the believability of its sources. Following the intuition that more credible blog posts are preferred by searchers, the authors explore the impact of credibility-inspired indicators on the task of blog post retrieval, and utilize the ideas from the credibility framework in a reranking approach. Experimental evaluation results show that credibility-inspired reranking leads to larger improvements over the baseline than combined reranking, but both approaches are capable of improving over an already strong baseline.

Topic model is an important tool for information retrieval. In social environment, it would be interesting to adapt conventional data-driven topic modeling to incorporate user information. The paper by Jingdong Wang, Zhe Zhao, Jiazhen Zhou, Hao Wang, Bin Cui and Guojun Qi proposes a social topic model to automatically recommend Flickr groups by simultaneously exploit media contents and link structures between users and groups. Their model can jointly discover the latent interests for users and Flickr groups and simulta-neously learn the recommendation function.

Automatic question answering is a hot research topic in information retrieval which has aroused considerable interests in recent years. Under the social umbrella, there emerges some specific interesting problems. The paper by Ian Wakeman, Simon Fleming and Dan Chalmers considers how to ask questions and retrieve answers using the wisdom of the crowd when people are connected together over ad hoc social networks. The authors focus on fully decentralised protocols using ant inspired tactics to route questions towards members of the network who may be able to answer them well. At the same time, both question asking and answering are plausibly deniable with privacy concerns. They show that it is possible to improve answer quality and also reduce the total amount of user attention required to generate those answers.

The paper by Tianyong Hao and Eugene Agichtein considers the problem of finding similar questions in collaborative question answering archives. They propose a precise approach of automatically finding an answer to the questions by automatically identifying  X  X  X quivalent X  X  questions submitted and answered in the past. Their method generates equivalent question patterns by grouping together questions that have previously obtained the same answers, and these patterns are used as seed patterns to match more questions to extract large number of equivalent patterns by a bootstrapping-based learning method. The learned patterns can be applied to match a new question to an equivalent one that has already been answered, and thus suggest potential answers.

The paper by Matteo Magnani, Danilo Montesi and Luca Rossi introduces a novel search paradigm for microblogging sites resulting from the intersection of Information Retrieval and Social Network Analysis (SNA). This approach is based on a formal model of on-line conversations and a set of ranking measures including SNA centrality metrics, time-related conversational metrics and other specific features of current microblogging sites. The authors compare their proposed approach with other methods on two well known social network sites (Twitter and Friendfeed) showing that the inclusion of SNA metrics in the ranking function and the usage of a model of conversation can improve the results of search tasks.

Sentiment detection is another research topic that is closely related to computational linguistics and information retrieval. It aims to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. In the Web 2.0 era, due to the expanding volume of available online information such as microblogging messages and review comments, automatic sentiment detection becomes more important to the success of modern e-commerce. In the paper by Dan Zhang, Luo Si and Vernon J Rego, the authors propose a novel method for joint modeling the sentiment space of different domains. Their proposed method is validated on the product review and twitter datasets.
 The last paper of this special issue, which is by Hanghang Tong, Spiros Papadimitriou, Christos Faloutsos, Philip Yu and Tina Eliassi-Rad, considers the problem of finding gateways in a large graph, i.e., find a small subset of nodes that are crucial in connecting the source to the target. For example, given a social network, who is the best person to introduce you to, say, Chris Ferguson, the poker champion? The authors formulate the problem in both Pair-Gateway and Group-Gateway scenarios, and show the problem is sub-modular and can be solved near-optimally. Moreover, the authors also make those algorithms fast and scalable, and validate them on real world datasets.

 Stephen Adams 1 Introduction Intellectual property (IP) management consists of all the processes linked to the recogni-tion, the publication and the exploitation of creations of the human mind. Patents on inventions are granted by 74 patent offices worldwide under the condition that the patent claims are new, inventive and show industrial applications. Information retrieval (IR) has been recognized as the computing field appropriate to aid in assessing the novelty aspect of the IP processes by proposing methods to search, compare and analyse patent documents.
Patents are complex search objects. They attempt to describe that most elusive concept, the  X  X  X nvention, X  X  in a manner that distinguishes it from what has gone before. Unfortu-nately for the inventor, many of the modern methods for communicating new technical information, such as video, animations, CAD-CAM displays or even, most recently, 3D printing, are little accepted within the patent system, with the result that many new patent applications struggle to render the details of a complex innovative product or process through the medium of the written word. The last 10 years has seen substantial improvements in the proportion of patents that has been digitised for electronic searching purposes, and this has made it possible, albeit a challenge, to introduce more information technology support into existing workflows. Indeed, professional patent searchers are still using X  X nd obtaining high-quality, reproducible results from X  X earch tools which have changed little over the last 40 years. With the exception of specialist techniques for handling 2D chemical and biochemical structures, current tools pay little attention to the complexity of patent text.

Patents play a major role in society as they are meant to encourage innovation and invention globally. As a consequence, companies are filing increasing numbers of patents in order to protect their intangible assets and the value of their research X  X fter a drop of 3.9 % in the number of patent application filings worldwide in 2009 compared to 2008, they have again been increasing by around 7.6 % in 2010, 8.1 % in 2011 and reached an increase of 9.2 % in 2012. This corresponds to an estimated 2.35 million patent filings worldwide in 2012 (WIP 2013 ).

The impact of IR on the economic world, through its influence on the validation and the enforcement of patents is potentially immense. Indeed, the whole purpose of defining the novelty of an invention is to be able to get a clear overview of the technological landscape at the date of the patent filing. IR offers the means to find and compare digital artefacts, in particular text documents such as patents. Not limited to text chunks, IR gives also the possibility to compare images such as technical figures or flowcharts, where inventions are explained. This gives an increasing role for multimedia IR in retrieving prior art docu-ments. Additionally, novelty is not limited to a country or a region. Access to collections of documents (scientific articles, standards, reports, and academic theses) through the internet offers today the possibility of getting a more comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art. Again, IR has played a fundamental role in society by breaking the language barriers in both the querying aspects and the understanding of the search results in different lan-guages. The state-of-the-art of IR for patents is described in a recent overview of patent retrieval (Lupu and Hanbury 2013 ).

In summary, patent retrieval and intellectual property specialists in the twenty-first century face many challenges. They must search very large numbers of documents expressing complex technological concepts through sophisticated legal clauses in multiple languages. Despite a great deal of theoretical development in IR techniques and machine translation approaches, advanced search tools for patent professionals are still in their infancy. IR still has a large potential to speed up and make more effective the whole chain of processes involved in IP. 2 The special issue Patent information retrieval is a cross cutting research area as it contains domains such as text retrieval, multilingual information retrieval, image retrieval, natural language pro-cessing, and text categorisation. This special issue presents research results on topics related to IR in the intellectual property domain in order to advance the current state-of-the-art of patent search tools. To the reader who may be unfamiliar with the challenges facing the patent world, this collection of papers is a good introduction to the range of issues which face both patent office and industrial searchers.
The previous special issue on patent processing was published in Information Pro-cessing and Management in 2007 (Fujii et al. 2007 ). A significant amount of work has been done in the area of IR in the intellectual property domain since then, spurred on by the evaluation campaigns and workshops held in the last 6 years, most notably:  X  The CLEF-IP 1 Evaluation Campaign (2009 X 2013). The main focus of this evaluation  X  The NTCIR 2 patent tasks (2001 X 2013). The tasks focussed on patent retrieval in the  X  The TREC-CHEM 3 Track (2009 X 2011). This track focussed on the creation of  X  The series of Patent Information Retrieval (PaIR) Workshops 4 (2008 X 2011), collocated Six of the papers in this special issue use resources made available by the CLEF-IP Evaluation Campaign. 3 Paper overview Seven papers were accepted for publication in this special issue after a thorough review by at least three reviewers each. These papers recognize at least two major factors which impact the work of the patent searcher. The first factor is the multimodal and multilingual nature of the data to be searched, while the second is the process of developing an appropriate strategy for searching the data, which includes query expansion and optimi-sation steps. Three of the papers consider the use of query expansion in improving patent retrieval results, while one paper considers the use of multiple query representations for the same purpose. The remaining three papers cover the areas of text categorization, image retrieval and multilingual retrieval for patents. We now briefly summarize the papers in this special issue, highlighting their potential contributions to advancing patent search in practice.

We begin by considering the papers related to search strategy. One of the main prob-lems in patent retrieval is vocabulary mismatch X  X n different patents, different words or phrases are often used to describe similar concepts. This is to a small extent due to a conscious effort on the part of the patent authors to make patents less findable, but mostly because patents represent technological advances for which the vocabulary is not yet fixed. For this reason, the use of carefully crafted lists of synonyms in queries to patent search systems is an important aspect of professional patent search. Three of the papers deal with the use of automated query expansion to solve the vocabulary mismatch problem. Note that query expansion seems to have the connotation that  X  X  X ore is better X  X  when developing a search string for retrieval, whereas professional searchers are aware that the optimum strategy applied to current search tools may often be quite concise: the most important step is choosing the most appropriate search terms, not simply identifying additional ones. The three papers in this category each use a different source of information for the query expansion: patent citation graphs, Wikipedia and query logs of patent examiners. The paper by Parvaz Mahdabi and Fabio Crestani uses the citation links in a pseudo relevance result set to build a topic dependent citation graph. The term distribution of the documents in the citation graph is used to build a query model, which is used to expand the original query. The paper by Bashar Al-Shboul and Sung-Hyon Myaeng uses primary and sec-ondary categories as well as titles of Wikipedia pages for query expansion, with a par-ticular focus on the use of phrases instead of words. Finally, Wolfgang Tannebaum and Andreas Rauber use query logs from patent searchers at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to create term networks of synonyms for several USPTO patent classes, which are then used for automated query expansion.

The paper by Dong Zhou et al. also examines manipulating the query to improve patent retrieval, but uses multiple query representations instead of query expansion. Three query representations are automatically generated from a query patent document and submitted to the same search engine. The list of search results produced by each query is treated as a collection of  X  X atings, X  which are analyzed using collaborative filtering algorithms and finally merged into a single document ranking.

Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is an essential tool for patent retrieval, as patent documents are written in multiple languages, and are eligible as prior art irrespective of the language used. The paper of Walid Magdy and Gareth Jones presents an adapted machine translation (MT) specifically designed for CLIR. As the translations of query text used for CLIR do not have to be morphologically and syntactically correct, an MT system is trained on text which has been pre-processed with stop word removal and stemming. This leads to a significant decrease in the MT computational and training resource requirements. This is a promising area, although the most pressing challenge for the professional searcher is in the Asian languages rather than French and German.

Patent categorisation is generally used to automatically place a patent into categories of a hierarchical patent classification system, such as the international patent classification (IPC) or the recently adopted cooperative patent classification (CPC). This categorisation has an application in patent offices to efficiently direct new patent applications to the most competent examiners. The paper by Eva D X  X ondt et al. examines the impact of concept drift over time on patent categorization accuracy, where a temporal mismatch between training data and newer patent documents to be categorized could lead to a deterioration in accuracy. It proposes methods for training data selection and combination of text repre-sentations to improve patent categorization. Eventually, such an approach could lead to better ways of retrieving from the older literature, which is still legally part of the state-of-the-art for every new patent search.

To achieve the necessary discrimination between a new invention and the prior state of the art, modern search must be able to take account of everything known about the content of the patent databases. One way forward is to develop better ways of exploiting the relatively small, but highly significant, volume of non-text information as part of the search process. There are situations where the key information is not in the text of the patent, but in the patent drawings, where it cannot be located by text retrieval approaches. The paper of Marc  X al Rusin  X  ol et al. presents a method for processing a specific type of patent image. It converts flowchart images into a structured textual representation that can be queried using text retrieval approaches or compared to each other using various metrics for structural similarity. 4 Conclusion This special issue presents seven papers proposing solutions to challenges in patent retrieval. The majority of the papers focus on the manipulation of queries to improve search results, with further papers covering the issues of cross-language retrieval, cate-gorisation and image search.

It is interesting to note that none of the evaluation campaigns in the intellectual property domain are still active. This is however not due to all challenges in this domain being solved, as is clear from the papers in this special issue and from the less than optimum results of the evaluation campaigns. The collections and tasks that are still available as a result of the evaluation campaigns continue to be a fertile ground for innovative devel-opments in Information Retrieval.

There are also some challenges in retrieval in the intellectual property domain that are not tackled by any of the papers in this special issue. This includes (Lupu and Hanbury 2013 ): information fusion to take into account in a unified way the patent text, drawings and metadata; federated search to allow searching of disparate sources of information that could constitute prior art; and collaborative search to take into account that patent searching is often done by a group of people, such as an information specialist collabo-rating with a technological domain specialist and a patent lawyer. It is also necessary to tackle the human factor in patent searching X  X hat point where searcher and machine combine.

From the searcher X  X  point of view, patent information exists primarily as a resource to inform commercial decisions. Research such as that described in this special issue could help ultimately to improve the accessibility of patent information to all interested parties. References
