 The KDD Cup is the oldest of the many data mining competitions that are now popular [1]. It is an integral part of the annual ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). In 2007, the traditional KDD Cup competition was augmented with a workshop with a focus on the concurrently active Netflix Prize competition [2]. The KDD Cup itself in 2007 consisted of a prediction competition using Netflix movie rating data, with tasks that were different and separate from those being used in the Netflix Prize itself. At the workshop, participants in both the KDD Cup and the Netflix Prize competition presented their results and analyses, and exchanged ideas.

There were two ta sks, which were developed in conjunction with Netflix and were chosen to be interesting to participants from both academia and industry. Both tasks employed the Netflix Prize training data set [2], which consists of more than 100 million ratings from over 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous cust omers on nearly 18 thousand movie titles. The data were collected between October, 1998 and December, 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received by Netflix during this period. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 (integral) stars.

Netflix has agreed to award a Grand Prize to the team with a system that can improve the accuracy of Cinematch by 10%. In addition, Progress Prizes are to be awarded annually to teams that produce the greatest accuracy improvements over a given 12-month period. This is referred to as the Netflix Prize competition. Additional details about the competition can be found in Bennett and Lanning [3]. As part of this competition, many interesting data mining techniques have been (and continue to be) explored and applied to the Prize data set. The workshop was initiated with the aim to bring together competition participants, as well as other researchers interested in the Netflix Prize problem, to exchange Prize participants were thus encouraged to submit papers describing their algorithms and e xperiences. After reviewing by the program committee, selected papers were presented in the workshop. Two papers from the top two teams at that time are included in this issue.

Tikk (Budapest University of Technology and Economics) The Netflix Prize competition has stimulated a great deal of high-quality research. With the aim of br inging some of this research to the workshop, we invited two sp eakers to present their recently-published work on the Netflix Prize data set. The speakers are Su-In Lee (Stanford University) and Andriy Mnih (University of Toronto), who each presented recent work based on their papers [4, 5] at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-2007).
