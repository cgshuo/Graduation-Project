The term know-how is generally used to refer to knowledge about how to accom-plish something effectively and efficiently. While it is widely acknowledged that a great deal of know-how is tacit, the body of literature in each technical domain reflects the cumulative store of the articulated know-how for that domain. Map-ping out the conceptual structure of a body of know-how facilitates learning about the domain. Practitioners can use a map to seek out solutions to prob-lems, and compare strengths and weaknesses of alternate solutions. Researchers can use a map to uncover gaps and guide research directions. In this part, we will introduce the notions and the benefits of know-how mapping.
 we discuss the desired properties from a knowledge mapping approach and ana-lyze potential approaches for mapping out know-how in light of the desired properties (such as Ease of Use, Expressiveness, Evolution, Reasoning, and Pro-cess Support). These approaches include literature review [ 4 , 5 ], classification [ 6 ], citation graphs [ 2 ], cause maps [ 3 ], concept maps [ 7 ], and claim-oriented argu-mentation [ 8 ].

The ME-map approach centres around the means-ends relationship promi-nent in goal-oriented requirements engineering (hence the name ME-map) [ 10 ], for depicting alternative solutions to problems and the trade-offs among them [ 9 ]. By visualizing and analyzing the structure of the body of know-how in a domain, one can discover gaps in knowledge (open problems with missing or inadequate solutions), thereby guiding research directions and facilitating the evaluation of the impact of research results. Synergies across domains can potentially be dis-covered by making connections across know-how maps, creating new solutions. The progress of knowledge over time can be visualized as an animation, as newly-invented methods and techniques are incrementally overlaid on top of the map of the existing body of know-how. We illustrate the approach and our experiences with examples from a number of areas in information system engineering, such as: variability in modeling business processes, architecture description languages, architecture documentation, agent-oriented software engineering, and data min-ing. We also outline research challenges for know-how mapping.
