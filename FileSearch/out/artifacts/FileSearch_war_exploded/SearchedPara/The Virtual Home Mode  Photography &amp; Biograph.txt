 In this paper, I describe an ongoing qualitative study into the collaborative production and social uses of snapshot photography in the context of modern user-gen erated content systems. Through semi-structured interviews and in -home observation, I examine how these everyday media practices support the biographies and well-being of the participants. I build on Chalfen's concept of the home mode media production to frame the set of users and social behaviors in this study, terming current analogous activities as the  X  X irtual home mode. X  In doing so, I contribute to the body of research investigating the rela tionships between technology and well-being, as well as providing rich description of user practices in the pervasive context of personal digital photography.

 photography, biography, home mode, well-being, user practices Persistent debates exist both in popular discourse and the academic literature about the relationshi ps between technology use and wellbeing, with little resolution in sight. [1]. In my dissertation research, I investigate these issues within a particular set of practices: personal and everyday digital photographic production and sharing. In so doing, I s eek to provide a more detailed description of the dynamics between technology and wellbeing within a more delineated context. I frame the activities and participants of interest to my study through use of anthropologist Richard Chal fen X  X  model of the  X  X ome mode X  of photographic production [2], as well as work that responded to this model. In Chalfen X  X  definiti on, the home mode is a form of pictorial communication that supports  X  X  pattern of interpersonal and small group communication cen tered around the home... This concept of mode allows us to place pictures, as symbolic forms, into a process of social communication. X  The scope of  X  X ome X  in this framing is that of a social context, not just a geographical one, denoting that such images serve familial functions rather than marketplace logic. The pictures of the home mode both rely on and serve the common ground that already exists with their subjects and audiences. The concept of the home mode also emphasizes that snapshot media serve not primarily as containers of information, but instead as both support for and a location of sociality. Through use of more recent literature on digital photography practices, I update and extend Chalfen X  X  model into a description of the virtual home mode (VHM) of personal media production, examining how the intimate symbolic space of the home is enacted in distributed and pot entially public online contexts, as well as the supports and complicati ons introduced by the networked condition. I draw a connection between the ev identiary and locative aspects of the home mode with the rich and broad literature describing biography, personal narratives and life stories [3], as well as literature describing biographical trajectory maintenance [4], and multi-faceted views of psychological wellbeing [5]. Each of these literatures underscores the need for individuals to build and maintain a sense of coherence and continuity in their biographies. Focusing more specifically on a St raussian sense of  X  X iography work X  [4], the research questions of this project are: RQ1) What practices and tactics do virtual home mode participants deploy in their biographical work? RQ2) How is VHM biography work impacted by the socio-technical contexts in which it takes place? RQ3) How does VHM biography work support participants X  sense of personal and familial wellbeing? I am approaching these issues through qualitative methods, with a specific goal of highlighting the participant X  X  view [6] of the virtual home mode. The context of th is work is the production, dissemination and social use of virt ual home mode media, as well as the meanings ascribed to these activities by home mode participants; I attend to activities in both physical and computer-mediated spaces. The primary data for this study c onsists of semi-structured in-home interviews and observation sessions , conducted with 23 individuals in Michigan and Ohio. Participants have been selected via purposeful sampling, recruiting individuals across a range of ages and life stages who have engaged in virtual home mode activities regularly for at least a year (sharing photos via systems such as Flickr, Facebook, Picassa, Twitpic, etc). I interviewed participants in the lo cations in which they engage in their photowork [7] (usually at home, though not exclusively so). I structured the interview sessions primarily through a series of photo-elicitation tasks, using the pa rticipant X  X  own photographs to contextualize and focus their responses. In addition to revealing general photography practices, the protocol highlighted decisions related to media production and shar ing, asking subjects to reflect on their life events of the past year, and the photographic representations of those life even ts. Interview and observation data has been analyzed via iterative open coding and qualitative memoing. I gathered further supportive evidence from content analysis of some participants photos and associated textual information, such as online conve rsation threads, titles, and tags. Due to space constraints and the descriptive nature of the findings, I will limit my discussion here to a brief summary of results for RQ1. Among my study participants, I was able to highlight five primary conceptual categories of biographical work. These categories should not be viewed as exclusiona ry, as participants often move fluidly between them, or engage in work that operates in parallel categories simultaneously. 1. Procedural work . The first category of work addresses the mundane but pervasive set of pro cess steps that pervades taking, downloading, sorting, editing, s earching, browsing, labeling and offloading. This includes what ot her research labeled as photowork [7], but is not limited to that. This set of practices must be considered biography work as they generate the necessary substrate for all the other more abstracted biographical work in the VHM. Strauss [4] illustrated this point in discussing the amount of invisible work that goes into many  X  X eisure X  activities; to enjoy a picnic, someone has to engage in the wo rk of making the sandwiches. 2. Representational management work . This second category of practices deals instead with th e work needed to manage the symbolic and informational asp ects of VHM photos. Representation management includes both the se lective creation of photographic representations, as well as some of the framing and interpretive cueing of those representations. Chalfen [2] emphasized the  X  X atterned inclusion X  and exclusi on of particular images found in the home mode. In my analysis, I argue that VHM representational practices are more meaningful viewed as a layer cake model, in that important work takes place at each stage of the photography process: in deciding what pictures are taken, which are saved, which are edited, which are shared privately, which are shared publicly, and so on. As with procedural work, this category is also necessary for all following work. 3. Connection work. While it was not surprising to find this work given the emphasis in the literature on social aspects of personal photography, the detail and scope of connection and communication practices in the VHM was interesting, as were their deeply contextualized character. For example, several participants presented examples of intenti onally leveraging their distinct common ground with different sets of viewers so as to transmit multiple concurrent messages via the same image. Other examples emphasized how deeply personal mean ings could be read into banal photos (such as food pictures), gi ven the appropriate contextual framing. Participants also displa yed a wide range of communication expectations. Some treated photos as information-laden messages, while others shared as a lightweight form of intimate co-presence [8]; some were highly focused on reciprocal interactions, while others expected no feedback from their audience(s). 4. Introspective work. In addition to the memory process that we traditionally associate with pers onal photography (also a form of purposeful work, involving not just the recall of memory, but reconstituting and recreating it), I found many examples of mindfulness and attentional practices , particularly during the taking and organizing of photos. For exam ple, one participant discussed how photographing his son X  X  soccer games caused him to  X  X ee X  in a new and more detailed manner, changing his perception of the events. Other participants were clearly using their organizing work as a form of personal symbolic cu ration for their life experiences. It was interesting to note the strong pres ence of this internally directed work in a context that so many have underscored as fundamentally social and communicative. 5. Interest/Hobby work. More contingent than the others, this category of work illustrates the common uses of photo practices in service of other interests (hobby, cr aft and serious leisure activity), which in turn serve biographical practices. For example, participants engaged in activitie s such as ham radio building, baking, knitting and scrap-booki ng all discussed how their photography allowed them to documen t their projects, contribute to dispersed communities of interest, convey personal pride of accomplishment and serve as a point of inspiration and reference for future projects. The work in this category often generated mutually supportive cycles with both connec tion and introspection work. As this research project proceeds to completion this fall, I am using these work categories to organize the findings in RQ2 and RQ3 as well. Ultimately, I use my analysis of this particular setting of the virtual home mode X  X  site of technologically mediated creativity and communication between small groups of intimates X  X o argue that our conceptions of technology and well-being should be viewed through the lens of ecological affordances [9] rather than deterministic relationships. I l ook forward to the opportunity to discuss this and future research with the mentors and participants of the Group 2010 doctoral colloquium. [1] Shklovski, I., Kiesler, S. &amp; Kraut, R. E.
