Precision ( P ) is the fraction of the retrieved documents that are relevant documents that are retrieved: relevant documents that are retrieved (see Egghe, 2004 ).
 Proposition 1.1. Let ality) and the fraction of retrieved documents. Then we have the following four equations: other ones follows the same lines.

Now, using the two equations in (7) or (8) , we trivially have the following corollary: Corollary 1.2. For any IR system and any query we have the equation for 0 &lt; P, R, F, M &lt; 1.

We now pose the question: given four numbers x , y , z , u such that any value larger than 1  X  one can even take x = y 6  X  z = u ).
In other words, we have a natural necessary condition that but less trivial than the converse, described in the previous section.
Theorem 2.1. Let the numbers x ; y ; z ; u 2 0 ; 1  X \ Q be given such that other orders of the measures P, R, F, M. In general we can say that we have
Proof. Since x ; y ; z 2 0 ; 1  X \ Q we can write x  X  x 1 x &lt; x 2 , y 1 &lt; y 2 , z 1 &lt; z 2 . Rewrite documents of our IR system) such that
For ret we take ret  X  X such that (since x 1 &lt; x 2 , y 1 &lt; y 2 and z 1 &lt; z 2 ) of which we choose (since x 1 &lt; x 2 ) relevant documents in ret . Hence we already have that
For rel we add to the x 1 y 1 z 1 points in j ret \ rel j , x and hence
Note that
Define hence we add (by (24) and (26) ) construction.

Check also that agreeing with (18) . It is clear from (25) that All choices have been made: everything is fixed now, but we still have to pove that
This is where (13) comes in. (13) implies hence
But, using (21), (23) and (27)
