 1. Introduction
There are many digital resources to support humanities scholars that are either currently available or under development (e.g. AHDS, 2006; Intute, 2006 ). This introduction of digital resources is changing the ways that scholars work. However it has been suggested that many of these digital environments have been designed and developed using predictions based on  X  X  X ocal experience, anecdotal evidence and good intentions X  X  ( Wilson, 2003 ), rather than formal user requirements research. The traditional physical library has been built up on cultural traditions spanning two thousand years and has been described as  X  X  X he humanists X  laboratory X  X  ( Bur-chard, 1965 ): the library materials of the humanities scholar are often their research objects. If digital and physical resources are to be developed to complement each other, their different properties and potential values and uses need to be well understood.

In this paper we highlight these often-implicit qualities, reporting from a recent set of interviews with humanities scholars as well as drawing from the literature. We then highlight what can be learned from these findings in the development of future digital resources designed to support their research activities. 2. Background physical and digital libraries. Finally in this section, we present a brief overview of work comparing the phys-ical and the digital in other domains. 2.1. Digitisation and access
There are many advantages to digital resources that support the information needs of scholars and these have been widely reported in the literature (see Lesk (2005) for a comprehensive overview). In particular they often with additional facilities that enhance our interaction with the materials and allow us to engage with artefacts in more advanced ways (e.g. full text search).

A physical collection may be unique, or of national or international importance, but only available to a limited number of researchers. The process of digitization can bring acclaim to a collection and its host insti-tution, thus providing an opportunity to promote itself and its resources to a wider community ( Youngs, 2001 ). An institution may also wish to showcase a new technology in the hope that it will draw such interest, manner that emulates the real world interaction  X  it looks as if one is actually turning the pages on the screen ( British Library, 2007 ).

Viewing the digital version of a rare artefact physically housed in, for example, the British Library online may be an attractive alternative to travelling to London and following various bureaucratic processes in order
Library, as reader has to have first consulted the available surrogates, including published facsimiles and microfilms. Obtaining a Reader X  X  Pass involves providing proof of identity and passing through a number of security procedures in order to see the original that would take place under careful supervision. A further uates such requests. In this example, interacting with the digital surrogate may be far less inconvenient and expensive for the researcher.

Deegan and Tanner (2002) claim that digital formats are favoured over their analogue counterparts because they provide immediate access to items that are in high demand, they allow easier access to individual com-ness, colour contrast etc.:
Dalbello (2004) discusses how digitized collections can facilitate reproduction and multiplication at the same time as removing objects from the context of the traditional library. This can reduce an object X  X   X  X  X ura X  X  as a unique item of a particular time and context. In discussing her own study of a range of digital  X  X  X rude and elicit what may be called picturesque voyages that allow for episodic engagement with the mate-rials X  X  (p288). Wood (2000) argues that often the digitisation of a rare artefact can actually enhance the mys-tique and  X  X  X ura X  X  of the physical object, increasing the requests for access to the original; she cites the example of the digitisation of the Domesday Book, which led to such increased demand for access the ori-ginal that it had to be removed from the search room of the Public Records Office. Indeed the archivists X  steps to restrict or prevent access by imposing  X  X itualistic actions X  serve to increase the object X  X  value, gen-erating further curiosity and enhancing the object X  X  uniqueness and mystique. Wood X  X  paper explores the reasons behind many objects held in archives being fetishised, asking,  X  X  X hat is the difference between infor-mation and the medium on which that information has been inscribed? Is the nature of information such that man will be satisfied to receive it in surrogate form, and then not care if the original is discarded? X  X  (p20).

Liu (2006) reviewed the literature on peoples X  perceptions and preferences for print and electronic resources and carried out his own survey of graduate students at San Jose State University. He found that reading pref-erences and the use of print and electronic resources vary among different disciplines although the categori-sations offered in the paper are too broad to distinguish the humanities subjects from other disciplines. His results echo those of other studies that have identified a shift towards the use of electronic resources and the World Wide Web as a first stop for addressing scholars X  information needs. He notes that an entire gen-eration is growing up with new technology, and this may have implications for their expectations of and pref-erences regarding the choice between digital libraries and traditional libraries. Liew, Foo, and Chennupati (2000) Sathe, Grady, and Guise (2002) found from their surveys that participants preferred electronic journals over print journals for such commonly cited reasons as improved searching capabilities, links to additional resources, currency, availability and ease of access and printing. Wilson (2003) reported that continuous 24 h access in the comfort of one X  X  home is gaining considerable popularity, as is demonstrated by university faculty and students preferring remote use of online information to handling print editions within the geo-graphical constraints of the library. Within many of these studies the distinction between journals and books can become a little blurred. 2.2.  X  X  X f we build it they will come X  X 
Despite the advantages of digital media outlined above, there has been lower take-up and use of many dig-ital repositories than their developers anticipated. This is often explained by reference to the mantra  X  X  X f we build it they will come X  X , a quotation from the movie  X  X ield of Dreams X  which has been widely adopted by the digital humanities community. As Michel (2005) explains;  X  X  X his has been a guiding principle behind much ent, so critical an aspect of our cultural heritage, that if people were only aware of the existence of such resources they would flock to us as magi following the star of Bethlehem. Our job was to create the guiding star, and if they in their blindness cannot find the star we will transport the manger virtually to their door-step. X  X  (p386). Likewise, Wilson (2003) suggests that for the most part many projects are developed as  X  X  X e build it, hoping people will come, without knowing what we are building, or precisely who will be coming X  X  (p19).

Jones, Gay, and Rieger (1999) suggest that  X  X  X f we build it they will come X  X  may have been a sufficient model of user interests and behaviour in the earlier days of digital libraries, but modern times require us to proac-tively address the needs and challenges presented by libraries X  intended users. Additionally, Warwick, Terras,
Huntington, and Pappa (2006a) remind us that many projects have been publicly funded to deliver digital resources for use by humanities scholars and, whilst some are well known, others have been relatively forgot-ten, suggesting that this may be a waste of intellectual effort and public funding. Their research with human-ities scholars suggests that it is not the lack of knowledge of what resources are available but perceived shortcomings in resource quality and fitness for their research purpose that deters users from employing digital tion of an object that satisfies the needs of every researcher. 2.3. Presentation of the artefact digitally
Transferring three-dimensional objects to two dimensions through digitisation can limit a user X  X  engage-ment with that object because, for example, of the quality of images and limitations of screen size. Indeed, when using images for academic research, the scholar needs to know whether the image is a faithful reproduc-tion or whether it has been enhanced or altered in any way ( Frost, 2002 ). Before the advent of digital ought to see the originals ( Burchard, 1965 ). Many modern digitisation projects go to great lengths to repro-duce an artefact as a true surrogate. For example, in 1998, Octavo produced a digital version of the 1896
Kelmscott Edition  X  X  X orks of Geoffrey Chaucer X  X  that was intended  X  X  X o reduce, rather than increase, requests the layout of the double-page spread, the grain of the paper, and the faint colour and impression of printed matter visible through the paper ( Hansen et al., 2003 ).
Deegan and Tanner (2002) remind us that there are many methods for encoding, storing and retrieving dig-manence of some digital data. For example, the BBC X  X  Digital Domesday Project suffered a setback as data became unreadable after just 15 years when the technology required to play the video storage disks had become obsolete ( Schofield, 2003 ). The original physical copy remains readable almost one thousand years after its production. Yet in order to make the information accessible online, the National Archives was forced (1999) have shown. 2.4. Presentation of the artefact physically
The study of history is described as being  X  X  X nabled through access to artefacts of earlier times and people-and many areas of scholarship, research and education could not be carried out without access to physical objects X  X  ( Furuta, Marshall, Shipman, &amp; Legget, 1996, p. 109 ). Such objects are intrinsically impermanent and susceptible to change through use as well as from the surrounding environment. As a physical object is unique, it can only be in one place at a time, and culturally collection managers will seek to restrict access to the object: preservation versus access ( Forde, 2005 ). A digital representation of the physical object frees it from the shackles tying it to one place and if borrowed it does not make it unavailable to anyone else.
A traditional library (or museum) as a place allows us to experience its space and content, to absorb surround-ing ambience and encounter real objects, perceive scale, texture and true colours as well as ignite other senses such as sound and smell. Chu, Y, Bainbridge, and Witten (2004) acknowledge that the handling of the physical book may be an  X  X  X njoyably exquisite X  X  part of the information seeking process whereas the experience of the same vein, one of our Postgraduate students described her experiences of using the original manuscript for
Alice X  X  Adventures Underground (that went onto become Alice X  X  Adventures in Wonderland). This rich description gives us an excellent insight into the almost ethereal qualities of her experience of the physical when compared to the digital.
A recent report on peer review of digital content in the arts and humanities ( IHR, 2007 ) even found scholars recommend that instructions for authors in journals should insist that digital editions are cited, as a means of increasing the acceptance of digital resources as respectable sources. 2.5. The physical and the digital in other domains
In other domains, such as computer science, medicine and education, researchers are developing an under-standing of the relationship between the physical and the digital.

Stelmaszewska and Blandford (2004) studied the behaviour of a group of computer scientists whilst using a physical library. They focused on how they interacted with artefacts, evaluated them and interacted with librarians. Their study highlighted the fact that the library metaphor is limited in terms of how experiences can be transferred from the physical to the digital environment. Users X  experiences of using paper, books, shelves and other tangible media are different from those of using computer keyboards, screens and other tech-nology designed to facilitate interaction with digital information. One important theme from this study is that the digital library is not a simple replacement for the physical one, but affords different experiences and sup-ports different interactions with research materials.

Equator was a six-year interdisciplinary research collaboration across several UK institutions that sought to address technical, social and design issues in the  X  X  X evelopment of new inter-relationships between the phys-ical and the digital X  X  ( Equator, 2007 ). One Equator study looked at the library of Early Women X  X  Literature at
Chawton House, England ( Halloran, Hornecker, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Weal, 2005 ). Working alongside the curators, they designed new visitor experiences involving technology-enhanced interactions using portable devices and flora and fauna or how the environment influenced the works of Jane Austin. They looked at ways of devising different experiences to different groups of visitors that could be facilitated by different organisers (school teachers, curators etc.).

Another important theme concerns the quality of the fit between system design and user practices. Fitzpa-trick (2000) reported in her study of paper records in healthcare settings how these are embedded in the social, spatial and organisational milieu of the hospital. Based on these findings she suggests that the design of tech-nology for healthcare should start with the question  X  X  X ow do we support clinical practice? X  X  which requires that we understand more about that practice.

To design digital resources that support humanities scholars, we need to better understand their research are usually invisible to librarians (and designers). Early and constant engagement with potential users is vital in order to better understand their expectations in order to serve them more effectively ( Giersch, Klotz, &amp;
McMartin, 2004 ). To this end, an interview-based study has been conducted with humanities scholars, as reported below. 3. Methodology
The aim of the study was to better understand the research experiences of humanities scholars and to investigate how other services, people, tools and artefacts fit into their scholarly work. This should inform the design of tools to support those research practices, and our goal was to enable this knowledge transfer.
Interviews were arranged with humanities scholars in order to map out their research working practices and in particular their information seeking practices. Data were collected using open-ended questions as set out in
Appendix A . These questions were intended to cover key aspects of how humanities scholars carry out their research, and their experiences of interacting with physical and digital resources.

The sample of scholars was one of convenience: some participants were contacted directly (e.g. through being known by a member of the project team), while others responded to a request for participation that was circulated via departmental offices. In addition, four Postgraduate students were contacted through the faculty members who responded. Confidentiality was assured, and each participant was assigned a code according to the order of the interviews. Outline profiles of participants are provided in Table 1 . Interviews were conducted between July 2005 and April 2006, were face-to-face and at the participant X  X 
Institutional place of work. The same researcher was the interviewer at all sessions. Interviews were captured using a digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim. They were systematically analysed by two independent researchers, each iteratively working through transcripts, coding the data and identifying and cross-relating key themes. The approaches used were based on thematic analysis techniques described by Wetherell, Taylor, and Yates (2001) and Wong and Blandford (2002) . 4. Findings and discussion
Three main themes relating to issues of physicality and the digital emerged from the data, and are the focus of this paper. These were: the working environment; finding things; and working with artefacts. For clarity of reporting, stumbling and hesitations have been removed from the illustrative quotations where they do not carry any interpretative meaning, and names of people and places have been anonymised by replacing them by codes. Participants are referred to by the participant codes listed in Table 1 . 4.1. The working environment
Participants reported placing great store by the importance of, and problems of, places such as libraries, auction houses, book fairs, and spaces provided to support their work. All participants offered opinions and preferences on a variety of working spaces within places, predominantly major libraries.

The first, and perhaps most obvious, aspect of the working environment is how easily it enables the scholar to access the required materials. For example, the Buddhist scholar had carried out his postgraduate degrees and post-doctorial research in London and Oxford, both homes to ancient Buddhist texts. Travelling to work with these texts was relatively quick and cheap whilst living and working in the UK. Now he is geographically displaced from these physical items and relies on photocopies, and is working in an institution with signifi-cantly less funding opportunities to travel to work with other texts within the Asian region.
The majority of scholars interviewed for this study were based in London or Cambridge, arguably privi-leged geographical locations in terms of resources that are easily available to them to work with. This partic-ipant had come to the UK from New Zealand and commented:
One striking reminder of how a researcher X  X  geographical location affected the way in which they worked was highlighted by the Australian scholar interviewed. He reminds us how, not that long ago, being geograph-ically dislocated from his contemporaries in Europe and the US slowed down access to materials and commu-nications within the research community.
This scholar had moved to Australia. This is a significant geographical distance from Europe, their original research focus. This change in working environment meant a shift in their research focus, keeping within
European themes but concentrating on the history of Colonialism in Asia. So now his new geographical posi-tion allowed him easier access to Asia than had they been based in Europe or the US. He describes, when asked about technological advances changing the research experience for a modern researcher, how having access to these physical working environments is still a desirable part of being a humanities scholar:
Of note were scholars describing electronic resources as a benefit in that they do not have to constrain themselves to being there. Carrying out much of the research at home or in the office is now possible:
The issue of access, and the improved access provided via the Internet, was a source of palpable pleasure to many participants. For example, participant 12 noted:
Similarly, participant 4 recalled the time when access had first become possible to remote library catalogues:
However, the contrast between physical and digital access is not based solely on the ease of access. Expe-riences of working in particular places can be viewed both positively and negatively. Here is an account of one researcher X  X  experiences of a variety of spaces that highlights both disdain and passion for them. This particular excerpt follows on from the participant explaining how he enjoyed buying a book and taking it home to read, rarely enjoying working in the library. When asked if he had ever enjoyed working in the library:
Similarly, another participant regarded a particular library as  X  X retty good X , but nevertheless commented that the space available to work within it seemed to engender a dark and gloomy ambience. Here is a descrip-tion of the participant X  X  time researching at a US institution and being asked what the resources were like:
In contrast, the same participant considered another library environment to be very conducive to working despite problems accessing some of its resources. This is the same library ( X  X  X  X  X ) that participant P2 described views of what might constitute a conducive working environment. Also of note is the enthusiasm P14 the respondent commented on how the environment can affect the research experience, contributing to  X  X eeling like a real historian X  alongside an original ancient text: Another academic offered an account of the value of the broader working environment on a research trip to
France. His physical presence in the country, his immersion as it were, allowed him to make connections that sparked his interest and eventually became a book. Being remote from the physical place in this instance would not have allowed for these connections. This was drawn out from a conversation where the participant talked of feeling less  X  X mmersed X  in a digital library:
Another common theme raised within the context of descriptions of their working environments was that of a sense of community, and its importance to the experience of being a humanities scholar. When asked about the difference between using electronic and physical texts this scholar offered:
An attribute of the physical library is that it is possible to meet people face to face, whom as the researcher here reminds us, one might not meet by any other means except by physically being in that particular place.
Relationships are often forged with librarians, archivists, book specialists and colleagues locally and globally with similar interests. When asked what qualities of the research experience would be taken away if it was solely electronic the participant replied:
This researcher explains that individuals that work in these places can influence whether work in a partic-ular area will be done, and how the relationship, for example with an archivist, is very important in the devel-opment of the scholar X  X  work. This extract follows on from a comment made about some UK city archives being more helpful than others and being asked whether this was a level of resistance that has to be faced in his/her work:
While community is developed in an obvious way through physical interactions, some participants were also aware of the value of online communities, particularly through the use of specialist mailing lists:
To summarise: three important aspects of the working environment were found to be the way the environ-and the ways in which particular environments support the development of community. Both physical and dig-ital environments have the capacity to provide positive and negative experiences, albeit in different ways. 4.2. Finding things
A typical library has designed its physical space to allow its users to wander around sections and explore the contents of the open stack shelves. Many of the researchers interviewed described hours, if not days, of this browsing activity. This is achieved by becoming familiar with library environments and the activity of brows-ing. Several scholars described early interactions within libraries as daunting or intimidating. For example:
Problems are often encountered with inconsistencies between institutions and how different electronic resources operate. There are often differing cataloguing systems between libraries and similarly differing func-tionality and presentation across a range of digital libraries. Here, for example, a library shelves some resources in an unconventional manner due to physical space restrictions. An advantage of electronic resources is that physical  X  X pace X  does not present the same sort of concern.
In terms of learning how to find materials in the library, scholars reported that there had recently been an increased emphasis on research skills training: these observations were offered by scholars across institutions.
When asked whether she had been taught how to do research this scholar replied:
Another scholar commented that colleagues, in particular the supervisor, were the traditional source of acquiring research strategies whereby being in the presence of somebody more experienced allows you to absorb this knowledge:
One of the main skills is the  X  X  X rocess of learning to discriminate X  X  (P3) and this is increasingly important with the growing amount of information available via the Internet, which has speeded up the process of acquiring background information for research and of becoming familiar with works and authors that may be relevant. This is, of course, helped by ...
It is important that scholars gain a level of familiarity with their library environments. The physical envi-ronment lends itself to browsing, As well as browsing the shelves, there is a style of browsing through the card catalogue: the recognition afforded by printing on cards was regarded by some as an advantage, particularly if they were not sure how to spell a particular term:
The physical organisation of most libraries lends itself to the chance for serendipitous encounters, because other resources in close proximity have strong potential to be relevant to their inquiry. When this scholar was asked how she knew about journals in her research area, she commented on the visibility of these sorts of resources in the physical library and suggested that it is perhaps now harder for researchers who work in elec-tronic environments that lack these physical cues:
The grouping of documents in the physical library is regarded by many as a definite advantage. For example:
The physical sense of being surrounded by, even immersed in, books creates a sense of possibilities, of ser-endipity where discoveries can be made, apparently by accident. Serendipity was mentioned as being valued by several participants. For example, participant 2 highlighted the value of serendipity in physical libraries and antiquarian book shops:
Participant 10 explained one of the important roles of serendipity in inquiry:
While most participants linked the experience of serendipity to interacting with materials in physical spaces, one highlighted the possibility of a different kind of serendipity in digital spaces:
One marked contrast between the physical and digital libraries in terms of serendipity is that, whereas par-ticipants were generally comfortable being surrounded by books that were of greater or less relevance to them, the analogous experience in a digital library was viewed by most as being unmanageable. For example:
The sheer volume of information that is, in principle, readily available can lead to another challenge in rela-tion to research practice  X  namely, balancing information acquisition with other aspects of research. One par-ticipant offered the following opinion whilst discussing the impact of electronic resources on humanities researchers today, that perhaps more time is spent chasing resources that reading them:
Conversely, when the user knows what material they are looking for (in a focused search), digital libraries are much less prone to temporary disorganisation that disrupts the search than physical libraries are:
Requests to libraries for documents are almost exclusively carried out online, which reduce the physical space required for paperwork as well as speeding up the processes. Here is an example of a small reference book being replaced by online information. In effect this means that the information required is no longer con-fined to one physical space (the book), which can be lost or left behind, but is now distributed and available anywhere there is an active Internet connection:
In summary, physical and digital libraries are perceived as offering different possibilities in terms of finding information. On the whole, physical libraries are perceived as better supporting serendipitous and browsing libraries give access to a greater body of material, and better support focused searching. 4.3. Working with artefacts
Even in the experience of findings documents, there is often a tactile aspect of the physical library environ-ment that researchers enjoy. The traditional card catalogue system offers a different means of searching the library X  X  stock compared to the typical digital interrogation required of an electronic database catalogue sys-tem. When asked if he had found the card catalogue easier to use than the computer catalogue:
This theme of the value of being able to touch and feel materials emerged in other interviews. Many researchers are interested in the materials used to make up their sources, for example: Participant 2 laid store by the additional information implicit in the material properties of the historical artefact:
Davis-Perkins et al. (2005) raise a similar point in relation to the archiving and use of historical photograph loses information  X  X  X hrough manipulation and accidental loss X  X  (p. 282) which makes the resources of less value to specialists.

As well as the additional information embodied in physical artefacts, the sense of authenticity was reported as being important to many participants. Here is a description of the lure of medieval manuscripts that
England had available to a researcher from another country when asked if they were wanting to come to Eng-land to work on a specific project:
Although digital copies often attempt to replace the need to see original material, interaction with old and original artefacts is one of the pleasures many described.
The scholar here refers to research that was predominantly carried out in a prestigious library. This was perceived to be  X  X  X eal, real research X  X  and implied here is a kind of exclusivity in that not many other people would have accessed these resources and that is a feeling that you do not get online. Here he has been asked whether he feels he has benefited from his earlier experiences in physical libraries:
Another scholar described the  X  X uzz X  of handling ancient documents, but once that experience has been had, fact. Here the participant was asked to describe what a good experience in the library would be other than finding what he came in for. The reliability of the information in digital surrogates was a concern raised by several of the participants.
Common criticisms aired in the interviews concerned accuracy, quality and credibility of electronic resources.
Human input errors would seem to be the most common complaint. When asked if using electronic resources has changed the way he thinks about research and whether the experience of carrying it out is better or worse, participant 1 responded:
The value of the physical, printed book or journal is deeply embedded in the scholarly culture of the humanities, to the extent that scholars still appear to rate printed items more highly than digital ones as objects of study. The participant below, when asked whether citing electronic versions of texts caused any they are more reputable in scholarly terms.
There was also criticism that some humanities digital library projects are too expensive and exclusive, with a narrow user base, badly thought-out and poorly maintained. Another complaint levelled at some electronic resources is apparent glitches in the software X  X  performance. These occurrences are usually system errors or examples of system behaviours that were unexpected, illogical or plain wrong, as illustrated below by partic-ipant 5 when she was asked why she did not like a particular library X  X  online catalogue:
Users were also frustrated by an inability to adequately search a digitised resource; as a result, using the physical resource might in fact be quicker in some cases:
Another problem that faces developers of digital resources for the humanities is deciding which edition of a text to digitise. For example, it was relatively common for manuscripts to have annotations that may or may not have been reproduced in printed form. Some scholars were frustrated that the most suitable edition for research purposes had not always been chosen. Although variorum editions such as the Canterbury Tales Pro-ject and the Internet Shakespeare Editions Project do exist, most commercial publishers choose to digitise a single first edition because of copyright constraints. This may not suit the needs of users however,
The most common use of electronic resources of digitised physical objects (e.g. books and other scholarly work) reported in the interviews was as a convenient reference tool, for example, enabling quick access to a particular quotation (that may then be checked against a physical copy).
However, it is too simplistic to suggest that scholars must either use physical or digital resources. Below is an example of how a researcher, having seen the original physical documents, was able to use the electronic pox and cowpox that were likely to be different descriptions of the same thing. This meant he was able to inter-act with the electronic version more effectively than if he had not seen the original artefact: Finally, and unsurprisingly, the physical properties of paper and screen were raised by several participants.
Many interviewees described an unwillingness to read for long periods from the computer screen, opting to send them to their printer. These findings are in keeping with those reported by King and Montgomery (2002) and Liu and Stork (2000) . Many people search or browse digital documents and then prefer to print them out for an in-depth reading. They find it easier to have several sources out in front of them from which to work. Such physical copies allow cross comparison and hand written annotation on these documents. When asked what digital libraries s/he used:
However, printed copies of documents lack the distinctiveness of the originals than allow one to discrim-inate easily between them. Participant 4 describes the benefits of taking notes from an original rather than relying on printing out a copy and taking it away to work on at a later time. This describes how the physical constraints of the library and its resources can actually make the researcher more efficient. Printing off reams of A4 paper means that different resources can be collected (in this example, within a binder) but they lose the individual characteristics of the original source material. Furthermore it can prove more difficult to search through annotations and highlighted text than through notes  X  X icking the most important things out X  at the time. This may suggest that the researcher has a deeper engagement with these original materials than the dig-ital copy or a printout of it. Here the participant is answering the question of what online resource he valued highly:
To summarise: it was found that participants in this study value the physical properties of original docu-of working with originals were all cited. In many cases, though, digital surrogates were recognised as having value provided that they are reliable, easy to use, and match the scholars X  needs (e.g. regarding which editions are available in digital form). 5. Discussion
It became clear in this study that humanities scholars are very aware of the details of their information environment and its affordances. As we have found with other user groups ( Makri et al., 2007 ), they are capa-ble of constructing very complex mental models of physical information environments. The literature also shows that they need a great variety of types of information, and are thus adept at finding the ideal piece of information from a wide range of sources ( Stone, 1982; Watson-Boone, 1994 ). This suggests that they are likely to be able to employ the same skills in a digital realm, making them very perceptive but potentially very critical of the digital information landscape. They are thus a very demanding user population for which to design. Here, we review what has been found, from the literature and from this study, and identify some implications for the design, deployment and maintenance of future digital resources as they relate to their physical counterparts.

There has been great enthusiasm for digitisation of historical documents, the research material of many humanities scholars, and substantial resources have been invested in digitisation projects. As noted above (Section 2 ), digitisation holds out the promise of making such documents readily accessible to a broader pop-ulation of readers and scholars, and also raising the profile of the hosting library. However, the literature reports some apparently contradictory outcomes of digitisation:
Rather than reducing demand for accessing physical originals, digitisation has been found to increase demand for such access.

In some cases, people have been found to prefer electronic to print journals, because it improves access and enables remote working.  X  X  X f we build it they will come X  X  has been found to be, in many cases, a fallacy, with many digital resources having limited use.
 Poor image quality in digitisation can cause people to engage less well with digital documents. Even when only the digital document has been accessed, it is the physical document that is cited.
The uniformity of digital presentations (particularly printouts) can make them less engaging than interac-tions with physical originals.

The media used (paper, books, shelves, etc. or screens, keyboards, mice) afford different kinds of interactions.

The study reported here has confirmed many of these findings, but also established a richer set of relation-ships between the physical and the digital for humanities scholars.

The focus of this study was on the library as the  X  X  X umanist X  X  laboratory X  X   X  i.e. focusing more on their use of documents as objects of research than on their use of the research literature (typically reported in mono-graphs and journals) within their specialist areas of interest.

If digital documents do not offer any added value (e.g. being searchable or annotatable) then their only advantage is that they are accessible from many places at any time (regardless of whether or not someone else is using the same document at the same time). This accessibility does mean that scholars can effectively have a features that make  X  X  X orking in the library X  X  an experience that is differentiated from other kinds of work. The physical library evokes a range of (often strongly expressed) emotions, from delight to despondency, depend-ing on the way the design is perceived by users. The activity of going to the library is usually viewed as being tedious and mundane, except where that library is in a novel and interesting location, in which case going there augments the experience of doing research.

Borgman (1999) recognises that libraries provide information  X  X  X n behalf of a community of users X  X  (p.231), but the physical library is also a place in which people (both scholars and archivists) meet by virtue valuable contacts for exchange of ideas and information via the Internet; there is scope for further develop-ments to support on-line communities based around shared interest in particular digital artefacts or closely related documents.

The primary ways of finding materials in digital and physical repositories are different: the physical orga-ital documents are more easily searched for. The context of digital documents is often lost, in that closely related documents are not apparently any  X  X earer X  a retrieved document than those that are completely unre-lated. New means of browsing in digital libraries could improve scholars X  perceptions of serendipity when working with digital documents. Better representation of aggregate works ( Buchanan, Gow, Blandford,
Rimmer, &amp; Warwick, 2007 ) would also help set digital documents within their original context, improving the potential for understanding that context and locating related materials.

Physical libraries provide staff that often have valuable knowledge of the institution X  X  archiving and can help researchers find pieces of information that would be harder, or even impossible, to locate without their aid. It is known that a lot of electronic resources are poorly maintained after a project has been completed ( Warwick, Terras, Huntington, Pappa, &amp; Galina, 2006 b ), and that this can damage the trust a scholar has in electronic resources. Perhaps more digital libraries could provide a contact to someone with a good knowl-edge of the resource in order to help with researchers X  questions. Understanding the navigation of both phys-ical and electronic environments can take time. At least interaction at a human level allows you to ask questions and get immediate feedback.

Original documents will always have an authenticity and  X  X  X agic X  X  about them which cannot be replicated by digital surrogates. They will also be inherently more reliable (in the sense that they are not copies, and so cannot have  X  X rrors X  introduced through modern reproduction processes). Trust in digital surrogates was high-lighted as an important issue, and there is a clear need to ensure quality production and ongoing curation of digital resources.

There has been a long tradition of attempting to substitute the  X  X ld X  technology of paper with a  X  X ew X  digital substitute ( Sellen &amp; Harper, 2002 ). Lancaster (1978) predicted that electronic information systems would replace paper-based systems in the sciences by the year 2000. Despite these claims not proving entirely true, it is becoming increasingly common for physical objects to be replaced by digital versions. Our study provided no evidence that access to digital surrogates reduced demand for access to physical originals. The power of the physical book as a cultural object of study is as strong today as it was when Flanders (1997) discussed such issues, despite the far greater number of digital surrogates that are now available to scholars. As Duguid other, but may instead be complementary, depending on the task in hand. The art of the designer is then to be able to recognise when this may be the case and develop new resources accordingly.

This study has highlighted the complementary roles that physical and digital documents can play in sup-porting research, provided that the digital copies are sufficiently faithful reproductions, easily searched for and worked with. Scholars value the efficiency gains from being able to locate and interact with digital resources, which can save time before visiting a library that may be quite a distance from home.
The value of well designed physical libraries, as places to study and interact, must not be underestimated, and it seems likely that they will continue to colour the experiences of humanities research. Physical interac-tions, with both the artefacts and the library that houses them, encourages a deeper engagement with the mate-interconnected and easily accessed, can further enrich those experiences, but should not be regarded as simple substitutes for their physical counterparts.
