 Blog/news search engines are very important channels to reach information about the real-time happenings. In this paper, we study the popular queries collected over one year period and compare their searc h results returned by a blog search engine (i.e., Technorati) and a news search engine (i.e., Google News). We observed that the numbers of hits returned by the two search engines for the same set of queries were highly correlated, suggesting that blogs often provide commentary to current events reported in news. As many popular queries are related to some events, we further ob-served a high cohesiveness among the returned search results for these queries.

Search engines dedicated for blogs and news enable users to reach the most up-to-date information. Very often, the Figure 1: Top 20 queries with highest frequencies popular queries submitted to blog/news search engines serve as good indications of the information needs of web users at the time of searching. In this paper, we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati ( http://www.technorati.com/ ), a well-known blog search engine, over one year period. We then compare the search results to these popular queries returned by Technorati and Google News ( http://news.google.com/ ), the latter is a popular news search engine. The results from the two search engines represent the information provided by bloggers and journalists respectively. For each query, the search results are studied from two perspectives: (i) the number of hits, and (ii) the cohesiveness of the returned results. Such an analysis will facilitate many web/text mining tasks, includ-ing trend analysis in blogosphere, event detection, etc.
Without the access to query logs of commercial blog/news search engines, we chose to collect the popular queries pub-lished by Technorati. From 08 Nov 2006 1AM to 30 Nov 2007 10PM, we crawled the top 15 most popular queries 1 from Technorati every 3 hours. Each of the 15 popular queries was extracted and submitted to two search engines, i.e., Technorati and Google News. The number of hits and the top 50 results from each search engine were recorded.
Among the 46,545 popular queries scheduled to be crawled in the given period, we managed to collect 44,594 (or 95.81%). We missed some queries (and their search results) due to oc-casional network/power outage and errors in query extrac-tion due to page format change. Note that, the same query may be popular at various time points but were evaluated multiple times as the search results could be different at each time. After punctuation removal (e.g.,  X  X econd life X  becomes second life ), the number of distinct query keywords is 1530.
The query frequency of a popular query is defined by the number of its occurrences in our dataset. The distribution of popular queries with respect to their query frequencies is plotted in Figure 2(a) with log-scale axes. It is observed that 63% of queries have query frequencies smaller than 10 and a small set of queries appears to be popular for fairly long periods. Among the latter, youtube has query frequency of 2766, being popular for about 346 days over the 388 days covered by our dataset.

The top 20 queries with the highest query frequencies (see http://www.technorati.com/pop/ Figure 1) can be broadly grouped into three categories: web-site , person name ,and topic/concept .
 Almost half of the top 20 queries, i.e., YouTube , MySpace , Google , Bebo , Facebook , StudiVZ , Joost , Second Life ,and Twitter , are websites providing services mainly on social-networking, sharing, searching, and gaming (see their cor-responding articles in Wikipedia 2 ). Quite a few top queries are person names, including Ron Paul , Paris Hilton , Noelia , Galilea Montijo , Britney Spears ,and Tammy NYP .Prob-ably because of their popularity, articles about them have been created in Wikipedia. Many of these persons became popular due to some events in which they involved (e.g., presidential election for Ron Paul ). A few queries are top-ics/concepts, such as Web 2.0 , video ,and music , suggest-ing that many users are interested in the discussions among bloggers on these topics. Finally, iphone is a product re-leased in 2007 which received much public attention;  X  X tube X  may refer to (i) a misspelt  X  X outube X , or (ii) the lawsuit case between utube.com and youtube.com.

Compared to the top 20 most popular queries for Blogdig-ger.com reported in [1], the major differences in our obser-vation is the large number of websites among top popular queries. All these websites are highly dynamic in nature. Web users may want to discover through blog search  X  X hat other people say X  about these websites or the popular top-ics discussed at these websites (e.g., an interesting video surfaced on YouTube). Among the 1530 distinct popular queries in our dataset, many are named entities and are event-related, which is consistent with the earlier observa-tion [1]. For instance, harry potter (for the release of the book), saddam hussein (mainly for the execution video), and Windows Vista (for the release of the software).
Figure 1 also reports the average number of hits when each query was submitted to Technorati (TR) and Google News (GN). It is interesting to observe that, the numbers of hits from TR and GN are highly correlated (coefficient = 0.965). The average numbers of hits for all queries against their query frequencies are plotted in Figure 2(b). Similarly, high correlation (coefficient=0.798) between the numbers of hits is observed for all popular queries. That is, if a query (e.g., a person name) receives high coverage among news, it is likely to be mentioned by a large number of blog posts. In other words, many blogs provide commentary or additional information about current events. For a given query, the number of hits from TR is always larger than that from http://en.wikipedia.org/ GN, as shown in Figure 2(b). The large number of input sources (i.e., millions of blogs traced by TR) could be the reason.

Observed from Figure 2(b), queries having high query fre-quency do not always lead to more hits from the two search engines. For TR, queries having query frequency in the range from 40 to 160 have higher probability of receiving small number of hits compared to other queries. For GN, many queries having query frequency larger than 40 match very few news articles. One possible reason is that such queries are related to some bursty events lasting for only a short period. At the time of searching, an event maybe in its very early stage with few blog posts (or news arti-cles) matching it. It is also observed that some queries are less covered in news articles despite their popularity. For instance, among the top 20 most popular queries shown in Figure 1, 4 of them, i.e., Galilea Montijo , StudiVZ , utube , and Tammy NYP , have less than 10 hits on average from Google News.
Given a query searched at a particular time, the cohe-siveness of its search result is defined by the average cosine similarity between each of the 50 returned documents (i.e., the snippets) to their centroid. Figure 2(c) plots the aver-aged cohesiveness of all queries having the same query fre-quency. On average, results from GN demonstrated higher cohesiveness than that from TR. For GN, the search result cohesiveness for queries having query frequency between 40 and 160 are higher than others. Recall that most of these queries are likely related to some bursty events. The results returned are therefore similar to each other, as most of them report the same event. Comparing the same set of queries, Figure 2(c) shows that the topics discussed in blog posts are much more diverse than that in news articles.
In this paper, we report the o bservations made from pop-ular queries published by Technorati over one year period. The search results to these popular queries returned by Tech-norati and Google News are compared by examining the number of hits and the cohesiveness of the returned doc-uments. Our observations include: many of the popular queries are event-related; there exists high correlation be-tween the numbers of hits returned from Technorati and that from Google News for these popular queries.
