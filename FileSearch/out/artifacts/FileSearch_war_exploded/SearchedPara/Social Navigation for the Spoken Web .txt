 { robfarr, rajarshi, cdanis}@us.ibm.com This paper describes our experiences deploying a recommender system for a mobile phone-based knowledge sharing application to farmers in rural India. Users of the system record questions and call back for answers left by other users and experts. We used collaborative filtering to derive relevant content for each user based on historical navigation pa tterns of the community. An empirical analysis of behavioral and interview data reveals key issues for future mobile r ecommender systems in developing regions of the world.

Recommender systems for movies, books, and music have enjoyed popularity on the Web for many years. In contrast, recommender systems for voice-driven applications have received relatively little study. In this work, we explore how to improve mobile phone-based navigation of audio recordings delivered through an interactive voice response (IVR) system using collaborative filtering (CF). We present our work as a case study of what is, to our knowledge, the first recommender system to be fielded in a rural, developing region of the world. We designed and implemented a CF system that sequences audio recordings based on the historical pattern of users X  navigation through these recordings. We deployed this system to farmers in a developing region in rural India, gathered feedback, and analyzed log data. Based on this experience, we identify several issues for future IVR-based recommender syst ems in developing regions of the world. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. A case study of the fielding of one method of collaborative 2. The details of how a collaborative filtering algorithm with 3. An outline of issues that need to be considered when building The rest of this paper is organize d as follows. We first discuss the problem of audio navigation and review existing solutions and their limitations. Next, we motivate the work, introduce the design and implementation of our reco mmender system, provide details of the field trial, and discuss so me of the issues that surfaced during the deployment. We conclude with a discussion of future directions. Audio is a linear medium that affords only slow, sequential access [10]. Thus, a good way of navigating to individual audio resources would be valuable. Unfortunate ly, existing audio retrieval algorithms generally perform poor ly with low-end cell phones in noisy environments and require a speech model often not available for many of India X  X  hundreds of native languages. Another method of locating relevant resources is social navigation [4]. CF can be used to enable social navigation by recommending audio resources or other items ba sed on ratings provided by peers [7]. Some CF systems use implic it ratings inferred from user behavior. Claypool et. al. [1] tested various implicit rating indicators of interest using We b pages and found that dwell time on a page positively correlated with the user X  X  interest. Schafer et al.[13] review the key concepts of CF. Some researchers have built CF systems for recommending audio resources e.g., [9] but these syst ems do not use implicit ratings. Numerous recommendation system s have been deployed on mobile phones (e.g., [12]) but none have addressed the problem of audio navigation. Moreover, none of these systems have been deployed in developing regions. The IBM India Research Laboratory has created a platform for voice-based applications called the Spoken Web (SW) [8]. The SW can be used to create an interconnected network of hosted  X  X oice sites X  (similar to web s ites) accessible from any phone. Our work focused on Avaaj Otalo (AO) (meaning  X  X oice stoop X ), a SW voice site hosted by the De velopment Support Center (DSC) in Ahmedabad, India [11]. A farmer can use AO to review archived radio programs, liste n to announcements or use the question and answer (Q &amp; A) forum to post new questions or browse existing questions and answers. After listening to a question, users can listen to the answers (if any) or provide an answer. If a user posts a question, he can call back later to see if it was answered. Agricultural experts from the DSC can record  X  X xpert answers X  and the farmers themselves could provide  X  X ser answers X . A sample interaction is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: A sample Spoken Web (SW) dialogue Users were limited to a linear path from the question to answers and then to the next question, with no ability to filter or search. The most recently posted questions appeared first. The AO voice site was deployed December 24, 2008 and was expanded to hundreds of farmers in four major farming regions of Gujarat. By February 1, 2010, the linear path through the Q &amp; A forum was 1,925 menus deep. Users complained about poor quality recordings (e.g., noise), non-farming (e.g., singing) content, and questions about crops they do not grow posted by farmers from other regions. Many users requested something be done to present them with only inform ation that is useful to them. In August of 2009 we started to build a recommender system for the AO voice site. The resulting system, the Social Navigation System (SNS), integrates directly with the SW to fundamentally change the voice menu navigation. Figure 2 shows the major components of the integrated system. The call flow assembler (A) uses a database of linked audio content (B) to generate a call flow (C) for the IVR (D) (initially in the default recency order). As the user navigates the IVR, call flow statistics (H) are logged and reported to the SNS. The CF component (E) uses the call flow st atistics to build a user profile of the caller (F) that it stores in the SNS database (I). The CF component retrieves a use r X  X  profile and generates recommendations (G). Figure 2: Software Architecture Given recommendations, the call fl ow assembler can build a call flow that leads to the recommendations by using the database of linked audio content. The user profile is a set of imp licit ratings of audio items based on listening time. We define an a udio item as a three-tuple of a uniform resource identifier (uri) for an audio resource, a reputation level and a resource type . In AO, there are two levels of reputation ( X  X ser X  and  X  X xpert  X ) and two resource types ( X  X uestion X  and  X  X nswe r X ). The implicit rating of the current user u and audio item y is given by: the duration is below a threshold t . We set t to 2 seconds (an average time before the next input.) The term t( y ) is the total time needed to play y . This normalizes listening time relative to the length of the recording and log-normalizes repeated accesses to the same recording. s( y ) scales the rating by reputation level and resource type. Neighbors( u ) is the set of other users with similar implicit ratings. The similarity of two users u and v , userSim( u , v ), is given by the percent overlap in implicit ratings of co-rated audio items (i.e., This favors users who rated many items, but offsets the sparse rating matrix resulting from frequent numbers of recordings relative to the number of these recordings accessed [5]. If userSim( w , v ) is greater than a threshold m , then w is considered a threshold m was set empirically at m = 0.5 so as to generate sufficient similarity clusters. has a non-negative implicit rating by one or more users in the similarity cluster. We say z is recommended if it is a common interest audio item but the current user u listened to it below t amount of time, otherwise it is unrecommended by the similarity cluster. Recommendations are sorted by the average normalized listening follows: where w  X  W. The SNS is implemented as a software component written in Java. Recommendations can be generated and retrieved on-line via an HTTP interface or off-line from a SW log file. The SNS creates a sequence of voice menus that allows users to navigate the entire Q &amp; A forum. It uses a hybrid three-step strategy to sequence the recommendations (answers to questions): 1. List audio items reco mmended by neighbors ( CF strategy ). 2. Add audio items frequently heard ( popularity strategy ). 3. Add audio items already heard ( reference strategy ). For the popularity strategy audio items are sorted by number of accesses by all users. For the CF and reference strategies the audio items are sorted by score. The result is an ordered sequence of recommendations. Each recommendati on includes the uri, score, strategy used, and cluster used to generate the recommendation (a list of user ids). The call flow assembler (A in Fig. 2) then constructs the SW voice menus. For each answer in the sequence, the call flow assembler looks up th e question linked to this answer and then constructs a call flow le ading from the question to all of its linked answers, with the expert answer appearing first. The IVR follows the call flow to wait for key presses or voice commands from the user X  X  mobile phone, match their response to a voice menu, and play the selected audio resources. In February and March of 2010, we conducted a pilot study to test SNS in the field. We selected 10 farmers who were long-term users of AO to participate by us ing the SNS for a brief period and providing some feedback. We present results from interviews and analysis of logs. The base AO system had been in use for just over a year by the time of this study. Before starting the study, we modified SW in two ways. First, we added a  X  X kip X  function; if the user pressed a certain touchtone key, the system skipped immediately to the next audio resource. Second, we modifi ed SW to keep track of how long the user played an audio resource. Once the user pressed a key, spoke a command, hung up, or the audio completed playing, the SW system logge d the amount of time the audio played. Our 10 participants were regular users of the system, 8 of whom had used the skip feature. We used SW logs from AO between January 21 and February 3 of 2010 to seed the recommendations. We also conducted three brief interviews. The first interview focused on background information, including demographic questions (location, e ducation level, age, gender), technology use (phone, radio, TV, etc.) and intere st in AO. A second interview, with 14 questions, asked about th eir experience with AO. This semi-structured interview was administered once with respect to the farmer X  X  usage of the recency ordering of the Q &amp; A forum and once with regard to their us age of the newly introduced SNS ordering. We called each participant within 24 hours of his exposure to the new ordering. Seven of the 10 farmers complete d all aspects of the study. All were male, 20 years to 38 years ol d, and completed between 7 and 12 years of schooling. No two farmers lived in the same village, though 3 of them knew each other from prior contact. All used the mobile phone and listened to the radio regularly. Only one used a computer or reported having used an ATM. Farmers expressed interest in using AO to learn farming, animal husbandry, and to get prices. Some wanted to learn about crops, fertil izer, weather, vocational &amp; children's education, and health &amp; home remedies. During our second interview, 5 of the 7 participants who completed the study reported noticing a difference when the SNS ordering was introduced. Two noted that the difference was in the order. For example, one participant  X  felt as if AO started from halfway  X  and another noted,  X  The Q &amp; As were all jumbled up . X  These statements were not particularly positive. However, others noticed a difference in the content. One noted there were  X  X elevant questions; this time [was] much better X  while another was pleasantly surprised that a question he had asked some time ago was presented at the start of the call. We examined the top 10 initial recommendations for each of the 10 users. One user did not access the system during the study period. Two users were not suffici ently similar to any others and thus received recommendations us ing the popularity strategy. The remaining seven experienced the CF strategy. CF created recommendations for each of the 7 users were from clusters of three or more. We also looked at the SW log file to identify a call when the user accessed at least ten recommende d answers. We then looked up the question corresponding to each of these answers and found its rank in the recency X  X ased sequence. Among the seven users who experienced CF, two had one recommendation each with an unusually high rank. The remain ing 54 recommendations had a mean of depth of 48.3. We also looked for any differences in the content of the audio recordings being recommended. One author fluent in the Gujarati language called AO and listened to the top 10 questions and their answers in the Q &amp; A forum ordered by recency and then by CF. While both sets of recordings included music and comments about AO itself, the differences were still striking. In recency order, 3 recordings were blank or contained noise whereas none of the SNS ordered recordings had th is problem. Also, the recency-ordered recordings were on a broad range of topics, whereas the SNS-ordered recordings were mo re narrowly focused on crops. The two users receiving a popularity order listened to only four answers each with an average recency depth of over 300. In our second interview, one of these users said they did not get an answer to their question and the other said they were looking for information on  X  X growing] waterm elon X  and did not find it. More data is needed to determine wh ether popularity order is effective for some users. Study participants using the CF-b ased ordering continued to use the system for more than a month with the SNS deployed. We compared study participants receiving the SNS order during February 10 th to March 10 th of 2010 with users accessing the recency order. Recommendations were updated every few days. Table 1: Fraction entering Q &amp; A vs. Mean time in Q &amp; A per Collaborative Filtering 0.36 149.206 Recency Those listening to resources in CF order listened to Q &amp; A more frequently than those listening to the recency order. There are several possible reasons for this finding. The first is that the farmers used Q &amp; A more because it was useful. However, they also might have used it more b ecause of novelty or other reasons. Despite CF users using Q &amp;A mo re frequently, they spent less than half the mean time per call (149 seconds) in Q &amp; A than users with the recency order (333 seconds). One explanation for this difference is that the CF users were able to more quickly navigate to the information they wanted. Another explanation is that they were dissatisfied with the content and hung up, perhaps because the content was out of date. The study we have reported on here is suggestive, but more work remains. First, we would like to investigate other methods of recommending. In AO, the farmers frequently refer to other farmers by name, even farmers who they have never met in person. The farmers used a protocol whereby the question asker would say their name, village, and phone number before asking a question. Farmers used this knowl edge to follow up with other farmers  X  or to complain about the quality or accuracy of the recordings. Prior to AO, farmers had no regular access to the farmers in neighboring villages. Using AO, farmers who answered questions accurately became well known. We would like to utilize this social network and reputa tion in the SNS, probably by enhancing the user similarity measure. Most recommender systems are based on the assumption that an individual user generates ratings. However, phone sharing is quite common in developing regions. In this situation, SNS builds a user profile reflecting the interests of the group. We would like to investigate ways of better tracking individual users or automatically differentiating users based on a  X  X avigation signature X . Recommender systems generally treat items as atomic and independent. However, in many domains items are linked to one another. We may be able to get a more accurate estimation of the user X  X  rating based upon their na vigation patterns through these links. One possibility we are exploring is to treat a group of linked items (e.g., a question and its answers) as an item. Recommender systems make sense in developing regions of the world with large numbers of user s but a paucity of expertise. However, designing, building, and deploying recommender systems in these regions presen ts unique challenges, including overcoming the limitations of an impoverished user interface, serving users with low written literacy and little familiarity with computer technology, and filtering out content that is of low quality. We have presented a case study of fielding a hybrid strategy recommender system to farmers in India. The system used a collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend paths through an IVR. Users of the recommender system spent a greater percentage of time in the Q &amp; A portion of the application than peers who navigated the Q &amp; A forum ordered by recency, but they spent less time on average navigating and listening to the recordings. In future work, we would like to validate this result with a larger sample of users and deploy th e system over a longer period of time. We believe that collaborative filtering is a promising strategy for deriving relevant audio content for each user to navigate in an IVR and could have significant impact in developing regions of the world. We would like to thank Jaso n Ellis and Wendy Kellogg for initiating and supporting this wo rk, Jim Christensen and Mark Bailey for technical exchanges.
