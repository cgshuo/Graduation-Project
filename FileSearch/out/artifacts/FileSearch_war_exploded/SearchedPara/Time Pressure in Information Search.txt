 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  Search Process Search behavior; Time pressure
The primary purpose of this research is to explore the im-pact of perceived time pressure on search behaviors, searcher perceptions of the search system and the search experience. Are there observable behavioral changes when a searcher is time-pressured? To what extent are search behavior differ-ences attributable to objective experimental manipulation versus to the subjective experience of time pressure? An important secondary purpose of this work is to identify ap-propriate outcome measures that allow for the comparison of session-level search behaviors when time is manipulated. This proposal builds on Crescenzi, Kelly and Azzopardi [3] and is intended to be part of a multi-method line of inquiry examining time-pressured information-seeking.

Why is it important to study time? Research has shown that time is an important element of information retrieval [4] and information-seeking [6]. Recent work has examined several temporal factors in interactive information retrieval (IIR) research including system response time [1], time lim-its [9], and the urgency of the information need [8]. While impact of perceived time pressure on search behavior is not well understood, there has been a great deal of research on how time pressure impacts decision-making. This research has shown that when making a decision under time pressure, people often reduce the amount of time to process pieces of information, work faster, focus on more general information or even satisfice [5]. As information search involves numer-ous decisions, examining similar adaptations may be present in time-pressured information search.

Time is also an important factor to consider in search and system evaluation. Comparison of interaction measures is
