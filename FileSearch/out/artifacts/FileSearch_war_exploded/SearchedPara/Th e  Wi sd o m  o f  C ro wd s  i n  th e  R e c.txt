 Many demo nstr ations have s ho wn that aggre gating the judgme nts of a number of individuals known as the  X  X isdom of crowds X  [1 ] . This was demonstr ate d by Galto n, who s ho wed that the estimated weight of an o x, when aver age d across individuals , closely approximated the true weight [2] . Similarly, on the game sho w Who Wants to be a Millionaire , co ntestants are give n the opportunity to ask all members of the audie nce to ans wer multiple choice questio n s . Over se ver al se asons of the s ho w, the modal res ponse of the audience corresponde d to the correct ans wer 91% of the time. More sophistic ated aggregatio n appro aches have been de velope d for multiple choice tasks , s uc h as Cult ur al Co nsens us Theor y, that additio nally take differences across indi viduals and items into account [3 ] . The wis dom of cro wds ide a is c urrently use d in se ver al re al -world applic ations , s uch as predictio n mar kets [4 ] , s pam filtering, and the pre diction of c ons umer preferences through collabor ative filtering. Recently, it was s ho wn that a form of the wis dom of cro wds phe nome non also occurs within a single person [5] . Aver aging multiple guesses from o ne person pro vides better estimates than the individual gues ses.
 We a re interested in applying this wis dom of cro wds pheno meno n to human memor y involving situatio ns where individuals have to retrie ve informatio n more complex than single numerical estimates or ans wers to multiple choice questions. We will focus here o n memory for or der informatio n. For e xample, we test individuals on their ability to reconstruct from memory the or der of historic e ve nts (e.g. , the or der of US presidents) , or the magnitude alo ng some physical dimensio n (e .g., the or der of largest US cities). We the n de velo p computatio nal models that infer distributions o ver or derings to explain the o bser ve d orderings across individuals. The goal is to demo nstrate a wisdom of cro wds effects where the inferred ordering s are closer to the actual ordering than the or dering s pro duce d by the majority of individuals . Aggregating r ank or der data is not a ne w pro blem. In social c hoice theor y, a number of systems have been de velo pe d for aggregating r ank or der preferences for groups (Mar den, 1995). Preferential voting systems , where voters e xplicitly r ank or der their c andidate systems, s uch as the Borda count, perform well in aggre gating the individuals ' r ank order data, but with an inherent bias to war ds determining the to p members of the list. Ho we ve r, as vo ting is a means for e xpressing individual preferences , there is no ground tr uth. The go al for these systems is to determine an aggregate of preferences that is in some sense  X  X air X  to all me mbers of the group. The r ank aggregatio n problem has also been studied in machine learning and information retrie val [6 ,7] . For e xample, if one is prese nted with a r anke d list of webpages from se ver al se arch engines, ho w c an these be combined to cre ate a single ranking that is more acc ur ate and less se nsitive to s pam? Relatively little researc h has bee n done o n the r ank order agg regation pro blem with the go al of appro ximating a kno wn ground truth. In follo w -ups to Galto n's wor k, some experime nts were performed testing the ability of individual s to r ank -order magnitudes in ps ycho physic al experiments [8 ] . Also , an informal aggre gati on model for r ank order data was de velope d for the Cultural Conse nsus Theory, using f actor analysis of the co variance str ucture of r ank order judgme nts [3 ] . This was use d t o ( partially) reco ver the order of c auses of de ath in the US on the basis of the ind ividual orderings.
 We present empirical and theoretical researc h o n the wisdo m of cro wds pheno meno n for rank order aggregatio n. No communic atio n between people is allo wed for these tasks , and therefore the aggregatio n method o perates o n the data produced b y inde pe nde nt decision -makers. Importantly, for all of the pro blems there is a kno wn ground tr uth. We compare several heuristic computational approaches X  X ased on voting theory and existing models of social choice X  X hat analyze the individual judgments and p ro vide a single ans wer as o utput, whic h can be compared to the gro und tr uth. We refer to these s ynthesize d ans wers as  X  X roup X  answers because they capture the collective wisdom of the group, even though no communication betwee n group me mbers occurre d. We a lso apply probabilistic mo dels base d on a Thursto nian approac h and Mallo ws model. The Thursto nian model re presents the group kno wledge abo ut items as distributio ns o n an inter val dimensio n [9 ] . Mallo ws model is a distance -base d mo del that represents the group ans wer as a mo dal ordering of items , and assumes e ach individual to have orderings that are more or less close to the mo dal ordering [10] . Altho ugh Thursto nian and Mallo ws type of mo dels have often been used to analyze preference r ankings [11 ] , the y have not been applied, as far as we are aware, to ordering problems where there is a gro und truth. We also present e xtensio ns of these mo dels that allo w for the possibility of different res ponse str ategies  X  some individuals might be pur ely guessing bec ause they have no kno wle dge of the proble m and others might have partial kno wledge of t he ground tr uth. We de velop efficient MCMC algorithms to infer the late nt group orderings and assignme nts of individuals to respo nse str ate gies. The advantage of MCMC estimatio n procedure is that it gives a probability distributio n o ver group or derings , and we can therefore assess the likelihood of any partic ular group ordering. 2 . 1 M e t ho d Participants were 78 undergr aduate students at t he University of Califor nia, Ir vine. The experiment was compose d of 17 questions involv ing gener al kno wle dge re gar ding: population statistics (4 questions) , geo graphy (3 questions), dates, s uch as release dates for mo vies and boo ks (7 questions), U.S. Presidents , material har dness , the 10 Co mmandments , and the first 10 Amendme nts of the U.S. Co nstitution . An inter active interf ace was presente d on a computer screen. Participants were instructed to order the presented items (e.g.,  X  X rder these books by their first release date, earliest to most recent X ), and responded by dragging the individual it ems o n the screen to the desire d locatio n in the or dering. The initial ordering of the 10 items within a question was r andomized across all questions and all participants. 2 . 2 R e s ul t s To e valuate the performance of participants as well as mo dels, we me asure d the distance between the reconstr ucted and the correct ordering. A co mmonly used distance metric for orderings is Kendall X  X   X  . This distance metric count s the number of adjace nt pair wise dis agreeme nts betwee n or derings . Values of  X  range from: 0  X   X   X   X  (  X   X  1 ) / 2 , where N is ordering is e xactly right, and a value of one me ans that the or dering is correct e xcept for two neighboring items being tr anspose d, and so on up to the maximum po ssible value of 45.
 Table 1 s ho ws all unique order ings , by column , that were produced for two pro blems: arr anging U.S. States by e ast -w est locatio n, and sorting U.S. Preside nts by the time the y serve d in office . The correct ordering is s ho wn o n the right. The columns are sorte d by Kendall's  X  distance. The first and second number belo w eac h or dering correspo nd to Kendall's  X  distance and the number of participants who produced the ordering respective ly . These two e xamples sho w that o nly a small number of participants repro duce d the correct ordering (in f act, for 11 o ut of 17 problems , no participant gave the correct ans wer ) . It also sho ws that ver y fe w or derings are pro duce d by m ultiple participants . F or 8 out of 17 problems , e ac h participant pro duced a unique or dering. To summarize the res ults across participants , t he column labeled PC in Table 2 sho ws the proportion of individuals who got the or dering exactly right for eac h of the ordering tas k questio ns. On aver age, abo ut o ne percent of participants recreated the correct r ank ordering perfectly. The column  X  , s ho ws the me an  X  values over the pop ulation of participants for note the best performance o verall was ac hie ve d o n the Preside nts, States from west to east, Oscar mo vies, and Mo vie rele ase dates tas ks . These four questions relate to educ ational and cultur al kno wledge that seems most likely to be s hare d by our undergr aduate subjects.
 Finally, an important s ummary statistic is the performance of the best individual. Inste ad of picking the best individu al separ ately for eac h problem, we find the individual who scores best across all problems . Table 2 , bottom ro w, sho ws that this individual has o n average a  X  distance of 7 .8. To demo nstr ate the wis dom of cro wds effect, we have to s ho w that the synthesized group or dering outperforms the ordering, o n aver age , of this best individual. We e valuate d a number of aggre gation mo dels o n their ability to reconstr uct the gro und tr uth based on the group ordering inferred from individual or derings. First, we e valuate two heuristic methods from social choice theory base d on the mo de and Borda counts. One dr awback of s uch heuristic aggrega tio n models is that the y create no explicit representatio n of eac h individual's wor king kno wledge. Therefore, e ven though s uc h metho ds c an aggregate the individual pieces of kno wledge across individuals, they c annot e xplain why individuals rank the items i n a partic ular way. To address this potential weakness, we de velop two simple pro babilistic mo del s based on the Thurstonian approac h [9 ] and Mallo ws model [10 ] . 3 . 1 H e u r i s t i c Mo d e l s We tested two heuristic aggre gation mo dels. In t he simplest heuristic , based on the mode, the group ans wer is based o n the most fre que ntly occurring sequence of all o bser ve d seque nces. In c ases where se veral different se que nces correspond to the mode, a r a ndomly c hosen modal se quence was pic ked. The second method uses the Borda count method, a widely use d technique from voting theory. In the Bor da co unt metho d, weighte d counts are assigne d suc h that the first choice  X  X andidate X  receives a count of N ( where N is the number of candidates) , the second c hoice candidate receives a co unt of N -1 , and so o n. These counts are summe d across candidates and the candidate with the highest count is considered the  X  X ost preferred X . Here, we use the Borda count to create an ordering over all items by ordering the Borda co unts . Table 2 reports the perf ormance of all of the aggregatio n models. For e ach, we c hecke d whether the inferre d gro up or der is correct ( C ) and me asure d Ke ndall's  X  . We also report in the r ank column the percentage of participants who perform worse or the s ame as the group ans wer, as me asure d by  X  . With the r ank statistic, we c an verify the wis dom of cro wds effect. In an ide al model, the aggregate ans wer sho uld be as good as or better than all of the individuals in the group. Table 1 sho ws the res ults se parately for e ach pro blem, and a verage d across all the pro blems. These res ults s ho w that the mo de heuristic le ads to the worst performance o verall in r ank. On aver age , the mo de is as good or better of an estimate than 68% of participants. This means that 32% of participants came up with better solutions individually. This is not surprising, since, with an ordering of 10 items, it is possible that o nly a fe w participants will agree on the or dering of items . The difficulty in inferring the mo de makes it an unreliable method for co nstructin g a group ans wer. This pro blem will be exacer bate d for or derings involving more than 10 items, as the number of possible orderings gro ws combinatorially. The Bor da count method perform s relatively well in terms of Ke ndall's  X  and o ver all r ank performance . On average, these metho ds perform with r anks of 85%, indicating that the group ans wers from these metho ds score amongst the best individuals . On aver age , the Borda count has an aver age distance of 7.47, which outperforms the best individual o ver all proble ms . 3 . 2 A Th u r s t o ni a n M o d e l In the Thursto nian approac h, the o verall item kno wle dge for the gro up is re presente d explicitly as a set of coordinates o n an inter val dimensio n. The inter val re presentation is justifiable , at le ast for some of the pro blems in o ur study that involve o ne -dimensio nal concepts , s uc h as the relative timing of e vents , or the lengths of items . We will intro duce an extensio n of the Thurstonian a pproac h where the orderings of some of the individuals are dr awn from a Thursto nian model and others are dr awn are based on a guessing process with no relation to the underlying inter val re presentation.
 To intro duce the basic Thurstonian appro ach, let N be the number of items in the ordering tas k and M the number of individuals ordering the items . Eac h item is represe nted as a value  X   X  along this dime nsion, where  X   X  1 , ... ,  X  . Each individual is ass ume d to have access to this gro up -le vel information. Ho we ver, individuals might not have precise kno wle dge abo ut the e xact locatio n of eac h item. We mo del e ach individual's loc ation of the ite m by a single sample from a Normal distribution, centered on the item X  X  group location. Specifically, in our model, whe n determining the order of items , a person  X   X  1 , ... ,  X  samples a value from each item  X  ,  X   X   X  ~ N  X   X  ,  X   X  . The standar d de viation  X   X  captures the uncertainty that individuals have about ite m  X  and the s amples  X   X   X  represent the me ntal represe ntat io n for the individual. The ordering for e ach individual is then based on the ordering of their samples . only if  X   X  Thurstonian mo del with group -le vel information for three items , A, B, and C and two individuals. In the illustr atio n, there is a larger degree of o verlap betwee n the representatio ns for B and C making it likely that items B and C are tr anspose d ( as illustrate d for the second individual).
 We exte nd this basic Thursto nian model by incor porating a guessing compone nt. We found this to be a necessar y exte nsion because some individuals in the ordering tas ks actually were 
Figure 2. Graphical model of the extended Thurstonian Model (a) and Mallows model (b) not f amiliar with any of the ite ms in the ordering tas ks (s uc h as the Te n C ommandments or ten ame ndents ) . In the exte nded Thursto nian mo del, the or dering of suc h cases are ass ume d to originate from a single distributio n,  X   X   X  ~ N  X  0 ,  X  0 , where no distinction is made between the different items  X  all s amples come from the same distributio n with par ameters  X  0 ,  X  0 . Therefore, the or derings produced by the individuals under this model are completely r andom. For example, Figure 1, right panel sho ws two or derings produced from this guessing model. W e associate a latent state  X   X  with e ach individual that determines whether the ordering from eac h individual is pro duced by the guessing model or the Thurstonian mo del: To complete the mo del , we placed a standard prior on all normal distributions ,  X   X  ,  X   X  1  X  2 . Figure 2 a s ho ws the graphic al model for the Thurstonian model. Although the model looks straightfor ward as a hier archic al model, inference in this mo del has pro ve n to be difficult bec ause the obser ved variable  X   X  is a deterministic r anking f unctio n (indic ate d by the do uble bordered circle) of the underlying late nt variable  X   X  . T he basic Thursto nian model was intro duced by Thursto ne in 1927, but o nly recently have MCMC methods bee n de velo ped for estimation [12] . We de velo ped a simplifie d MCMC procedure as describe d in the s uppleme ntar y materials that allo ws for efficient estimatio n of the underlying tr ue ordering , as we ll as the assignme nt of individuals to res ponse str ate gies. The result s of the exte nded Thur stonian model are s ho wn in Table 2 . The mo del performs appro ximately as well as the Borda count metho d. The model does not reco ver the exact ans wer for any of the 17 pro blems , base d on the kno wle dge pro vided by the 78 participants . It is possible that a la r ger s ample size is neede d in order to ac hie ve perfect reconstr uctio ns of the ground tr uth. Ho we ve r, the model, on aver age, has an distance of 7.29 from the actual truth, whic h is better than the best individual o ver all pro blems.
 One advantage of the prob abilistic approac h is that it gives insight into the difficulty of the tas k and the respo nse strategies of individuals. For some problems , s uch as the Te n Commandments , 32 % of individuals were assigned to the guessing str ategy (  X   X  = 0 ) . For other pro blems, s uc h as the US Preside nts , only 16 % of individuals were assigned to the guessing str ategy, indicating that kno wle dge abo ut this do main was more widely distribute d in our gro up of individuals. Therefore, the exte nsion of the Thurstonia n mo del can eliminate individuals who are purely guessing the ans wers .
 A n a dvantage of the re presentation underlying the Thursto nian model is that it allo ws a visualizatio n of gro up kno wle dge not o nly in terms of the or der of items, but also in terms of the uncertainty associated with e ac h item on the inter val sc ale. Figure 3 sho ws the inferre d distributio ns for four pro blems where the mo del performe d relatively well. The crosses correspond to the mean of  X   X  across all s amples, and the error bars re present the standard 
Figure 3. Sample Thurstonian inferred distributions. The vertical order is the g round truth ordering, while the numbers in parentheses show the inferred group ordering de viatio ns  X   X  based o n a geometric aver age across all s amples . These vis ualizations are intuitive , and s ho w ho w so me ite ms are conf used with others in the gro up po pulatio n. For instance, ne arly all participants were able to identif y Maine as the e aster n most state in o ur list, but many co nfuse d the centr al states. Li ke wise , there was a large agreement o n the proper placement of " the right to be ar arms " in the amendments question  X  this amendment is often popularly referred to as  X  T he S econd A me ndme nt  X . 3. 3 M a l l o w s Mo d e l One drawbac k of the Thursto nian model is that it gives an analog re presentation for eac h item, which might be inappropriate for some proble ms. For example , it seems psyc hologic ally implausible that t he te n amendments or Ten Commandme nts are me ntally repres ented as coordinates o n a n inter val sc ale. Therefore, we also appl ie d probabilistic models where the gro up a ns wer is base d o n a pure r ank ordering. One suc h a model is Mallo ws model [ 7, 9 , 10 ] , a distance -base d mo del that ass um es that o bser ve d ordering s that are close to the group or dering are more likely than those far away. One instantiatio n of Mallo ws mo del is base d o n Ke ndall's distance to meas ure the number of pair wise permutations between the group order and the individual or der. Specific ally, t he probability of any o bser ve d or der  X  , given the group order  X  is : where  X  is the Ke ndall 's distance . The scaling parameter  X  determines ho w close the obser ved orders are to the gro up ordering. A s describe d by [7 ] , the normalizatio n f unctio n  X   X  does not de pend on  X  and c an be c alc ulate d efficiently by: The model as state d in the Eq s . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) describe that standar d Mallo ws model that has often been use d to model preference ranking data. We no w introduce a si mple variant of this model that allo ws for contaminants . The ide a is that some of the individuals orderings do not originate at all from some commo n group kno wle dge , and inste ad are base d o n a guessing process . The e xte nd e d model introduces a late nt state  X   X  where  X   X  = 1 if the individual j produced the ordering based on Mallo ws model and  X   X  = 0 if the individual is guessing. We model guessing by cho osing an or dering uniformly from all possible or derings of N items . Ther efore, in the e xtende d model, we have To complete the mo del, w e place a Ber noulli( 1 / 2 ) prior o ver  X   X  . The MCMC infere nce algorithm to estimate the distribution o ver  X  ,  X  and  X  give n the obser ved data is based o n earlier work [6 ] . We exte nded the algorithm to estimate  X  and also allo w for the efficient estimatio n of  X  . The details of the inference procedure are describe d in the s upplementar y materials. The res ult of the infere nce algorithm is a pro bability distributio n o ver group ans wers  X  , of whic h we take the mode as the single ans wer for a particular proble m. Note that the i nferre d group ordering does not have to correspond with an order ing of any partic ular individua l. The model just finds the or dering that is close to all of the obser ve d ordering s , e xcept those that c an be better e xplaine d by a guessing process. Figure 4 illustr ates the model solutio n based on a single MCMC s ample for the Te n Comm andme nts and ten ame ndme nt sorting tas ks. The figure sho ws the distributio n of distances from the inferred gro up ordering. Eac h circle corresponds to an individual. Individuals assigne d to Mallo ws model and the guessing model are illustrate d by fille d and unfille d circles respectively. The solid and dashe d re d lines s ho w the e xpected distributions base d o n the mo del par ameters. Note that although Mallo ws mo del describes an e xpone ntial f alloff in probability based o n the distance from the group ordering, the e xpecte d distributio ns also take into account the number of or derings that e xist at eac h distance (see [11 ] , page 79, for a recursive algorithm to compute this). Figure 4 sho ws the distributio n o ver individuals that are c aptured by the two ro utes in the model. The individuals with a Kendall 's  X  abo ve belo w 15 te nd to be assigned to Mallo ws route and all other individuals are assigne d to the the guessing ro ute. Interestingly, the distributio n o ver distances appears to be bimodal, especially for the Te n Co mmandments . The middle pe ak of the distribution occurs at 22, whic h is close to the expected value of 22.5 based o n guessing. This result seems intuitively plausible --not e ver ybody has studie d the Te n Commandme nts , let alo ne the or der in which they occ ur. Table 2 sho ws the res ults for the e xtende d Mallo ws model across all 17 problems . The over all performance , in terms of Ke ndall 's  X  and r ank is compar able to the Thurstonian model and the Borda count metho d. Therefore, there does not appear to be any o v er all advantage of this particular appro ach. For the Te n Commandme nts and ten ame ndme nt sorting tasks , Mallo ws model performs the s ame or better than the Thursto nian mo del. This suggests that for particular ordering tas ks, where there is ar guably no underl ying analo g representation, a pure rank -ordering representatio n suc h as Mallo ws model might have an advantage . We have presente d two he uristic aggregatio n approac hes, as well as two probabilistic a ppro ach es , for the problem of aggregating r ank or ders to unco ver a gro und truth. For eac h problem, we found that there were individuals who performe d better than the aggregatio n models ( altho ugh we cannot identify these individuals until after the f act). Ho we ver, across all pro blems, no person consistently outperforme d the model. Therefore, for all aggregatio n methods , except for the mode , we demo nstrated a wisdom of cro wds effect, where the a ver age performance of the mo del was better than the best individual o ver all problems . We also presente d two probabilistic appro ache s based o n the classic Thursto nian and Mallo ws approac h. While neither of these mo del s outperform ed the simple Bor da count heuristic models , the y do have some advantages o ver them . The Thurstonian mo del not o nly extracts a group ordering, but also a re presentation of the uncertainty associate d with the ordering. This c an be vis ualize d to gain insight into me ntal representatio n s and processes. In additio n, the Thursto nian and Mallo ws mo dels were both exte nded with a guessing compone nt to allo w for the possibility that some individuals simply do not kno w any of the ans wers for a partic ular pro blem. Finally , although not e xplored here , the Bayesian approac h potentially offers advantages o ver heuristic appro aches because the probabilistic mo del c an be e asily expande d with additio nal so urces of kno wle dge, s uch as co nfidence judgme nts from participants and bac kground kno wle dge abo ut t he items.
