A developments in fields as dive rse as citation analysis and pattern recognition. The purpose of this tutorial is to survey those roots, and their relation to the contemporary fruits on th e tree of information retrieval, and to separate, as much them, and the heuristics that are the br ead and butter of a working operation. While some might think that an examination of the roots is of merely historical interest, it has practical value as well. When you know which earlier research has provided the origins for the things that you are interested in, you can use problems. In addition to pattern recognition and citation analys is, the tutorial will also e xpose and review some of the relations to the fields of sta tistics and operations research. heuristics, in the application of these ideas to their own research and/or deve lopment activities.

 As we face an explosion of potential new applications for the fundamental concepts and technologi es of information retrieval, ranging from ad ranking to soci al media, from collaborative recommending to question answering systems, many researchers are spending unnecessary time reinventing ideas and relationships for many researchers, means anything published before they entered graduate school). Much of today X  X  received wisdom may be nothing more than the fossilized residue of lively debates concerning such things as . estimation of value and evaluation of systems. Returning to those discussions may open the door to genuinely new insights. super-heated research environment have very firm roots in earlier tree of information retrieval, and to separate, as much as is possible in an era of increasing commercial secrecy about methods, the problems to be solved, the algorithms for solving them, and the heuristics that are the bread and butter of a working operation. Among the important new topics whose foundations will be explored are the use of social media in search and advertising, and the growing management of personal image collections for search and for commercial purposes. While some might think that an examination of the roots is of merely historical interest, it has practical value as well. When you know which earlier research has provided the origins for the things that you are interested in, you can use that fact to trace its other descendents, and often find rich and rewarding ideas in a literature that you would not normally reach, because it was not considered important by your instructors when you were learning about the problems. In addition to pattern recognition and citation analysis, the tutorial will also expose and review some of the relations to the fields of sta tistics and operations research. Participants will become familiar with roots in Pattern Analysis, Statistics, Information Science and other sources of key ideas that reappear in the current development of Information Retrieval as it applies to Search Engines, Social Media, and Collaborative Systems. They will be able to separate problems from algorithms, and algorithms from heuristics, in th e application of these ideas to their own research and/or development activities. Course materials will be made available on a Web site two weeks prior to publications that will be discussed; and mechanisms for chat among the tutorial participants, before, during and after the tutorial. Specific Topics will include: 1. The earliest  X  X utomated retrieval; 2. Vectors and Logarithms: their pragmatic origins; 3. Probabilistic approaches. A frequentist foundation; 4. The quest for a theoretical foundation; 5. Generative approaches; 6. Network approaches; 7. Binding approaches together. foundational IBM technical reports by H.P. Luhn and I.J.
