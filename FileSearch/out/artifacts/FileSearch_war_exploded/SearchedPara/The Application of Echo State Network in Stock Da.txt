 Data mining on stock markets has received focus from investors and researchers for a long time due to its potential profits. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the most widely used approach on stock markets and show good performance in many cases. Among ANNs, back-propagation neural network (BPNN), time delay neural network (TDNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are popular. However, they have their own limitations. BPNN can learn only an input-output mapping of static patterns that mismatch between the choice of time-delay values and temporal location of important information in the input patterns [1]. RNN is difficult to develop [2]. 
Echo State Network (ESN) is a novel RNN whose basic idea is to use a large  X  X eservoir X  RNN as a supplier of interesting dynamics from which the desired output is consistent with stock markets. ESN is good at chaotic time-series forecast and obtained the best result in Mackey-Glass series prediction. Because it is simple to develop, ESN [6, 7], etc. Unfortunately, there is no application of ESN in financial area. 
This paper investigates the effectiveness of ESN to predict daily stock price and compare the results of ESN with BPNN, Elman neural network and radial basis-function neural network (RBFNN). The experiments demonstrate that ESN outperforms other neural networks in most cases and is an effective way in short-term stock time-series prediction. makes a conclusion and proposes some advice for future research. 2.1 Architecture of ESN activation of internal state (1) xn + at time step 1 n + is updated according to where in W is input connections sampled from a uniform distribution between [ 0.1, 0.1]  X  ; W is internal connections sampled from a uniform distribution between [1,1]  X  ; back W is feedback connections sampled from the uniform distribution ESN is computed according to unchanged. Here we use least-squares algorithm to train an ESN. 2.2 Hurst Exponent Before training, an initial transient should be dismissed first so that after the transient time the internal network state is determined by the preceding input history [5]. Here we apply the Hurst exponent [9] to decide initial transient. 
The Hurst exponent provides a measure for the long-term memory and fractality impact is. Hurst exponent can be computed according to rescaled range analysis (R/S analysis) [10]. the closest to 1 is the final training set. 2.3 Data Preparation Because in short-term prediction, the infl uence of macroeconomic environment and a company X  X  financial conditions is negligible, we only consider raw prices and optimal one. All the input data are listed as follows and linearly normalized to [-1,1]. z High: the maximum price of a stock ticker during the intra-day trading. z Low: the minimum price of a stock ticker during the intra-day trading. z Open: the first price of a stock ticker during the intra-day trading. z Close: the final price of a stock ticker during the intra-day trading. z 5-day High: the highest High Price during the past 5 days. z 5-day Close Moving Average: the average of Close in the past 5 days. 2005 (the first 1000 days for training and the last 100 days for testing) of 491 stocks Matlab Neural Network Toolbox) on the same task for comparison. Note that their topology and parameters are chose by manual experiments to guarantee satisfying results on most stocks. Average percent erro r (APE, See Equation 3) is the criteria to judge all networks. results that are randomly chosen. others in some cases such as AHC, KMG, NBR and RHI. BPNN performs the best in 14.87% cases; Elman performs the best in 20.16% cases and RBFNN performs the best in 7.94% cases. Moreover, in 138 out of 211 stocks where ESN does not perform the best, it gives results very close to the optimal one (the gap is smaller than 0.5%). parameters such as max  X  , back W and  X  , the accuracy can be improved. memory ability of ESN. one stock on a Core 2 CPU T5500 1.0G computer. Obviously, it takes the most time calculate the Hurst exponent spends most of the time. compare its predictive accuracy with BPNN, Elman network and RBFNN. The Hurst exponent is used to guide transient selectio n before training an ESN. The experiments outperform other conventional neural networks in most cases. 
However, ESN is a young discrete model for chaotic time-series mining that needs preliminary observation indicates that the price trend may influence prediction accuracy, but further exploration is required. Second, finding an optimal architecture and transfer functions with genetic algorithms (GAs) for each stock is under consideration. Finally, whether ESN has the ability of long-term stock data mining is still of interest.
