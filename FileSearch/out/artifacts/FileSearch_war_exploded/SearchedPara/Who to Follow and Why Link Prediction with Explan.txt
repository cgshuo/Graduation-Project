 User recommender systems are a key component in any on-line social networking platform: they help the users growing their network faster, thus driving engagement and loyalty.
In this paper we study link prediction with explanations for user recommendation in social networks. For this prob-lem we propose WTFW ( X  X ho to Follow and Why X ), a stochastic topic model for link prediction over directed and nodes-attributed graphs. Our model not only predicts links, but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a X  X opical X  or a  X  X ocial X  link, and depending on this decision it produces a di  X  erent type of explanation.

A topical link is recommended between a user interested in a topic and a user authoritative in that topic: the expla-nation in this case is a set of binary features describing the topic responsible of the link creation. A social link is rec-ommended between users which share a large social neigh-borhood: in this case the explanation is the set of neighbors which are more likely to be responsible for the link creation.
Our experimental assessment on real-world data confirms the accuracy of WTFW in the link prediction and the quality of the associated explanations.

Link prediction is the task of estimating the likelihood of the existence of an unobserved link between two nodes, based on the other observable links around the two nodes and, when available, the attributes of the nodes [8]. It finds application in any context in which the network is only par-tially observable and we want to guess the unobserved part. A typical setting is when we consider the network evolving along time, so that the unobservable part of the network is the set of links which are not yet created: given the graph observed at time t , we want to predict the set of links which will be created in the time interval [ t, t +1][17].
Link prediction has been applied in a variety of domains, ranging from bioinformatics to web sites management, from bibliography to e-commerce [12, 18, 5]. However, the most immediate and prominent application of link prediction is the recommendation of users to other users of a social net-work. This is one of the most fundamental functionalities common to all on-line social networking platforms 1 : it helps the users having a quicker start in building their network, thus driving engagement and loyalty. It is a key component for growth and sustenance of a social network: for instance, the Wtf ( X  X ho to Follow X ) service at Twitter is claimed to be responsible for millions of new links daily [11]. Given that growing the user base and maintaining a high level of engagement are key factors for the success (or the death) of these billion-dollar businesses, one can easily figure out the importance of user recommendation systems.

In this paper we study link prediction with explanations for user recommendation systems in on-line social networks. Enriching recommendations with explanations has the ben-efit to increase the trust of the user in the recommenda-tion, and thus the likelihood that the recommendation is adopted. While these benefits are well understood in clas-sic collaborative-filtering recommender systems [14, 25, 30], providing explanations in the context of user recommenda-tion systems is still largely underdeveloped: in fact, in most of the real-world systems, the unique explanations given for user recommendations are of the type  X  X ou should follow user Z because your contacts X and Y do the same X .
Our starting observation is that a link creation is usually explainable by one of two main reasons: interest identity or personal social relations. This observation is rooted in soci-ology, where it goes under the name common identity and common bond theory [24, 26]. Identity-based attachment holds when people join a community based on their interest in a well-defined common theme shared by all of the mem-bers of that community. The goal in this case is information collecting and sharing in the specific theme of interest. Peo-ple joining a community through identity-based links may not even directly participate, e.g., by producing content or by engaging with other members, and instead only passively consume information.

Conversely, bond-based attachment is driven by personal social relations with other specific individuals (e.g., family, friends, colleagues), and thus it does not require a common theme of interest to be justified. Bond-based links are usu-
E.g.,  X  X eople You May Know X  in Facebook and LinkedIn ,  X  X ecommended Blogs X  in Tumblr ,or  X  X ho to Follow X  in Twitter , just to mention a few. ally reciprocated, while identity-based links are much more directional, where the direction is given by the level of au-thoritativeness of the user on the theme. The two types of links create two di  X  erent types of communities, that for sim-plicity we name  X  X opical X  for identity-based and  X  X ocial X  for bond-based [10].

Based on this observation we define a stochastic model, dubbed WTFW ( X  X ho to Follow and Why X ), which not only predicts links, but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a topical or a social link, and depending on this decision it produces a di  X  erent type of explanation .

A topical link u ! v ( u should follow v ) is usually recom-mended to u when v is authoritative in a topic in which u has demonstrated interest. In this case the explanation is a set of the top-k binary features (e.g., tags in Flickr or hash-tags in Twitter ) describing the topic of authoritativeness of v , which makes v a potential source of interesting informa-tion for u . A social link u ! v instead is recommended when u and v are already part of the same social commu-nity, i.e., they have many contacts in common. In this case the explanation is the set of the top-k common neighbors w.r.t. the likelihood of being responsible for the link cre-ation. As an important by-product, WTFW also implicitly detects communities and their type (social or topical) .
More in details WTFW is a bayesian topic model defined over directed and nodes-attributed graphs. In WTFW each link creation and each attribute adoption by a node are ex-plained w.r.t. a finite number of latent factors. These latent factors can be abstractly thought as topics or communities : in the rest of the paper we will use the three terms (la-tent factor, topic, and community) interchangeably. Each community is characterized by a level of sociality/topicality: social communities are characterized by high density and reciprocity of links, whereas topical communities are char-acterized by low entropy in the features and by the presence of authoritative users on the relevant topic. Each user tend to be involved in di  X  erent communities to di  X  erent extent and with di  X  erent roles. These components are modeled by three di  X  erent multinomial distributions over the set of users, modeling their sociality, authoritativeness and inter-est in each topic. Finally, each topic is characterized by a multinomial distribution over the feature set, which provide a semantic interpretation of the topic.

Link prediction has attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade (the interested reader may refer to [12, 18] for a comprehensive survey): however, to the best of our knowl-edge, no previous work has studied link prediction with ex-planations for user recommendation systems . Our proposal can also be collocated in the literature on relational learning methods that are able to leverage attribute information on nodes [29, 34, 19]. The main drawback of those approaches is scalability, which seriously prevents their application on real-world networks.

The Supervised Random Walk algorithm for link predic-tion [1], exploits edge features to learn the edge strength that is then used random walk transition probability. Alter-native random-walk approaches rely on merging the social graph and node attributes in a unique graph with person-nodes and attribute-nodes linked among them [33, 9].
The joint factorization of social links and node attributes is closely related to the task of detecting communities in nodes-attributed graphs. [35] uses node attributes to aug-ment the social graph by generating  X  X ttribute edges X  be-tween nodes that are similar on a given attribute, and then identify communities in the augmented graph. [21] intro-duces the problem of finding cohesive patterns , defined as connected subgraphs whose density exceeds a given thresh-old, and with homogeneous values on node-attributes. [31] proposes a co-clustering framework based on users and tags. Users are implicitly connected by their common interests, as expressed by the tags they use. [23] studies the problem of finding communities with concise descriptions based on the nodes attributes.

Several stochastic models for community detection in net-works with node attributes have been proposed in the litera-ture. In Link-LDA [6] social connections and user attributes are generated by a mixture of user-specific distributions over topics. In [22, 15, 32] the community-membership vectors are used to factorize both links and the attribute-profile of each user. [27] extends the author-topic model to commu-nication networks in which the sender and recipient of each post are known. [2] proposes a generative stochastic model to detect communities from the social graph and a database of information propagations over the social graph.
In this section we introduce the WTFW model for link pre-diction with explanations. Our application scenario is that of online social networking platforms, where users build and maintain social connections, share information, and follow updates from other users. We represent this as a directed graph, where each node is a user and it has associated a set of binary features, representing the interests of the user. More formally, let G =( V, E ) be the social graph where V is a set of n users, E  X  V  X  V is a set of m directed arcs, and ( u, v ) indicates that u follows v and hence he is notified of v  X  X  activities. We also denote the neighborhood of a node u as N ( u )= { v 2 V :( u, v ) 2 E _ ( v, u ) 2 E } . Moreover let F denote a set of h binary features. We are given a binary n  X  h matrix F such that F u,f = 1 when user u is interested in the feature f . For simplicity we denote this case also as ( u, f ) 2 F . Finally, we denote all the features of the node u as F ( u )= { f 2 F :( u, f ) 2 F } and the set of all the nodes having attribute f as V ( f )= { u 2 V :( u, f ) 2 F } .
Following the common identity and common bond theory discussed in Section 1, we assume two main types of behav-ior in creating connections in a social network. The X  X opical X  behavior, in which a user u decides to follow another user v because of u  X  X  interest in a topic in which v is authorita-tive; and the  X  X ocial X  behavior in which u follows v because they know each other in the real world, or they have many common contacts in the social network. In the topical be-havior case we can further identify two distinct roles for a user, either as authoritative ( X  X nfluential X ) for the topic or just interested ( X  X usceptible X ) in the topic. In the social case instead there are no specific roles, but a generic tendency to connect among the users of a close-knit circle.

Following these considerations, we propose to explain the structure of the network (the links) and the features of the nodes, by introducing a set of latent factors representing users X  interests, and by labeling the links as either social or topical. This is done by means of a unique stochastic topic model, which is based on the following assumptions:  X  Links can be explained by di  X  erent latent factors (over- X  Social links tend to be reciprocal and communities char- X  Topical links tend to exhibit a clear directionality and
More in details, the degree of involvement and role of user u in the community/topic k is governed by three parameters: (1) A k,u which measures the degree of the authoritativeness of u in k ;(2) S k,u which measures the degree of interest u in the topic k , or in other terms, the likelihood of following users that are authoritative in k (susceptibility to social in-fluence); and (3)  X  k,u denotes the social tendency of u ,i.e., her likelihood to connect to other social peers within com-munity k . Moreover, each latent factor k is characterized by a propensity to adopt certain features in F over others. We can formalize such a propensity by means of a weight k,f , denoting the importance of feature f within k .

All these components are accommodated in a mixture membership model expressed in a Bayesian setting [4], to define distributions governing the stochastic process, given some prior hypotheses. Bayesian modeling is better suited when the underlying data is characterized by high sparsity (like in our case), as it allows a better control of the priors which govern the model and it prevents overfitting.
In particular, we directly model each observed social link ( u, v ) 2 E or adoption of feature by a node ( u, f ) 2 F and in-troduce random variables on the source/destination of these observations. That is, for each link ( u, v ) 2 E we model the likelihood that there exists a latent factor k , such that u has high probability of being a source, while v has high proba-bility of being a destination. We further introduce a latent variable x u,v , which encodes the (social/topical) nature of an existing link. Analogously, the adoption of an observed feature association ( u, f ) 2 F will be explained by a latent factor k and by the status of the latent variable y u,f which represent the role of the user u , either as authoritative or just interested, when adopting the feature f .

The underlying generative process for social links and adoption of features depends jointly on the components  X  , A , S and , as described in Figure 1 and depicted in plate notation in Figure 2. The overall generative process is gov-erned by the following components:  X  A multinomial distribution  X  over a fixed number of  X  The multinomial distributions  X  k , A k and S k over the  X  The multinomial probability k over F which specify  X  The degree of X  X ociality X  k (or X  X opicality X , 1 k ) which  X  The  X  X uthoritative attitude X   X  k of observing the adop-Since the whole model relies on multinomial and Bernoulli distributions, a full Bayesian treatment can be obtained by adopting Dirichlet and Beta conjugate priors.

Let  X  = {  X  , ,  X  ,  X  , A , S } denote the status of the distri-butions described above. Both the probability of observing link l =( u, v ) and a feature assignment a =( u, f )canbeex-pressed as mixtures over the latent community assignments z and z a : The generation of a link changes depending on the status of the latent variable x l . A social connection l =( u, v )can only be observed if, by picking a latent community k , u and v have high degrees of social attitude  X  k,u and  X  k,v , that is Conversely, a topical connection l =( u, v ) can only be ob-served if, by picking a latent community k , u has a high degree of activeness A k,u and v have a high degree of pas-sive interest S k,u , that is Note that the likelihood of observing the reciprocal link ( v, u ) is equally likely in case of social connection, while it is di  X  erent in a topical context, and hence reflect our design assumption on the directionality of links in social/topical communities. Each link is finally generated by taking into account the social/topical mixture of each community: Similarly, the probability of observing a node-feature pair a =( u, f ) 2 F depends on the degree of authoritative-ness/susceptibility of the user and by the likelihood of ob-serving the attribute f within each latent factor k : Here, the term  X  k A k +(1  X  k ) S k defines a multinomial distri-bution over users, which encodes the joint (both susceptible and authoritative) attitude of users within that community.
We have described the intuitions behind our joint mod-eling of links and feature associations and now we focus on defining a procedure for inference and parameter estimation under WTFW .

Let  X  = { ~  X  , ~ X  , ~ , ~ , ~ X  , ~ = { 0 , 1 } , ~ X  = {  X  the set of hyperparameters of the Dirichlet/Beta priors. Also, let Z e represents a binary m  X  K matrix where z l,k denotes that link l has been associated with the k -th latent factor (i.e., z l = k ). Analogously, Z f denotes the t  X  K bi-nary matrix where z a,k = 1 denotes that feature assignment a 2 F is associated with the k -th latent factor ( z a = k ). Fi-nally, X and Y denote the vectors of assignments x l and y With an abuse of notation, we also introduce the counters described in Tab. 1, relative to these matrices.

The key problem in inference is to compute the posterior distribution of latent variables given the observed data. We start by expressing the joint likelihood as: where and Pr(  X  |  X  ) represents the product of all the Dirichlet and Beta priors. By marginalizing over  X  , we can obtain a closed form for the joint likelihood Pr( E, F, Z e , Z f , X , Y |  X  ). The latter is the basis for developing a stochastic EM strategy [3, section 11.1.6], where the E-step consists of a collapsed Gibbs sampling procedure [13, 3] for estimat-ing the matrices Z e , Z f , X and Y , and the M-step esti-mates both the predictive distributions in  X  and the hy-perparameters of interest in  X  . In particular, the sampling step consists of a sequential update of each arc and feature-assignment, of the status of the corresponding latent vari-ables in Z e , Z f , X and Y . A possible sampling strategy for each arc l 2 E and adoption a 2 F is based on the following chain: Pr( z l = k | Rest ) , Pr( z a = k | Rest ) , Pr( x and Pr( y a =1 | Rest ) 2 . By algebraic manipulations, we can devise the sampling equations expressed in Tab. 8. The over-all learning scheme is shown in Alg. 1. Lines 5-12 of the algorithm represent the Gibbs sampling steps, while line 14 represents the update of the multinomial distributions which are collapsed in the derivation of the sampling equations: In line 15 we update the Beta ( ~ , ~ X  ) and Dirichlet ~  X  hyper-parameters, according to the fixed point iterative procedure described in [20]. The final predictive distributions A , S ,  X  and  X  , and  X  are averaged along all the steps of the Gibbs sampling procedure.

A single iteration of the sampler performs O (( m + t )  X  K ) computations and hence it is linear on the size of observed data. In Alg. 1 we assume that the number K of topics is given as input; typically this value is determined experimen-tally as the number of topics that maximizes the predictive performances. However, it is possible to automatically de-vise the number of topics by relying on Bayesian nonpara-metrics. In fact, as shown in [7], it is possible to adapt the sampling equations in order to make explicit the annihilation of some topics as well the generation of new ones, according to the Chinese Restaurant Process principle.
 Algorithm 1 Gibbs-sampling with parameter estimation
The success of a recommender system does not only de-pend on its accuracy in inferring and exploiting users X  inter-ests, but it also relies on how the deployed recommendations are perceived by the users. Explanations increase the trans-parency of the recommendation process and may positively contribute in gaining users X  trust and satisfaction.
When generating explanations for social recommenda-tions, the first step is to understand if the proposed con-nection l =( u, v ) is social (i.e., such that x l = 1) or topical (i.e., x l =0). WTFW provides a natural way to do this:
Social connections have a natural explanation in terms of close-knit circles. Thus, for a given link l =( u, v ) predicted as social (i.e., such that x l = 1), we can provide an expla-nation as the set of the most prospective common neighbors , ranked according to the following score: This rank promotes common neighbors that have high de-gree of involvement in social communities where both u and v are involved as well. Interestingly, the score finds an ex-planation in terms of the probability of observing a social triangle among u , v and w . In fact, the joint probability of observing ( u, v ) , ( u, w ) and ( v, w ) within community k is proportional to  X  k,u  X  k,v  X  k,w . And, since by definition both ( u, w ) and ( v, w ) hold in the data, the score explain the prospective new link ( u, v ) in terms of the common neigh-bors which are more likely to devise a triangle in the data.
Conversely, topical links can be explained through a list of attributes which are representative of the topics of interest by the current user and for which the recommended connec-tion has high authority. For each feature common to the two nodes, we define the following score: rank ( f ; l )= Here, the latter term represents the topical involvement of the user u within community k . Again, the score has an interpretation in terms of the prospective triangle among ( u, v ) , ( u, f ) and ( v, f ). Notice, however, that the direction-ality plays a role here, since we are only interested in those features for which v is authoritative.

The procedure for producing explanations for a recom-mended link is summarized in Alg. 2. In short, the pro-cedure predicts the nature (either social or topical) of the prospective link, hence providing the list of most prominent neighbors/common features. Algorithm 2 Producing explanations
In this section we report the empirical assessment of the proposed WTFW model on real networks. The experimen-tation is aimed at assessing the following:  X  The accuracy of the model for what concerns both link  X  The scalability and stability of the learning procedure,  X  The quality of the associations between links and fea-Datasets. For our purposes we need datasets coming from social networking platforms in which links creation can be explained in terms of interest identity and/or personal social relations. This requirement is satisfied, among the others, by two popular social networking platforms, namely Twit-ter and Flickr . On both platforms, the underlying network is inherently directed to reflect interest of users towards im-portant, and authoritative, information sources. Moreover, in these systems the role of users may naturally change with respect to di  X  erent topics. The Twitter dataset we use is publicly available 3 and it includes information from 973 ego-networks crawled from the public API. The resulting network contains roughly 80 thousand nodes and 1 . 7mil-lion directed links. Attribute information consists in all the hashtags (e.g. #sanfrancisco) and mentions (e.g. @Barack-Obama), used by those users.
 Flickr data has been obtained by querying Flickr public API in the time window 2004 2008 and then by performing forest fire sampling [16] on the resulting network. Features are generated by crawling all the tags used by each users. Flickr also contains a form of ground-truth for the label prediction task. Specifically, for each link in the dataset there are two flags, namely friend and family , that a user can specify. We naturally interpret these flags as follows: a link is labeled as  X  X ocial X  if it is either marked as family or friend. Conversely, a link is  X  X opical X  if none of the two flags are set. It is important to stress that this ground-truth is expectedly very noisy as it is any user-declared information on the internet. As such, it is likely to produce an underes-timation of the accuracy in the label prediction task.
In order to keep the experimental setting as close as possi-ble to the original data (high dimensionality and exceptional sparsity), no further pre-processing has been performed. Basic statistics about these two datasets are given in Ta-ble 2. These datasets are characterized by di  X  erent prop-erties. The social graph in Twitter is much more directed and sparse than in Flickr , while the number of attributes per user is much higher in Flickr .
 Experimental setting. In all the experiments we assume a partial observation of the network and a complete set of user features. 4 The learning algorithm starts with a ran-dom assignments to latent variables, it performs a burn-in phase (burn-in=500) to stabilize the Markov chain, and the parameters of the model are updated at regular intervals (sampling lag=20) for the next 2000 iterations. We initial-ize hyperparameters with the following (symmetric) values:  X  = =  X  = 1 n , = 1 h ,  X  0 =  X  1 = 0 = 1 =  X  =2. Evaluation on link prediction. In a first set of experi-ments, we measure the accuracy of the model in predicting new links. On Twitter , we perform a Monte Carlo Cross-Validation in 5 folds, by randomly splitting the network into training and test data. We also measure the accuracy of the learned models for di  X  erent proportions of training/test, namely 60/40, 70/30, 80/20. This allows us to stress the ro-bustness of the link prediction task for di  X  erent proportions, and to mitigate the e  X  ects of the random splits. In Flickr instead the dataset contains the timestamp of creation of the link, allowing us to perform a chronological split, where older links (70% of the data) are used for learning the model, while the most recent 30% are used as prediction target.
The accuracy of link prediction is measured by computing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) over a set of positive and negative examples drawn from the test set. In principle, we can consider all links in the test-set as positive examples, and all non-existing links as negative example. However, the sparsity of the networks poses two major issues: ( i ) the number of non-existing links can be enormous, thus making the computation of the AUC infeasible; ( ii ) missing links do not necessarily represent negative information, but rather unseen information [28]. Following [1], we thus limit the negative examples to all the 2-hops non-existing links.
The task of predicting/recommending missing features is not investigated here and it is left as future work.
We compare the performance of the WTFW model with some popular baseline approaches from the literature, which perform well on a range of networks [18, 9]: Common Neigh-bors/Features (CNF) and Adamic-Adar (AA-NF) .CNFisa local similarity index that produces a score for each link ( u, v ), which is given by the number of common neigh-bors/features: AA-NF represents a refinement of the simple counting of common neighbors/features, which is achieved by assigning more weight to less-connected components. score ( u, v )= In addition, we compare WTFW with a matrix factoriza-tion approach based on SVD, dubbed Joint SVD (JSVD) [9]. In practice, the approach computes a low-rank factor-ization of the joint adjacency/feature matrix X =[ EF ]as X  X  U  X  diag ( 1 ,..., K )  X  V T , where K is the rank of the decomposition and 1 ,..., K are the square roots of the K greatest eigenvalues of X T X . The matrices U and V provide substantial interpretation in terms of connectivity of both E and F . The term U u,k can be interpreted as the tendency of u to be either a source in E or an adopter in F , relative to factor k . Analogously, V u,k represents the tendency of u to appear as a destination in E , and V f,k represents the likelihood that item f is adopted in k . The link prediction score can hence be computed as:
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the results of the evaluation, for increasing values of the number of latent topics/factors. On Twitter data, both WTFW and JSVD underperform when the number of latent factors is limited, but exhibit a com-petitive advange over the baselines for higher values of K . WTFW outperforms the other considered approaches and these results are stable on di  X  erent training/test set propor-tions. The prediction on Flickr is in general weaker for all methods. However, the results seems stabler, since the dif-ference with regards to JSVD remains constant for increas-ing values of K . The standard baselines perform poorly on this dataset. Figure 3 shows the slope of the ROC curves on both datasets for K =256.On Twitter , there are some lim-ited areas where the JSVD is skewed but, in general, WTFW clearly outperforms the other methods. This is even more evident on the Flickr dataset.
 Evaluation on link labeling. We next turn our atten-tion to the task of discriminating between social and topical links, thanks to the ground truth that we have in the Flickr dataset. Again, we measure the accuracy by computing the AUC on the prediction, and by comparing the result with a baseline based on common neighbors/features. That is, a link l =( u, v ) is deemed social if the weight of the common neighbors is higher than those of the common features, and topical otherwise. Formally:
Table 5 reports the results for increasing values of K . The best results are obtains on a lower number of topics, and in particular for K = 32. This is somehow surprising if we compare this results with the results on link prediction discussed above. In an attempt to explain such a behav-ior, we analysed the values of  X  and in the model, and we noticed that all models exhibit a strongly dominant la-tent factor. We will discuss this component also in the next subsection: it is worth mentioning, however that the associ-ated probability k leans towards 0 . 5 (a clear sign that the community tends to mix topical and social contributions). Clearly, the balanced value of k does not a  X  ect the perfor-mance in link prediction (as it only depends on whether any of the social/topical components is strong enough to trigger is computed as: Scores for measuring the degree of susceptibility and so-ciality can be computed likewise. Again, Twitter tends to exhibit a predominant amount of authorities/followers, whereas the great majority of the communities in Flickr tend to include social users. Finally, Figure 9 shows the estimated values of k within the communities. As already observed before, Flickr tends to be more clearly social than Twitter . Moreover, the distinction between social and topi-cal latent factors is very clear in Flickr with almost all com-munities having probability of being  X  X ocial X  either above 0.9, or below 0.2. This discriminating attitude is even more evident when we increase the number of latent topics.
Finally, a further assessment of the correct identification of social and topical latent factors can be performed by mea-suring, for a given feature f , the probability of observing it in a social/topical context, computed as follows: In Table 6 we validate the accuracy of the feature-labeling task on two small sets of tags. The first set contains key-words notably associated with social events, such as family , and wedding . The second set contains keywords specific to photographic techniques, e.g. hdr and polaroid , which are likely to generate topical interest in the users. The results confirm the capability of the model to discriminate between social and topical features.

Finally, Table 7 summarizes the top keywords detected by our approach on both datasets in some representative com-munities/topics: highly social communities (large ) have characteristic features (e.g., family , christmas on Flickr , and followback on Twitter ) which are clearly social.
This paper introduces WTFW , a novel stochastic gener-ative model that jointly factorizes both social connections and feature associations. The model provides accurate link prediction and contextualized socio/topical explanations to support the predictions. Our approach is based on latent factors which can be interpreted as communities of people sharing a similar behavior, and on the explicit modeling of the underlying latent nature behind each observed connec-tion. The result is a decoupling of social and topical con-nections to reflect the idea that social communities should have high density and reciprocal connections, whereas top-ical communities should exhibit clear directionality and a low entropy over user attributes.

Our work can be extended in several directions. First, we deliberately omitted to quantify the quality of the commu-nities that the model produces. Some initial results based on modularity look promising (we measured 0 . 55 and 0 . 37 on Twitter and Flickr , respectively). Also, the qualitative analysis in Section 4 clearly denotes the capability of the model to group users according to both connectivity and common features. However, we plan to devote to future work a more detailed treatment, as well a thorough compar-ison with other approaches in the literature.

Second, the approach explored in this paper is rooted on mixture membership topic modeling. However, other alter-natives are possible, which can be based on probabilistic matrix factorization. We plan to explore and compare these di  X  erent strategies in a future work. Acknowledgments.
