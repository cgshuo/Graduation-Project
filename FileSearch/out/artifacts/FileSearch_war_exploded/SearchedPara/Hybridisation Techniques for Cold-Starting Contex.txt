 Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARSs) suffer from the cold-start problem, i.e., the inability to provide accu-rate recommendations for new users, items or contextual situations. In this research, we aim at solving this problem by exploiting various hybridisation techniques, from simple heuristic-based solutions to complex adaptive solutions, in order to take advantage of the strengths of different CARS algorithms while avoiding their weaknesses in a given (cold-start) situation. Our initial research based on offline experi-ments using various contextually-tagged rating datasets has shown that basic CARS algorithms perform very differently in different recommendation scenarios, and that they can be effectively hybridised to achieve an overall optimal perfor-mance. Further research is now required to find the optimal method for hybridisation.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  information filtering Context-Aware Recommender Systems; Cold-Start Problem; Hybrid System
Context-Aware Recommender S ystems (CARSs) have been developed using several algorithms to provide users with rec-ommendations based on additional context information be-sides the typical user and item information. Roughly, they can be divided into three categories [1], namely contextual pre-filtering, contextual post-filtering and contextual mod-elling, depending on the recommendation stage where the available contextual information is used. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the proposed approaches is specifically addressing all kinds of cold-start problems occur-ring in CARSs, i.e., the new user, new item and new context problems.

While hybrid RSs are a well-accepted technique to deal with cold-start issues in traditional Recommender Systems (RSs), they have not yet systematically been applied to CARSs. Hybrid RSs combine in different ways several rec-ommendation techniques, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses, to achieve overall peak performance [7]. For instance, the new item problem, which is tampering with pure Collaborative Filtering (CF), can be avoided by rely-ing on a content-based component. Similarly, demographic approaches void the requirement of a history of user ratings needed by both CF and content-based techniques, and hence can be employed to alleviate the new user problem.
In our work, we extend this idea to deal with cold-start situations occurring in CARSs. In particular, we deal with: (i) the new user problem, which refers to the problem of providing relevant recommendations to new users with no rating history; (ii) the new item problem, which denotes the difficulty of accurately recommending items that are new to the system; (iii) the new context problem, which has not been explored in detail so far, and occurs when the system is requested to produce recommendations under new con-textual situations; and finally (iv) the possible mixtures of the aforementioned problems.

We hypothesise that these problems can effectively be alle-viated by hybrid approaches that combine the rating predic-tions from different CARS algorithms into one overall pre-diction. By combining multiple basic recommenders, which can be done using different techniques that range from sim-ple heuristics to more complex adaptive algorithms, the re-sulting hybrid should be able to produce meaningful rec-ommendations also in cold-start situations when the basic recommenders alone would fail.

We define the following research questions:
To address the above stated research questions, we will design, develop and test novel hybridisation techniques for combining the predictions of a suite of CARS algorithms, which can then be used for effectively cold-starting CARSs.
While there has been a lot of research on the cold-start problem for traditional RSs [17, 14], only few studies have examined it specifically for CARSs. One direct approach is to exploit additional information about the users, items or contextual situations in the recommendation process. But acquiring this information is a non-trivial task that requires substantial effort from the users and/or service providers. It can be obtained efficiently, for example, by employing an Active Learning (AL) strategy [10] or a cross-domain recom-mendation technique [11]. Another way more closely related to our research is by profiling users and items through at-tributes (e.g., demographics and item descriptions), and by using them to develop a hybrid CARS for overcoming the new user and new item problem [18]. There are several dif-ferent hybridisation methods for traditional RSs [7]. Two of the most prominent ones, which inspired our work, are weighted and switching. A weighted hybrid recommender, as illustrated, for instance, in [5, 12], is one that aggregates the rating predictions of all available recommendation tech-niques into a single value by using a selected aggregation method [13]. On the other hand, a switching hybrid, as de-scribed, e.g., in [9, 4], chooses the best-performing algorithm for recommendation depending on the current recommenda-tion situation. Switching hybrid can be considered a special case of weighting where a weight of 1 is assigned to the se-lected recommender, and 0 is assigned to all remaining ones.
Rather than relying on new ratings data or metadata, one can also try to better use the existing ratings data. One ex-ample of such approach is Differential Context Weighting (DCW) [19], which aims at alleviating the cold-start prob-lems caused by exact pre-filtering [1] by weighting contextual ratings based on their similari ty to a given target context. Another similar method, which we considered in our work, is Semantic Pre-Filtering (SPF) [8]. Also SPF exploits, in the recommendation process, not only contextual ratings that exactly match the target context but also those there were acquired in semantically similar contexts.
All the basic CARS algorithms as well as the hybrid solu-tions that we have considered so far in our research operate on a | Users | X | Items | X | Context | user-item-context rating tensor denoted as R . The tensor entry r uic 1 ,...,c k is the rat-ing of the user u on the item i in the contextual situation described by the contextual conditions c 1 , ..., c k ,and the index of the contextual condition for factor j (e.g., the index of condition  X  X unny X  X  for the  X  X eather X  contextual fac-tor). More details about the specific algorithms are given below. We have considered four basic CARS algorithms. CAMF-CC (Context-Aware Matrix Factorisation for item categories) denotes a variant of CAMF [3] that extends standard Ma-trix Factorisation (MF) by incorporating baseline parame-ters for each contextual condition and item category in order to model how the ratings of items belonging to a specific cat-egory are affected by the contextual conditions.

SPF (Semantic Pre-Filtering) [8] is a pre-filtering algo-rithm that, given a target contextual situation, uses a stan-dard MF model learnt from all ratings tagged with contex-tual situations identical or semantically equivalent to the target one. SPF is expected to perform well in cold-start situations since it reuses ratings tagged with contexts that, notwithstanding they are syntactically different, they actu-ally influence in a similar way the users X  ratings. Content-based CAMF-CC is a novel variant of CAMF-CC that we have designed to tackle the new item problem of CAMF-CC. It extends CAMF-CC by incorporating ad-ditional factor vectors for describing an item also through a set of item-associated attributes, such as the type of a place of interest (POI) and the actors or the genre of a movie.
Finally, Demographics-based CAMF-CC is another vari-ant of CAMF-CC that we propose for tackling the new user problem associated to CAMF-CC. It enhances the user rep-resentation by profiling users with additional factor vectors corresponding to known user attributes (demographics), for instance, gender, age group and personality traits.
Moreover, we have designed two hybridisation techniques that we compare here with a baseline, namely Average Weighted , which combines individual basic CARS algorithms simply by taking the average of their predicted ratings. The first tech-nique, called Heuristic Switching , was proposed by us in [6] and uses a stable heuristic in order to switch between the various basic algorithms depending on the encountered cold-start situation. It selects content-based CAMF-CC when requested to predict a rating for a new item, while it selects demographics-based CAMF-CC when predicting a rating for a new user or a new contextual situation. When a mixture of elementary cold-start cases is detected, it computes the predicted rating by averaging the predictions of the two con-stituent algorithms.

The second one, Adaptive Weighted refers to a novel adap-tive weighted hybrid CARS algorithm. It extends the two-dimensional adaptive RS presented in [5], and builds for each basic CARS algorithm a new user-item-context error tensor whose entries are the known deviations (errors) of the CARS predictions from the true ratings. Then, it trains a separate CARS error prediction model for each of these error tensors, and combines all the considered basic CARS differently for each user-item-context setting by weighting each of them in-versely proportional to its predicted error on that particular setting. As error prediction model, we chose a new variant of CAMF that is conceptually similar to the one illustrated in [11] and that uses latent factor vectors for modelling con-textual conditions, rather than scalar numbers, as in original CAMF. It leverages latent correlations and patterns between users, items as well as contexts in the data, and hence is well-suited to produce error predictions. Given a user u ,an item i , the subset of item-related contextual conditions and the subset of user-related contextual conditions UC ,it predicts errors using the following rule:  X  e where q i , p u , x c i and y c u are the latent factor vectors as-sociated to item i ,user u , item-related contextual condition c and user-related contextual condition c u , respectively,  X  is the average prediction error for item i ,and b u is the bias associated to user u . The model parameters are learnt by minimising the associated regularised squared error function through stochastic gradient descent.
This section describes the datasets, the evaluation proce-dure and the results of an offline experiment that we con-ducted to compare the cold-start performance of the afore-mentioned CARS algorithms.
For the experiment, we have considered three contextually-tagged datasets of ratings with different characteristics: STS [10], CoMoDa [15] and Music [2]. Table 1 provides some de-scriptive statistics of these datasets. We note that finding a suitable dataset for our evaluation purposes is not a trivial task because most of the standard datasets available for RS research can not be used as they are either too small, too sparse or they do not provide contextual tags and user/item attributes.

We ran experiments for three separate test cases, one for new users, one for new items, and one for new contextual sit-uations. Below, we describe the adopted testing procedure (i.e., ten-fold cross-validation test) for new users. The test-ing procedures for new items and new contextual situations were identical, except that here cross-validation was per-formed on the set of items and contextual situations rather than the set of users. 1. Divide the users into ten cross-validation folds (groups) 2. For each fold k =1 , 2 , ..., 10
The MAE and nDCG estimates from step 2(b) are then averaged over all 10 folds, to produce cross-validation esti-mates of the MAE and nDCG.

The above evaluation procedure could also be used for determining the models X  performance on mixtures of ele-mentary cold-start cases, simply by cross-validating on user-item, user-context, item-context and user-item-context tu-ples. However, we have not considered this yet, and it is left for future work. Another aspect not dealt with the above test procedure is the fact that there exist various degrees of coldness; currently we test the models X  performance on re-ally cold users, items and contextual situations, i.e., without any observed rating.
The results, which are summarised in Table 2, reveal some significant performance differences between the individual basic CARS algorithms across the different cold-start cases. For the new user situation, we observed the best overall performance for demographics-based CAMF-CC, which is consistent with our hypothesis since it profiles users not only in terms of explicit ratings, but also through known user attributes (i.e., demographics).
 In the new item situation, we found content-based CAMF-CC to be the best-performing CARS algorithm, thus also supporting our hypothesis. It works by incorporating item metadata into the CAMF-CC model, and hence can produce relevant recommendations also in the case when no ratings for the items are available.

Finally, regarding the new contextual situation scenario, we again observed the best performance of demographics-based CAMF-CC. Interestingly, we found a poor perfor-mance of SPF, especially for the Music dataset, which is due to the fact that here contextual situations are made up of only one contextual condition, thus making it impossible for SPF to correctly calculate similarities between contex-tual situations.

Considering the results for the hybrid CARS algorithms, we found that hybridisation techniques, including the simple Average Weighted method, can indeed improve performance in both MAE and nDCG in the different cold-start cases. In almost all cases, they outperformed the state-of-the-art CARS algorithms (i.e., CAMF-CC and SPF), thus easing the problem of model selection. This shows that our first developed hybridisation techniques, and likely more sophis-ticated follow-up versions, can provide an efficient solution for the cold-start problem in CARSs.
In the present research, we are trying to tackle the cold-start problems (i.e., new user problem, new item problem and new context problem) of CARSs by developing novel hy-brid recommendation techniques that exploit different CARS algorithms, and adaptively use these algorithms for rating prediction depending on their strengths and weaknesses in a given (cold-start) situation. This is a new topic and little or no research has been conducted specifically in this direction.
As future work, we plan to first continue our offline ex-periments, trying to extend our analysis to mixtures of el-ementary cold-start cases as well to different levels of cold-start. Secondly, it is necessary to try out further hybridis-ation techniques proposed in the research literature before [13], and to identify the best-performing one for cold-start purposes. Finally, we plan to integrate the developed hybrid CARS algorithm into our STS Android app [10] so that we can perform a live user study and compare the users X  per-ceived recommendation quality and choice satisfaction of our proposed algorithm against another state-of-the-art CARS algorithm (e.g., CAMF-CC or SPF).
