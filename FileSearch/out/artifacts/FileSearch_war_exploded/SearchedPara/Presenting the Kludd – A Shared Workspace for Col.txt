 In this poster, we would like to present the current state of the Kludd system . Kludd is a web -based collaboration tool, enabling users to collaborate around various media objects like images, videos, texts and audio in a shared workspace. The design metaphor is an online whiteboard, where multiple ac tors c an add, manipulate and remove o bjects, all while everyone sees the same view. The system is made with standard components like HTML5, CSS3 and a number of open -source j avascript libraries enabling real -time collaboration in a browser. Utilizing a Design Science Research methodology, the initial design was based on 9 design requirements. In this poster, a further four requirements are presented as a result of the analysis of the first phase, and an initial design of the second phase of the project is presented.

 Shared workspace , collaboration, real -time, HTML5 In this text, we would like to present the current state of development of the Kludd system. Kludd i s a shared workspace in the browser, where users can interact and collaborate around various media objects such as video, sound, images and texts. Developed using standardized technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, the system is enhanced with a number of ope n-source javascript libraries and frameworks that for example enable real-time visualization of co-present users , simplified upload of different types of media and manipulation of that media directly in the browser. As such, we are faced with a number of interesting challenges, both technical challenges as well as challenges regarding the interaction design. While the design of traditional web -based interfaces has seen extensive coverage in both the academia as well as in the web industry, design of web based shared real -time workspaces has seen less attention. We believe there is a need to explore these types of systems to further the knowledge of how to design collaborative system s in general and real -time shared workspaces in particular.
 The Kludd syst em is developed using a design science research (DSR) methodology (see for example [1], [2]), and at the time of writing the system is entering the second cycle of the process. In this cycle, the evaluation from the initial phase has led to a number of new requirements and, subsequently, changes to the functionality, user interface and interaction model . This poster will briefly outline the work done on the f irst phase leading up to the first set of design requirements, and elaborate on the design changes to be implemented in the second phase of the research project. As we are utilizing a DSR approach, kernel theories guiding the initial development is of great importance. The two main conceptual models for the system is  X  X ocial Translucen ce X , a concept int roduced by Erickson &amp; Kellogg [3 ]. Here, visibility, awareness and accountability are key factors in creating a social system. By visualizing users presence and activities, an awareness of each other is created. And with awareness, the co ncept of accountability is enabled. The idea is that  X  X  know you are there, I know what you are doing and I can hold you accountable for your actions in this shared environment X . And on the flip side,  X  X  know that you know I am here, what I am doing and ot hers can hold me accountable for my actions X . We believe this process is essential in a collaboration process, online and otherwise. The second main kernel theory derives from the concept of calm technology [4], where the user interface is designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, making itself visible when neede d or requested. The features of the system also come from a longitudinal study into awareness and its ro le in collabor ative computing (see Nilsson et al. [5] for more on the longitudinal study) . Together with two observation studies and focus groups, the final design requirements for the first phase of the DSR was assembled. The observation studies were conducted on the teacher X  X  end of a n online tutoring session in a higher education setting. The researchers followed the teacher s where they set up the sessions using a variety of tools and technologies available to them, such as voice communication, screen sharing a pplications and e -mail. The audio from the session was recorded and notes were taken at the time and the material was subsequently analyzed revealing areas where the interaction between tutor and student was sub -opti mal.
 The focus group sessions involved teachers experienced in web -based education. All had been involved in online tutoring and net -based collaboration, and the session s focused on what type of requirements a tool for collaboration would benefit from.
 The next section discusses the outcome of this methodological approach and provides a rationale for the subsequent design requirements. A key factor in creating a social system is ability of the system to support the creation, recre ation and reinforcement of social norms within the system [5]. An important factor in this ongoing process is to visualize co -present users and their actions. This is also supported by Ericson &amp; Kellogg [3] that suggests that a social system must be able to support the notion of awareness of others through visualization of their activities . Findings from the longitudinal study [5] show that we not only need current visualization, but also a historical insight into what has happened before. At the same time as there is a need to visualize the actions of other users in the system, both current and historical, there is also a need to enable both real -time and historic al conversations between users. Norms are developed and upheld by both words and actions [5]. With the Internet being such a diverse place with computers, tablets and phones used to connect to it , it is important to keep the system as open, platform independent and lightw eight as possible to enable as many users as possible to access the system. To further the ease of access, the system should not require a local installation of files. At the observation study, these issues became apparent, with users hav ing trouble running proprietary software due to restrictions to install applications locally on the computer. Such restrictions are common in for example educational institutions, libraries and other public spaces as well as In some workplaces.
 Along the same line , storing files in the cloud, thus removing the need for local storage of files that ar e collaborated around, and linking in resources like for example video from external services into the collaboration system would be beneficial to the s ystem design . The observation study also revealed a need to easily s hare documents with each other, prefe rably with document history. Issues that were prominent in the tutoring session revolved around what had been said at the previous tutoring session and what state the project was in back then.
 From the kernel theory o f calm technology, we derive the design notion that the system should be unobtrusive, only revealing its user interface when needed. The objects in the system and the awareness of co -present users should be the focus of attention, not the system itself. The requirements of the system are thus; The next section will outline the technologies used to develop the system based on these requirements. As described in the introduction, the Kludd system is developed using standards su ch as HTML5, and CSS3 and together with advanced javascript libraries and frameworks enables real -time shared workspaces in a browser. The HTML5 specifications enable incorporation of video and sound, and together with CSS3 developers are enabled to create powerful applications run in a modern browser. The HTML5 specifications are not finalized yet, and new features added and old ones altered, making the development of applications using these technologies somewhat cumbersome. To add to the uncertainty of w eb development with HTML5 and CSS3, modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Explorer have different levels of adherence to the current specifications of HTML5. As such, some parts of a web application might work bett er or worse in some browsers, while some functionality might not work at al in some browsers. As a developer, you must be prepared to handle all variations of browser X  X  specifications. One of the key features of HTML5 used by the Kludd system is the websoc ket. Unlike the older uni -directional webserver connection where the server sends the client browser data, the websocket connection is bi -directional enabling real -time communication between the webserver and client browser. In non-technical terms, this me ans that an action from a user can be sent to the web server, which then propagates this action to all other valid users. The websock et communication is central in the Kludd system, as it forms the foundation of the shared workspace, transferring the real-time data between users in the system. The next section will provide a description of how the interaction in the Kludd system is modeled. Upon entering a Kludd (see Figure 1  X  note that the system in the first phase was named  X  X loudBoard  X ), a user is presented with the objects that users belonging to the Kludd have added or created (or, if the Kludd is new, an empty space). Objects are adde d by dragging an object to the browser window containing the Kludd and drop it anywhere. This can be any type of file , for example images, PDF fil es, Microsoft Office documents or video files. Objects can also be added entering a link to a n object from the Internet. This can be links to a Vimeo or YouTube video, or an image from Dropbox. Twitter feeds and Instagram links can be added the same way. When an object is added, all other user of the Kludd can see the object being added and can begin to collaborate around it. Different filetypes are visualized in the system in various ways. For example, where an image is shown as is, a video is usually displayed with controls for playing and pausing while a more unusual file type could be displayed with a generic ico n symbolizing the file. An object can be moved, resized and manipulated in various ways (depending on the objects nature) or hidden by any user . Users can also annotate objects with comments. While using the system, other users pointers are visible, so eve ry move a user makes is visible to others . Other users pointers have their respective names attached, so one knows what pointer belongs to whom. Obviously, this is only applicable to users utilizing a computer to access the Kludd. Using a phone or tablet w ith touch input, a pointer is not visible until the user starts to manipulate an object or tap somewhere in the Kludd.
 While t he Kludd is mostly a real -time system visualizing current activities , it also incorporates an historical view. Using a slider, use rs can reverse the Kludd, and see how it looked at any time in the past. Users can follow the build -up of texts, different placements of images etc. In this view, users are also allowed to revive hidden objects on the Kludd, thus making them usable in the real-time view. Figure 1. The Kludd System , first phase The Kludd system was evaluated using students in an online university course. The students evaluated the system and wrote a report on their experiences using the system in small groups . Each group was given a separate Kludd space to evaluate. The student X  X  reports were used to evaluate the Kludd together with the logs that the system was automatically creating as the students used the system . The reports were a nalyzed with the aim to identify different types of problems or errors in the system. The reports and the logs revealed four main issues with the system. First, as the system used new ways of interaction not familiar to the students , the student X  X  preconceived mental models of how to interact with more traditional functions on a website became an issue. As an example, a text field where users could annotate objects in the Kludd was perceived as a  X  X hat X , and evaluated as such. We believe that it is important in the nex t phase to create a better visual distance between traditional designs of interaction and interaction in a collaborative web system. Secondly, users expected a multi -modal experience. They stated that seeing the pointers of others moving around while not hearing anyone speak or seeing them was eerie. We believe there is a point in enabling a more rich experience, giving the users an option to enable both sound of others as well as video of each other in the system.
 The third aspect involved a hesitation t o use the system and skepticism as to the functionality. For example, a s users uploaded objects to the Kludd , it was often followed by a text saying,  X  X an you see the image I just uploaded X . As the users just see their view in a shared workspace, it would perhaps be a good idea to in some ways notify uploaders t hat others can see their image.
 The fourth issue was with the awareness system itself  X  users were often not aware of who was lo gged in and who was doing what. The system was inadequate in making use rs feel aware of each other and everyone X  X  actions , juxtaposing the actual purpose of the system . This is a main issue that will be addressed in the second phase of DSR process.
 As the evaluation of the first phase of the design cycle concluded, it became app arent that the system had to incorporate further design requirements to be sufficient as a real -time shared workspace collaboration tool. The following section will outline the work currently undertaken to formalize the evaluation into design requiremen ts, and the practical work of realizing the new design The following addi tional design requirements can b e derived from the evaluation of the first phase of the DSR. These four requirements together with the original nine, will provide the basis of the Kludd system being bui lt in the second phase of the design science research project. We believe that this project has a potential to add to the body of knowledge on collaborative systems, and more specif ically on real -time, shared workspace systems. As the second phase of the project has started at the time of writing, we have begun work on incorporating these new requirements by tweaking th e user interface and interaction model. The main focus lies in providing a better way of creating an awareness of the presence and actions of other users, as this is cornerstone in a collaborative system. We are increasing the visibility of the pointers o f co -present users, making their actions more prominent. We also work on better visualizing users entering and leaving the system, making a list of who is present clearer. We are also focus on removing all graphical elements of the system not immediately n ecessary, thus putting more focus on the objects in the system and the visualization of others X  activities. To further the awareness of others, we are including a video conferencing function, where users can engage in more natural conversations alongside visualization of actions within the system. We believe this is going to heighten the feeling of awareness of others in the system, as well as removing the eerie feeling described in the reports. Further, we are going to work on distancing the interaction models of the Kludd system from traditional interaction models for web based systems. Exploring a n interaction design of for example a real -time collaborative text-editing module is a challenge we are facing in this second phase. Creating a loopback function , where we are going to provide feedback to users that their own actions are visible to others in the shared workspace is going to be a challenge.
 Figure 2 shows an early version of the reworked Kludd, though being an interactive system, an image will not make it justice. Here, we have removed much of the interface to the left of the screen , making the controls  X  X n demand X , when the users are requesting it.
 Figure 2. The second phase Kludd As new users are entering a Kludd, their image is shown for a brief period of time to signal to other users that a new person has joined the Kludd. Further, when a person leaves the system, their image is shown and slowly faded away to symbolize their departure. The faces of those present at the moment are available on demand, so anyone can check to see who is present.
 With the second phase of this resea rch project, we hope to be able to shed further li ght on the aim of this research; to add to the body of knowledge of how to design real -time shared workspaces.
