 Iraklis A. Klampanos Introduction to Information Retrieval by Manning, Prabhakar and Schu  X  tze is the authors X  latest book on Information Retrieval (IR). While it is primarily meant to be used as a textbook for relevant university courses, this book combines a near-complete view of the theoretical foundations of IR alongside a consistent and well-presented treatment of many issues that arise on a practical, implementation-centric level. This approach makes this book a useful resource not only to senior university students but also to IR researchers and keen software engineers and computer scientists alike. After the successful book, Foun-dations of Statistical Natural Language Processing by Manning and Schu  X  tze, 1 it is of no surprise that the authors have also included an extensive (as far as IR books go) intro-duction to the neighboring research fields of Machine Learning and Numerical Methods. Another worth-noting fact, which separates this book from other textbooks in the field, is that this has been made fully available on the Web, encouraging students and professionals to communicate their comments and ideas to the authors, thus making it an increasingly accurate and useful resource.

 The book starts off with a solid introduction to the field through the presentation of the Boolean retrieval model. The introduction of information retrieval concepts, such as information need , relevance , precision and recall are given through applied examples of Boolean retrieval. Using the Boolean model alongside real-life examples is both educa-tionally useful as well as it is engaging for the reader. A first look at the inverted index is given early in the book, placing the content well into a perspective of data structures and algorithms. Building on this trend and given the introduction of the rather straightforward Boolean model the authors choose to dedicate the first eight chapters of the book to algorithmic and implementation issues. To the reviewer X  X  understanding this approach is particularly beneficial for educational purposes as it is not uncommon for students to fail to see the connection between the theory behind IR and its corresponding engineering aspect.
In Chapter 2 the book introduces the term vocabulary and the posting lists while at the same time it discusses issues that arise with variable indexing granularity. It goes on to discuss other techniques that frequently arise in the IR workflow, such as the extraction of indexing tokens from text, the removal of stop-words and stemming. Following this, the book progresses onto discussing positional indexing and phrase retrieval, always providing related algorithms, examples and exercises. Chapter 3 discusses appropriate data structures for implementing dictionaries for efficient searching. It then goes further into addressing tolerant retrieval , including wildcard queries and spelling correction, from an algorithmic perspective, introducing various relevant concepts as needed. Chapters 4 and 5 take the reader into index creation and compression. Various aspects of index creation are intro-duced through the discussion of single-pass in-memory indexing , distributed indexing for large collections as well as dynamic indexing for frequently changing corpora. Heap X  X  and Zipf X  X  laws are discussed before the authors present algorithms and techniques on index compression. However, the book does not explicitly cover the problem of distributed IR as this is found in remote digital libraries, in peer-to-peer networks and in the open Internet; instead it suffices to provide a few pointers for further reading.
 Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the concepts of document scoring and term weighting . Again, the authors, from a practical viewpoint, start off by introducing ranked Boolean retrieval along with its corresponding algorithm. By introducing the now standard term-weighting scheme tf-idf the book then goes onto presenting the vector-space model and variants of it. Through these particularly important concepts, the authors provide the necessary motivation and theoretical background as well as insight into their algorithmic and implementation angles. Chapter 8 concludes the first part of the book by introducing the basics of IR evaluation . This chapter includes descriptions of the most commonly used test collections before it progresses into evaluation methods, measures and algorithms. After having given the standard treatment on evaluation, the authors provide justifications and critiques for the material presented and also put the problem of IR evaluation within an application context. This should give the reader the opportunity to zoom out from the technical bits and pieces of evaluation, develop a critical approach and apply or customise existing approaches to his or her needs.

At this stage the keen reader should have reached a firm understanding of IR basics, from concept to implementation, and should therefore be able to follow the rest, more advanced topics that follow.
 The next part of the book, spanning Chapters 9 X 12, covers more advanced IR subjects. Chapter 9 focuses on relevance feedback while also giving an introduction on query expansion . It provides a thorough presentation of the widely used Rocchio algorithm along with appropriate examples and illustrations. The book then provides a discussion on the usefulness of relevance feedback before presenting additional instantiations of the para-digm, such as its use on the Web. Chapter 10 introduces the problem of retrieval over collections of XML documents. After introducing the technical elements of XML docu-ments, the authors present the challenges in XML retrieval. A transposition of the vector-space model for XML documents is of particular interest as well as evaluation methods and techniques targeted specifically to XML retrieval.

Chapters 11 and 12 introduce the probabilistic angle of IR and are, therefore, of par-ticular importance to any advanced IR course. Chapter 11 starts off with a very brief review of basic probability rules which are used later in this one as well as in consequent chapters. Even though it is understood that this book should not need to provide an extensive treatment of probability theory, it is the reviewer X  X  opinion that a slightly longer and more thorough introduction to probability theory would be beneficial. The probability ranking principle is then introduced before the book progresses into a thorough treatment of the binary independence model . While the authors present the theoretical and conceptual foundations of probability estimation for IR, being consistent with the general approach of the book they also briefly discuss probability estimation from a practical standpoint, giving useful pointers for further reading. This chapter finishes off with an introduction to the Okapi BM25 weighting scheme. Chapter 12, building on concepts introduced earlier, offers an introduction to probabilistic language models for IR. After briefly describing the basics of language modelling the book focuses on the query likelihood model , which arguably forms the basis of most language modelling studies and solutions in the field. Like in other chapters, a critical approach is taken, which motivates and helps the reader to put the material into perspective.

The primary focus of the next part of the book, comprising Chapters 13 X 15, is text classification and its applications, such as filtering, document sorting and specialist, or vertical, search engines. Chapter 13 introduces the reader to the problem of text classifi-cation, where important concepts, such as training set and classifier are introduced. The book then goes onto introducing the naive Bayes classification method, where the multi-nomial and the multivariate Bernoulli models are also explained and contrasted. Feature selection , as a way of reducing the vocabulary size before classification, and issues of evaluation of text classification are also introduced in this chapter. Chapter 14 introduces the vector-space family of classification methods. Among the methods presented are the Rocchio classification method and the k nearest neighbour both carefully explained, outlining theoretical and algorithmic characteristics. Building up on the previous two chapters, Chapter 15 introduces support vector machines , thus providing a machine learning approach to text classification. Linear and non-linear support vector machines are introduced before the book goes onto discussing the practical issues that arise when applying text classification, such as application feasibility, choosing a classifier, etc. This chapter concludes with an example of applying machine-learning methods for ad hoc retrieval. Like similar sections in other parts of the book, it provides useful insight onto a possible application of machine-learning for IR while it helps the reader to appreciate the material learnt within a greater context.
 Following document classification, Chapters 16 X 18 deal with document clustering . Chapter 16 introduces the problem of flat clustering approaches, i.e. document clustering algorithms where no structure is retained. After properly stating the problem, the book discusses methods for evaluating clustering through internal (by observing the document clusters obtained by an algorithm) or external criteria (by matching the document clusters to a golden standard ). The K-means clustering algorithm is then introduced as the most important of the flat clustering approaches. The chapter concludes with the more advanced topic of model-based clustering , where the expectation-maximisation algorithm is also discussed. Contrasting flat clustering algorithms, Chapter 17 deals with hierarchical clustering algorithms. The largest part of the chapter is devoted to hierarchical agglom-erative clustering , where many important concepts are introduced. Single-link , complete-link , group-average and centroid clustering are all introduced in a concise and useful manner. The book then goes onto briefly discussing the thinking behind divisive clustering but for further information the reader is referred to cited work. The chapter concludes with the introduction of the problem of cluster labelling for user interfaces and notes on implementation. Making the case for dimensionality reduction, also highlighted in the previous chapters, Chapter 18 introduces the algebraic operations of matrix decomposition as well as latent semantic indexing .

The final part of the book deals with IR on the Web. Chapter 19 offers an introduction to the basics of Web IR. In this chapter the reader will find a brief historical background as well as a number of important technical issues along with appropriate solutions, such as the estimating index sizes of search engines, dealing with duplicate and near-duplicate web pages, etc. The design of Web crawlers and the distribution of indexes for Web IR are the focus of Chapter 20. This chapter follows the technical approach of the previous one, providing the reader with an architectural view of a Web crawler as well as introducing potential problems that might arise when crawling. Practical considerations, such as the distribution of the crawler components or the issue of efficiency when performing DNS resolution are explicitly discussed. This chapter concludes with a brief discussion on index distribution as well as with dealing with connectivity/linkage queries. Chapter 21 intro-duces the basics of link analysis, thus providing a more abstract view on the Web than the two previous chapters. PageRank and HITS are also introduced as two distinctively important algorithms for Web IR.

To the reviewer X  X  opinion, Introduction to Information Retrieval is a comprehensive, well-written textbook. Despite having a few omissions, whose importance would be dic-tated by the target curriculum and the approach of the academic, this book has a number of strong points. The layout of the book makes it easy to follow, with worked examples, advanced material and exercise difficulty levels clearly marked. Each chapter provides adequate motivation and concludes with a section providing references for further reading. Exercises can be found at the end of most sections of the book. The fact that there is an online, freely accessible version of the book not only does it make it easier for students and teachers to communicate more effectively, but it also provides a means to provide useful feedback to the authors X  X omething which they also acknowledge. Last but not least comes the balance between theory, abstraction and implementation that this book pro-motes. Wherever appropriate the authors provide relevant algorithms as well as design and implementation considerations. This makes the book appealing to people interested in the technical aspects of IR, while it should make the experience of computer science students more useful and rewarding.
