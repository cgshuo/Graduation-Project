 The reliable, secure and economical commercial forecasting plays an important role in the business field. Therefore forecasting methods have been studied deeply and technologies [1]-[3]. The classical methods mainly include many models based on network methods and expert system approaches [4]-[11]. In practice all these methods have been applied in the research of time series to certain degrees. However, because of time series X  near-periodicity, non-stationarity and nonlinearity, difficulties do occur when using these methods to solve practical problems [4], [6]. Firstly, Classical time series analysis methods mainly depend on linear time model and linear spectral estimation. Although these methods are based on the simple theories and are convenient to be applied in practice, when forecasting precision needs to be enhanced forecasting speed becomes slower due to time series X  essence of non-linearity. Secondly, expert system techniques, utiliz ing the knowledge and analogical reasoning of experienced human operators, have been investigated [12]. Although expert system can synthesize many influencing factors, its knowledge base is very difficult to describe and build and its parameters can't be adjusted flexibly. As a result, in practice, the application of expert system is much limited. In addition, several research groups have studied the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) [13], [14] for ANN techniques are excellent tools to describe nonlinear relation [5]. However when the dependence of ANN learns represents relatively strong nonlinearity, it into local minimum and the convergence speed is extremely low, and finally a great quantity of cyber-resources and times have been consumed. This proves that ANN intend to apply wavelet methods into data mining in the business field, and elucidate in details the procedure and effect of this new method applied in the time series prediction, through analyzing the real data of one supermarket. In this paper the data processing flow can be divided into four phases. The first phase the wavelet decomposition. It aims to attain the wavelet decomposition series and the modeling and forecasting. Its role is modeling and forecasting for these wavelet decomposition series at each transformation domains by using BP neural net, and for the final scale decomposition series by using ARMA model. The fourth is the wavelet reconstruction. Here the wavelet reconstructions have been achieved with purpose of synthesizing those forecast series obtained at each transformation domains, to system final forecasting, utilizing the wavelet reconstruction technique. 
In figure 1, original system is any time series needs to be analyzed. Wavelet denoising level 1, Wavelet decomposition level 2, wavelet decomposition level 3... wavelet decomposition level M are M wavelet decomposition series of original time series at M levels (decomposition layer) and their notations are respectively. Scale decomposition level M is M th scale decomposition series, its notation is M a . 
The final phase of these forecasting models is to synthesize forecasting series at various transformation domains in order to obtain final forecasting series by using wavelet reconstruction technology. There will be an analysis of 2688 sample datum (4 weeks) of one supermarket, and make forecasting. 3.1 Noise Elimination of Original Data by Wavelet Analysis Because the original data we collected contain big noise, the original data have obvious false data and can X  X  be used directly. Aiming to this problem, noise elimination processing using the fault soft threshold due to the lack of enough data and correlative empirical equation. The fault threshold we assigned is 32.259. The low frequency coefficient hasn X  X  quantization of threshold. The wavelet we chose is biorthogonal wavelet, and its parameter is (4,4) and level number is 5. The results comparison between original data and de-noised results are shown in figure 2 and figure 3. 
In the following text, the time series of load we will analyze are the de-noised time series except for special illustration. 3.2 Wavelet Decompositions decomposition series is decreased doubly with scale increased doubly. Since the scale of the new series is different on each scale, the intervals of samples from neighboring series and original series have the same length and sample, and name them as redundant wavelet transformation and redundant scale transformation. The coefficient of Low-pass filter in Biorthogonal wavelets bior(4,4) is (0, 0.0378, -0.0238, -0.1106, 0.3774, 0.8527, 0.3774, -0.1106, -0.0238, 0.0378), the coefficient of High-pass filter is (0, -0.0645, 0.0407, 0.4181, -0.7885, 0.0407, 0.4181, -0.0645, 0, 0), they also have 10 coefficient. 
In figure 4, on the top is the primitive time series of 1344 data, its notation is S. In 5th scale level is a 5 . The wavelet transformation time series of 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st series S, a 5 and d 5 , and this near-periodicity is one day, it reflects for 96 continuous points in the figure. 
As for scale level, in fact 1st scale level corresponds to scale 2, afterwards 4, 8, and 16, 32 in turn. When scale is short, wavelet transformation series express strong change, embodying that the reliance relation of the data is not good, namely, the these show that this component have no great impact on change trend of original time series, it is just a kind of part influence factor, so the prediction data of this time series wavelet time series becomes more and more smooth. It becomes plainness in the 5th much longer. In addition, the scale transformations in 5th scale has also become plain and keep the same trend with the original time series, furthermore its value is close to the original time series. This shows that the scale transformation series has the essential impact on original time series. The characters of the time series make wavelet-neural networks-ARMA model available to predict and analysis the original time series. 3.3 Modeling and Forecasting in Scale When BP neutral nets are built at five wavelet transformation domains, every net model includes three layers, namely, an input layer, a hidden layer and a output layer, and there is only one output cell in every output layer. Design parameters of the five net models are shown in the table 1. In this table, the notation BP 1 is the BP neutral net model, which is built for d 1 . 
Because the characteristic of these 5 wavelet transformation series is that the range changed is very small relative to original series, and d 5 which range changed is a little succession. For example, there are 13 input cells in model BP 5 , and X={ x1 , x 2 ... x 13 } and x 2 is a vector which consists of the second 96 data of series d 5 , and so on. scale decomposition series a 5 received zero equalization transfers, then the problem of series ( x 1 , x 2 ... x n ) fit into ARMA ( p , q ) model, the model is: 
Firstly the parameter evaluation is processed. The regression approximation method is applied in this paper and consists of two steps. The first step is to make the of evaluation and reduce calculation amount, we select p = 300 in this paper. The fitted model is: The second step is to calculate fitted residual error through the formula (2). matrix form: when we fit into ARMA ( p , q ) model. Therefore it is essential to evaluate the values of p and q when the formula (1) is fitted, AIC order-confirmation criterion is employed to get the ARMA (2, 1) model in this paper. Next this model will forecast the scale transformation series of 5th scale as follows: 
After k  X   X  values have been confirmed  X  each x n  X  k can be ascertained via confirmation of x n  X  k conditional expectation, namely 
When k &gt;1, moving average part disappear, x n  X  k near-forecasting value can be calculated combining with known k  X   X  , then the transformation series mean value finally. 3.4 Short Term Time Series Forecasting According to the wavelet method, in order to get the systematic short-term forecast of 15-minute interval, wavelet rebuild technol ogy is used to combine the six forecasting series in turn and finally get the prediction data. 
In order to compare with other methods (for example, only using BP neural networks or ARMA for model building), N z z N mean square error is used to describe index of forecasting performance. t z stands for the actual data of time series, and t z  X  stands for the forecasting data. After using 1334 datum of two weeks predicts 96 data in the next day through three different methods, the indexes of forecasting performance of three methods, which are wavelet-NN-ARMA method, BP-NN method and ARMA method, are shown in the table 2. These results prove that the performance of wavelet-NN-ARMA is more ideal than the other two methods X . 
In order to show forecasting performance further there are statistic result by relative error in the table 3, 4 and 5. According to this comparison  X  the advantage of wavelet-NN-ARMA method is even apparent. The statistical results of relative error analysis of load forecast on the next day for ecasted by above-mentioned three forecast methods are shown respectively in the tabl e 3, 4 and 5. These comparison results demonstrate the superiority of the method in this paper adequately. Wavelet denoising is emphasized in this paper. Combining wavelet, ARMA model and neural networks in data mining time series forecast can not only separate all kinds of hidden periods and describe them effectively, but also well depict its essential analysis of the examples in practice proves that, the forecast method mentioned in this paper can be applied successfully and effectively in the business field.
