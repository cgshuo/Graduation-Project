 Automatic detection of sarcasm is still in its infa n-cy. One reason for the lack of computational mod-els has been the absence of accurately-labeled naturally occurring utterances that can be used to train machine learning systems. Microblogging platforms such as Twitter, which allow users to communicate feelings, opinions and ideas in short messages and to assign labels to their own messag-es, have been recently exploited in sentiment and opinion analysis (Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Davi-dov et al., 2010). In Twitter, messages can be an-notated with hashtags such as #bicycling, #happy and #sarcasm. We use these hashtags to build a labeled corpus of naturally occurring sarcastic, positive and negative tweets. In this paper, we report on an empirical study on the use of lexical and pragmatic factors to distin-guish sarcasm from positive and negative senti-ments expressed in Twitter messages. The contributions of this paper include i) creation of a corpus that includes only sarcastic utterances that have been explicitly identified as such by the com-poser of the message; ii) a report on the difficult y of distinguishing sarcastic tweets from tweets that are straight-forwardly positive or negative . Our results suggest that lexical features alone are not sufficient for identifying sarcasm and that pragmat -ic and contextual features merit further study. Sarcasm and irony are well-studied phenomena in linguistics, psychology and cognitive science (Gibbs, 1986; Gibbs and Colston 2007; Kreuz and Glucksberg, 1989; Utsumi, 2002). But in the text mining literature, automatic detection of sarcasm i s considered a difficult problem (Nigam &amp; Hurst, 2006 and Pang &amp; Lee, 2008 for an overview) and has been addressed in only a few studies. In the context of spoken dialogues, automatic detection of sarcasm has relied primarily on speech-related cues such as laughter and prosody (Tepperman et al., 2006). The work most closely related to ours i s that of Davidov et al. (2010), whose objective was to identify sarcastic and non-sarcastic utterances in Twitter and in Amazon product reviews. In this paper, we consider the somewhat harder problem of distinguishing sarcastic tweets from non-sarcastic tweets that directly convey positive and negative attitudes (we do not consider neutral ut-terances at all). Our approach of looking at lexical features for identification of sarcasm was inspired by the work of Kreuz and Caucci (2007). In addition, we also look at pragmatic features, such as establishing common ground between speaker and hearer (Clark and Gerring, 1984), and emoticons. In Twitter, people (tweeters) post messages of up to 140 characters (tweets). Apart from plain text, a tweet can contain references to other users (@&lt;user&gt;), URLs, and hashtags (#hashtag) which are tags assigned by the user to identify topic (#teaparty, #worldcup) or sentiment (#angry, #happy, #sarcasm). An example of a tweet is:  X  X UserName1 check out the twitter feed on @UserName2 for a few ideas :) http://xxxxxx.com #happy #hour X . 
To build our corpus of sarcastic (S), positive (P) and negative (N) tweets, we relied on the annota-tions that tweeters assign to their own tweets usin g hashtags. Our assumption is that the best judge of whether a tweet is intended to be sarcastic is the author of the tweet. As shown in the following sec-tions, human judges other than the tweets X  authors, achieve low levels of accuracy when trying to clas-sify sarcastic tweets; we therefore argue that usin g the tweets labeled by their authors using hashtag produces a better quality gold standard. We used a Twitter API to collect tweets that include hashtags that express sarcasm (#sarcasm, #sarcastic), direct positive sentiment (e.g., #happy, #joy, #lucky), an d direct negative sentiment (e.g., #sadness, #angry, #frustrated), respectively. We applied automatic filtering to remove retweets, duplicates, quotes, spam, tweets written in languages other than Eng-lish, and tweets with URLs. (2010) that tweets with #hashtags are noisy, we automatically filtered all tweets where the hashtag s of interest were not located at the very end of the message. We then performed a manual review of the filtered tweets to double check that the remain -ing end hashtags were not part of the message. We thus eliminated messages about sarcasm such as  X  X  really love #sarcasm X  and kept only messages that express sarcasm, such as  X  X ol thanks. I can always count on you for comfort :) #sarcasm X . of the three categories, sarcastic, positive and negative. Examples of tweets in our corpus that are labeled with the #sarcasm hashtag include the fol-lowing: The sarcastic tweets are primarily negative (i.e., messages that sound positive but are intended to convey a negative attitude) as in Examples 2-4, but there are also some positive messages (messages that sound negative but are apparently intended to be understood as positive), as in Example 1. In this section we address the question of whether it is possible to empirically identify lexical and pragmatic factors that distinguish sarcastic, posi-tive and negative utterances. Lexical Factors. We used two kinds of lexical fea-tures  X  unigrams and dictionary-based. The dictio-nary-based features were derived from i) Pennebaker et al. X  X  LIWC (2007) dictionary, which consists of a set of 64 word categories grouped int o four general classes: Linguistic Processes (LP) (e.g., adverbs, pronouns), Psychological Processes (PP) (e.g., positive and negative emotions), Per-sonal Concerns (PC) (e.g, work, achievement), and Spoken Categories (SC) (e.g., assent, non-fluencies); ii) WordNet Affect (WNA) (Strappara-va and Valitutti, 2004); and iii) list of interject ions The latter are inspired by results from Kreuz and Caucci (2007). We merged all of the lists into a single dictionary. The token overlap between the words in combined dictionary and the words in the tweets was 85%. This demonstrates that lexical coverage is good, even though tweets are well known to contain many words that do not appear in standard dictionaries. Pragmatic Factors. We used three pragmatic fea-tures: i) positive emoticons such as smileys; ii) negative emoticons such as frowning faces; and iii) ToUser , which marks if a tweets is a reply to another tweet (signaled by &lt;@user&gt; ). Feature Ranking. To measure the impact of fea-tures on discriminating among the three categories, we used two standard measures: presence and fre-quency of the factors in each tweet. We did a 3-way comparison of Sarcastic (S), Positive (P), and Negative (N) messages (S-P-N); as well as 2-way comparisons of i) Sarcastic and Non-Sarcastic (S-NS); ii) Sarcastic and Positive (S-P) and Sarcasti c and Negative (S-N). The NS tweets were obtained by merging 450 randomly selected positive and 450 negative tweets from our corpus. 
We ran a most useful in discriminating categories. Table 1 shows the top 10 features based on presence of all dictionary-based lexical factors plus the pragmatic In all of the tasks, negative emotion ( Negemo ), positive emotion ( Posemo ), negation ( Negate ), emoticons ( Smiley, Frown ), auxiliary verbs ( AuxVb ), and punctuation marks are in the top 10 features. We also observe indications of a possible dependence among factors that could differentiate sarcasm from both positive and negative tweets: sarcastic tweets tend to have positive emotion words like positive tweets do ( Posemo is a signifi-cant feature in S-N but not in S-P), while they use more negation words like negative tweets do ( Ne-gate is an important feature for S-P). Table 1 also shows that the pragmatic factor ToUser is impor-tant in sarcasm detection. This is an indication of the possible importance of features that indicate common ground in sarcasm identification. In this section we investigate the usefulness of le x-ical and pragmatic features in machine learning to classify sarcastic, positive and negative Tweets. We used two standard classifiers often employed in sentiment classification: support vector machine with sequential minimal optimization (SMO) and logistic regression (LogR). For features we used: 1) unigrams; 2) presence of dictionary-based lexi-quency of dictionary-based lexical and pragmatic with bigrams and trigrams; however, results using these features did not report better results than u ni-balanced datasets (900 instances per class) and tested through five-fold cross-validation. 
In Table 2, shaded cells indicate the best accura-cies for each class, while bolded values indicate the best accuracies per row. In the three-way clas-sification (S-P-N), SMO with unigrams as features as features. Overall SMO outperformed LogR. The best accuracy of 57% is an indication of the diffi-culty of the task. 
We also performed several two-way classifica-tion experiments. For the S-NS classification the best results were again obtained using SMO with 
Table 2: Classifiers accuracies using 5-fold cross-unigrams as features (65.44%). For S-P and S-N the best accuracies were close to 70%. Overall, our best result (75.89%) was achieved in the polarity-based classification P-N. It is intriguing that the machine learning systems have roughly equal dif-ficulty in separating sarcastic tweets from positiv e tweets and from negative tweets. 
These results indicate that the lexical and prag-matic features considered in this paper do not pro-vide sufficient information to accurately differentiate sarcastic from positive and negative tweets. This may be due to the inherent difficulty of distinguishing short utterances in isolation, without use of contextual evidence. 
In the next section we explore the inherent diffi-culty of identifying sarcastic utterances by compar -ing human performance and classifier performance. To get a better sense of how difficult the task of sarcasm identification really is, we conducted thre e studies with human judges (not the authors of this paper). In the first study, we asked three judges t o classify 10% of our S-P-N dataset (90 randomly selected tweets per category) into sarcastic, posi-tive and negative. In addition, they were able to indicate if they were unsure to which category tweets belonged and to add comments about the difficulty of the task.

In this study, overall agreement of 50% was achieved among the three judges, with a Fleiss X  Kappa value of 0.4788 (p&lt;.05). The mean accuracy was 62.59% (7.7) with 13.58% (13.44) uncertainty. When we considered only the 135 of 270 tweets on which all three judges agreed, the accuracy, com-puted over to the entire gold standard test set, fe ll agree (43.33%) and the average accuracy (62.59%) as a human baseline interval (HBI). 
We trained our SMO and LogR classifiers on the other 90% of the S-P-N. The models were then evaluated on 10% of the S-P-N dataset that was also labeled by humans. Classification accuracy was similar to results obtained in the previous sec -S-P-N). The highest value in the established HBI achieved a slightly higher accuracy; however, when compared to the bottom value of the same interval, our best result significantly outperforme d it. It is intriguing that the difficulty of distin guish-ing sarcastic utterances from positive ones and from negative ones was quite similar. 
In the second study, we investigated how well human judges performed on the two-way classifi-cation task of labeling sarcastic and non-sarcastic tweets. We asked three other judges to classify 10% of our S-NS dataset (i.e, 180 tweets) into sar-castic and non-sarcastic. Results showed an agreement of 71.67% among the three judges with a Fleiss X  Kappa value of 0.5861 (p&lt;.05). The aver-age accuracy rate was 66.85% (3.9) with 0.37% uncertainty (0.64). When we considered only cases where all three judges agreed, the accuracy, again computed over the entire gold standard test set, fe ll tweets), the HBI was outperformed by the automat-ic classification using unigrams (68.33%) and 
Based on recent results which show that non-linguistic cues such as emoticons are helpful in interpreting non-literal meaning such as sarcasm and irony in user generated content (Derks et al., 2008; Carvalho et al., 2009), we explored how much emoticons help humans to distinguish sarcas-tic from positive and negative tweets. For this tes t, we created a new dataset using only tweets with emoticons. This dataset consisted of 50 sarcastic tweets and 50 non-sarcastic tweets (25 P and 25 N). Two human judges classified the tweets using the same procedure as above. For this task judges achieved an overall agreement of 89% with Co-hen X  X  Kappa value of 0.74 (p&lt;.001). The results show that emoticons play an important role in helping people distinguish sarcastic from non-sarcastic tweets. The overall accuracy for both judges was 73% (1.41) with uncertainty of 10% (1.4). When all judges agreed, the accuracy was 70% when computed relative the entire gold stan-
Using our trained model for S-NS from the pre-vious section, we also tested our classifiers on th is new dataset. Table 3 (S-NS: 100 tweets) shows that our best result (71%) was achieved by SMO using unigrams as features. This value is located between the extreme values of the established HBI. 
These three studies show that humans do not perform significantly better than the simple auto-matic classification methods discussed in this pa-per. Some judges reported that the classification task was hard. The main issues judges identified were the lack of context and the brevity of the messages. As one judge explained, sometimes it was necessary to call on world knowledge such as recent events in order to make judgments about sarcasm. This suggests that accurate automatic identification of sarcasm on Twitter requires in-formation about interaction between the tweeters such as common ground and world knowledge. 7 Conclusion In this paper we have taken a closer look at the problem of automatically detecting sarcasm in Twitter messages. We used a corpus annotated by the tweeters themselves as our gold standard; we relied on the judgments of tweeters because of the relatively poor performance of human coders at this task. We semi-automatically cleaned the cor-pus to address concerns about corpus noisiness raised in previous work. We explored the contribu-tion of linguistic and pragmatic features of tweets to the automatic separation of sarcastic messages from positive and negative ones; we found that the three pragmatic features  X  ToUser , smiley and frown  X  were among the ten most discriminating features in the classification tasks (Table 1). 
We also compared the performance of automatic and human classification in three different studies . We found that automatic classification can be as good as human classification; however, the accura-cy is still low. Our results demonstrate the diffic ul-ty of sarcasm classification for both humans and machine learning methods. 
The length of tweets as well as the lack of expli-cit context makes this classification task quite di f-ficult. In future work, we plan to investigate the impact of contextual features such as common ground. 
Finally, the low performance of human coders in the classification task of sarcastic tweets suggest s that gold standards built by using labels given by human coders other than tweets X  authors may not be reliable. In this sense we believe that our ap-proach to create the gold standard of sarcastic tweets is more suitable in the context of Twitter messages. We thank all those who participated as coders in our human classification task. We also thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful com-ments.
