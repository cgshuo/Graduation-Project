 Temporal-relational information is present in many domains such as the Internet, citation and collaboration networks, communication and email networks, social networks, biological networks, among many others. These domains all have at-tributes, links, and/or nodes changing over time which are important to model. We conjecture that dis covering an accurate temporal-relational representation will disambiguate the true nature and strength of links, attributes, and nodes. However, the majority of research in rel ational learning has focused on mod-eling static snapshots [2, 6] and has largely ignored the utility of learning and incorporating temporal dynamics into relational representations.

Temporal relational data has three main components (attributes, nodes, links) that vary in time. First, the attribute values (on nodes or links) may change over time (e.g., research area of an author). Next, links might be created and deleted throughout time (e.g., host connections are opened and closed). Finally, nodes might appear and disappear over time (e.g., through activity in an online social network).

Within the context of evolving relational data, there are two types of predic-tion tasks. In a temporal prediction task, the attribute to predict is changing over time (e.g., student GPA), whereas in a static prediction task, the predic-tive attribute is constant (e.g., paper topic). For these prediction tasks, the space of temporal-relational representations is defined by the set of relational elements that change over time (attributes, links, and nodes). To incorporate temporal information in a representation that is appropriate for relational mod-els, we consider two transformations based on temporal weighting and temporal granularity . Temporal weighting aims to represent the temporal influence of the links, attributes and nodes by decaying the weights of each with respect to time, whereas the choice of temporal granularity restricts attention to links, attributes, and nodes within a particular window of time. The optimal temporal-relational representation and the corresponding temporal classifier depends on the partic-ular temporal dynamics of the links, attributes, and nodes present in the data, as well as the network domain (e.g., social vs. biological networks).
In this work, we address the problem of selecting the most optimal temporal-relational representation to increase th e accuracy of predictive models. We con-sider the full space of temporal-relational representations and propose (1) a temporal-relational classification framework, and (2) a set of temporal ensemble methods, to leverage time-varying links, attributes, and nodes in relational net-works. We illustrate the different types of models on a variety of classification tasks and evaluate each under various conditions. The results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the temporal-relational framework for classifica-tion in time-evolving relational domains. Furthermore, the framework provides a foundation for automatically searching over temporal-relational representations to increase the accuracy of predictive models. Recent work has started to model network dynamics in order to better pre-dict link and structure formation over time [7, 10], but this work focuses on unattributed graphs. Previous work in relational learning on attributed graphs either uses static network snapshots or significantly limits the amount of tem-poral information incorporated into the models. Sharan et al. [18] assumes a strict representation that only uses kern el estimation for link weights, while GA-TVRC [9] uses a genetic algorithm to learn the link weights. SRPTs [11] incor-porate temporal and spatial information in the relational attributes. However, the above approaches focus only on one specific temporal pattern and do not consider different temporal granularities. In contrast, we explore a larger space of temporal-relational representations in a flexible framework that can capture temporal dependencies over links , attributes ,and nodes .

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose and investigate temporal-relational ensemble methods for time-varying relational classification. However, there has been recent work on r elational ensemble methods [8, 14, 15] and non-relational ensemble methods for evolving streams [1]. Preisach et al. [14] use voting and stacking methods to combine relational data with multiple relations. In contrast, Eldardiry and Neville [8] incorporates prediction averaging in the collective inference process to re duce both learning and inference variance. Below we outline a temporal-relational classification framework for prediction tasks in dynamic relational networks. Relational data is represented as an at-tributed graph D =( G, X ) where the graph G =( V,E ) represents a set of N nodes, such that v i  X  V corresponds to node i and each edge e ij  X  E corresponds to a link (e.g., email) between nodes i and j . The attribute set: contains m v observed attributes on the nodes ( X V )and m e observed attributes on the edges ( X E ). Dynamic relational data evolves over time by the addition, deletion, and changing of nodes, edges, and attributes. Let D t =( G t , X t ) refer cation framework, we consider relational data observed over a range of timesteps Given this time-varying relational dat a, the task is to learn a model to predict either a static attribute Y or a dynamic attribute at a particular timestep Y t , while exploiting both the relational and temporal dependencies in the data.
We define our temporal-relational classification framework with respect to a set of possible transformations of links, attributes, or nodes (as a function of time). The temporal weighting (e.g., exponential decay of past information) and temporal granularity (e.g., window of timesteps) of the links, attributes and nodes form the basis for any arbitrary transformation with respect to the tempo-ral information (See Table 1). The discovered temporal-relational representation can be applied for mining temporal patterns, classification, and as a means for constructing temporal-ensembles. An overview of the temporal-relational repre-sentation discovery is provided below:
Table 1 provides an intuitive view of the possible temporal-relational rep-resentations. For instance, the TVRC m odel is a special case of the proposed framework where the links, attributes, and nodes are unioned and the links are weighted. Below we provide more detail on steps 2-4. 3.1 Temporal Granularity a network [18]. However, since the relev ance of data may change over time (e.g., links become stale), learning the appropriate temporal granularity (i.e., range of timesteps) can improve classification a ccuracy. We briefly define three general classes for varying the temporal granularity of the links, attributes, and nodes. 1. Timestep. The timestep models only use a single timestep t i for learning. 2. Window. The window models use a sliding window of (multiple) timesteps 3. Union. The union model uses all previous temporal information for learning The timestep and union models are separated into distinct classes for clarity in evaluation and for understandability in pattern mining. 3.2 Temporal Influence: Links, Attributes, Nodes We model the influence of relational components over time using temporal weighting. Specifically, when considering a temporal dataset D t =( G t , X t ), we Here W t refers to a function that assigns weights on the edges and attributes that are used in the classifiers below.

Initially, we define W E t ( i, j )=1if e ij  X  E t and 0 otherwise. Similarly, we different approaches to revise these initial weights: 1. Weighting. These temporal weights can be viewed as probabilities that a 2. Uniform. These weights ignore the temporal influence of a relational com-We note that different weighting functions can be chosen for different relational components (edges, attributes, nodes) with varying temporal granularities. For instance, the temporal influence of the links might be predicted using the expo-nential kernel while the attributes are uniformly weighted but have a different temporal granularity than the links. 3.3 Temporal-Relational Classifiers Once the temporal granularity and tempo ral weighting are selected for each rela-tional component, then a temporal-relational classifier can learned. In this work, we use modified versions of the RBC [13] and RPT [12] to model the transformed temporal-relational representation. However, we note that any relational model that can be modified to incorporate node, link, and attribute weights is suitable for this phase. We extended RBCs and RPTs since they are interpretable, di-verse, simple, and efficient. We use k -fold x-validation to learn the  X  X est X  model. Both classifiers are extended for learning and prediction over time. Weighted Relational Bayes Classifier. RBCs extend naive Bayes classi-fiers [5] to relational settings by treating heterogeneous relational subgraphs as a homogeneous set of attribute multisets. The weighted RBC uses standard maximum likelihood learning. More specifically, the sufficient statistics for each conditional probability distribution are computed as weighted sums of counts based on the link and attribute weights. More formally, for a class label C ,at-tributes X , and related items R , the RBC calculates the probability of C for an item i of type G ( i ) as follows: Weighted Relational Probability Trees. RPTs extend standard probability estimation trees to a relational setting. We use the standard learning algorithm [12] except that the aggregate functions are computed after the ap-propriate links and attributes weights are included for the selected temporal granularity (shown in Figure 1). For prediction, if the model is applied to pre-dict attribute Y t at time t, we first calculate the weighted data D t . Then the learned model from time ( t  X  1) is applied to D t . The weighted classifier is appropriately augmented to incorporate the weights from D t . Ensemble methods have traditionally been used to improve predictions by con-sidering a weighted vote from a set of classifiers [4]. We propose temporal ensem-ble methods that exploit the temporal dimension of relational data to construct more accurate predictors. This is in contrast to traditional ensembles that do not explicitly use the temporal information. The temporal-relational classifica-tion framework and in particular the temporal-relational representations of the time-varying links, nodes, and attributes form the basis of the temporal ensem-bles (i.e., as a wrapper over the framework). The proposed temporal ensemble techniques are drawn from one of the five methodologies described below. 1. Transforming the Temporal Nodes and Links: The first method learns 2. Sampling or Transforming the Temporal Feature Space: The second 3. Adding Noise or Randomness: The third method is based on adding 4. Transforming the Time-Varying Class Labels: The fourth method in-5. Multiple Classification Algorithms and Weightings: The fifth method For evaluating the framework, we use both static ( Y is constant over time) and temporal prediction tasks ( Y t changes over time). 5.1 Datasets PyComm Developer Communication Network. We analyze email and bug communication networks extracted from the python-dev mailing list archive (www.python.org) for the period 01/01/07  X  09/30/08. The network consists of 13181 email messages, among 1914 users. Bug reports were also extracted and used to construct a bug discussion network consisting of 69435 bug comments among 5108 users. The size of the timesteps are three months. We also ex-tracted text from emails and bug messages and use it to dynamically model topics between individuals and teams. Addi tionally, we discover temporal cen-trality attributes (i.e., clustering coeffi cient, betweenness). The prediction task is whether a developer is effective (i.e., if a user closed a bug in that timestep). Cora Citation Network. The Cora dataset contains authorship and citation information about CS research papers extracted automatically from the web. The prediction tasks are to predict one o f seven machine learning papers and to predict AI papers given the topic of its r eferences. In addition, these techniques are evaluated using the most prevalent topics its authors are working on through collaborations with other authors. 5.2 Temporal Models The space of temporal-relational models are evaluated using a representative sample of classifiers with varying temporal weightings and granularities. For ev-ery timestep t , we learn a model on D t (i.e., some set of timesteps) and apply the model to D t +1 . The utility of the temporal-relational classifiers and repre-sentation are measured using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Below, we briefly describe a few classes of models that were evaluated.  X  X ENC: The TENC models predict the temporal influence of both the links  X  X VRC: This model weights only the links using all previous timesteps.  X  Union Model: The union model uses all links and nodes up to and including  X  Window Model: The window model uses the data D t  X  1 for prediction on We also compare simpler models such as the RPT (relational information only) and the DT (non-relational) that ignore any temporal information. Additionally, we explore many other models, including the class of window models, various weighting functions (besides exponential kernel), and built models that vary the set of windows in TENC and TVRC. work and temporal ensemble methods on two real-world datasets. The main findings are summarized below:
Temporal-relational models significantly outperform relational and non-relational models.

The classes of temporal-relational models each have advantages and disad-vantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. Models based strictly on temporal granularity are more interpretable but less accurate than models that learn the temporal influence. The more complex models that combine both are generally more accurate, but less efficient.

Temporal ensemble methods significantly outperform non-relational and re-lational ensembles. In addition, the temporal ensembles are an efficient and accurate alternative to searching over the space of temporal models. 6.1 Single Models 1 We evaluate the temporal-relational frame-work using single-models and show that in all cases the performance of classification im-proves when the temporal dynamics are ap-propriately modeled.
 Temporal, Relational, and Non-Relational Information. The utility of the temporal (TVRC), relational (RPT), and non-relational information (decision tree; DT) is assessed using the most primitive models. Figure 2 compares TVRC with the RPT and DT models that use more fea-tures but ignore the temporal dynamics of the data. We find the TVRC to be the sim-plest temporal-relational classifier that still outperforms the others. Interestingly, the discovered topic features are the only additional features that improve performance of the DT model. This is signifi-cant as these attributes are discovered by dynamically modeling the topics, but are included in the DT model as simple non-relational features (i.e., no temporal weighting or granularity).
 Exploring Temporal-Relational Models.
 We focus on exploring a representative set of temporal-relational models from the proposed framework. To more appropriately evaluate the models, we remove highly correlated at-tributes (i.e., that are not necessarily temporal patterns, or motifs), such as  X  X ssignedto X  in the PyComm prediction task. In Figure 3, we find that TENC outperforms the other models over all timesteps. This class of models are sig-nificantly more complex than TVRC since the temporal influence of both links and attributes are learned.

We then explored learning the appropri-ate temporal granularity. Figure 3 shows the results from two models in the TVRC class where we tease apart the superiority of TENC (i.e., weighting or granularity). However, both TVRC models outperform one another on different timesteps, indicating the ne-cessity for a more precise temporal-repre sentation that optimizes the temporal granularity by selecting the appropriate decay parameters for links and attributes (i.e., TENC). Similar results were found using Cora and other base classifiers such as RBC. Models based strictly on varying the temporal granularity were also explored. More deta ils can be found in [17]. 6.2 Temporal-Ensemble Models Instead of directly learning the optimal temporal-relational representation to in-crease the accuracy of classification, we use temporal ensembles by varying the relational representation with respect to the temporal information. These ensemble models reduce error due to variance and allow us to assess which features are most relevant to the do-main with respect to the relational or tem-poral information.
 Temporal, Relational, and Traditional Ensembles. We first resampled the in-stances (nodes, links, features) repe atedly and then learn TVRC, RPT, and DT models. Across almost all the timesteps , we find the temporal-ensemble that uses various temporal-relational representations outperforms the relational-ensemble and the traditional ensemble (see Figure 4). The temporal-ensemble outperforms the others even when the minimum amount of temporal information is used (e.g., time-varying links). More sophisticated temporal-ensembles can be constructed to further increase accuracy. We have inv estigated ensembles that use signifi-cantly different temporal-relational representations (i.e., from a wide range of model classes) and ensembles that use various temporal weighting parameters. In all cases, these ensembles are more robust and increase the accuracy over more traditional ensemble techniques (and single classifiers). Further, the average improvement of the temporal-ensembles is significant at p&lt; 0 . 05 with a 16% reduction in error, justifying the proposed temporal ensemble methodologies.
In the next experimen t, we construct en-sembles using the feature classes. We use the primitive models (with the transformed fea-ture space) in order to investigate (more ac-curately) the most significant feature class (communication, team, centrality, topics) and also to identify the minimum amount of temporal information required to outper-form relational ensembles.

In Figure 5, we find several striking tem-poral patterns. First, the team features are localized in time and are not changing fre-quently. For instance, it is unlikely that a developer changes their assigned teams and therefore modeling the temp oral dynamics only increase s accuracy by a relatively small percent. However, the temporal-ensemble is still more accurate than tra-ditional ensemble methods that ignore temporal patterns. This indicates the ro-bustness of the temporal-relational representations. More importantly, the other classes of attributes are evolving considerably and this fact is captured by the significant improvement of the temporal ensemble models. Similar performance is also obtained by varying the temporal granularity (see previous examples). Randomization. We use randomization to identify the significant attributes in the temporal-ensemble models . Randomization provides a means to rank and eliminate redundant attributes (i.e., two attributes may share the same significant temporal pattern). We randomize each attribute in each timestep and measure the change in AUC. The results are shown in Figure 6.

We find that the basic traditional ensemble relies on  X  X ssignedto X  (in the current time step) while the temporal ens emble (and even less for the relational ensemble) relies on the previous  X  X ssignedto X  attributes. This indicates that relational information in the past is more useful than intrinsic information in the present X  X hich points to an interesting hypothesis that a colleagues behavior (and interactions) preced es their own behavior. Organizations might use this to predict future behavior with less information and proactively respond more quickly. Additionally, the topic attributes are shown to be the most useful for the temporal ensembles (Fig. 7), indicating the utility of using topics to understand the context and strength of relationships. We proposed and validated a framework for temporal-relational classifiers, en-sembles, and more generally, representations for temporal-relational data. We evaluated an illustrative set of temporal-relational models from the proposed framework. Empirical results show that the models significantly outperform competing classification models that u se either no temporal information or a very limited amount. The proposed temporal ensemble methods (i.e., tempo-rally sampling, randomizing, and transforming features) were shown to sig-nificantly outperform traditional and relational ensembles. Furthermore, the temporal-ensemble methods were shown to increase the accuracy over traditional models while providing an efficient alternative to exploring the space of temporal-models. The results demonstrated the effectiveness, scalability, and flexibility of the temporal-relational representation s for classification and ensembles in time-evolving domains. In future work, we will theoretically analyze the framework and the proposed ensemble methods.
