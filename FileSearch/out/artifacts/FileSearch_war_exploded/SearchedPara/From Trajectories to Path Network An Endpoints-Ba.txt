 With the widespread usage of miniaturized GPS devices, recording the trace data of moving objects become extremely easy and useful work while it provides enormous business opportunity in geography navigatio n and recommendation system[1]. During the past years, a bunch of research has been performed based on individual location history represented by GPS trajectories. These works include detecting individual lo-cations [2], recognizing user-specific activitie s[3,4] and predicting traveler X  X  movement [2]. The trajectory pattern mining problem was introduced in [5]. Following this work, some important efforts had been devoted, such as[6,7,8].

Finding some key information, such as characteristic points[9,10] and representative line[10], is the feasible method to help people extracting useful information from GPS trajectory. However, it is hard to get such i nformation because the recorded GPS data are always non-uniformity, sparse, lost and inconsistency with the endpoints in cases that the users turn on and off the GPS-enabled d evices casually. In this paper, we present an endpoints-based GPS trajectory partition a nd clustering framework to mine users X  interested locations and frequent travel sequences in a given geo-spatial region. 2.1 Stationary Sub-trajectory g . For any sub-trajectory STR = { g s g s +1 ......g t } X  TR , action . Now, suppose the projection of g i , ( i = s +1 , ..., t ) on
A sub-trajectory STR is a stationary sub-trajectory (SST) if the position disturbance of each GPS point g i ,s +1 &lt;i  X  t changes not rapidly with respect to the first move action 2.2 Trajectory Partitioning Method In fact, the key issue for partitioning a TR into SSTs is to find out all the characteris-tic points [10] in it. In this section, we propose a new trajectory partitioning algorithm which aims at finding the points where the behavior of a trajectory changes rapidly. The action (Algorithm 1).
 Algorithm 1. Trajectory Partitioning Algorithm 2.3 Characteristic Points Cl ustering and Path Network Given N trajectories, the clustering processes can be specified as follows: Firstly, we general clustering method to cluster all the points in CP =  X  N i =1 CP i into l clusters: C , ..., C l , based on the Euclidean distance of paired points. The element number of C , ( i =1 , ..., l ) and use these centroid point to represent each cluster.
The edge between two nodes c i and c j ( i = j ) can be used to represent all the word, it approximates to the common path between area c i to c j . We can construct an undirected path network by connecting these fixed territories. 3.1 Efficiency and Preciseness The following experiments are based on the real GPS datasets 1 . The results about ef-ficiency and preciseness are shown in Figure 1. It indicates that: 1) The efficiency of our method ( d 0 =1 ) is more faster than that of the method presented by [10]. 2) The computation speed will become mo re faster with increasing value of d 0 . 3) The curves in Figure 1 are almost straight lines, these are experimental evidences about the truth that both these two methods have computation complexity of O ( n ) . raw trajectory. The pink line is the number of characteristic points generated with the method presented by Lee et al., and the blue line is that with our method. The red line presents the number of characteristic points found by these two methods commonly. We can see that, 1) Both the preciseness of these two methods would become worse along with the increase of trajectory length, n . 2) The method presented by Lee et al. has advantage in preciseness because it keep s more GPS points as characteristic points. 3.2 Path Network In the following, we choose randomly 8 users X  data to conduct the experiments. Their path networks are generated as in Figure 3. Each network is a spatial map of the typical motions for a specific user, and it contains valuable information about: the frequent pathes, the fixed territories, and the movement correlations among representative points. In this work, we try to trim GPS trajectories into fixed territories and frequent path to generate a spatial map of typical motions, i.e., path network , by taking into account of users X  historic travel experiences as we ll as the correlation between locations.
The methods proposed in this work are efficient for mining information hidden in the trajectory data, especially the frequent path , fixed territories and movement intention, which can provide business opportunity in geography information service.
