 Recent progress in NLP has given rise to the field of personality profiling -automated classification of personality traits based on written, verbal and multimodal behavior of an individual. This re-search builds upon findings from classical person-ality psychology and has applications in a wide range of areas from medicine (suicide prevention) across security (forensics, paedophile detection, cyberbullying) to marketing and sales (recommen-dation systems, target group profiles). The gold standard labels for an objective evaluation of per-sonality are mostly obtained by means of personal-ity tests of the Five Factor Model (FFM) (McCrae and Costa, 1987; Goldberg, 1990), which is well-known and widely accepted in psychology and other research fields. The FFM defines personality along five bipolar scales: Extraversion (sociable vs. reserved), Emotional stability (secure vs. neu-rotic), Agreeableness (friendly vs. unsympathic), Conscientiousness (organized vs. careless) and Openness to experience (insightful vs. unimagi-native). Psychologists have shown that these five personality traits are stable across individual lifes-pan, demographical and cultural differences (John and Srivastava, 1999) and affect many life aspects. (Terracciano et al., 2008; Rentfrow et al., 2011).
It has been shown that the personality traits of readers impact their literature preferences (Tirre and Dixit, 1995; Mar et al., 2009). Psychology researchers also found that perceived similarity is predictive of interpersonal attraction (Montoya et al., 2008; Byrne, 1961; Chartrand and Bargh, 1999). More explicitly, recent research (Kaufman and Libby, 2012) shows that readers of a narrative develop more favorable attitudes and less stereo-type application towards a character, if his differ-ence (e.g. racial) is revealed only later in the story. We therefore hypothesize that readers might have a preference for reading novels depicting fictional characters that are similar to themselves. Finding a direct link between reader X  X  and protagonist X  X  per-sonality traits would advance the development of content-based recommendation systems. As a first step to explore this hypothesis further, it needs to be determined if we are able to construct a per-sonality profile of a fictional character in a similar way as it is done for humans, and which aspects of personality profiling can be exploited to autom-atize such procedure.

In this paper, we open this research topic by presenting a novel collaboratively built dataset of fictional character personality in Section 3, ing the personality prediction as a text classifica-tion task, we incorporate features of both lexical-resource-based and vector space semantics, in-cluding WordNet and VerbNet sense-level infor-mation and vectorial word representations. We evaluate three machine learning models based on the speech (Section 4), actions (Section 5) and predicatives (Section 6) of the protagonists, and show that especially on the direct speech and action data the lexical-semantic features signifi-cantly outperform the baselines. Qualitative anal-ysis reveals that the most predictive features corre-spond to reported findings in psychology and NLP. Research in the the area of content-based recom-mendation systems have shown that incorporat-ing semantic information is valuable for the user and leads to measurable improvements (Passant, 2010; Di Noia et al., 2012; Heitmann and Hayes, 2010). De Clercq et al. (2014) incorporated se-mantic frames from FrameNet into the recommen-dation system for books. They represent the plot of each book with a sequence of ca. 200 seman-tic frames and has shown that the frame informa-tion (such as Killing -Revenge -Death) outper-forms the bag-of-words approach.Recent NLP ex-periments begin to reveal the importance of entity-centric models in a variety of tasks. Chambers (2013) show improvement in event schema induc-tion by learning entity-centric rules (e.g., a victim is likely to be a person). Bamman et al. (2014) and Smith et al. (2013) present latent variable models for unsupervised learning of latent character types in movie plot summaries and in English novels, taking authorial style into account. However, even the state-of-the-art NLP work rather describes per-sonas of fictional characters by their role in the story -e.g., action hero, valley girl, best friend, villain etc. -or by their relations to other char-acters, such as mother or daughter (Elson et al., 2010; Kokkinakis and Malm, 2011), rather than by their inner preferences and motivations. It is important to note here that determining a person-ality of a character is a very different task from determining its role in the story. Psychological understanding of personality, in contrast to role at-tribution requires a certain detached objectivity -even outright villains may have traits considered desirable in real life. For example, the devil has in many tales a very high aspiration level, appear-ing highly conscientious and agreeable. We hy-pothesize that these deeper personality aspects are those which drive reader X  X  affiliation to the char-acter, thus deserve to be examined closer.

Also literary scholars formulate ad hoc person-ality descriptions for their experiments, for exam-ple to test hypotheses from evolutionary psychol-ogy (Johnson et al., 2011) or examine fictional portrayals of physicists (Dotson, 2009). These de-scriptions are usually adjusted to the experiment focus (e.g. emotions, relationships, ambitions). As McCrae et al. () point out, a standard set of personality traits, that encompass the full range of characteristics found in all characters in literature (p.77), is needed for a better comparison.

Hence we base our present study primarily on the previous NLP research on personality predic-tion of human individuals. Correlations between lexical and stylistic aspects of text and the five FFM personality traits of the author have been found in numerous experiments, with extraver-sion receiving the most attention (Pennebaker and King, 1999; Dewaele and Furnham, 1999; Gill and Oberlander, 2002; Mehl et al., 2006; Aran and Gatica-Perez, 2013; Lepri et al., 2010). The LIWC lexicon (Pennebaker et al., 2001) established its position as a powerful mean of such analysis.
The first machine learning experiments in this area were conducted by Argamon et al. (2005), Oberlander and Nowson (2006) and Mairesse et al. (2007). Researchers predicted the five personality traits of the authors of stream-of-conscientiousness essays, blog posts and recorded conversation snippets. Given balanced data sets, Mairesse et al. (2007) report binary classification accuracy of 50-56% on extraversion in text and 47-57% in speech, using word ngrams, LIWC, MRC psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981) and prosodic features. Additional improvement is reported when the extraversion was labeled by external judges rather than by self-testing. Ex-tended studies on larger datasets achieve accu-racies around 55% (Nowson, 2007; Estival et al., 2007). More recent work in this area fo-cuses on the personality prediction in social net-works (Kosinski et al., 2013; Kosinski et al., 2014) and multimodal personality prediction (Biel and Gatica-Perez, 2013; Aran and Gatica-Perez, 2013). These trends emphasized the correlation of network features and audiovisual features with ex-traversion, giving rise to the Workshop on Compu-tational Personality Recognition (for an overview see (Celli et al., 2013; Celli et al., 2014). Traditionally, the gold standard for this supervised classification task is obtained by the means of per-sonality questionnaires, used for the Five-Factor Model, taken by each of the individuals assessed. This poses a challenge for fictional characters. However, strong correlations have been found be-tween the self-reported and perceived personality traits (Mehl et al., 2006). Our gold standard bene-fits from the fact that readers enjoy discussing the personality of their favourite book character on-line. A popular layman instrument for personal-ity classification is the Myers-Brigggs Type Indi-cator (Myers et al., 1985), shortly MBTI, which sorts personal preferences into four opposite pairs, or dichotomies, such as Thinking vs. Feeling or Judging vs. Perceiving. While the MBTI validity has been questioned by the research community (Pittenger, 2005), the Extraversion scale is show-ing rather strong validity and correlation to similar trait in the Five-Factor Model (McCrae and Costa, 1989; MacDonald et al., 1994). Our study hence focuses on the Extraversion scale.

Our data was collected from the collabora-the readers can vote if a book character is, among other aspects, introverted or extraverted. While the readers used codes based on the MBTI typology, they did not apply the MBTI assessment strate-gies. There was no explicit annotation guideline and the interpretation was left to readers X  intuition collection has several obvious drawbacks. First, the question is posed as dichotomic, while in real-ity the extraversion is a normally distributed trait in human population (Goldberg, 1990). Second, users can view the vote of previous participants, which may influence their decision. While we ad-dress both of these issues in our ongoing data col-lection project based on the Five-Factor Model, we consider them acceptable for this study due to the exploratory character of our pilot research.
We have collected extraversion ratings for 298 book characters, of which 129 (43%) are rather ex-traverted and 166 (56%) rather introverted. Rated characters come from a wide range of novels that the online users are familiar with, often covering classical literature which is part of the high school syllabus, as well as the most popular modern fic-tion, such as the Harry Potter series, Twilight, Star Wars or A Game of Thrones. A sample of the most rated introverts and extraverts is given in table 1. The rating distribution in our data is strongly U-shaped. The percentage agreement of voters in our data is 84.9%, calculated as: where k = 2 (introvert, extravert), N is the num-ber of book characters and n the number of votes per character. Voters on the website were anony-mous and cannot be uniquely identified for addi-tional corrections. There is no correlation between the extraversion and the gender of the character.
Our set of English e-books covered 220 of the characters from our gold standard. We have built three systems to assess the following: 1. Direct speech : Does the style and content of 2. Actions : Is the behavior, of which a character 3. Predicatives and adverbs : Are the explicit
In the next three sections we present the experi-mental settings and results for each of the systems. The system for the direct speech resembles the most to the previous systems developed for author personality profiling, e.g. on stream of conscious-ness essays (Mairesse et al., 2007) or social media posts (Celli et al., 2013) and therefore provides the best opportunity for comparison between hu-man individuals and fictional characters. On top of the comparison to previous research, we exploit the sense links between WordNet and VerbNet to extract additional features -an approach which is novel for this type of task. 4.1 Extraction and assignment of speech We process the book text using freely available components of the DKPro framework (Gurevych et al., 2007). The most challenging task in build-ing the direct speech data set is assigning to the di-rect speech utterance the correct speaker. We ben-efit from the epub format of the e-books which defines a paragraph structure in such a way, that only the indirect speech chunk immediately sur-rounding the direct speech can be considered: &lt;p&gt; John turned to Harry. "Let X  X  go," he said.&lt;/p&gt; Given the large amount of text available in the books we focus on precision and discard all utter-ances with no explicit speaker (i.e., 30-70% of the utterances, dependent on the book), as the perfor-mance of current systems on such utterance types is still fairly low (O X  X eefe et al., 2012; He et al., 2013; Iosif and Mishra, 2014). Similarly, conven-tional coreference resolution systems did not per-form well on this type of data and were therefore not used in the final setup. We adapt the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer(Finkel et al., 2005) to consider titles (Mr., Mrs., Sir...) as a part of the name and to treat the first person I as a named en-tity. However, identifying only the named entity PERSON in this way is not sufficient. On our eval-uation sample consisting of A Game of Thrones and Pride and Prejudice books (the former anno-tated by us, the latter by He et al. (2013)), 20% of utterances with explicit named speaker were not recognized. Of those correctly identified as a Person in the adjacent indirect speech, 17% were not the speakers. Therefore we implemented a custom heuristics (Algorithm 1), which addition-ally benefits from the WordNet semantic classes of verbs, enriching the speaker detection by grab-bing the nouns . With this method we retrieve 89% of known speakers, of which 92% is assigned correctly. Retrieved names are grouped based on string overlap (e.g. Ser Jaime and Jaime Lannis-ter ), excluding the match on last name, and cor-rected for non-obvious groupings (such as Mar-garet and Peggy ).
 Algorithm 1 Assign speaker
Our experimental data consists of usable direct speech sets of 175 characters -80 extraverts (E) and 95 introverts (I) -containing 289 274 words in 21 857 utterances (on average 111 utterances for 4.2 Classification approach for direct speech All speech utterances of one book character are represented as one instance in our system. We use the leave-one-out classification setup due to the relatively small dataset size, using the support vector machines (SVM-SMO) classifier, which performs well on comparable tasks (Celli et al., 2013). The classification is performed through the DKPro TC Framework (Daxenberger et al., 2014). Lexical features As a bottom-up approach we use the 1000 most frequent word uni-, bi-and tri-grams, 1000 dependency word pairs, 1000 charac-ter trigrams and 500 most frequent verbs, adverbs, adjectives and interjections as binary features. Semantic features Since the top-down ap-proach, i.e. not focusing on individual words, has been found more suitable for the personality pro-filing task on smaller data sets (Celli et al., 2013), we aim on capturing additional phenomena on a higher level of abstraction. The main part of our features is extracted on sense level. We use the most frequent sense of WordNet (Miller, 1995) to annotate all verbs in the direct speech (a sim-ple but well performing approach for books). We then label the disambiguated verbs with their se-mantic field given in WordNet (WordNet defines 14 semantic classes of verbs which group verbs by their semantic field) and we measure frequency and occurence of each of these classes (e.g. cogni-ditionally, we use the lexical-semantic resource UBY (Gurevych et al., 2012) to access the Word-Net and VerbNet information, and to exploit the VerbNet sense-level links which connects Word-Net senses with the corresponding 273 main Verb-Net classes (Kipper-Schuler, 2005). These are more fine-grained (e.g. pay, conspire, neglect, dis-cover) than the WordNet semantic fields. WordNet covered 90% and VerbNet 86% of all the verb oc-curences.

On word level, we extract 81 additional fea-tures using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tools (Pennebaker et al., 2001), which consists of lexicons related to psychological pro-cesses (cognitive, perceptual, social, biological, affective) and personal concerns (achievement, re-ligion, death...) and other categories such as fillers, emotion detection has been found predictive in previous personality work (Mohammad and Kir-itchenko, 2013), we measure overall positive and negative sentiment expressed per character, using SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) and NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2010) for the word lookup, inverting sentiment scores for negated dependency sub-tree given by the Stanford Parser.
 Stylistic features Features of this group cap-ture the syntactic and stylistic properties of the ut-terances of a character, disregarding the content. Starting from the surfacial properties, we measure the sentence, utterance and word length, including the proportion of words shorter than 4 or longer than 6 letters, frequency of each punctuation mark, and endings of each adjective as per Corney et al. (2002). On the syntax level we measure the fre-quency of each part of speech as well as the 500 most frequent part-of-speech bi-, tri-and quadri-grams, and the frequency of each dependency ob-tained from the Stanford Parser. We additionally capture the frequency of superlatives, compara-tives and modal verbs, the proportion of verbs in present, past and future tense, and the formality of the language as per the part-of-speech-based for-mality coefficient (Heylighen and Dewaele, 2002), and measure the average depth of the parse trees. Word embeddings as features Since vector space semantics has been beneficial for predicting author X  X  personality in previous work (Neuman and Cohen, 2014), we use a pre-trained word vec-tor model created by the GloVe algorithm (Pen-nington et al., 2014) on English Wikipedia. GloVe employs a global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the global matrix factorization and local context window methods. We assign the resulting 300-dimensional vectors to the words in character X  X  direct speech, exclud-ing stopwords, and calculate an average vector for each character. We calculate for each test charac-ter the cosine similarity to the mean vector of ex-travert, resp. introvert, in the training data, and to each character in the training set individually us-final scalar outcome and the difference of each of the individual vector dimensions as features. 4.3 Classification results on direct speech Table 2 shows the precision, recall, F 1 -score and accuracy for extraversion and introversion as a weighted average of the two class values.

Similarly to previous research (Mairesse et al., 2007; Celli et al., 2013), the bottom-up word based approach is outperformed by top-down se-mantic approaches which employ a more abstract feature representation. As in previous work, LIWC features exhibit good performance. How-ever, the highest performance is achieved employ-ing the VerbNet verb classes with WordNet word-sense disambiguation. Also stylistic features con-tribute substantially to the classification despite the mixture of genres in our book corpus -es-pecially frequencies of modal verbs and part-of-speech ratios were particularly informative. The most predictive features from each group are listed in Table 3 together with their correlation merit (Hall, 1999), and compared with previous work in Table 4.

In accordance with the experiments of Pen-nebaker and King (1999), we observe more fre-quent exclusions (e.g. without, but ), hedging and negation expressed by introverts, and inclusion (e.g. with, and ) by extraverts. Extraverts talk more in first person plural, use more back-channels and interjections, and talk more about aspects related to their body. Introverts show more rationalization through insight words and more factual speech us-ing less pronouns.

Additionally, the semantic features in Table 3 confirm the broad psychological characteristics of both types in general, i.e., for introverts the ra-tionalization, uncertainty and preference for indi-vidual or rather static activities, and for extraverts their spontaneity, talkativeness and preference for motion. Furthermore, we observe certain direct-ness in extraverts X  speech -note the predictive words fat and dirty and frequent descriptions of body functions.
 Discussion Exploiting the links between lexical-semantic resources (performing WordNet word-sense disambiguation and using VerbNet verb classes linked to the disambiguated senses) was particularly beneficial for this task. WordNet semantic fields for verbs alone are too coarse-grained to capture the nuances in direct speech, and experiments with fine-grained VerbNet classes without WSD resulted in noisy labels. We did not confirm the previously reported findings on emo-tional polarity -we observe that the genre of the books (e.g. love romance vs horror story) have blurred the subtle differences between individual characters, unfortunately the dataset size did not allow for genre distinctions. Furthermore, a per-ceived extravert in our case can be a pure villain (Draco Malfoy, Joffrey Baratheon...) as well as a friendly companion (Gimli, Ron Weasley...), while the evil extravert types are possibly rarer in the ex-periments on human writing, or are more likely to fit under the MBTI definition of extraversion than FFM facets. Another potential cause, based on the error analysis, is the different target of the same sentiment for extraverts and introverts. For exam-ple, the ngram  X  X  fear X  is highly predictive for an introvert in our data while extraverts would rather use formulations to imply that others should fear. Similarly to Nowson et al. (2005), we did not find any difference in the formality measure of Hey-lighen and Dewaele (2002). Neither we did in the complexity of sentences as per the parse tree depth and sentence length. It is probable that these as-pects were also impacted by our broad variety of author style (F. Dostoyevsky vs J. K. Rowling). Our basic vector-based features carried no useful information in our case, in contrast to the person-ality research of Neuman and Cohen (2014). We observed that the factual content of the stories con-tributed to the character similarity measure more than the subtle personality differences. While psycholinguists and consequenlty NLP re-searchers analyzed the relation between speech, resp. writing, and personality of an individual, psychologists often evaluate extraversion through behavioral personality questionnaries (Costa and McCrae, 1992; Goldberg et al., 2006). We hypoth-esize that similar behavior shall be predictive for extraversion of fictional characters as perceived by the readers. 5.1 Action extraction For our purpose we define actions as the subject, verb and context of a sentence, where the subject is a named entity Person and the context is either a direct object in relation dobj to the verb or a first child of the adjacent verb phrase in a parse tree. After grouping the actions per character, the sub-ject name is removed. For example, a sample of actions of the character Eddard Stark of Game of Thrones would be: X paused a moment, X studied his face, X changed his mind, X unrolled the paper, X said etc., visualized in Figure 1. We obtained 22 030 actions for 205 characters (102 E, 116 I), with on average 100 actions for E and 101 for I. Note that also actions for those characters who do not talk enough in the books (often first-person per-spectives) could be used.
 5.2 Action classification setup In the system based on actions we use only a sub-set of the features described in 4.2. From the lex-ical features we focus on the 500 most frequent verbs and dependency word pairs. Semantic fea-tures are used the same way as in 4.2, profiting from LIWC, WordNet, Verbnet and the sentiment lexicons. Word embedding vectors for book char-acters are in this case computed by taking only the verbs into account rather than all content words. From the stylistic features we use the part-of-speech bigrams and trigrams, verb modality and verb tense. 5.3 Classification results on actions Table 5 shows the performance of the classifica-tion models based on the protagonists X  actions, us-ing different feature groups. The overall perfor-mance is higher than for the direct speech model.
Due to the lack of previous NLP experiments on this task, we compare our features to the ac-tions measured in the International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg et al., 2006), frequently used personality assesment questionnaire (Table 6).
The most predictive features of this model cap-ture the activity and excitement seeking facets of extraversion. Stylistic features reflect the complexity difference of the verb phrases ( John jumped vs. John thought about it ), extraverts be-ing characterized by plain verbs. Semantic fea-tures exhibit higher precision than stylistic ones. Sense-linked semantic classes of VerbNet demon-strate the preference of extraverts for being ac-tive and expressing themselves -they jump , fight, shout, run in and run out, eat and drink , see and hear and get easily bored . Extraverts in books also often bring or hold something. Introverts, on the other hand, seem to favor slow movements -while they are thinking, reflecting, creating , looking for explanations and find out solutions, they tend to lie down, sit or walk , eventually even sleep or snooze . The uncertainty typical for introverts is also no-table in their actions, as they often hope or wish for something they might like to do. Addition-ally, semantic classes Social and Family, reported as correlated to extraversion by Pennebaker and King (1999) and not confirmed in our first model, became predictive in protaonists X  actions. 5.4 Discussion Also in this task, the VerbNet classes brought sig-nificant improvement in performance. The clas-sification model based on actions outperforms not only the direct speech model, but also the state-of-the-art systems predicting authors X  ex-traversion from the stream-of-consciousness es-says (Mairesse et al., 2007; Celli et al., 2013; Neuman and Cohen, 2014). While surely not directly comparable, this result hints to the fact that the personality is easier to detect from be-havior than from person X  X  verbal expression. This would correspond to the findings of Mairesse et al. (2007), Biel and Gatica-Perez (2013) and Aran and Gatica-Perez (2013) on multimodal data sets. Our third extraversion prediction system is sub-ordinate to how fictional characters are described and to the manners in which they behave. We are not aware of a previous NLP work predicting ex-traversion using descriptive adjectives of the per-sons in question. We thus juxtapose the most pre-dictive features of our system to the adjectival ex-traversion markers developed by Goldberg (1992). 6.1 Extraction of descriptive properties In this setup we extract predicatives of the named entities P ERSON in the books -relations amod ( angry John ) and cop ( John was smart ). As these explicit statements are very sparse in modern nov-els, we additionally include adverbial modifiers ( advmod ) related to person X  X  actions ( John said angrily ). We extract data for 205 characters, with on average 43 words per character. 6.2 Classification setup This system uses similar set of lexical, semantic and vectorial features similarly as in 5.2, this time with the focus on adjectives, nouns and adverbs instead of verbs. Stylistic and VerbNet features are hence not included, word vectors are as in 4.2. 6.3 Classification results on descriptions Table 7 reports on the performance of individual feature groups. With only few words per character semantic lexicons are less powerful than ngrams.
Table 8 displays the most predictive features in our system contrasted to the adjectival markers. 6.4 Discussion on errors All our systems had issues with characters rated by less than five readers and with protagonists with low agreement. Other challenges arise from au-thorial style, age of the novel and speech individ-uality of characters (e.g. Yoda ). Varied length of information for different characters poses issues in measuring normally distributed features (e.g. ra-tio of jumping verbs), being in shorter texts less reliable. Ongoing and future work on this task ad-dresses the limitations of these initial experiments, especially the data set size and the gold standard quality. Extending the data will also enable us to examine different book genres as variables for the personality distribution and feature impact. It will be worth examining the relations between charac-ters, since we observed certain patterns in our data, such as the main introvert character supported by his best friend extravert. Additionally, we want to verify if the system in Section 6 is overly opti-mistic due to the data size. Automated personality profiling of fictional char-acters, based on rigorous models from personal-ity psychology, has a potential to impact numer-ous domains. We framed it as a text classifica-tion problem and presented a novel collaboratively built dataset of fictional personality. We incor-porate features of both lexical resource-based and vectorial semantics, including WordNet and Verb-Net sense-level information and vectorial word representations. In models based on the speech and actions of the protagonists, we demonstrated that the sense-linked lexical-semantic features sig-nificantly outperform the baselines. The most pre-dictive features correspond to the reported find-ings in personality psychology and NLP experi-ments on human personality. Our systems based on actions and appearance of characters demon-strate higher performance than systems based on direct speech, which is in accordance with recent research on personality in social networks (Kosin-ski et al., 2014; Biel and Gatica-Perez, 2013), re-vealing the importance of the metadata. We have shown that exploiting the links between lexical re-sources to leverage more accurate semantic infor-mation can be beneficial for this type of tasks, ori-ented to actions performed by the entity. How-ever, the human annotator agreement in our task stays high above the performance achieved. Con-sidering that most of the sucessful novels were produced as movies, we cannot exclude that our annotators based their decision on the multimodal representation of the protagonists. In the future we aim on collecting a more detail and rigorous gold standard through gamification and expanding our work on all five personality traits from the Five-Factor Model and their facets, and ultimately ex-tend our system to a semi-supervised model deal-ing with notably larger amount of data. We also plan to examine closer the differences between perceived human and fictional personality, and the relationship between the personality of the reader and the characters.
