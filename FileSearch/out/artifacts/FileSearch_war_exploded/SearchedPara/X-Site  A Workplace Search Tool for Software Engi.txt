Professionals in the workplace need high-precision search tools capable of retrieving information th at is useful and appropriate to the task at hand. One approach to identifying content, which is not only relevant but also useful, is to make use of the task context of the search. We present X-Site, an enterprise search engine for the software engineering domain that exploits relationships between user X  X  tasks and document genres in the collection to improve retrieval precision. H.3. [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Systems and Software 
Keywords: Enterprise search, contextual search, task, genre information practices among a comm unity of software engineers in a major technology firm, which identified a strong relationship between the tasks they perform a nd the document genres they use. 
This analysis enabled us to id entify task-dependent patterns of genre preference, which we incorporated into the ranking algorithm of X-Site. X-Site includes the following components:  X  a task profile , composed of a work task (e.g. installation) and an information task (e.g. find facts), which are elicited from the searcher at query time;  X  a task-genre association matrix , which specifies known positive, neutral and negative re lationships between task and genre pairs;  X  a genre weighting component in Okapi BM25. Document frequency to score structured documents. Each weight represents the strength of each task-genre pair[2];  X  a genre classifier , which uses supervised machine learning using a domain-specific genre taxonomy;  X  a language identifier , which uses n-gram-based text categorization (libTextCat 2 ); and  X  a multi-user search engine (wumpus 3 ). http://svmlight.joachims.org http://software.wise-guys.nl/libtextcat http://wumpus-search.org X-Site is currently deployed as a prototype in a real workplace environment. It provides a single point of access to ~8GB of content crawled from the Internet, intranet and Lotus Notes data, using a set of seed URLs tailored to the needs of this group. To search using X-Site, the searcher types in a query, and selects a work task and an information task from drop down lists (Figure profile is used to determine the genre weights associated with the search. The results are then ranked using a modified BM25 scoring method, which incorporates genre weights in addition to length, term frequency and othe r collection statistics. Figure 1: X-Site results disp lay with query input sidebar X-Site provides a customized, fl exible and user-controlled means particular benefit in enterprise information environments, which need to serve diverse user populations and support a wide range of work and information tasks. Future improvements of the X-Site system will include a component to monitor implicit measures of document preference during system use in order to tune the task-genre associations.
