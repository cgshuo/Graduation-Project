 It is often difficult to analyse data sets including a combi-nation of categorical and numerical variables (mixed data sets) since there does not exist any similarity measure which is as straight forward and general as the numerical distance between numerical items. Quantification of categorical vari-ables enables analysis using commonly used visual represen-tations and analysis techniques for numerical data. This paper presents a tool for exploratory analysis of categorical and mixed data which uses a quantification process intro-duced in [17]. The application enables analysis of mixed data sets by providing an environment for exploratory anal-ysis using common visual representations in multiple coordi-nated views and algorithmic analysis that facilitates detec-tion of potentially interesting patterns within combinations of categorical and numerical variables. The generality and usefulness of the quantification process and of the features of the application is demonstrated through a case scenario using a data set from the IEEE VAST 2008 Challenge [13]. In many research and application areas, data sets including categorical variables or a combination of categorical and nu-merical variables (mixed data sets) are nothing unusual. Al-though several similarity measures exist that can be used for categorical data, such as the Jaccard coefficient [27], overlap, or Goodall similarity [5], these are usually not as straight-forward and general as similarities within numerical vari-ables. Due to this, categorical data is often more difficult to visualize and analyse. Moreover, many commonly used vi-sualization techniques, such as parallel coordinates [15; 29] and scatter plots, have been developed for visualization of numerical data and are hence based on the numerical simi-larity or distance between data items. Several visualization techniques developed for categorical data exist, but their ef-fectiveness is often highly dependent on the structure of the data and on the analysis task. Moreover, they are often un-able to represent mixed data sets including a combination of categorical and numerical variables.
 One approach to overcome the difficulties involved in visual-ization of categorical and mixed data sets is to quantify the categorical data, representing the categories with numerical values, which enables analysis using the more general meth-ods developed for numerical data. To avoid misleading the analyst into drawing incorrect conclusions when employing this approach, it is crucial to find a quantification that pre-serves the relationships within the data set.
 In [17] an interactive quantification process was presented, which utilises the efficiency of algorithmic data analysis as well as making use of the knowledge of domain experts. This process identifies numerical representations that preserve re-lationships within the data and enables modification based on the analysis task and user knowledge.
 This paper presents MiDAVisT (Mixed Data Analysis Vi-sualization Tool), which is an application that has evolved from the process and interactive environment presented in [17]. MiDAVisT is an interactive tool for analysis of cat-egorical and mixed data sets that provides a combined al-gorithmic and user controlled quantification of categorical variables, enabling analysis using both algorithmic methods and visual representations developed for purely numerical data sets. MiDAVisT also provides an interactive environ-ment for visual and exploratory analysis where commonly used visual representations for numerical data are provided and combined with common algorithmic analysis methods to facilitate detection of patterns and relationships between categorical and numerical variables. The effectiveness and generality of the application is demonstrated through anal-ysis of the geospatial data set from the VAST 2008 Migrant Boat Mini-Challenge [13]. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as: The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents related research. In section 3 the quantification process is described and in section 4 the visual exploration environment of Mi-DAVisT is presented. Section 5 contains a case scenario, fol-lowed by conclusions and future work in section 6. Colour versions of all figures are available in the online pdf version of the paper.
 Several visualization techniques exist that are designed specif-ically for visualization of categorical data. Some examples being fourfold displays [9], where the cell frequencies of two-by-two tables are represented by quarter circles, mosaic dis-plays and mosaic matrices [8; 9], which represent multi-way tables with tiles whose sizes are proportional to the cell fre-quencies. Parallel sets [19] is a visual representation with a layout similar to parallel coordinates [15; 29] where the categories of a categorical variable are represented with a set of boxes whose sizes are proportional to the category frequency. In parallel sets the numerical variables of mixed data sets are represented by separating numerical values into bins. Furthermore, one example where the layout of paral-lel coordinates is used for categorical data visualization is presented in [14], where parallel coordinates are extended to avoid data overlay, meaning data items being concealed by other data items. This is achieved by spreading the lines over additional axes and by sorting the lines according to what categories they belong to in the adjacent axes. These techniques are all relevant to the visualization of cat-egorical and mixed data, and are hence related to the ap-proach presented in this paper. However they all suggest single visual representations, whereas the application pre-sented in this paper focuses on quantification of categorical data and analysis using common methods and visual repre-sentations for numerical data, hence providing a more gen-eral and diverse environment for visual analysis.
 A range of measures exist for measuring the similarity be-tween individual categorical data items. The most simple one being the overlap similarity [5] which assigns a similar-ity value of 1 if two items match for a variable and 0 if they do not match. The overlap similarity has a major drawback in that all matches and all mismatches are treated as equal. The Jaccard coefficient [27] is a similarity measure for bi-nary data which is also based on category matching, but only considers matching of ones for binary items, whereas matching of zeros is ignored, this makes the Jaccard coef-ficient a suitable similarity measure for sparse data. None of these similarity measures are, however, suitable for the application presented in this paper unless modifications are made, since categorical variables are, in general, not binary and since both measures only consider whether items match or not and do not take any other properties of similarity into consideration. Another approach to similarity in cate-gorical data is to use data-driven similarity measures, such as the Goodall, Occurrence Frequency, and Smirnov similarity measures [5]. For these measures the frequency distribution of variables is taken into account when measuring similarity and, as a result, the behaviour of the measures is directly dependent on the structures in the data set, and is hence not as general as numerical similarity.
 Several approaches to quantification of categorical data have been presented. In [20] a technique for ordering of cate-gorical data is introduced, using clustering and domain se-mantics. In [25] categorical data is quantified based on the association of categories in a categorical space. The quantifi-cation is achieved using Correspondence Analysis (CA) [12], as described in detail in section 3.1. In [22] this technique is incorporated into a framework for mapping of diverse data types.
 CA has been used in different ways in visualization. In [8; 9] it is used to reorder the categories in mosaic displays, and [12] presents a number of ways to visualize the result of CA using scatter plot techniques, such as CA Maps where CA is used to position the categories in a plot, and CA Bi-plots where each row and column of a table is displayed as a point. In [12] CA is also suggested as a technique for quantification of categorical data in order to apply statistical techniques that require numerical data.
 The quantification approach of MiDAVisT is based on the quantification process presented in [17]. This process is sim-ilar to the approach presented in [25], but extends it by in-corporating the relationships of numerical variables into the quantification process and by utilising the domain knowledge of expert users, as described in detail in section 3. In addition to this MiDAVisT also provides an interactive environment for visual exploration by combining algorith-mic analysis and multiple coordinated views. Using multi-ple coordinated views is a well established concept [3; 6; 24] that has been successfully used to overcome the difficulty of presenting large amounts of data in one screen while simul-taneously making it possible to find detailed structures. A number of toolkits and applications exist that can be used for visual exploration using multiple coordinated views com-bined with algorithm analysis, some examples are XmdvTool [28], GAV [16], InfoVis Toolkit [7] and the Hierarchical Clus-tering Explorer [26]. MiDAVisT has been implemented using the GAV framework. This section briefly describes an interactive process for quan-tification based on algorithmic analysis and knowledge of domain experts, which was introduced in [17]. MiDAVisT employs this approach for quantification of categorical data, as well as for identification of similarities and relationships between categories. The data set used to demonstrate the process is an automobile data set containing 205 data items and including 6 categorical and 8 numerical variables [2]. When performing quantification of categorical data it is of high importance to find numerical representations that pre-serve the existing relationships within the data set. The quantification process described in this section uses CA to identify similarities between categories, however any algo-rithm able to identify similarities between categories could be used. CA is a method for analysis of frequency tables, where each cell represents the frequency of a combination of categories [11; 12; 25]. An example frequency table for two categorical variables (eye colour and hair colour) is shown in table 1. For larger numbers of categorical variables, tables that contain all possible category combinations within the data set are used.
 CA identifies similarities between the cells of the frequency table, and can be seen as a special case of Principal Compo-nents Analysis [18]. An example of similarity between cate-gories can be seen in table 1 where the brown and hazel rows follow a similar pattern with highest frequency for brown hair and lowest frequency for blond hair. Hence brown and hazel can be considered to be similar. The row representing blue eyes is less similar to brown and hazel , with high frequencies for both brown and blond hair.
 Initially CA computes a correspondence matrix, P = N where N is the frequency table and n is the grand total of the table. P is normalised and centred (equation 1) using ~r and ~c , which are vectors containing the row and column sums respectively, and D r and D c , which are diagonal matrices with ~r and ~c as diagonals.
 CA identifies independent dimensions in the frequency ta-ble by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), S = U X V T where U and V are unitary matrices and  X  is a di-agonal matrix where the diagonal values are singular values of S [10]. The first independent dimension explains most of the variance within the table, and the variance explained decreases with every succeeding dimension. Principal axes, F , of the table rows are extracted as in equation 2. Based on the theory of optimal scaling [12] the first principal axis of F , which is related to the first independent dimension in SVD, can be used as numerical representations of the row categories in the frequency table. In this way a quantifica-tion is performed based on the relationships of all categories within the data set. Table 2 displays the first principal axis when CA has been applied to table 1. As can be seen the brown and hazel categories are represented by values close to each other, suggesting that they are similar, whereas blue is represented by a value further away, indicating that it is less similar to brown and hazel . CA is performed on frequency tables where each cell repre-sents the frequency of a combination of two categories, hence enabling a quantification based on the relationships within the categorical variables. If performing CA on a data set containing both categorical and numerical variables, the nu-merical variables need to be incorporated into the frequency Table 1: A frequency table for two variables, eye colour (rows) and hair colour (columns). Each cell in the table represents the frequency of a combination of categories. Table 2: The first principal axis when CA has been per-formed on table 1. The values of this axis are used as nu-merical representations of the row categories.
 Figure 1: The suggested quantification of the categorical variables subsequent to correspondence analysis, displayed using parallel coordinates. Each category is represented by its name. The dark red arrows point out the categories five and three in the number-of-cylinders variable, which are con-sidered similar to each other. A category that is considered less similar to them ( eight ) is pointed out by a light green arrow. table. This categorization must be done in a way that pre-serves the existing numerical relationships. In this way a quantification is performed that is based on relationships within both categorical and numerical variables.
 The quantification process used in MiDAVisT provides two methods for categorization of numerical data. One being a manual categorization, where the user is allowed to inter-actively divide the data items into a number of categories guided by a visual display, and the other being an algorith-mic categorization using K -means clustering [21]. Using the K -means categorization the relationships within the numer-ical variables are preserved, and hence the distance informa-tion within the numerical variables influences the quantifi-cation. The quantification achieved through categorization of nu-merical data followed by CA is presented to the user using parallel coordinates, as shown in figure 1. This is a sugges-tion of how the categories can be quantified, based on the relationships within the data set, and also a presentation of similarities between categories. In figure 1 for instance, the categories five and three in the number-of-cylinders vari-able (pointed out with dark red arrows) are considered sim-ilar since they are positioned close together, whereas eight (pointed out with a light green arrow) is considered less sim-ilar to five and three since it is positioned further away from them.
 Although the algorithmic quantification is efficient, a domain expert may possess knowledge about the data and of the analysis task that the algorithm is unable to detect. To make use of this domain knowledge MiDAVisT allows the user to modify the result of the quantification. The modifications include a manual reordering, which is performed by dragging and dropping categories within an interactive display, as well as a category weighting where the user assigns weight values to combinations of categories to indicate whether they are to be more or less similar to each other, followed by CA re-computation as described in detail in [17].
 In addition to this MiDAVisT also provides the possibility of undoing the modifications made by the user. This provides interactivity and exploratory freedom to the user by allow-ing analysis of different modifications without demanding a re-quantification to return to the quantification originally suggested by the algorithm. For categorical variables with high cardinality, difficulties may arise if different categories are represented with numer-ical values close to each other. Since one category may con-ceal others this can cause a cluttered display. To avoid this MiDAVisT allows the user to merge several categories into one.
 The merging can be performed based on the distance be-tween the quantified categories, using a distance threshold which is interactively controlled by the user. This results in a merging where highly similar categories are merged into one representative category. Another approach available is a manual grouping where the user interactively selects a num-ber of categories that are to be merged into one. In ad-dition to this MiDAVisT provides possibilities of splitting any merged group of variables into their original categories throughout the analysis process. Figure 2 displays the scat-ter plot and figure 3 the graphical user interface (GUI) used for merging of categories. The glyphs of the scatter plot represent the categories of a selected variable, the x-axis represents the first principal axis achieved through CA, and the y-axis represents the second principal axis. In the GUI a threshold is set to identify categories that are close enough to be merged into one category, the suggested groups are repre-sented by colour in the scatter plot, where the same colour is used for all categories within a group. One group containing three categories is selected and highlighted in black in figure 2, and the names of the categories are displayed within the GUI (figure 3). The quantification process described in section 3 not only provides a quantification of categorical variables which is based both on relationships within the whole data set and on the knowledge of an expert user. Through the visual representations used, it also provides an understanding of relationships and similarities between categories. Further-more, any data set that has been quantified in MiDAVisT can be saved and re-opened at a later time, preserving all in-formation on quantification and modifications made by the user.
 In addition to the quantification MiDAVisT also provides an interactive environment for visual exploration of categor-ical and mixed data sets using multiple coordinated views. Within this environment the data set is treated as a numer-ical data set and three common visual representations for numerical multivariate data are used. Figure 4 shows the environment where a scatter plot matrix [4] is positioned in the top left view, a table lens [23] in the top right view and parallel coordinates [15; 29] in the bottom view. Within the table lens and parallel coordinates the category names are presented in addition to the numerical representations. The Figure 2: The scatter plot of the category merging inter-face, which displays the distribution of categories within a selected variable along the first and second principal axis re-sulting from correspondence analysis. In this example three categories (coloured in black) are selected to be merged into one.
 Figure 3: The graphical user interface (GUI) for merging categories. Merging can be either fully manual or guided by a similarity threshold. The names of the three categories selected in figure 2 are displayed in the right part of the GUI. views are coordinated so that any selection or highlighting of items in one view is immediately reflected in the others. To facilitate detection of structures and relationships in the data three different colour schemes are available within Mi-DAVisT. The default colour scheme uses a single colour to represent the data items that are not highlighted, as shown in figure 4. Using this colour scheme, individual items that are selected and highlighted in red are easily perceived in the parallel coordinates and table lens, enabling an understand-ing of the behaviour of individual items. The second colour scheme facilitates understanding of the relationships of cat-egories, by supplying one individual colour for each category of a selected categorical variable, as shown in the top view of figure 5 where colouring is done according to the categories of the number-of-cylinders variable and parallel coordinates are used to display the colour schemes.
 The third colour scheme, shown in the bottom view of figure 5, is used to emphasize cluster structures within the data set. This colouring is achieved by performing K -means clustering on the whole data set after the categorical variables have been quantified. Each cluster is assigned a unique colour and the data items are coloured according to their cluster membership.
 In MiDAVisT the understanding of relationships between variables is facilitated through visual representation of cor-relation values. The Pearson correlation coefficient, r , is computed for every pair of variables according to equation 3, where N is the total number of data items and ~x ~x k are variables where j, k = 1 , ..., M and M is the total number of variables in the data set. r ( ~x j , ~x k ) =  X  The correlation values are represented by coloured cells in the top left half of the scatter matrix, as shown in figure 4, where each cell represents the correlation of a variable pair. Positive correlation is represented by purple, and negative correlation by green. Strong correlations are represented by darker colour than weak correlations.
 Figure 5: Two of the colour schemes available in MiDAVisT (a colour version of the figure is available in the online pdf version of the paper). The top view displays a colouring according to the number-of-cylinders variable, where each category of this variable is assigned a unique colour. The bottom view displays a cluster colouring, where colours are assigned according to cluster belonging when K -means clus-tering has been performed on the whole data set.
 In this section MiDAVisT will be used to analyse the data set from the VAST 2008 Migrant Boat Mini-Challenge [13]. This is a geospatial data set including a combination of cat-egorical and numerical variables and contains information on 917 migrant boats departing from the fictional Isla Del Sue  X no during the years 2005 to 2007. The mini challenge included three tasks: to characterize the choice of landing sites and their evolution over the three years, to character-ize the geographical patterns of interdiction over the three years, and to find the successful landing rate over the time period. This section will demonstrate how MiDAVisT can be used to provide answers to the above questions, and also how the application can be successfully used for exploratory analysis of a mixed data set.
 Since MiDAVisT has been developed to be a general tool for analysis of mixed data it has no support for any specific visual representations for geospatial data, such as a map. Hence some relationships, for instance the geographical dis-tance between two locations, are not as intuitive to under-stand as they would have been if a map was included in the analysis. However, although it would have been possible to adapt MiDAVisT to fit this specific data set by includ-ing a map in the visual exploration environment, we have chosen not to do so. Instead this analysis provides an ex-ample of how MiDAVisT, due to its generality, can be used to analyse a specific kind of mixed data set. Furthermore, MiDAVisT has no support for specific data formats, such as the geographic coordinates that are used in the Migrant Boat data set, and hence the data set had to be slightly mod-ified prior to analysis. The modified data set includes six numerical variables: Encounter Coordinates Longitude , En-counter Coordinates Latitude , Number of Passengers , Num-ber of Deaths , Launch Coordinates Longitude and Launch Coordinates Latitude , and five categorical variables: Record Type , USCG Vessel , Encounter Year , Encounter Month and Vessel Type . The encounter date was presented as a single variable in the original data set, including year, month and day, but was divided into two categorical variables since it was considered probable that an analyst of this data would be more interested in finding patterns and similarities be-tween years and months than finding patterns for specific dates. The first step of analysing the data set is to quantify the cat-egorical data. The quantification is done using clustering to categorize the numerical variables as described in sections 3.1 and 3.2. This provides a quantification based on the relationships within all variables. The result of the quan-tification, which is a suggestion of similarities between cat-egories, is displayed in figure 6 using parallel coordinates. From the display it can be see that for the Encounter Month variable the categories June , July and Oct (pointed out by black arrows) are positioned close together, indicating that the migrant boats follow similar patterns for these months, whereas it is indicated that the patterns for Feb (pointed out by a red arrow) are more different from the patterns for June , July and Oct , since it is positioned further away from them.
 The second axis from the left is the USCG Vessel variable. Figure 6: The Migrant Boat data set after quantification. The distances between categories suggest similarities and dissimilarities to the analyst. The months June , July and Oct are pointed out by black arrows and Feb is pointed out by a red arrow.
 Figure 7: The parallel coordinates plot coloured according to a K -means clustering performed on the whole data set. This variable contains information on the name of the coast guard cutter that was involved in any interdiction of migrant boats. The migrant boats that managed to make it ashore (represented by the category Landing in the Record Type variable which is positioned to the left in the parallel coor-dinates) all belong to the Missing category for USCG Vessel since no interdiction took place. The Missing category is positioned far from the other categories of the USCG Ves-sel variable which indicates that the patterns of the boats belonging to the Missing category is rather different from the patterns of the boats belonging to the other categories. This is considered a reasonable result since there probably are some general differences between the boats that made it ashore and the boats that were interdicted at sea.
 To identify whether any major multivariate patterns exist in the data set, the cluster colouring is used. Figure 7 displays the data set using parallel coordinates where K -means clus-tering has been applied to the whole data set. Three clusters are identified and represented by different colours in the dis-play. One cluster, represented by a dark red colour, mainly includes migrant boats which were encountered in areas with relatively high latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. The boats of this cluster mainly belong to the Missing category of the USCG Vessel variable (second axis from the left), and hence include boats that managed to land ashore. A second cluster is coloured light green and includes boats with lower latitudinal encounter coordinates than the dark red cluster. The majority of the boats belonging to the light green clus-ter were not successful, as can be seen from the Record Type variable where most of the migrant boats included in the light green cluster belong to the Interdiction category. Fi-nally there exist a small cluster which is represented by a Figure 8: The quantified Migrant Boat data set presented in a scatter plot matrix where the cells in the top left half of the matrix represents the correlation of variable pairs using colour and numeric values. dark purple colour. This cluster represents boats that were encountered in a region with low latitudinal and longitudinal encounter coordinates. In the scatter plot matrix in the visual exploration environ-ment of MiDAVisT, displayed in figure 8, it is visible from the dark colouring of the cells that four variable pairs have strong pairwise correlations. The dark purple cell at the bottom left of the matrix represents the Record Type and USCG Vessel variable pair. This pair has a very strong pos-itive correlation due to the fact that a coast guard cutter name is registered for all boats where an interdiction took place, whereas the cutter name is missing for all boats that made it ashore. A more interesting relationship is the neg-ative correlation between Record Type and Encounter Coor-dinates Longitude , represented by the dark green cell at the centre of the leftmost column. To find out more about this relationship a filtering is done on the Encounter Coordinates Longitude axis in the parallel coordinates, as displayed in figure 9, where only migrant boats which were encountered at relatively low longitudinal coordinates are retained. As can be seen from the parallel coordinates display all migrant boats with low values for Encounter Coordinates Longitude belong to the Landing category of the Record Type variable (leftmost axis) and hence made it ashore. To the right of the cell representing the Record Type and Encounter Coor-dinates Longitude variable pair in the scatter plot matrix is the cell representing the USCG Vessel and Encounter Co-ordinates Longitude variable pair. The correlation of this variable pair is identical to the correlation between Record Type and Encounter Coordinates Longitude , which is a con-sequence of the strong correlation between the Record Type and USCG Vessel variables.
 The fourth cell where a strong correlation can be identified is found in the centre of the scatter plot matrix. This cell rep-resents the correlation between the Encounter Coordinates Figure 9: The Migrant Boat data set when filtering is per-formed on the Encounter Coordinates Longitude variable and only migrant boats which were encountered on relatively low longitudinal coordinates are retained.
 Longitude and the Encounter Coordinates Latitude variables and is coloured dark purple which indicates a strong posi-tive correlation. By examining the relationship between the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates in the parallel coor-dinates it is found that all migrant boats where the longitu-dinal encounter coordinates are low also have low latitudinal coordinates, as can be seen in figure 9. Furthermore it can be seen from the figure that the low encounter coordinates are clearly separated from the higher longitudinal and lati-tudinal encounter coordinates. This indicates the existence of a rather small geographic region, positioned relatively far away from the other encounter regions, where several mi-grant boats were encountered.
 Furthermore, one coloured cell can be found in the scatter plot matrix. This cell is positioned in the middle of the third column from the left and represents the correlation between the Encounter Coordinates Longitude variable and the En-counter Year variable. It is not as dark as the four other cells and hence does not represent as strong a correlation as they do. The correlation is strong enough, however, to indicate the existence of a relationship that might be interesting to look more closely into. The relationship between years and encounter coordinates is examined by filtering on year in the parallel coordinates, as displayed in figure 10, where the migrant boats of 2005, 2006 and 2007 are retained in the top, centre and bottom view respectively. To find out whether any relationship between Record Type , encounter year and coordinates is present, the colouring is done according to the Record Type variable (left-most axis in the parallel coordinates), where light blue rep-resents Landing and dark red represents Interdiction . From the encounter coordinates variables, surrounded by a yel-low and grey rectangle in the figure, it is found that during 2005 all boats were encountered within one main region with rather high longitudinal coordinates and medium high lati-tudinal coordinates. This might suggest that most migrant boats leaving the island in 2005 followed a similar route and headed towards one specific geographical region.
 In 2006 (centre view) the patterns for encounter coordinates have changed and are spread over two regions. The rela-tively small geographical region, where the encounters took place in 2005, has grown into a large region including areas with noticeably higher latitudinal coordinate. In addition a new and clearly separated region of encounter can be found, Figure 10: Parallel coordinates filtered according to year. From the top the views display the migrant boats encoun-tered in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. The colouring is done according to Record Type where dark red represents Intersection and light blue represents Landing . with low longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates. This in-dicates that the migrants might have changed their tactics from 2005, using different routes and possibly heading to-ward different geographical regions, to minimize the risk of an interdiction. Furthermore, by examining the colouring for 2006, and comparing it to the encounter coordinates of 2005, it can be found that almost all interdictions in 2006 (represented by dark red lines) are made in the encounter region of 2005. This suggests that the coast guard focused their search for migrants based on the encounters of last year. In 2007 there were even more encounters in the region with high latitudinal coordinates and more in the region with low longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates as well, as can be seen in the bottom view of figure 10. In 2006 there were almost only successful landings within those regions and the migrants have clearly learnt from previous year which routes are the best to use. Similarly, the region where interdictions take place (dark red lines) has grown since 2006, which in-dicates that the coast guard has adapted its search to the encounters of the previous year. Although the correlation and clusters, as well as the filtering in parallel coordinates, has given an understanding of rela-tionships between variables and an overview of major multi-variate patterns and possibly interesting relationships within the data set, it has not provided any understanding of the frequency distribution between categories. This is one of the (a) Sorting and colouring according to the Encounter Year variable (third column from the left). (b) Sorting and colouring according to the Record Type vari-able (leftmost column).
 Figure 11: The table lens sorted and coloured according to Encounter Year and Record Type . major problems when analysing categorical data using paral-lel coordinates, since data items conceal each other. A table lens fits the purpose of analysing frequencies better. By sort-ing the columns of the table lens and by colouring according to specific categories it is possible to find some further infor-mation about the migrant boats. In figure 11(a) the data set is sorted and coloured according to Encounter Year (third column from the left), with 2005 at the top coloured in light green, 2006 in the middle coloured in blue and 2007 at the bottom coloured in dark red. From the height of the rect-angular regions in the table lens it can be seen that there were approximately twice as many migrant boats in 2006 as in 2005, and that the number also doubled from 2006 to 2007. Similarly it is visible in figure 11(b), where sorting and colouring is done according to Record Type (leftmost column), that approximately half of the migrant boats suc-cessfully landed, as represented by light blue in the top part of the column.
 It is also of interest to examine whether there have been any changes in landing rates during the time period. This can be done by combining the previously performed filtering on years in the parallel coordinates, as shown in figure 10, with sorting according to Encounter Year and colouring according to Record Type . This analysis does not provide any exact figures for the landing rate, but provides a quite clear and intuitive understanding of the approximate landing rates and the change over the years.
 In the top view of figure 12 only the migrant boats of 2005 are retained and displayed using the table lens. Successful landings are represented by light blue in the display and by long lines in the leftmost column which represent Record Type , while interdictions are represented by dark red and short lines in the Record Type column. As can be seen the number of interdictions is noticeably higher than the number of landings. In the centre of figure 12 the migrant boats of 2006 are retained. Here the rate between Landing (light blue) and Interdiction (dark red) is more equal, indicating an increase in landings, although there still appears to be a small majority of interdictions. The migrant boats of 2007 Figure 12: The table lens sorted according to Encounter Year and coloured according to Record Type , light blue rep-resenting Landings and dark red representing Interdictions . The top, centre and bottom views display the migrant boats of 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. are displayed in the bottom view of figure 12. Here the light blue landings appear to be more numerous than the dark red interdictions, and it is clear that the rate of successful landings has increased from previous years.
 There are clear differences between the migrant boats of the different years, in particular the number of boats clearly in-creases throughout the time period. Similarly it seems prob-able that there exist differences in boat frequencies through-out the seasons of the year, for instance due to meteorologi-cal issues. To find out if this is the case the Encounter Month variable is examined. The previously performed quantifica-tion provided a suggestion of similarities between different months, but for analysing and comparing the frequencies throughout the seasons of the year it is more useful to exam-ine the months using their natural order. Hence the manual reordering of categories is used, as described in section 3.3, to interactively reorder the categories of the Encounter Month variable. Figure 13 displays the data after the Encounter Month variable has been reordered, using a table lens where sorting and colouring is done according to Encounter Month , with January at the bottom of the column and December at the top. As can be seen from the figure April, May, June, July and August are the months when most migrant boats are encountered, whereas January, February, November and December have relatively few migrant boat encounters. The analysis described in this section provides answers to the three tasks of the IEEE VAST 2008 Mini-Challenge Migrant Boats . Furthermore it provides a general understanding of relationships between the variables of the data set, the inter-nal relationships between categories and an overview of the main patterns and relationships within the data set. When comparing the result of the analysis with the results pre-sented in, for example, [1] they generally agree very well. Figure 13: The table lens ordered and coloured according to Encounter Month after the months have been reordered manually by the user. To facilitate the interpretation of the figure the names of the months are written to the right of the areas representing them.
 However, parts of the analysis presented here would have been more intuitive and could have been investigated in more detail if a map view would have been available in the explo-ration environment of MiDAVisT. On the other hand, the generality and exploratory properties of MiDAVisT guides and encourages the analyst to discover major trends and patterns as well as local relationships and behaviours, with-out any limitations regarding the area of analysis. This paper presents MiDAVisT, an application for quantifi-cation of categorical data and exploration of data sets includ-ing both categorical and numerical variables. The quantifi-cation process used in MiDAVisT was introduced in [17] and enables a quantification based on the relationships within all variables of a mixed data set as well as utilising the knowl-edge of a domain expert. MiDAVisT extends the analysis possibilities enabled by the quantification process by pro-viding a multiple view environment for visual exploration and analysis of categorical and mixed data sets, using gen-eral and commonly used visual representations and analysis methods developed for numerical data sets. The main ben-efit of MiDAVisT is its ability to merge the quantification process into an interactive environment that enables versa-tile exploration.
 The effectiveness of MiDAVisT is presented through a case scenario, where the quantification process and the features of the visual exploration environment are used to analyse a data set from one of the VAST 2008 Mini-Challenges [13]. This data set includes information on landings and interdic-tions of migrant boats during a three year period. The sce-nario demonstrates how the quantification process combined with analysis methods traditionally used for purely numer-ical data sets can be used to identify multivariate patterns regarding the behaviour of the migrant boats over time. It also demonstrates how MiDAVisT can be successfully used to identify relationships between categorical and numerical variables.
 Future work includes an evaluation of the efficiency and use-fulness of the quantification process and the application to-gether with domain experts and potential end-users. Fur-thermore, additional analysis methods will be included in the exploration environment to further facilitate exploration and detection of patterns and relationships.
