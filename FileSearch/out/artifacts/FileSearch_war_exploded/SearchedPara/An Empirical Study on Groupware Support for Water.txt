 Ontology [1] is a formal specification of concepts and their relationships. By defining a common vocabulary, ontologies reduce concept definition mistakes, allowing for shared understanding, improved communications, and a more detailed description of resources. Ontologies have crossed the borders of philosophy, achieving an important position in Computer Science. 
The ontology creation supplies a structure of the domain information that assists the common agreement of the domain between people and between software agents, eliminating possible ambiguities and allowing the interoperability between systems and the information re-use. Besides make a hierarch of the domain concepts, ontolo-gies also explain the rules that conduct such concepts, allowing the inference of new information. This way, it became comparable to a knowledge base of the modeled between the domain knowledge and the system operational knowledge. In Database information systems, ontologies can be used as a broker between heterogeneous sys-tems, to facilitate tasks inter-mediation and to help in knowledge storage, being used to publish semantic enriched documents. [8] 1.1 Motivation The necessity of this work appeared from the development of knowledge management systems from COPPE/UFRJ Hydrology Laboratory (LabHID). An important aspect that makes these systems efficient in an environment where the activities are strongly conditioned to the domain is that during the information processing and analysis, limitations and rules imposed by this domain are relevant. Because of its characteris-tics, we can use ontologies to make this aspect respected. In the LabHID, ontologies can be used to guarantee that the artifacts wi ll be classified and easily identified to be re-used. To have a common vocabulary between the laboratory systems and all the unique ontology. The knowledge management system boarded here is Toth [8], which is a CBR (Case Based Reasoning) tool for scientific processes re-use, and creates an archival of information on water resources for the LabHID. To create a new ontology, the ontology designer doesn X  X  need to start from scratch. Instead, he can re-use existing ontologies. To use several ontologies in the creation of a new one, it will be necessary to join them. Ontology re-use is now one of the impor-tant research issues in the ontology field. [3] 
In [4], we investigate the problems that may arise and propose an ontology integra-tion support module to be added to COE [7]. In this paper we describe an experiment on tool support for collaborative ontology manipulation including ontology integra-tion, and discuss how the COE (Collaborative Ontology Editor) can support collabo-rative ontology manipulation, including ontology integration. Our previous results in dedicated to create a new ontology, and obtained better quality ontologies. This paper thus explores whether groupware tools can improve ontology integration so that their effort can be justified. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents Toth, and shows why ontol-ogy is necessary. Section 3 presents some tools for ontology integration, discusses ontology re-use methodologies and briefly introduces COE. Section 4 presents our experiment for evaluating tool support for collaborative ontology manipulation in-cluding ontology integration. Section 5 discusses the results of the experiment. Con-clusions are given in Section 6. The main objective of the studies accomplished by the professionals of the LabHID is to identify the potential, limitations and problems of Brazilian hydrological basins in basin. These studies are accomplished through agreements with the Brazilian gov-ernmental Institutes responsible for the definition of these policies. [8] 
A workflow management system, in this environment, aids activity planning and allows control and coordination of these activities. Besides, the information generated during the planning and execution of the work can be considered as activities X  docu-mentation. However, the workflow system doesn X  X  have as its objective to support the collaboration among the professionals, fast er knowledge identification and creation, nor facilitating re-use of best practices. That is the Thoth objective. 
Thoth considers that knowledge about previous analysis can increase work effi-ciency, so as to allow re-use of successful practices, the notion about how the data had workflow system with the main purpose of allowing processes re-use, the visualiza-tion of information about past activities and collaboration among researchers. 
The CBR approach is used to reach such aims. This approach takes advantage of the knowledge obtained from previous attempts to solve a similar problem (a case), here the approach is performed by raising the analogy between process instances stored on the Workflow Management System and the cases. 
The use of similarity devices allows that the most important aspects, on the re-searchers X  optics, can be used during the localization and the cases re-use. However, larly in projects related with the hydrology area it is important to recognize the hydro-studied and the models that had been used during the analysis that had been executed. The recognition of these characteristics is carried through by the ontology. 
Thoth architecture is showed in Fig 1. The ontology is used at two moments: first spective metadata) used in the processes, for example, visualized maps, read and generated documents and reports, spread sheets and tables of data, amongst others. The second moment is during the localization of the similar processes. The similarity between the processes is defined through the analysis of the supplied ontological comparison of the concepts that classify two or more compared processes. 
The ontology used in this environment brings some challenges. First, the ontology construction process and the similarity definition processes are complex, and, the ontology and its relations and concepts can be modified with the system evolution. 
Moreover, part of the maps, reports and data that are analyzed are from other insti-tutions, as the National Agency of Water (ANA), who regulates the use of the re-Statistics (IBGE), supplier for example of the Brazilian tax data and the economic profile of Brazilian regions, amongst other Brazilian or International research agen-cies. These data bring new concepts, rules and knowledge that they need to be repre-sented in the ontology, for example a bigger detailing of a basin or river still not rep-resented in the ontology. 
Thus, it is important to know that the ontology must be in constant evolution, with the possibility of addition of new concepts, relationships and restrictions or modifying the existing ones. Ontolingua Server, OntoEdit and APECKS are client-server approaches to knowledge help the development of shared ontologies. OntoEdit is a collaborative ontology edi-tor for the Semantic Web. APECKS is an ontology server that supports collaboration allowing individuals to keep private ontologies. [4] Studies carried out in the area of ontology integration offer a few methodologies. placed on the area, and a few academic systems have emerged, such as PROMPT and Chimaera. PROMPT is an interactive ontology X  X erging tool that guides the user through the merging process making suggestions, determining conflicts, and propos-ing conflict-resolution strategies. Chimaera is an ontology merging and diagnosis tool developed by the Stanford University Knowledge Systems Laboratory. [4] 3.1 Ontology Re-use ontology field. There are 2 different re-use processes: merge and integration . Merge is the process of building an ontology into one subject re-using two or more different ontologies on the same subject [3]. Integration is the process of building an ontology into subject re-using one or more ontologies in different subjects [3]. In an integration process source ontologies are aggregated an d combined, to form the resulting ontol-ogy, possibly after re-used ontologies have suffered some changes, such as, extension, cluded in the overall process of ontology building. 
A lot of research has been conducted under the merge area. There is a clear defini-[3] In the integration area a similar effort is beginning. The most representative ontol-ogy building methodologies [7] recognize integration as part of the ontology devel-more complex than previously anticipated. It is a process in its own. 3.2 Collaborative Ontology Editor (COE) Because their use becomes more common in a wide variety of applications, with many projects developing new ontologies, it X  X  possible to find two or more different ontologies representing the same or similar knowledge [6]. Taking into account that ontology creation can be a complex and time-consuming process, a tool that enables share and re-use of ontologies is considered of great utility. 
COE [7] is a peer-to-peer (P2P) application designed to allow ontology developers to share their knowledge. It provides many activities: ontology creation, edition, shar-ing, re-use, and other traditional P2P mechanisms. It is implemented over COPPEER 1 ; therefore, its users can also take advantage of non-specific collaboration tools provided by it, such as an instant messaging (chat) tool and a file exchange tool. center), insert, remove, and move nodes (and their corresponding sub-trees). 3.3 Ontology Integration in COE ontology building process. The building process framework showed in Fig 3 is well explained in [3]. Here, as in the major works about ontology integration, this process, in this case the  X  X pply integration operation X  activity, is only cited. In an attempt to gration, that was added to the ontology building process. 
As in any process, integration is made of several activities. We have identified the activities that should take place along the ontology building lifecycle to perform inte-gration. The integration does not substitute the building; but is a part of it. 
Activities that precede integration help th e ontology designer to analyze, compare, and choose the ontologies that are going to be reused. The ontology integration proc-ess was divided in 3 phases. The first involves  X  X yntactic Reduction X  (SR) and  X  X in-guistic Comparison X  (LC). In the second, the  X  X ntology Reduction X  (OR) is carried through, and in the third phase the  X  X emantic Comparison X  (SC) [Fig 3]. 
The SR is made to the concept X  X  name, description and list of synonyms, using a stemming algorithm and stop words elimination. In LC the concepts with a high rate of similar terms are classified as "very similar X . The concepts with a low rate of simi-larity will be used in phase 3. In OR the ontological structure simplification and prop-erties, as well as axiom elimination are made. Only the relations  X  X s-a X  are considered because they are necessary in the next phase. In SC the objective is to reach the hier-archical structure of the concept.  X  X ow similar X  concepts of the first phase are com-pared considering only its position in its tree, and this allows finding the region where one concept could be placed. Here, concepts rated as  X  X ery similar X  will be suggested to be integrated. More details can be found in [4]. Design criteria guide the integration After integration, one should evaluate and analyze the resulting ontology. 
In summary, the integration process can be organized into 3 stages: find the places equivalence and subsumption relations (aligning); check the consistency, coherency ontology integration, the research presented in [4] proposes an ontology integration support module, through which the system suggests integrations to the user. The suggestions possess a degree of trustworthiness. In the following two sections we describe our study on tool support for collaborative ontology manipulation including ontology integration. 4.1 Research Approach and Hypotheses Collaborative Integration: The main goal of collaborative work in our study is to ontology integration, is a tool that improves group work, easing collaboration among the members. Ontology Integration: Due to the tool support, we need to identify how people inte-grate ontologies manually, in the attempt to evaluate the ontology integration process proposed in [4]. This way, we believe we can try to validate the integration process or even partially validate it. Moreover, try to find new strategies created by experiment participants that can improve the process proposed. Water Resources Ontology: We also want to validate the ontology created by a non-specialist, in [8]. The ontology was built as a hierarchical structure, using hyponymy (is-a relation), to be used in the COPPE/UFRJ Hydrology Laboratory (LabHID), where subjects related to Brazilian hydrological basins are studied. Amongst the countless possibilities, this ontology will be used to identify and classify metadata and ontology to facilitate the communication with external institutions. To validate the existing ontology, we created a new one, in the same domain, with specialists. 4.2 Experiment Process The experiment was carried out in four stages: in the first, each participant creates an individual ontology (distinct domain parts). The subjects were 10 students from the Civil Engineering undergraduate program, and the domain selected for the experiment was Water Resources. It should be pointed that all of the students are specialists in the domain. To guarantee ontology quality, in the second stage a group of 15 students from the Computer Engineering undergraduate program was invited to transform the badly formed ontologies, created in stage 1, into a well formed 2 one. This was neces-sary because the specialists in Water Resources were not ontology designers. In stage 3, all participants collaborated to create a single ontology (whole domain). In stage 4, the specialists in Water Resources validated the ontology created by a non-specialist, in [8]. 
As pointed before, one of the objectives of this experiment is to validate an ontol-ogy created by a non-specialist in [8]. This ontology has around 120 concepts. So, in overlap) and each participant created one X  X  own ontology with the concepts fed. This ontology must be created using COE. It was defined that the participants had auton-omy to add new related concepts, but all the concepts fed had to be used. 
Another goal of the experiment involved the ontology integration process. In this case, we observed each participant creating ones own ontology, in an attempt to dis-cover new strategies and to evaluate the ontology integration process proposed in [3]. The participant could consult a database wher e he or she could find other ontologies. 
Before the first stage was initiated, a brief training was carried out, aimed at: strengthening ontology concepts, and training the participants in COE. The tutorial created was available during all the experiment. 
In the third stage, a new goal was added: to evaluate the collaborative work in the ontology is the one that will be used to validate the ontology created in [8]. The ex-This process was repeated until only one ontology was left. 
To create a single ontology, group members need to reach an agreement about the concepts and its relations. As this is very difficult in a big group, we decided to initi-ate with small groups, and so the participants were gradually presented to the negotia-tion problem. 4.3 Threats to Validity external validity. Internal Validity. P rimary threat is the selection of subjects and their assignments to particular treatments. To ensure comparability of team performance we randomly selected students to form them. Second threat arises from the fact that we didn X  X  con-formance, was much easier to ensure during the experiment due to tool support. External Validity. Regarding external validity, we took specifications from a real-world application context to develop an inspection object representing a realistic situation. The results are obtained through the  X  X n loco X  observation of the predefined activities, the questionnaire answers, video capture and messages exchanged. The subjects were students participating in a university class. As pointed out in the litera-ture students may not be representative of real developers. However, H X st [11] ob-serve no significant differences between them for small judgment tasks. According to and the data is used to establish a trend. These conditions are both met in our case. In this section we describe key empirical results regarding tool support for collabora-tive ontology manipulation including ontology integration. We analyze defect dis-crimination performance (a) including team discussions, (b) fully automated, and present information on meeting effort (see hypotheses in Section 4.1). We also com-where possible. 5.1 Collaborative Integration At this point, we analyze if the participants collaborative work to create a single on-low cost evaluation methodology to diagnosis usability problems in interfaces, ac-cepted by HCI researchers. The heuristics used are from Teamwork [14], which are specific to groupware evaluation. These heuristics focus on shared workspaces, based on the Collaborative Mechanism framework. [15] Here are the defined questions and variables, beyond the obtained results: Evaluated dimension: Level of collaborative work Questions:  X  Q1 -Communication: degree of interaction and participation in quarrels and  X  Q2 -Collective design: degree of contribution.  X  Q3 -Coordination: degree of concentration and organization.  X  Q4 -Awareness: degree of process understanding. Table 1 summarizes the variables observed during the experiment, through registered and perceived evidences, on the questions presented for the evaluation. 
The following data was collected through  X  X n loco X  observation or extracted from the answers to the questionnaires, captured from videos and message logs. 
As regards the messages, we verified that the number of exchanged messages de-creased and the quality improved, during the experiment. This was an expected result, because it is normal to initiate with many badly elaborated messages, and finish with a lesser number of messages, that are better elaborated. We verified that the group had problems of initial coordination. They delayed about 1 hour organiz-ing themselves, where an acceptable delay is of around half an hour. Despite the coordination problems, 75% of the participants finished the tasks in adequate time. Negotiation problems were well solved in most cases. This can be explained by the fact that the participants are from the same research group, or share similar ideas. 5.2 Ontology Integration process, we chose some variables, based on our experience in the ontology integration process. free, which is, not imposing any rules. To facilitate the work of the participants, some devices were suggested, and organized in two groups: Syntactic and Semantic. The class name and the property name are syntactic devices. The semantic devices are: way, the participant can make use of any external resource needed. However, during the experiment, only in 45% of the cases the researchers made use of internet and/or dictionaries to compare synonym terms. Table 2 shows a summary of the use of the available devices. 
In 100% of the integrations carried out, the participants analyzed the class names and only 40% verified the class properties names. For name comparison, in 55% of properties in account. In 25% of the cases th e relation  X  X s-a X  had been not considered, so, the integration process was made only with the terms X  syntactic analyses. Only one person considered other types of relation beyond the  X  X s-a X  relation. 5.3 Water Resources Ontology final ontology. Some relations were incorrect or non-existent (15%) and many proper-great changes (10%). Fig 4 shows a sketch of the Water Resources final ontology. With the growing availability of large online ontologies, the questions about the inte-gration of independently developed ontologies have become even more important. While in some situations the construction of a new ontology from other ontologies that already exist is only one easiness for the designers, another scene as common is presented in this work, where organizations or people with different backgrounds and interests need to agree on the best form to unify its ontologies in a way that the final ontology, satisfies the necessities of each part. 
In the LabHID, place where this study was carried through, many specialists from civil engineering, mechanic engineering, mathematics and statistics, work collabora-tively with biologists, geography and other researchers of social phenomena in pro-jects where the technician knowledge need to be combined with decisions based on also come from other institutions. So, th ese professionals need to have a common vocabulary, which is an acceptable representation of the domain. 
In this paper we have described an empirical evaluation of tool support for collabo-rative ontology manipulation including ontology integration process. The research integrates concepts from the areas of computer supported cooperative work, ontology engineering, water resources, as well as verification and validation. We focused on the performance of tool-support, where the main purpose was to observe the collabo-rative characteristics. Our empirical data shows that tool support results in a medium performance and the found requirements will be used to improve the tool. Examples of found requirements are: create a chat where each participant has a message with a personalized format; signal arrival messages when the chat window is minimized; the ontology integration process, we need to improve the  X  X ntology Reduction X  algo-rithm, also considering properties and axioms. 
Here is presented part of the obtained results. Complete results can be found in progress of the task, such as memory and internet access problems. This work was partially supported by CAPES and CNPq. We want to thank the par-ticipants in the experiment.
