University of Aberdeen 1. The Problem
Understanding language is one of the great challenges of science, and language-related technology is one of the great opportunities of Information Technology. Con-sequently, many different kinds of researchers work on language issues. Within the computer science community, language is studied by the  X  X CL community, X  by which
I mean researchers who regularly publish in Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) venues, such as the journal Computational Linguistics and ACL conferences. But language-related research is also carried out by researchers in other areas of computer science, including knowledge representation, cognitive modeling, vision and robotics, and human X  X omputer interaction communities. Additionally, there are even more peo-ple outside computer science who study language, including linguists, psycholinguists, philosophers, and sociolinguists.
 huge problems, and it is very useful to have many research communities from diverse backgrounds working on language. This will be especially true if the different research communities are aware of each other, so they can share insights, observations, problems, and so forth.
 in research with other language-related research communities than it used to be. This impression is mostly based on discussions I have had with researchers who are on the border between ACL and another language-research community. Several such people have told me that whereas ten years ago they occasionally submitted papers to ACL venues and attended ACL conferences, now they do not bother, because they believe that the ACL community has no interest in their research.
 in Computational Linguistics in 1995 and in 2005. Specifically, I extracted all citations from
Computational Linguistics (CL) articles (excluding book reviews) in these years to journal papers. I then classified the cited journal papers into one of the categories shown in
Table 1; whenever possible this classification was based on the subject category assigned by ISI Journal Citation Reports (JCR) to the cited journal. For example, a citation of a paper in Cognitive Science would count as a psychology citation, since ISI JCR classifies
Cognitive Science as  X  X sychology, Experimental. X  I counted citations myself, rather than relying on ISI JCR X  X  count, as there were some mistakes in JCR X  X  counting. I also created my own  X  X ther NLP and speech X  classification (that is, references to speech and NLP journals other than Computational Linguistics ), as there is no such category in ISI JCR.
This includes journals such as Computer Speech and Language , Natural Language Engi-neering ,and IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing . I did not look at citations to workshops or conference papers, partly in order to simplify the analysis task, and partly because I am not aware of an independent subject classification of conferences and workshops similar to ISI JCR X  X  journal classifications. I suspect that the main effect of including conference and workshop citations would be to decrease the percentage of citations to non-CS areas (psychology, linguistics, mathematics, other), because CS researchers are much more likely to publish important findings in conferences than researchers in other disciplines.
 ten years old; this gives us an idea as to whether CL authors are influenced by recent work in other areas. I draw the following conclusions from this table: investigating language than 1995 CL authors. I find the steep drop in citations of progress made in psychology and psycholinguistics, partially driven by more wide-spread availability of new technology such as eye trackers and brain scanners. 284 ing , which is another journal in which I believe many members of the ACL community publish. The citation pattern from 2005 NLE papers is overall quite similar to the citation pattern from 2005 CL papers. In particular, looking at references to other language research communities, 2005 NLE papers have a few more references than 2005 CL papers to papers in psychology journals (3% vs. 1%) and HCI journals (2% vs. 0%), exist then.
 impression is that the situation here is similar, and that most ACL conference papers do not make many references to papers from other language research communities. 2. Impact
Does this matter? The ACL community seems to be focusing more on specific niches of the  X  X anguage research X  space, such as low-level syntactic analyses based on sta-tistical corpus-based techniques. This is certainly an important niche, and progress in it will benefit the larger language community; so perhaps the ACL community is right to ignore the larger community and focus on making progress in its specific niches? in particular such a focus makes ACL conferences and Computational Linguistics less intellectually exciting and vigorous. This inward focus also goes against the belief in the larger scientific community that we need more inter-disciplinary work, and more interaction between researchers coming from different backgrounds.
 broader language community also decreases the awareness of the broader community in ACL research. This is because many researchers track references to their papers using citation-tracking services such as Google Scholar. Hence a side effect of researcher A citing researcher B is that researcher B is likely to become aware of researcher A X  X  work.
 not publish a broader range of papers on  X  X roblems involving natural language and computation X  (especially as the ACL Web site states that ACL is  X  X he international scientific and professional society for people working on problems involving nat-ural language and computation X ). In Table 2, I list recent language-related articles
I did see 10 X 20 years ago), such as user modeling, knowledge representation, inte-gration of linguistic and visual information, and computational cognitive modeling. These articles, incidentally, have a very different citation pattern from Computational
Linguistics papers (Table 1); only 11% of journal citations are to NLP and speech journals, whereas 31% are to AI journals, and 25% (!!) are to psychology journals. In other words, language-related papers published in Artificial Intelligence (unlike papers in Computational Linguistics ) show considerable awareness of the broader language research community.

Language to the World, which I co-edited (Roy and Reiter 2005). When I organized this special issue, I originally suggested having it in Computational Linguistics , but I switched to Artificial Intelligence because many potential authors told me that they had no interest in publishing in Computational Linguistics , because it was not a journal that they and their research colleagues read. In other words, they did not see Computational Linguistics as a venue that published papers about their kind of research. 3. Solutions?
If this is indeed a problem, what can be done about it? I believe that one useful initial step would be to broaden the range of papers in ACL conferences and Computational Linguistics (I believe that many ACL members would like this to happen in any case).
This could be done by making the paper-reviewing process less conservative (Church 2005); by putting more emphasis on the poster track and less on the full-paper track at ACL conferences (because the poster track tends to be broader than the full-paper track); and by including a broader range of people in journal editorial boards and conference program committees.
 and invited talks at ACL conferences and survey articles in Computational Linguistics on other areas of language-related research (I was very pleased to see a recent announce-ment that CL intended to publish such articles). 286 and the language-research community in general would benefit if the ACL community took more interest in the broader community, as indeed it did ten years ago.
