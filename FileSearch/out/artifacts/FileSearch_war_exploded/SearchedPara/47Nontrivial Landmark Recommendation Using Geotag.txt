 PAVEL SERDYUKOV , Yandex Online photo-sharing sites such as Flickr 1 are a rich source of information on user photo-taking behavior, both at the individual and at the collective levels, representing a typical example of the social and community intelligence [Zhang et al. 2011]. As GPS positioning becomes a standard functionality of mobile digital capture devices (i.e., cell phones or digital cameras), the amount of location information also available in online photo-sharing collections has increased. Location information takes the form of geotags, which encode where individual photos were taken.

Recent work has proposed various services that exploit the location information in photo-sharing sites, including geo-coordinate prediction [Serdyukov et al. 2009], tag recommendation, content classification and clustering [Sizov 2010], and location rec-ommendation [Clements et al. 2010]. The potential of location information in online photo-sharing collections is arguably not yet fully exploited. The richness of this po-tential is made clearer by closer consideration of the exact nature of an individual picture-taking act. Users deploy their mobile capture devices willfully and voluntarily. In other words, a click of the shutter is an explicit act of capture carried out on the part of a user. Insofar as it is possible to assume that users are triggered to take a picture by the feeling that a particular moment is special, then the capture of an image is effectively an act of tagging a particular moment as somehow important. If the image is associated with a geotag, then a user taking a picture is effectively tagging a place with an importance-related tag.

How exactly this importance should be understood or interpreted can be expected to vary widely from image to image and from user to user. However, when many acts of image capture are taken together, larger patterns emerge. These patterns can be exploited to implement intelligent, socially aware systems [Zhang et al. 2011]. Seen from this high-level perspective, mobile devices are sensors capturing information on the importance of places for human visitors and with the appropriate algorithms the information can be processed in a way that makes it possible to provide back to users new information on places that they would probably find important and interesting.

In this article, we give this high-level goal tangible form by proposing an algorithm that uses information from a photo-sharing Web site in order to provide users with per-sonalized landmark recommendations. Our formulation of the landmark recommenda-tion problem extends beyond the conventional location recommendation problem in two important respects. First, landmarks are considered to be places with a significance for history, culture, or contemporary society. In short, they are places that have mean-ing for people and have a high potential for being of interest to travelers or cultural tourists. In contrast, locations are simply points on a map, which may or may not have a larger social significance or be associated with particular meaning. Second, under our formulation, landmark recommendation avoids popular landmarks, which duplicate information already available, for example, in travel guides. Instead, we conceptualize personalization in the area of landmark recommendation to involve recommendation of  X  X ontrivial X  landmarks that are not typical destinations for mainstream travel and that a user would be unlikely to have easily found by other means. Note that there are multiple possible indicators that could be used to determine whether or not a particular landmark should be considered trivial. For example, one could consider a landmark is trivial if it is listed in a popular travel guide book, or if it is listed as highly popular in a travel Web site. In this article, we define the triviality of a landmark based on the overall volume of attention that it receives from the users in an online community. We assume that users are motivated to visit nontrivial landmarks due to underlying topical interests in specific areas within domains such as architecture or history. In contrast, users are motivated to visit mainstream landmarks by a general desire to travel and see the world that is not topic specific. In sum, we consider personalization to involve a topical match between users X  own interests and the recommendations gen-erated by the system. User satisfaction with the recommendations can be anticipated to rise if we are able to improve the quality of this match.

Recommending nontrivial landmarks is challenging because of the relative lack of information on past behavior of individual users that is available to create recommen-dations. This lack constitutes a formidable data sparseness challenge. Data sparseness is a problem because gaping holes are left in the information that would be desirable to create a fully fleshed-out picture of user preferences. Note that although Flickr contains an enormous number of photos, in order to use these photos to make recommendations, individual users must have photos taken at specific landmarks. Seen from this perspec-tive, it is clear that Flickr is actually quite impoverished in terms of the information that it can offer to support landmark recommendation. Conventional recommender systems depend on past user consumption, such as profiles consisting of items either purchased or rated. Most users who travel, however, are relatively limited in the overall number of places that they visit. Travel is naturally constrained by a variety of factors that do not necessarily apply in other domains such as movie or book recommendation. Travel requires the availability of relatively large amounts of money and time, but also of travel documents (e.g., valid visa). The physical or cognitive stamina of the traveler also serves to keep the number of landmarks that a single person directly experiences relatively limited. Because of these limiting factors, a single individual visits only an extremely small fraction of the total number of landmarks in existence. Consequently, personalized landmark recommendation must overcome a data sparseness problem that is arguably even larger than that presented by other domains in which there are fewer restrictions on the number of items with which users interact.

One conceivable approach would be to gather explicit information from users about their landmark preferences. Such a recommender system requires users to invest quite a bit of time and effort in explicitly informing the system of their interests. Further, if users have interests of which they are not consciously aware, the system will au-tomatically fail to provide recommendations suiting these interests. Our approach to personalized landmark recommendation avoids these issues by exploiting implicit user preferences. For information on user landmark preference, we turn to the large and rich collections of user images available in online photosharing Web sites.
Using photo-sharing Web sites to approach the personalized landmark recommenda-tion problem makes it possible to exploit user patterns that are implicit in photo-taking behavior, as described before. Collaborative Filtering (CF) [Resnick et al. 1994] allows us to make landmark recommendations in a new city for a traveler based on both the traveler X  X  own preference on previously visited landmarks in other cities and also on other travelers X  preference for landmarks in the new city. The underlying assumption is that a user in a new city may like landmarks that are already favored by other users who have had similar landmark visiting experiences in other cities in the past. Recommendations are made on the basis of images that the user has shared on a social media site and the user only needs to specify a destination city.

We specifically address data sparseness when designing our personalized landmark recommendation approach by incorporating category-based regularization, which ex-ploits information concerning the general categories of landmarks. The categories are classes such as  X 17th-century architecture X ,  X  X apanese gardens X , or  X  X orld War II sites X . We assume that user preferences are a reflection of underlying user topical in-terests. The use of categories allows us to counteract data sparseness by introducing in-formation on similarity between landmarks on a more abstract, topical level. We obtain category information about landmarks from Wikipedia 2 . Although another encyclope-dic knowledge resource could have been used for the same purpose, we use Wikipedia due to its scope, availability, and the fact that it is itself an online community resource.
The technique we propose is designed to be deployed in an application that uses the geotagged photos that a traveler (i.e., the target user) has uploaded to an online community to recommend landmarks in a new city for that user to visit. For example, proposed system can recommend some nontrivial landmarks in the city that could also fit her interest. We make use of the collaborative filtering paradigm [Adomavicius and Tuzhilin 2005; Resnick et al. 1994] in order to tackle the personalized landmark recommendation problem. We propose an approach, designated WMF-CR, that makes use of both weighted matrix factorization and category-based regularization in order to improve the performance of personalized landmark recommendation. This approach represents a substantive extension on its progenitor, CRMF (Category Regularized Matrix Factorization), which we proposed in the short paper [Shi et al. 2011] with which we initially introduced the landmark recommendation problem. The key innovation is our use of a weighting mechanism to balance the benefits of retaining as much data as possible on which to base the recommendation against the dangers of including data that will lead to highly popular, trivial recommendations. This characteristic sets our model apart from conventional CF models which do not have the capacity to prefer globally less-popular items over popular ones. We also notice that in this work we rely on the geotags of images rather than the image content for the recommendation process.

As mentioned before, recommendation using images from photo-sharing sites differs from recommendation in more conventional scenarios due to the lack of explicit user ratings, such as those often used for movie recommendation. Instead, our model in-corporates user preference as expressed by the number of photos that users take at various locations. The experimental evidence presented in this article will support the conclusion that WMF-CR effectively exploits user photo-taking behaviors to deal with data sparseness and that it is able to make nontrivial recommendations.

This article presents the first fully mature approach to the personalized landmark recommendation problem and makes the following major contributions.  X  X e propose a novel approach, WMF-CR, that specifically addresses the issue of making nontrivial recommendations for the personalized landmark recommendation scenario.  X  X e demonstrate that WMF-CR outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in recommending nontrivial landmarks.  X  X e show that WMF-CR is adequately scalable to deploy for very large collections.  X  X e provide evidence that WMF-CR accomplishes its design goal of addressing data sparseness by verifying its performance for users who only have limited travel expe-rience, that is, those most likely to suffer due to lack of information in their online photo-sharing profiles. We would also like to note that in order to help support the new research topic, namely, personalized landmark recommendation using users X  geotagged photos, we make the data collection used for this research publicly available 3 .

The remainder of the article is structured as follows. In the next section, we present a summary of the relevant literature and indicate how it is related to our own work. Then, in Section 3, the proposed WMF-CR model for nontrivial landmark recommendation is described in detail. Next, in Section 4, we introduce a data collection for the study of personalized landmark recommendation. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach is presented in Section 5. The last section sums up the key aspects of our study and gives a brief outlook on future work. This section provides the necessary background information for our work. We discuss the emergence of nontrivial recommendation in the area of recommender systems. Then we present an overview of related work on recommendation that exploits loca-tion information, especially for social media sites. Finally, we present the necessary background on Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques for recommendation. There is emerging research interest in recommending nontrivial items, which we argue is particularly relevant for the area of travel destination recommendation. In the area of general travel destination recommendation, it has been observed that recent trends in tourism [Caballero 2010] have had an impact on the types of travel that people engage in. In particular, this work discusses the trend of cultural tourism , which involves an increasing demand for independent holidays during which people seek authentic and personal experiences that go beyond mainstream tourism. It emphasizes that in order for travel experiences to be personal, they should match the topical interests of individuals. Our algorithm for personalized landmark recommendation also adopts the assumption that personalization involves a topical interest aspect that is specific to a particular user.

Nontrivial recommendation shares the similar idea to the long-tail investment, which has been analyzed to bring commercial benefits for Internet companies [Elberse 2008]. Research effort has also been devoted to improving recommendation performance for items in the tail [Park and Tuzhilin 2008]. For the general recommendation scenario, a recent empirical study investigated several recommender algorithms for top-N recom-mendation tasks [Cremonesi et al. 2010], revealing the importance of recommending nontrivial items by removing the most popular items in the evaluation. In this article, we adopt a similar evaluation strategy as suggested in the work of Cremonesi et al. [2010].

Recently, evaluation issues have already attracted much effort in the recommender system research community. Various criteria have been proposed for evaluation of rec-ommender systems beyond rating prediction accuracy [Cremonesi et al. 2011; Ge et al. 2010; Grossman 2010; Herlocker et al. 2004; McNee et al. 2006; O X  X ahony et al. 2004], including diversity, coverage, robustness, novelty, and serendipity. However, standard evaluation metrics have not yet been established for measuring recommendation per-formance in terms of these different criteria. In particular, there is no evaluation metric in widespread use that measures the ability of recommendation approaches in recom-mending nontrivial items. In our work, we focus on evaluating the performance of recommending nontrivial landmarks by assuming that a specific number of the most popular landmarks in each city are irrelevant recommendations for users. 2.2.1. GPS-Based Recommendation. Recent work has exploited explicit user location data (e.g., GPS data) for location recommendation. Based on user location data col-lected directly from GPS devices, Li et al. [2008] proposed to mine user-to-user similar-ity from location histories in order to infer the correlation between different locations. The extension of this work [Zheng et al. 2011] has shown that user similarity based on location history can be effectively exploited for personalized friend recommendation as well as location recommendation. Similarly, systems that make use of user similarity or location similarity mined from user location history have been built for shop recom-mendation [Takeuchi and Sugimoto 2006] and restaurant recommendation [Horozov et al. 2006]. In addition, an HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search)-based approach was proposed to recommend interesting locations and travel sequences within a re-gion [Zheng et al. 2009]. A further study based on this work has shown personalized recommendation can be achieved by mining correlations between locations based on user location history [Zheng and Xie 2011]. Another recent study demonstrated that user GPS history data can be exploited for location and activity recommendation via a joint matrix factorization model [Zheng et al. 2010]. Compared to this previous work, a key difference in our work lies in that the user location data are obtained implicitly, that is, from users X  geotagged photos that are uploaded in social media sites, which requires much less effort from user and system. In other words, users do not need to spend large amounts of time uploading their location history, and systems do not need to preprocess or transform huge amounts of user-uploaded data before being able to generate recommendations. 2.2.2. Geotag-Informed Recommendation. Location data from the geotagged photos of users has been exploited to approach various tasks. Based on the tags and geotags of Flickr photos together with information extracted from Yahoo Travel Guide 4 , a travel guidance system [Gao et al. 2010] has been designed to recognize and rank landmarks. Geotags have also been exploited to help travelers with trip planning [Lu et al. 2010], such as to suggest places of interest, to find a proper path to view a landmark, and to find a proper route to travel from one landmark to another. Mining frequent trip patterns through geotagged photos, including frequently visited city sequences and typical visit duration, has been proposed [Arase et al. 2010] to improve travel recom-mendation. Exploiting the similar trip patterns as studied in Arase et al. [2010] and De Choudhury et al. [2010] has been used to automatically construct travel itineraries. The differences between this previous work in the area of geotag-informed recommen-dation and our own work lies in the fact that we specifically address the personalized landmark recommendation task, that is, making nontrivial recommendations of land-marks for individual users. 2.2.3. Personalized Geotag-Informed Recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two recent studies that are closely related to our work, since they also tar-get personalized location-based recommendation based on geotags from photo-sharing sites. The first proposed to personalize location prediction by first generating recom-mendations based on location popularity and then rerank recommendations based on similar interest from other users [Clements et al. 2010]. This work observed, but did not specifically address the issue that popular locations can dominate less frequently-visited locations in location recommendation. The authors suggest that recommen-dations for less-frequently visited/nontrivial locations would be more meaningful to travelers. Our work differs from Clements et al. [2010] in three main respects. First, we target a new application, that is, landmark recommendation rather than location recommendation. Second, we specifically address the data sparseness problem in the recommendation context. Third, the prediction model proposed by Clements et al. [2010] relies on user similarities, which for large datasets grow to be computationally quite expensive, an issue which we return to shortly.

The second instance of closely related work, Kurashima et al. [2010], proposed to approach personalized travel route recommendation by capturing both location de-pendence and user interest dependence. Location dependence was represented by the timestamps of geotagged photos and user interest dependence was mined from users X  travel routes that are extracted from geotags. Compared to this work, our approach has substantial differences in along two lines: First, we focus on landmark recommendation rather than route recommendation. Second, we design a recommendation model that specifically addresses the data sparseness problem and the challenge of recommending nontrivial landmarks, both of which were not investigated in the work of Kurashima et al. [2010]. Collaborative filtering is known as one of the most popular techniques for person-alized recommendation. CF usually follows one of two basic approaches, memory based or model based [Adomavicius and Tuzhilin 2005]. In general, memory-based approaches make recommendations on the basis of similarities between users (user based) [Herlocker et al. 1999], or on the basis of similarities between items (item based) [Deshpande and Karypis 2004; Linden et al. 2003; Sarwar et al. 2001]. Among the aforementioned work on location-based recommendation, the work of Clements et al. [2010], Horozov et al. [2006], Takeuchi and Sugimoto [2006], and Zheng et al. [2011] involves memory-based CF. However, memory-based CF approaches usually suffer computational cost in computing user-to-user or item-to-item similarities from a large number of users and items. Since there could be millions of users in social media sites, we do not choose the direction of memory-based CF for personalized landmark recommendation in this article, while focusing on the direction of model-based CF.
Compared to memory-based CF, model-based approaches first fit prediction mod-els based on training data and then use these models to predict users X  preference on items. In particular, Matrix Factorization (MF) techniques have attracted much re-search attention in recommender systems because of their scalability and accuracy in rating/preference prediction, as witnessed by the Netflix contest [Koren et al. 2009]. Generally, MF techniques learn latent features of users and items from the observed preference in the user-item matrix and these features are then used to predict unob-served preferences. The rationale of MF is also illustrated from probabilistic point of view [Salakhutdinov and Mnih 2008]. Rather than solely focusing on predicting users X  preference scores, researchers have also formulated ranking-oriented CF approaches that specifically model users X  pairwise or listwise preference based on their rating pat-terns, for example, CofiRank [Weimer et al. 2007], EigenRank [Liu and Yang 2008], and ListRank [Shi et al. 2010a]. We also notice the existence of early work on weighted low-rank approximation [Srebro and Jaakkola 2003], which describes a method that is referred to  X  X eighted X  but is close to standard MF. Another work [Hu et al. 2008] proposed to enhance the contribution of positive feedback by weighting each factoriza-tion based on a confidence estimate, which is proportionate to the strength of user-item preference. Note that we propose to design the weights in MF based on landmark popularity to specifically target recommending nontrivial landmarks. In contrast, in Srebro and Jaakkola [2003] the weights in MF are based on whether or not ratings are observed for particular items, and in Hu et al. [2008] the weights are still based on user-item preference. Note that both of the two approaches have no particular consideration on trivial items, or on the exploitation of additional item information, the two issues studied in this article.

Recently, the joint matrix factorization framework has been widely proposed to ex-tend the basic MF model by taking into account different regularizations in order to make it suited for different purposes. For example, user social relationships have been exploited to regularize the factorization of user-item rating matrix for improved rating prediction [Ma et al. 2011]. User activity correlation and location correlation in terms of location features have been exploited to regularize the factorization of a location-activity matrix for improved location and activity recommendation [Zheng et al. 2010]. Contextual movie features have been exploited to regularize the factor-ization of the user-movie rating matrix for improved mood-specific movie recommen-dation [Shi et al. 2010b]. Collective matrix factorization [Singh and Gordon 2008] has been proposed to factorize multiple matrices of related entities in order to leverage knowledge between different entities. In addition, since tags have been ubiquitous in recommender systems, researchers proposed not only to exploit tags for improving item recommendation [Tso-Sutter et al. 2008], but also to exploit tensor decomposition techniques for improving tag recommendation [Symeonidis et al. 2008]. Our work in this article is closely related to aforementioned work in the sense that we also use the joint matrix factorization framework to exploit landmark categories from Wikipedia to regularize the factorization of user-landmark preference. However, we not only ad-dress a different application, our work is also substantially different from previous work in that our approach integrates a weighting scheme into the matrix factoriza-tion model, which allows the model to specifically target recommendation of nontrivial landmarks. An overview of our personalized landmark recommender system is provided in Figure 1. At the top (i.e., step 1), the photo-sharing collection is depicted from which the geotagged photos of the users are drawn and then transformed into a user-landmark matrix that encodes users X  preference on landmarks. Note that we also use the photo-sharing site to extract an inventory of landmarks. The process of extracting landmarks from geotagged photos and extracting landmark categories from Wikipedia will be described in greater detail in Section 4. As previously mentioned, we use the number of photos that a user has taken around a landmark to indicate the user X  X  preference for the landmark, that is, a larger number of photos taken around a given landmark reflects a larger degree of preference.

In step 2, the landmark category information is extracted from Wikipedia and used to calculate the similarity between landmarks that are topically related, but not identical. Details of the category-based landmark similarity will be explained in Section 3.3. Once the user-landmark preference matrix and category-based landmark similarity matrix have been obtained, the proposed approach, WMF-CR, is applied (i.e., step 3) to learn the latent features of users and landmarks during the matrix decomposition process. The resulting model is then used to generate nontrivial landmark recommendations to users, as illustrated in step 4.
 In the following of this section, we present our Weighted Matrix Factorization with Category-based Regularization (WMF-CR) approach for the personalized landmark rec-ommendation in detail. We first introduce the new weighting scheme incorporated by our approach and our method for using landmark categories available from Wikipedia to quantify the similarity between landmarks. Then, we put the individual parts to-gether into the WMF-CR and conclude the section with a discussion that summarizes the characteristics of our algorithm that make it particularly suited to address the challenge of personalized landmark recommendation. 3.2.1. Rationale. Recall from the Introduction that our assumption is that users have different motivations for visiting different landmarks. The motivation for visiting frequently-visited landmarks is a general desire to travel and see the world. For this reason, such highly popular landmarks are considered trivial, since they are standard and do not have to be recommended on a person-by-person basis. The motivation for visiting nontrivial landmarks is the interest of travelers in the topical aspects of the landmark. Our weighting scheme is motivated by the assumption that reducing the influence of highly popular landmarks will effectively reduce noise within the user-landmark matrix that is masking the person-dependent topical information implicit in user visiting patterns for nontrivial landmarks. A simplistic approach to emphasiz-ing nontrivial landmarks is to eliminate all other landmarks from the user-landmark matrix. There are two reasons for which this approach is not to be preferred. First, we can never be entirely sure about user motivations. In the case of the Eiffel Tower, we can probably safely assume that most visitors go there motivated by a general desire to have seen the world rather than motivated by a specific interest in the type of architecture it represents, namely a puddle iron lattice tower. However, in the larger majority of the cases it will be dangerous to apply this assumption. Rather than guessing at the topic-specific attraction of specific landmarks, we prefer to let the model learn which landmarks are less useful for personalized travel recommendation.
Second, we need to be very conservative about eliminating data from the user-landmark matrix in order to reduce the danger that we discard information that could prove useful for recommendation. As previously mentioned, the extreme sparseness of the user-landmark matrix presents us with a significant challenge. The sparse data problem could potentially be exacerbated if we are too aggressive in removing user preferences on landmarks from the user-landmark matrix. Instead, we would like to leave open the possibility that even relatively popular landmarks have topical interests inherent in the associated user visiting patterns that can be exploited to make personal landmark recommendations. Again, for this reason, we prefer to let the model learn which are useful. 3.2.2. Conventional Matrix Factorization. Our Weighted Matrix Factorization (WMF) ap-proach extends a conventional matrix factorization approach with weights that control the relative contribution of nontrivial landmarks from the user-landmark matrix. The basic user-landmark matrix encodes the preferences of users for the individual land-marks. In order to represent user i  X  X  preference on landmark j , we first calculate the number of user i  X  X  photos that have geotags matching the landmark j . Note that the matching process between the photo geotags and the landmarks will be described in Section 4. Then, for each user i , we further normalize the number of her geotagged photos on landmark j to be within [0, 1] (by dividing over the total number of the user X  X  geotagged photos). The result is the user i  X  X  preference score on landmark j ,whichis denoted by R ij . The user-landmark matrix is designated R , and it represents users in rows and their preferences on landmarks in columns.
 The basic matrix factorization model [Koren et al. 2009] is expressed as where R consists of M users and N items. The vector U i is the d -dimensional latent feature vector (a column vector) of user i . The vector V j is the d -dimensional latent feature vector (a column vector) of landmark j . Note that the elements in the feature vectors are parameters (latent features) that need to be estimated from a set of training data. The idea of MF is to estimate U and V in terms of the known preference data R and to use the learned U and V to predict the unknown users X  preferences on landmarks. I ij is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if R ij ||
V || F are the Frobenius norms [Golub and Van Loan 1996] of U and V , respectively, which serve to alleviate overfitting.  X  U ,  X  V are the norm regularization parameters, on which we impose the simplifying assumption  X  U =  X  V =  X  . 3.2.3. Weighted Matrix Factorization. Under the basic MF formulation, all the observed preference scores contribute equally to learning the latent features of users and land-marks. However, for the purpose of personalized landmark recommendation, we wish to direct the recommendation process towards nontrivial landmarks, that is, landmarks that are not widely visited, but that represent users X  personal, topical interest. We introduce a bias towards nontrivial recommendations into the model by reducing the influence of frequently-visited landmarks in the user-landmark matrix and increasing the influence of nontrivial landmarks.

We build the capacity to carefully adjust the balance between different kinds of landmarks into the model by introducing a factor W , which is integrated into Eq. (1) to yield the WMF formula.

The weight that is used for a given landmark j is determined by the global pop-ularity of that landmark measured on the entire photo-sharing collection. Note that we define the popularity of a landmark by the number of users who have visited the landmark. We rank all landmarks in the collection by their overall popularity scores and retain influence only from the landmarks that are  X  X ow enough X  in the ranking. These landmarks are the ones that make the most effective contribution to biasing the model towards nontrivial recommendations. Note that in order to determine what should be considered as  X  X ow enough X , a threshold of ranking position needs to be de-termined empirically given a concrete use case, while the general idea is to eliminate the influence of the top popular landmarks on learning the recommendation model. Specifically, the weighting coefficient W ij in WMF is defined as where poprank ( j ) defines the rank of the popularity of landmark j . For instance, if landmark j is the most popular landmark in the collection, then poprank ( j ) = 1. For preferences that are unobserved, that is, in cases where R ij = 0, W ij is trivially also set to 0. K takes the role of a threshold parameter, which controls how many of the most popular landmarks have their influence eliminated from the model. A larger K means that more highly popular landmarks are not used for training the recommendation model, resulting in a recommendation model that could be more biased to recommend nontrivial landmarks. However, the larger K also means that the more user-landmark preference data are discarded for training the recommendation model, resulting in a recommendation model that may suffer more from data sparseness. For this reason, in practice the optimal value of K needs to be tuned for a given data collection to attain a trade-off between the aforementioned two aspects. We will demonstrate and discuss the impact of K in our experiments in Section 5. In sum, WMF explicitly reduces the influence of popular landmarks, effectively extending the model with the capacity to make nontrivial recommendations. Note that in the case of K = 0, WMF returns to the basic MF model. Our Category-based Regularization extends matrix factorization with regularization that integrates information on higher-level semantic similarities between landmarks. This approach explicitly addresses the problem of data sparseness in the user-landmark preference matrix, by making it possible to relate landmarks not only on the basis of identity, but also on the basis of topical similarity. For example, both landmark  X  X ondon Bridge X  and landmark  X  X onument to the Great Fire of London X  belong to the category  X  X istory of the City of London X , indicating that they may be interesting to users who would like to know about London history. This topic-level similarity could allow the system increase the likelihood to recommend  X  X onument to the Great Fire of London X  to a user if he was already in favor of  X  X ondon Bridge X , even in the case that there is limited preference data about  X  X onument to the Great Fire of London X . Incor-porating auxiliary information to represent users and landmarks helps, in this way, compensate for the missing information in R . For each landmark we collect category information from Wikipedia and create a binary landmark-category matrix, C ,which captures the links between landmarks and categories. There, C jt = 1 if landmark j belongs to a category t , and 0 otherwise. Note that each landmark potentially belongs to multiple categories, for example,  X  X ondon Eye X  belongs to  X  X erlin Entertainments X ,  X  X hames Path X ,  X  X isitor attractions in London X , etc. For this reason, we can define the category-based landmark similarity between landmark j and landmark n , by using the vector space similarity [Salton et al. 1975] where T denotes the number of categories, and S denotes the category-based landmark similarity matrix, which is symmetric and contains values between 0 and 1.
We build on the assumption that landmarks that are similar with respect to their categories might share similar characteristics pertinent for the purpose of landmark recommendation and that these characteristics are expected to be preserved under matrix decomposition. Exploiting this insight, a new loss function can be formulated as. where J jn is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if S jn &gt; 0, and 0 otherwise. It is important to note that the new loss function (5) has the potential to alleviate the data sparseness problem in R . An extreme example illustrates this potential: if there is no user preference on landmark j , the latent features V j cannot be learned from R at all. However, V j can still be learned from other landmarks that are similar in terms of categories, and are marked as being preferred by the users. Consequently, latent features of landmarks could be substantially better represented when exploiting not only user-landmark preference but also category-based landmark similarity. We now combine WMF and category-based regularization, and present our integrated WMF-CR algorithm for personalized landmark recommendation. The objective func-tion of WMF-CR is formulated as where  X  serves as a trade-off parameter that controls the relative contribution from the category-based landmark similarity. Note that WMF-CR becomes equivalent to the WMF model when  X  is equal to 0. Minimizing the objective function results in the latent features of users and landmarks being learned from the user-landmark preference in R and from the category-based landmark similarity in S .

Since the objective function in Eq. (6) is not jointly convex over U and V , we choose to use alternating gradient descent to solve the minimization problem. The gradients of F ( U , V ) with respect to U and V can be computed as in Eqs. (7) and (8). Note that in Eq. (8) we make use of the property that S is symmetric. A local minimum solution of U and V is achieved by iteratively performing descent on U and V .With the learned latent features of U and V , we can predict user i  X  X  preference on landmark j as U T i V j . On the basis of this score, we generate the ranked list of landmarks that constitutes the personalized recommendation for user i .

The complexity of the objective function of WMF-CR in Eq. (6) is O ( d | R |+ d | S |+ d ( M + N )), where | R | denotes the number of known preference scores in the given user-landmark preference matrix R ,and | S | denotes the number of nonzero similarities in the category-based landmark similarity matrix S . The complexity of the gradients in Eqs. (7) and (8) is O ( d | R |+ dM )and O ( d | R |+ d | S |+ dN ), respectively. Considering that we usually have | R | M , N ,and | S | N , the total complexity of WMF-CR is O ( d ( | R |+| S | )), which is linear with the total number of known preference scores in R and non-zero similarities in S . Note that both R and S are very sparse in practice, for example, in our data collection, as described in Section 4, we have | R |= 260362 and | S |= 222778. For this dataset, our MATLAB implementation of WMF-CR takes approximately 6.5 seconds for one iteration of the learning algorithm, running on a PC with 1.59 GHz CPU and 2.93GB memory. This analysis indicates that WMF-CR is appropriate for applications where it is necessary to scale up to very large use cases. We conclude our presentation of the proposed WMF-CR approach with a brief summary and discussion of the ways in which the algorithm addresses the specific challenges faced in personalized landmark recommendation.

WMF-CR exploits landmark categories as an exter-
In sum, WMF-CR is designed to generate effective personalized landmark recommen-dations while addressing the challenges of applying CF to large online photo-sharing collections. In the remainder of the article, we present our data collection and an ex-perimental analysis that demonstrates the strength of WMF-CR in practice. We collected the data for our experiments using the public API of Flickr. First, we downloaded metadata for 42.9 million geotagged photos and then we filtered this data according to the following considerations. For the purpose of personalized travel recom-mendation, we wish to focus our investigation on the images of users who are travelers. Since an overwhelmingly large majority of Flickr users are based in the United States, we introduced a clearer focus on images most likely to belong to travelers by focusing only on users with geotagged photos taken outside the U.S.. We limited our investi-gation to city landmarks and include in the dataset only the photos taken in the top 40 most visited cities. The preceding steps resulted in a dataset containing 126,123 geotagged photos from 40,084 users. We generated the landmarks associated with the images by making use of Wikipedia. We considered each geotagged Wikipedia article to constitute a landmark. Each photo was associated with all landmarks within one kilometer radius. This set was obtained by computing the geographical distance based on the geotags of the photos with the geotags of the Wikipedia articles, according to Haversine formula [Sinnott 1984]. The set of landmarks was then filtered in a process that involved eliminating landmarks for which there was negligible overlap between the words in the title of the Wikipedia article and the tags assigned to the photo by the user. As a final step, already mentioned earlier, we normalized the number of a user X  X  photos related to a landmark in order to generate a score representing that user X  X  preference for a landmark. The resulting user-landmark preference matrix consists of 260,362 scores from 40,084 users and 9,557 landmarks. The main statistics of this data are given in Table I.

In Figure 2 we illustrate properties of the data with two plots showing how users are distributed over landmarks and landmarks over users. Note that Figure 2(a) is based on the histogram of the number of landmarks visited by each user, while Figure 2(b) is based on the histogram of the number of users who visited each landmark. Both distributions can be seen to closely follow a power law, which illustrates the two underlying characteristics of the data, already mentioned before: (1) the data set is very sparse, that is, most of the users in our dataset visited only a limited number of landmarks; (2) popular landmarks threaten to dominate, there are a few landmarks visited by lots of users, implying a phenomenon that the overlap of nontrivial (less popular) landmarks across users may be very small, which makes the challenge and importance of recommending nontrivial landmarks quite substantial.

We extracted categories for each landmark from Wikipedia, resulting in a total of 7,379 categories. In our collection, the total number of landmark-category assignments is 20796, and in average there are 2.2 categories per landmark. The maximal number of categories that a landmark has is 28. This information is encoded to generate a landmark-category binary matrix with 7,379 categories. In this section, we report on a series of experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed WMF-CR model for personalized landmark recommendation. First, we introduce the experimental protocol, followed by an investigation of the impact of the parameters in the proposed WMF-CR model. Then, we compare the recommendation performance of WMF-CR with several state-of-the-art baseline approaches. We focus our evaluation on the ability of these approaches to make nontrivial landmark recommendations. Finally, we investigate the influence of user travel experience on the performance of personalized landmark recommendation.

Our experiments are designed in order to address the following research questions. (1) Is the weighting scheme effective? In other words, does it show evidence of achieving (2) Is the category regularization effective? In other words, do the landmark categories (3) Is WMF-CR beneficial for users who only have limited travel experience? Since we evaluate personalized landmark recommendation based on the ranked recommendation list for each user, which is comparable to the search result list for a query in document retrieval, we adopt two of the most widely used evaluation metrics, that is, Mean Average Precision (MAP) [Herlocker et al. 2004] and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) [Voorhees 1999] to evaluate the recommendation quality. Specifically, AP and RR are defined for a given user m as where N m denotes the number of recommended landmarks for the user m . rel m ( j ) is a binary indicator, which is equal to 1 if the j th landmark in the list is relevant to user m , and otherwise 0. Prec m @ j is the precision of the top j recommended landmarks for the user m , that is, the number of landmarks in the top j recommendation that are relevant to user m . MAP and MRR are average value of AP and RR, respectively, across all the users for evaluation. MAP reflects the quality of the entire recommendation list, while MRR emphasizes the ability of the system to recommend a relevant landmark as early as possible. The higher MAP and MRR scores, the better the recommendation performance.

The most straightforward application from this study is to provide a user in a social photo-sharing site with landmark recommendations, when she is visiting a new city. For this reason, we evaluate the proposed WMF-CR approach for personalized land-mark recommendation under a simulated setting that approximates this application. In our experiments we only use the data of those users who have visited at least one landmark in each of at least two cities. By this means, we can define at least one  X  X lready visited X  city and at least one  X  X arget X  city for each user. The user-landmark matrix used for the experiments contains 14,031 users and all the landmarks, and has a sparseness of 99.89%, showing a challenging recommendation scenario in which the recommendation model would suffer limited user preferences, while the proposed ap-proach is expected to benefit from external knowledge of landmarks. We also emphasize that the sparseness of this data collection is higher than conventional CF benchmark datasets, such as MovieLens 10M-rating dataset 5 (sparseness approximately 97.7%) and Netflix 100M-rating dataset 6 (sparseness approximately 98.8%).

The dataset is randomly split into three sets, that is, a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set contains 60% randomly selected users and their landmark preferences. Each of the validation set and the test set contains 20% ran-domly selected users and their landmark preferences. For each user in the validation and the test set, we randomly select one city that she has visited as that user X  X  tar-get city. Then, we remove the user X  X  landmark preferences for this selected target city and try to recommend them. Note that the validation set is used to investigate the impact of parameters of the WMF-CR model, and the test set is used to evaluate the performance of WMF-CR and compare it to that of the baseline algorithms. We com-pare landmark recommendation algorithms on the basis of their ability to predict the withheld landmark preferences. Note that this method of evaluation provides a very conservative, lower-bound estimate of recommendation quality, which probably rather severely underestimates the usefulness of landmark recommendation algorithms in real-world applications. Recall that a user X  X  landmark preferences for a city are taken to be all the landmarks associated with photos that the user has taken in that city. Users probably fall far short of photographing at all landmarks within a given city that would potentially be of interest to them, especially if the city is a large one. For this rea-son, landmarks that are not photographed might still be interesting recommendations for a user, even though these landmarks are treated as false alarms by our evaluation method. Under this evaluation framework, the resulting numbers of evaluation met-rics are usually very low [Cremonesi et al. 2010]. However, our purpose in evaluation is to determine the relative difference between recommendation approaches, and for this purpose our evaluation method is straightforward and well suited. Note that the regularization parameter  X  in WMF-CR in Eq. (6) is set to 1 and the latent dimension-ality d is set to 10, the optimal values as determined on the validation set for all the related MF baseline approaches.

Finally, as discussed before, popular and well-known landmarks are not the most useful or desirable recommendations for the task of personalized landmark recommen-dation. For this reason, in our evaluation we investigate the influence of the popular landmarks on the final result and focus on nontrivial, that is, less popular, landmarks when discussing the recommendation performance. In this section, we use the validation set to investigate the impact of the parameters of the WMF-CR, discuss their role in recommendation, and determine the parameter settings that we use for the experiments.
 First, we investigate the impact of parameter K in the WMF-CR model (refer to Eq. (6)). K controls the balance of influence between nontrivial landmarks and main-stream landmarks on recommendation performance. In Table II, we list the landmarks number of users who have visited each of them.

It is evident that the top-ranked popular landmarks are well-known, frequently-visited, mainstream landmarks. By varying K , we eliminate the influence of those landmarks on the process of learning latent features that represent users and other landmarks. We examine the performance of WMF-CR on the validation set both in terms of MAP and MRR for the case in which the top five landmarks in each city have been removed.

Figure 3 illustrates how the performance changes with K for nontrivial landmark recommendation and reveals that optimal recommendation performance is achieved when K = 11. In this case, nontrivial landmarks are taken to be all landmarks within a city except for the top-five most popular. Note that these top-five most popular landmarks in a given city are different from the ones eliminated during the learning of the recommendation model by the threshold K . This point is important since it demonstrates the ability of our approach to capture nontriviality as a phenomenon. In other words, it is clear that the approach goes beyond merely deemphasizing specific globally popular landmarks. This result also indicates that for the purpose of recom-mending nontrivial landmarks, the proposed model could benefit from eliminating the influence of a certain number of most popular landmarks. This observation provides initial evidence that our first research question concerning the effectiveness of the weighting scheme can be answered positively. As expected, there are a certain number of landmarks that are unhelpful for nontrivial landmark recommendation because, according to our initial conjecture, people X  X  motivations to visit them are general and not topical in nature. These landmarks thus constitute noise within our recommenda-tion scenario and performance improves when they can be eliminated. More evidence on this point will be provided by the experimental results in the next section. The set of these landmarks is, however, relatively small. As can be also seen in Figure 3, when more than a certain number K of top-visited landmarks are eliminated, performance drops off sharply. This observation indicates that excessively eliminating the influence of popular landmarks could also degrade the performance of recommending nontrivial landmarks, since a lot of user preference data associated with popular landmarks may be discarded. In the case of excessively increasing K , the performance remains low and stable with a small fluctuation. For this reason, it is important to attain a trade-off of the weighting scheme that not only eliminates the influence of top-popular landmarks, but also maintains sufficient user preference data for model learning. Those retained landmarks carry information about helpful patterns, which we assume arise because of topical user motivation to visit landmarks. Note that for the purposes of personalized landmarks, it is not necessary to formulate an explicit understanding of what it means for a user to be motivated by interest in a particular topic to visit a landmark. Rather, user topical interests remain implicit in the data patterns, which can be effectively exploited by the CF approach without the need for explicit user profiles.

Our next experiment in this section investigates the impact of the trade-off parameter  X  in the WMF-CR model (as before, refer to Eq. (6)).  X  controls the influence of the category-based landmark similarity in the proposed WMF-CR model. We fix K to the optimal value determined during the first experiment ( K = 11) and vary the value of  X  in order to observe its influence on the ability of the algorithm to deal with data sparseness. As can be seen in Figure 4, the optimal performance is achieved when  X  = 0 . 001. In the case of  X  = 0, WMF-CR does not exploit the category-based landmark similarity. The result indicates that the integration of landmark categories introduces performance improvement to WMF-CR. Again, additional evidence will be provided by the experimental results in the next section. Note that the optimal value  X  is collection dependent, that is, it needs to be tuned for different datasets, and it depends on the scale and the sparseness of both the user-landmark preference matrix and the category-based landmark similarity matrix. For this reason, the absolute value of  X  cannot reflect the proportions of contribution from each of the two matrices. We also notice in Figure 4 that when further increasing the trade-off parameter, that is, biasing the learning of latent landmark features towards category-based landmark similarity and away from user-landmark preference, the recommendation performance degrades. This effect illustrates the contribution that is made by the user behavior patterns in the user-landmark matrix and the importance of balancing the contribution of this matrix with the contribution of category information.
 As a final point in this section, we examine one of our central design choices for WMF-CR, namely, the choice of using a hard cutoff to eliminate the influence of widely-visited, top-ranked landmarks, (refer to Eq. (3)). Top-ranked landmarks are completely eliminated from the learning process by having their weights set to zero. We performed a final exploratory experiment on the validation set to determine if this hard cutoff is indeed the right choice, or whether we should have weakened rather than eliminated the influence of these landmarks. Although the experiment was exploratory in nature, we report it here since it provides additional evidence that WMF-CR achieves an optimal balance between eliminating and retaining information in the user-landmark matrix. In the exploratory experiment we set K = 1 and replaced the decision in Eq. (3) with the decision in Eq. (11), introducing a parameter  X  instead of 0 in order to slowly reduce the influence of the top-ranked landmark.

We found a slight trend towards dropping performance as  X  was increased from 0 to 1 and on this basis concluded that our decision to set  X  = 0 was the correct one. In this subsection, we analyze the performance of the proposed WMF-CR approach for the users in the test set, targeting personalized landmark recommendation. This analysis also includes an investigation of the influence of highly popular, frequently-visited landmarks and the influence of the number of cities/landmarks a user has visited on the recommendation performance. For comparison purposes, we also present the performance of several alternative approaches that we adopt as baselines.  X  PopRec . Landmarks are recommended to users based on their popularity, which is defined in terms of the number of users who visited them in the training set. It is a nonpersonalized recommendation approach: for a given city, the same recommenda-tions are always generated independently of the target user.  X  PureSVD . The pure Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach is used to de-compose the user-landmark preference matrix in order to obtain the latent user and item features, which are further used to generate the recommendations for each user [Cremonesi et al. 2010].  X  MF . The basic matrix factorization approach in Eq. (1) is included to represent a state-of-the-art CF approach [Koren et al. 2009]. Note that both PureSVD and MF only learn the latent user and item features from the user preference data.  X  CRMF . This is the category-regularized matrix factorization approach that learns latent features from both the user preference data and the category-based landmark similarity [Shi et al. 2011]. Note that it is equivalent to WMF-CR (refer to Eq. (6)) in the case of parameters  X  = 0 . 001 and K = 0, that is, equally weighting the influence of landmarks with different popularity in the recommendation process.  X  WMF . This is the weighted matrix factorization approach that learns latent features from the user preference data and weights the influence of different landmarks in terms of their popularity, as shown in Eqs. (2) and (3). Note that it is equivalent to WMF-CR (refer to Eq. (6)) in the case that the parameter  X  = 0, that is, it is a special case of WMF-CR in which the external landmark category information is not exploited in the recommendation process.
 For WMF-CR and for the approaches related to it, we adopted the optimal values of the parameters that we had determined using the validation set as described in Section 5.2.
During our exploratory experimentation we also tried some traditional memory-based CF approaches (e.g., item-based CF by Deshpande and Karypis [2004]) and wanted to deploy them as additional reference methods. However, we found the perfor-mance of these approaches was much worse than the other baseline approaches listed earlier. A possible reason might be that the memory-based approaches severely suffer the data sparseness in the scenario of landmark recommendation. For this reason, we limited the comparative study to the previous baselines. 5.3.1. Recommending Nontrivial Landmarks. By assuming that the numbers of most pop-ular (and therefore irrelevant) landmarks may be different from case to case and by letting this number vary between 0 and 10, we can observe the performance of the pro-posed WMF-CR and its relative improvement over the baseline approaches, as shown in Tables III and IV. Note that we use 0 (in the first column) to denote the case where no as-sumption of the relevance of most popular landmarks is made, and we measure the per-formance according to the ground truth in the test set. The results of our experiments on recommending nontrivial landmarks are treated in the remainder of this section.
First, as can be seen from Tables III and IV, PopRec outperforms all the other approaches under the condition that no popular landmarks are assumed irrelevant. Recall, however, we are mainly concerned about the recommendation performance for landmarks less frequently visited by the general population, that is, those a traveler may not know about beforehand. If just a few most popular landmarks in each city are ignored, we can see WMF-CR outperforms PopRec by a generous margin. For instance, WMF-CR outperforms PopRec over 40% in terms of MAP and over 100% in terms MRR in the case in which the top-4 most popular landmarks in each city are considered irrelevant. Note that all the improvements reported in our experiments are statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon signed rank significance test with p &lt; 0 . 05 measured across all the users in the test set.

Second, we can observe that WMF-CR significantly outperforms CRMF in recom-mending nontrivial landmarks, that is, up to approximately 10% in MAP and up to ap-proximately 15% in MRR. This observation indicates that WMF-CR indeed contributes to improving the performance of recommending nontrivial landmarks by means of re-ducing the influence of highly popular landmarks. We can confirm a positive answer to our first research question about the effectiveness of the use of the weighting scheme. Note that we can also observe that similar improvements are achieved by WMF over PureSVD and MF, indicating that significant influence on performance can be still introduced by the weighting scheme in the case that the landmark categories are not exploited.
 Third, we can observe that WMF-CR significantly improves over PureSVD, MF, and WMF in recommending nontrivial landmarks, that is, up to ca. 25% in MAP and up to ca. 35% in MRR over PureSVD; up to ca. 20% in MAP and up to around 35% in MRR over MF; and up to approximately 6% in MAP and up to approximately 7% in MRR over WMF. These improvements indicate that the category-based landmark similarity exploited in WMF-CR indeed contributes to alleviating data sparseness. We can confirm a positive answer to our second research question on the ability of WMF-CR to address the problem of sparse data. Note that we can also observe that improvement is achieved by CRMF over MF and PureSVD, indicating that substantive influence on performance can be still introduced by exploiting landmark categories even in case the weighting scheme is not involved. 5.3.2. Recommendations for Users with Limited Travel Experience. We divide the users from the test set into two groups according to the number of cities they have visited. For the purpose of counting the cities that a user has visited, we ignore that user X  X  target city. Out of 2807 users in the test set, over half of them (1589 users) have photos from only one city, and the rest (1218 users) have photos from visits to more than one city. Note that the distribution of the number of cities that users visit is skewed. For example, only 10 users visited more than 10 cities.

We show the recommendation performance of different approaches for the two groups of users in Table V and VI, given the condition that the top-5 most popular landmarks in each city are considered irrelevant. As can be observed, users with relatively more travel experience can consistently benefit more from recommendations by different approaches, indicating the user travel experience has significant impact on recommen-dation performance. The proposed WMF-CR approach achieves the best performance of all the approaches for the users that have visited more than one city, leading to, for example, improvement of approximately 40% in MAP and approximately 90% in MRR over PopRec, about 14% in MAP and approximately 17% in MRR over MF, and approx-imately 4% in MAP and approximately 5% in MRR over WMF. In comparison, we can also observe that the relative improvement of WMF-CR over baseline approaches is in nearly the same magnitude for users that only visited one city, for example, about 37% in MAP and 73% in MRR over PopRec, approximately 13% in MAP and approximately 17% in MRR over MF, and about 4% in MAP and about 4% in MRR over WMF. Note that the magnitude of relative improvement introduced by the proposed WMF-CR ap-proach over most of the baselines is not severely degraded for users who only visited one city. As a whole, these results imply that the proposed WMF-CR approach could be particularly beneficial for users that only have limited travel experience, indicating a positive answer to our third research question on the benefits of WMF-CR for users with limited travel experience.

We further divide the 1589 users who only visited one city into groups according to the number of landmarks they visited. We thereby also assume that users with fewer visited landmarks have less travel experience. We find that most of these users visited a very limited number of landmarks, for example, over one-third only visited one landmark in a city, and users who visited a lot of landmarks are in minority, for example, only 125 users visited more than 10 landmarks in a particular target city. The performance for these different groups of users is shown in Tables VII and VIII.
As can be seen, the highest relative improvements achieved by WMF-CR are for the group of users who only visited one landmark, for example, about 48% over PopRec, approximately 11% over CRMF, and approximately 5% over WMF in MAP; about 75% over PopRec; about 18% over CRMF; and approximately 6% over WMF in MRR. These results again indicate that WMF-CR could be particularly helpful for users with very limited travel experience, again supporting a positive answer to our third and final research question.

We also notice in the tables WMF-CR outperforms other approaches for other groups of users who have visited more than one landmark, although the magnitude of rela-tive improvement is lower than for users who have visited only one landmark. These improvements support our conclusion that WMF-CR benefits from alleviating data sparseness and biasing the recommendation process in terms of landmark popular-ity and, as such, constitutes a highly effective technique for personalized landmark recommendation.

As a final note, we examine one particular user in more detail, who has only one city in her travel history (Barcelona) and has only visited two landmarks there ( X  X ark Guell X  and  X  X agrada Familia X ). This case illustrates how WMF-CR works for users with very little travel experience. We generate top-10 recommendations for this user for her target city (London) using the different recommendation approaches. The results lists are given in Table IX. As can be seen, the approaches that do not specifically target recommending nontrivial landmarks, such as PureSVD, MF, and CRMF, are heavily influenced by the most popular landmarks, for example, at least two of the top-5 rec-ommended landmarks are among the top-5 most popular landmarks in London. CRMF promoted the recommendation of  X  X ondon Zoo X  probably because the underlying cat-egories allow the algorithm to semantically relate  X  X ondon Zoo X  to  X  X ark Guell X . This case suggests that landmark categories can indeed improve recommendation quality. Both WMF and WMF-CR managed to move less popular landmarks towards the top of the list. We can observe that the top-5 most popular landmarks in London are not recom-mended in either of the top-10 list. In addition, WMF-CR succeeded in recommending the relevant landmarks on the top, benefitting from not only the bias introduced to-wards nontrivial landmarks, but also the category information. It is interesting to note that the users two visited landmarks ( X  X ark Guell X  and  X  X agrada Familia X ) are among the most popular landmarks in Barcelona, but that the WMF-CR is able to successfully generate recommendations on the basis of this evidence of user interest. This example supports our conjecture that there is not a hard difference between landmarks that users visit motivated by their own topical interest and landmarks that users visit mo-tivated by a general desire to travel. Here, relatively popular landmarks, that could also have been visited due to a general desire to travel, prove helpful in generating the recommendation. In this article, we put forward a comprehensive approach to the new research challenge of personalized landmark recommendation based on geotagged photos from photo-sharing sites. Our formulation of the personalized landmark recommendation task includes the criterion that recommended landmarks should be  X  X ontrivial X . In other words, the system should not recommend landmarks that users could discover via conventional means. Our approach, called WMF-CR, incorporates weighted matrix fac-torization and category-based regularization . Weights are incorporated into the matrix factorization approach in order to reinforce the importance of nontrivial landmarks for making nontrivial recommendations. Category-based regularization integrates infor-mation on topical-level similarities between landmarks by exploiting landmark cate-gory information available from Wikipedia. The computational complexity of WMF-CR is linear with the number of observed preferences in the user-landmark preference ma-trix and the number of nonzero similarities in the category-based landmark similarity matrix, meaning that it easily scales to large datasets.

The experimental results demonstrate that WMF-CR is capable of producing nontriv-ial personalized landmark recommendations. WMF-CR shows improved performance over a baseline based exclusively on popularity, over a conventional singular value de-composition approach (PureSVD), and over a standard matrix factorization approach (MF). Further, the addition of weights (WMF) or the use of category regularization (CRMF) both provide good performance when used separately. However, the best over-all performance is achieved by the full WMF-CR approach. Additional evaluation shows that WMF-CR is particularly helpful for users with limited travel experience, that is, in terms of either the number of cities or landmarks visited before. With these experi-ments we demonstrate that WMF-CR is indeed able to address the issue of sparseness of landmark data within Flickr.

Our future work will address the following challenges. First, although WMF-CR has clearly demonstrated the power of the assumption that the number of photos taken in the general location of a landmark reflects underlying interest that is useful for prediction, we would like to further refine the way in which our method captures user interest. Other factors that could be taken to reflect to user interest are: the distance of the photos from the landmark, the time that the user spent at the landmark as represented by the temporal spread of the photos, and the detail with which the user has annotated the photos. In addition, it would be also interesting to exploit other re-sources to define the triviality of landmarks and extend our comparative study. Second, Wikipedia contains a large amount of semantic information concerning landmarks that goes above and beyond their topical categories. We would like to exploit these sources of information in order to enhance our ability to model topical relatedness between land-marks. Examples include people associated with places and times in history where places were particularly important. Such approaches could be implemented efficiently using DBPedia (http://dbpedia.org), a structured information resource extracted from Wikipedia. Semantic Web technologies could be used for semantically richer encoding of categorical information, introducing into the model the means to capture a finer-grained representation of user interests. This type of user interest representation may also contribute to landmark recommendation, in a similar way of landmark similarity. Third, the categories of landmarks we exploit are extracted from an external resource, that is, Wikipedia. We could also exploit resources from within the photo-sharing site in order to determine higher-level similarity between landmarks. Examples of promising internal resources are user annotations for individual photos taken at a landmark and the content features of photos. Fourth, another interesting direction is to take the use-context into account for real-time landmark recommendation. Since the application dis-cussed in this article is closely associated with GPS-enabled mobile devices, it would be promising to investigate approaches that instantly refine landmark recommendations based on the traveler X  X  current location and landmarks visited on the same day. Finally, we would like to evaluate our landmark recommender system with real users in future. One earlier algorithm has been evaluated with a small-scale user study on a prototype system [Kofler et al. 2011], in which the concept of off-the-beaten-track recommenda-tions was highly appreciated by the users. It is interesting to investigate how user satisfaction could be improved by the proposed system in this article. In sum, the new task of personalized landmark recommendation based on images from photo-sharing sites can be effectively addressed with our proposed WMF-CR approach and at the same time, the approach opens vistas for extension that are promising for future exploration.
