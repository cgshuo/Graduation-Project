 The Chinese comma, which looks graphically very similar to its English counterpart, is functionally quite different. It has attracted a significant amount of research that studied the problem from the view-point of natural language processing. For exam-ple, Jin et al ( 2004) and Li et al ( 2005) view the disambiguation of the Chinese comma as a way of breaking up long Chinese sentences into shorter ones to facilitate parsing. The idea is to split a long sentence into multiple comma-separated seg-ments, parse them individually, and reconstruct the syntactic parse for the original sentence. Although both studies show a positive impact of this approach, comma disambiguation is viewed merely as a con-venient tool to help achieve a more important goal. Xue and Yang ( 2011) point out that the very rea-son for the existence of these long Chinese sentences is because the Chinese comma is ambiguous and in some context, it identifies the boundary of a sentence just as a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark does. The disambiguation of comma is viewed as a necessary step to detect sentence boundaries in Chinese and it can benefit a whole range of down-stream NLP applications such as syntactic parsing and Machine Translation. In Machine Translation, for example, it is very typical for  X  X ne X  Chinese sentence to be translated into multiple English sen-tences, with each comma-separated segment corre-sponding to one English sentence. In the present work, we expand this view and propose to look at the Chinese comma in the context of discourse anal-ysis. The Chinese comma is viewed as a delimiter of elementary discourse units (EDUs), in the sense of the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Carlson et al., 2002; Mann et al., 1988). It is also considered to be the anchor of discourse relations, in the sense of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDT) (Prasad et al., 2008). Disambiguating the comma is thus necessary for the purpose of discourse segmentation, the iden-tification of EDUs, a first step in building up the dis-course structure of a Chinese text.

Developing a supervised or semi-supervised model of discourse segmentation would require ground truth annotated based on a well-established representation scheme, but as of right now no such annotation exists for Chinese to the best of our knowledge. However, syntactically annotated tree-banks often contain important clues that can be used to infer discourse-level information. We present a method of automatically deriving a preliminary form of discourse structure anchored by the Chinese comma from the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005), and using this information to train and test supervised models. This discourse information is formalized as a classification of the Chinese comma, with each class representing the boundary of an elementary discourse unit as well as the anchor of a coarse-grained discourse rela-tion between the two discourse units that it delimits. We then develop two comma classification methods. In the first method, we replace the part-of-speech (POS) tag of each comma in the CTB with a de-rived discourse category and retrain a state-of-the-art Chinese parser on the relabeled data. We then evaluate how accurately the commas are classified in the parsing process. In the second method, we parse these sentences and extract lexical and syn-tactic information as features to predict these new discourse categories. The second approach gives us more control over what features to extract and our results show that it compares favorably against the first approach.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our approach to automati-cally extract discourse information from a syntac-tically annotated treebank and present our classifi-cation scheme. In Section 3, we describe our su-pervised learning methods and the features we ex-tracted. Section 4 presents our experiment setup and experimental results. Related work is reviewed in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6. There are many ways to conceptualize the discourse structure of a text (Mann et al., 1988; Prasad et al., 2008), but there is more of a consensus among researchers about the fundamental building blocks of the discourse structure. For the Rhetorical Dis-course Theory, the building blocks are Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs). For the PDT, the build-ing blocks are abstract objects such as propositions, facts. Although they are phrased in different ways, syntactically these discourse units are generally re-alized as clauses or built on top of clauses. So the first step in building the discourse structure of a text is to identify these discourse units.

In Chinese, these elementary discourse units are generally delimited by the comma, but not all com-mas mark the boundaries of a discourse unit. In (1), for example, Comma [1] marks the boundary of a discourse unit while Comma [2] does not. This is reflected in its English translation: while the first comma corresponds to an English comma, the sec-ond comma is not translated at all, as it marks the boundary between a subject and its predicate, where no comma is needed in English. Disambiguating these two types of commas is thus an important first step in identifying elementary discourse units and building up the discourse structure of a text. (1)  X   X 
Although to the best of our knowledge, no such discourse segmented data for Chinese exists in the public domain, this information can be extracted from the syntactic annotation of the CTB. In the syntactic annotation of the sentence, illustrated in (a), it is clear that while the first comma in the sen-tence marks the boundary of a clause, the second one marks the demarcation between the subject NP and the predicate VP and thus is not an indicator of a discourse boundary. (a)
In addition to a binary distinction of whether a comma marks the boundary of a discourse unit, the CTB annotation also allows the extraction of a more elaborate classification of commas based on coordination and subordination relations of comma-separated clauses. This classification of the Chinese comma can be viewed as a first approximation of the discourse relations anchored by the comma that can be refined later via a manual annotation process.
Based on the syntactic annotation in the CTB, we classify the Chinese comma into seven hierarchi-cally organized categories, as illustrated in Figure 1. The first distinction is made between commas that indicate a discourse boundary (RELATION) and those that do not (OTHER). Commas that in-dicate discourse boundaries are further divided into commas that separate coordinated discourse units (COORD) vs commas that separate discourse units in a subordination relation (SUBORD). Based on the levels of embedding and the syntactic category of the coordinated structures, we define three dif-ferent types of coordination (SB, IP COORD and VP COORD). We also define three types of subordi-nation relations (ADJ, COMP, Sent SBJ), based on the syntactic structure. As we will show below, each of the six relations has a clear syntactic pattern that can be exploited for their automatic detection. Sentence Boundary (SB) : Following (Xue and Yang, 2011), we consider the loosely coordinated IPs that are the immediate children of the root IP to be independent sentences, and the commas separat-ing them to be delimiters of sentence boundary. This is illustrated in (2), where a Chinese sentence can be split into two independent shorter sentences at the comma. We view this comma to be a marker of the sentence boundary and it serves the same function as the unambiguous sentence boundary delimitors (pe-riods, question marks, exclamation marks) in Chi-nese. The syntactic pattern that is used to infer this relation is illustrated in (b). (2)  X   X   X  (b) IP-Root
IP Coordination (IP COORD) : Coordinated IPs that are not the immediate children of the root IP are also considered to be discourse units and the com-mas linking them are labeled IP COORD. Different from the sentence boundary cases, these coordinated IPs are often embedded in a larger structure. An ex-ample is given in (3) and its typical syntactic pattern is illustrated in (c). (3)  X  (c) IP VP Coordination (VP COORD) : Coordinated VPs, when separated by the comma, are not seman-tically different from coordinated IPs. The only dif-ference is that in the latter case, the coordinated VPs share a subject, while coordinated IPs tend to have different subjects. Maintaining this distinction allow us to model subject (dis)continuity, which helps re-cover a subject when it is dropped, a prevalent phe-nomenon in Chinese. As shown in (4), the VPs in the text spans separated by Comma [6] have the same subject, thus the subject in the second VP is dropped. The syntactic pattern that allows us to extract this structure is given in (d). (4)  X   X  (d) IP
Adjunction (ADJ) : Adjunction is one of three types of subordination relations we define. It holds between a subordinate clause and its main clause. The subordinate clause is normally introduced by a subordinating conjunction and it typically provides the cause, purpose, manner, or condition for the main clause. In the PDT terms, these subordinate conjunctions are discourse connectives that anchor a discourse relation between the subordinate clause and the main clause. In Chinese, with few excep-tions, the subordinate clause comes before the main clause. (5) is an example of this relation. (5)  X  (e) IP (e) shows how (5) is represented in the syntac-tic structure in the CTB. Extracting this relation re-quires more than just the syntactic configuration be-tween these two clauses. We also take advantage of the functional (dash) tags provided in the tree-bank. The functional tags are attached to the sub-ordinate clause and they include CND (conditional), PRP (purpose or reason), MNR (manner), or ADV (other types of subordinate clauses that are adjuncts to the main clause).

Complementation (COMP) : When a comma separates a verb governor and its complement clause, this verb and its subject generally describe the attribution of the complement clause. Attribu-tion is an important notion in discourse analysis in both the RST framework and in the PDT. An exam-ple of this is given in (6), and the syntactic pattern used to extract this relation is illustrated in (f). (6)  X  (f) IP
Sentential Subject (SBJ) : This category is for commas that separate a sentential subject from its predicate VP. An example is given in (7) and the syntactic pattern used to extract this relation is il-lustrated in (g). (7)  X   X  (g) IP
Others (OTHER) : The remaining cases of comma receive the OTHER label, indicating they do not mark the boundary of a discourse segment.
Our proposed comma classification scheme serves the dual purpose of identifying elementary discourse units and at the same time detecting coarse-grained discourse relations anchored by the comma. The discourse relations identified in this manner by no means constitute the full discourse analysis of a text, they are, however, a good first approximation. The advantage of our approach is that we do not require manual discourse annotations, and all the information we need is automatically ex-tracted from the syntactic annotation of the CTB and attached to instances of the comma in the cor-pus. This makes it possible for us to train supervised models to automatically classify the commas in any Chinese text. Given the gold standard parses, based on the syntac-tic patterns described in Section 2, we can map the POS tag of each comma instance in the CTB to one of the seven classes described in Section 2. Using this relabeled data as training data, we experimented with two automatic comma disambiguation meth-ods. In the first method, we simply retrained the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) on the re-labeled data and computed how accurately the com-mas are labeled in a held-out test set. In the second method, we trained a Maximum Entropy classifier with the Mallet (McCallum et al., 2002) machine learning package to classify the commas. The fea-tures are extracted from the CTB data automatically parsed with the Berkeley parser. We implemented features described in (Xue and Yang, 2011), and also experimented with a set of new features as fol-lows. In general, these new features are extracted from the two text spans surrounding the comma. Given a comma, we define the preceding text span as i span and the following text span as j span. We also collected a number of subject-predicate pairs from a large corpus that doesn X  X  overlap with the CTB. We refer to this corpus as the auxiliary corpus.
Subject and Predicate features : We explored various combinations of the subject ( sbj ), predicate ( pred ) and object ( obj ) of the two spans. The sub-ject of i span is represented as sbj i , etc. 1. The existence of sbj i , sbj j , both, or neither. 2. The lemma of pred i , the lemma of pred j , the 3. whether the conjunction of sbj i and pred j oc-4. whether the conjunction of obj i and pred j oc-5. Whether the conjunction of pred i and sbj j oc-
Mutual Information features : Mutual informa-tion is intended to capture the association strength between the subject of a previous span and the predi-cate of the current span. We use Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1989) as shown in Equation (1) and the frequency count computed based on the auxiliary corpus to measure such constraints. 1. The conjunction of sbj i and pred j when j does 2. Whether obj i and pred j has an MI value 3. Whether the MI value of sbj i and pred j is 4. Whether the MI value of obj i and pred j is 5. Whether the MI value of pred i and sbj j is
Span features : We used span features to cap-ture syntactic information, e.g. the comma separated spans are constituents in Tree (b) but not in Tree (d). 1. Whether i forms a single constituent, whether 2. The conjunction and hierarchical relation of all
Lexical features : 1. The first word in i if it is an adverb, the first 2. The first word in i span if it is a coordinating 4.1 Datasets We use the CTB 6.0 in our experiments and divide it into training, development and test sets using the data split recommended in the CTB 6.0 documenta-tion, as shown in Table 1. There are 5436 commas in the test set, including 1327 commas that are sen-tence boundaries (SB), 539 commas that connect co-ordinated IPs (IP COORD), 1173 commas that join coordinated VPs (VP COORD), 379 commas that delimits a subordinate clause and its main clause (ADJ), 314 commas that anchor complementation relations (COMP), and 1625 commas that belong to the OTHER category. 4.2 Results As mentioned in Section 3, we experimented with two comma classification methods. In the first method, we replace the part-of-speech (POS) tags of the commas with the seven classes defined in Sec-tion 2. We then retrain the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) using the training set as presented in Table 1, parse the test set, and evaluate the comma classification accuracy.

In the second method, we use the relabeled com-mas as the gold-standard data to train a supervised classifier to automatically classify the commas. As shown in the previous section, syntactic structures are an important source of information for our clas-sifier. For feature extraction purposes, the entire CTB6.0 is automatically parsed in a round-robin fashion. We divided CTB 6.0 into 10 portions, and parsed each portion with a model trained on other portions, using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007). Measured by the ParsEval metric (Black et al., 1991), the parsing accuracy on the CTB test set stands at 83.29% (F-score), with a pre-cision of 85.18% and a recall of 81.49%.

The results are presented in Table 2, which shows the overall accuracy of the two methods as well as the results for each individual category. As should be clear from Table 2, the results for the two meth-ods are very comparable, with the second method performing modestly better than the first method. 4.2.1 Subject continuity
One of the goals for this classification scheme is to model subject continuity, which answers the ques-tion of how accurately we can predict whether two comma-separated text spans have the same subject or different subjects. When the two spans share the same subject, the comma belongs to the cate-gory VP COORD. When they have different sub-jects, they belong to the categories IP COORD or SB. When this question is meaningless, e.g., when one of the span does not even have a subject, the comma belongs to other categories. To evaluate the performance of our model on this problem, we re-computed the results by putting IP COORD and SB in one category, putting VP COORD in another cat-egory and the rest of the labels in a third category. The results are presented in Table 3. 4.2.2 The effect of genre
CTB 6.0 consists of data from three different gen-res, including newswire, magazine and broadcast news. Data genres may have very different char-acteristics. To evaluate how our model works on different genres, we train a model using training and development sets, and test the model on differ-ent genres as described in Table 1. The results on these three genres are presented in Table 4, and they shows a significant fluctuation across genres. Our model works the best on newswire, but not as good on broadcast news and magazine articles. 4.2.3 Comparison with prior work (Xue and Yang, 2011) presented results on a binary classification of whether or not a comma marks a sentence boundary, while the present work addresses a multi-category classification problem aimed at identifying discourse segments and prelim-inary discourse relations anchored by the comma. However, since we also have a SB category, com-parison is possible. For comparison purposes, we retrained our model on their data sets, and computed the results of SB vs other categories. The results are shown in Table 5. Our results are very comparable with (Xue and Yang, 2011) despite that we are per-forming a multicategory classification. 4.3 Error analysis Even though our feature-based approach can the-oretically  X  X orrect X  parsing errors, meaning that a comma can in theory be classified correctly even if a sentence is incorrectly parsed, when examining the system output, errors in automatic parses often lead to errors in comma classification. A common pars-ing error is the confusion between Structures (h) and (i). If the subject of the text span after a comma is dropped as shown in (h), the parser often produces a VP coordination structure as shown in (i) and vice versa. This kind of parsing errors would lead to er-rors in our syntactic features and thus directly affect the accuracy of our model. (h) IP There is a large body of work on discourse analysis in the field of Natural Language Processing. Most of the work, however, are on English. An unsupervised approach was proposed to recognize discourse rela-tions in (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), which extracts discourse relations that hold between arbitrary spans of text making use of cue phrases. Like the present work, a lot of research on discourse analysis is car-ried out at the sentence level. (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Sporleder and Lapata, 2005; Polanyi et al., 2004). (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) and (Polanyi et al., 2004) implement models to perform discourse parsing, while (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005) intro-duces discourse chunking as an alternative to full-IP COORD VP Coord scale discourse parsing.

The emergence of linguistic corpora annotated with discourse structure such as the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002) and PDT (Miltsakaki et al., 2004; Prasad et al., 2008) have changed the landscape of discourse analysis. More robust, data-driven models are starting to emerge.

Compared with English, much less work has been done in Chinese discourse analysis, presum-ably due to the lack of discourse resources in Chi-nese. (Huang and Chen, 2011) constructs a small corpus following the PDT annotation scheme and IP COORD+SB 76.0 78.7 77.3 (%) p r f1 p r f1 Overall 89.2 88.7 EOS 64.7 76.4 70.1 63.0 77.9 69.7 NEOS 95.1 91.7 93.4 95.3 90.8 93.0 trains a statistical classifier to recognize discourse relations. Their work, however, is only concerned with discourse relations between adjacent sentences, thus side-stepping the hard problem of disambiguat-ing the Chinese comma and analyzing intra-sentence discourse relations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first in attempting to disambiguating the Chinese comma as the first step in performing Chinese discourse analysis. We proposed a approach to disambiguate the Chi-nese comma as a first step toward discourse analy-sis. Training and testing data are automatically de-rived from a syntactically annotated corpus. We pre-sented two automatic comma disambiguation meth-ods that perform comparably. In the first method, comma disambiguation is integrated into the parsing process while in the second method we train a super-vised classifier to classify the Chinese comma, us-ing features extracted from automatic parses. Much needs to be done in the area, but we believe our work provides insight into the intricacy and complexity of discourse analysis in Chinese.
