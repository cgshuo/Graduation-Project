 Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery have gained immense importance in the wake of recent man and nature inflicted calamities. A critical problem in a crisis situation is h ow to efficiently discover, collect, organize, search and disseminate real -time disaster information . In this paper, we address several key problems which inhibit better information sharing and collaboration between both private and public sector participants for disaster management and recovery. We design and implement a web based pr ototype of a Business Continuity Information Network ( BCIN ) system utilizing the latest advances in data mining technologies to create a user -friendly, Internet -based, information -rich service and acting as a vital part of a company's business continuity p rocess. Specifically, information extraction is used to integrate the input data from different sources; the content recommendation engine and the report summarization module provide users personalized and brief view s of the disaster information ; the community generation module develops spatial clustering techniques to help users build dynamic community in disaster s. Currently, BCIN has been exercised at Miami -Dade County Emergency Management .

Annually, the gulf coast states are especially susceptible to hurricane impact. In 2004 -2005, Florida was struck eight times by hurricanes that caused enormous economic damage. An untold amount of time and effort was also spent on repeated preparation and recovery efforts causing fatigue and anxiety in the affected communities. To better understand hurri cane behavior and impact, a significant amount of scientific study is being conducted to improve the predictive ability of hurricane relevant atmospheric and hydrological models, or to develop technologies that improve the quality of building materials and building codes. However, despite the lessons learned in a succession of storms such as Andrew, Katrina, and Wilma, there is very little knowledge of how to collect, manage, find, and present disaster information in the context of disaster management phase s: Preparation, Response, Recovery, and Mitigation.
 In recent years , Federal Emergency Management Agency has recognized the importance of the private sector as a partner in addressing regional disasters. The State of Florida Division of Emergency Manageme nt has created a Business and Industry Emergency Support Function that is designed to facilitate logistical and relief missions in affected areas. Four counties, Palm Beach, Broward, Miami -Dade and Monroe, which constitute the Southeastern population of So uth Florida and include over 200,000 business interests, are developing Business Recovery Programs to help facilitate quicker business community recovery through information sharing and collaboration.
 For over three years, a multi -disciplinary team of rese archers at Florida International University with South Florida Emergency Management and i ndustry partners , such as Wal*Mart, Office Depot, Wachovia, T -Mobile , Ryder Systems , IBM , and others have investigated the way South Florida public and private sector entities manage and exchange information in a disaster situation. According to our prelimi nary work on our partner network in disaster management situations , the efficien cy of shar ing and management of information plays an important role in the business recovery [4] . For instance , it is critical that companies receive information about their facilities, supply chain, and city infrastructure. They seek this information from media outlets like television/radio newscasts , employee reports, and speak with other companies they have a relationship with. With so many sources of information at granularit ies , with different level s of redundancy and accuracy , possibly generated by different variet ies of reports (structured and unstructured ), it is difficult for companies to quickly assimilate such data and understand their situation. Furthermore , we have learned that large -scale regional disaster causes a disruption in the normal information flow and channels, and the relationships between information producer and consumer. Effective communication is critical in a crisis situation. What is not very w ell known is how to effec tive ly discover, collect, organize, search and disseminate real -time disaster information. In this context, we design and implement a Web-based prototype implementation of a Business Continuity Information Network (BCIN ) that is able to link participating companies into a community network , provide businesses with effective and timely disaster recovery information, and facilitate collaboration and information exchange with other busin esses and government agencies. The project website is http://www.bizrecovery.org . Based on observations we have made during our preliminary research , we have i dentified several key problems that inhibit better information sharing and collaboration among both private and public sector participants for disaster management and recovery. In this paper, we will focus on these problem s. 1. How can the system quickly captur e the status report information? Participants will communicate status reports through many channels, including direct emails, mailing lists, web pages, press releases, conference calls. It is desirable to capture such sta tus information the minute it is available an d prevent redundant reporting. To facilitate the reuse of such materials, users can upload status information in the form of unstructured documents such as plain text, Adobe PDFs, and Microsoft DOC. It is thus necessary to identify the useful information in the documents. 2. How can the system effectively understand the situation from a large collection of reports? In larger organizations, or in cases where there is a large accumulation of companies in an area, like a corporate park, re ports about a particular area can be redundant. It is important to build a summarized view to understand the situation users are interested from these reports. 3. How ca n we automatically capture user s X  interests and effectively deliver the relevant infor mation to the users? The status reports are collected through many different channels and are concerned about different categories. During disaster preparation and recovery, users typically don't have the time and patience to go through the system to find the information they want. 4. How can we take advantage of the community information for disaster recovery? Participating companies and organizations interact in different communities, such as being members of the same industry sector, or using the sam e shipping company. Identifying how participants interact with these communities in a disaster situation is very important since it may reveal information that would be helpful in a recovery scenario. To pursue solutions for these cha llenging problems, BCIN utilizes the latest advances in database, data mining, and information extractio n technologies to create a user -friendly, Internet -based, information -rich service and acts as a vital part of a company's business continuity process. BCIN is a platform of information sharing, integration, extraction, and processing for disaster management and recovery . It is also a data mining solution for disaster management and recovery that is able to process and analyze the data from diverse and heterogeneous informa tion sources of different types (categorical events and continuous data) with different formats (structured and unstructured: database records, document news, reports).
 In particular, to address Problem 1, we apply information extraction to automatically extract the status information from documents. To address Problem s 2 and 3, we create a user interface capability called the Dynamic Dashboard to improve information quality at match ing the u ser X  X  interests , and use document summarization techniques to give users a quick access to multiple reports . To addres s Problem 4, we adopt spatial clustering techniques to track assets like facilities, or equipment, which are important to participants. The geo -location of such participants can be organized into dyna mic communities, and these communities can be informed about events or activities relevant to their spatial footprint s. Our analysis shows that, if our system help s 5% of the companies in the South Florida area to speed up their hurricane recovery by 1 we ek, it will prevent $219,300,000 of non -property economic losses which would result from that week's closure. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the BCIN system . Section s 3-6 describe BCIN X  X  four key modules (information e xtraction module, dynamic dashboard , summarization module, space clustering module) in detail , respectively. Section 7 describes the system development and operation, and finally Section 8 presents the evaluation exercises BCIN has participat ed and concludes the paper . While there is no shortage of disaster planning or recovery toolkits, disaster information or news portals, emergency telecomm services, etc., there is no single technology, solution, or service that answers pressing business questions like,  X  What X  X  the damage to my company X  X  facility and surro unding area ? Are utility, transportation, and fuel services available ? X  We have developed our prototype BCIN system to help answer those questions. Based on the experience of developing our prototype we have established a series of abstrac tions necessary for model ing information management in our application. These concepts are listed below : Entity : An entity in BCIN represents anything of interest in which we can inquire status during a disaster, including companies (like Wal *M art and T-Mo bile ), assets of companies (like a retail outlet ), resources the companies are providing, facilities (like bus and seaports ), public service (like power and water ), and even orders (like curfew ). Most entities are associated with geographic information and can be annotated by a point or a range on the map. The sharing of entity status information is one of the most important motivations X  of our approach . Report: Users share their information by reports, which are mainly about the status of the entities that the users are related with. Reports from County Emergency Management Offices through an Emergency Operation Center, activated when there is a pending storm threat, are referred to as EOC reports. And reports from companies are called company reports and m essages, the difference of which is that company reports are accessible to users via group and role based access controls while messages are only received by specified target users.
 Community: Community is defined as a set of entities that have a specific relationship between each other. There are two kinds of communities: static and dynamic. A static community is a type of entity set whose relationships are pre -existing in the system (before a storm impact), whose relations among entities of the same set t ypically do not change. For example, a static community is the list of companies that participate in a type of industry. A dynamic community is a type of entity set in which existing rel ations among entities may break , new relations may establish and new e ntities may occur as the situation changes. Dynamic communities are designed to help users discover potential collaborations under disaster recovery scenarios. For example, in the post -disaster phase, hundreds of companies open or close every week, with ma ny reports and messages submitted every day. It is difficult for a user to browse all the different types of reports gathered in the system, and thus providing reports related to the user X  X  interest is highly desirable. In other words, the reports producer s and consumers are forming a community during a certain period of time.
 Dashboard: The dashboard of our system is a quick view of the current entity information for users. When a disaster event occurs, users are pressed for time and dealing with personal and business crisis situations, requiring immediate status information . Users will not have the patience to click the different sections in the system and find the information they seek . Therefore, the aim of the dashboard is to predict the most needed inf ormation by different users and to dis play that information directly. In our BCIN project, we have developed 4 different dashboards, each of them uniquely addressing information based on feedback obtained from our business users: Situation Dashboard: The s creenshot of the situation dashboard is shown in Figure. 1. In the table of this figure, each column represents a facility and each row represents a jurisdiction . The status of each fac ility at each jurisdiction is shown as a sign with a color. For example, a green cycle indicates the opening status and a red cycle indica tes the closed status . Thread Dashboard: The threat dashboard is designed to display the latest official advi sories from National Hurricane Center (NHC ). For example, Figure 2 shows a short description about a fictitious hurricane called  X  Tony  X  and is published on Thu Nov 1 3, 2007 at 7:00 AM . In this example, the storm named  X  X ony X , whose center is 720 Miles away from Fort Lauderdale is expected to impact the city with tropical storm force winds by Thursday, Nov. 15, 2007 at 1:00 AM . Event Dashboard: The event dashboard is a calendar that displays recovery event activity reports on a grid for each day in a month. Figure 3 is a screenshot of this dashboard. Company Dashboard: Th e company dashboard displays a list of companies X  news and status. The collection of companies is composed of two categories. The first category is determined by the selection s provided by t he user . User s can change their selections as needed to reflect th eir interest s in following different companies displayed in the dashboard. The second category is the recommended companies by the system that the user may be interested in. Figure 4 shows an example of the Wal -Mart X  X  status in Miami. Each record in that t able shows a status message of a specific Wal -Mart asset located in Miami. Figure 5 shows the system architecture of BCIN. The system allows company users to submit reports related to their own business , and government users to make an nouncements on the public issues. To collect more information during the disaster, BCIN can monitor the news published on the websites and takes the news as its input. Like traditional information system s, these reports and news, and the status information of entities they contain can be retrieved and access ed by queries . For example, reports can be viewed according to alert categories or geo -locations , and r esources can be viewed according to status or usage s. Furthermore , BCIN not only displays users -subm itted information but also conduct s necessary and meaningful data processing work. BCIN makes recommendations based on the current focus and dynamically adapt s based on the users X  interests. BCIN summarize s reports and news to provide users with brief and content -ori ented stories, prevent ing user s from being troubled when searching in huge amount of information. By introducing the concept of Community, BCIN offers users a hierarchical view of important reports or events around them.
 In this paper, we discuss the following four main information processing and representation components: Information Extraction, Dynamic Dashboard, Report Summarization, and Dynamic Community Generation . These four components utilize and develop data mining and machine learning techniques and apply them to disaster management and recovery. Information Extraction: As a data pre -processing component, we adopt sequence tagging and classification methods to extract the structured information from text to integrate different input without a unified format. The detailed approach es used for information extraction are presented in Section 3 . Dynamic Dashboard: In order to improve the relevance of information to match the user X  X  interests we have created a user interface capability called the Dynamic Dashboard. The dynamic dashboard analyzes user interactions such as what kinds of reports the participant has subm itted and viewed and automatically recommends similar information to display on the dashboard. The dynamic dashboard provides with the users a con venient and fast approach to obtain the disaster information that they probably want during the emergent time. The dynamic dashboard X  X  content is personalized with the concerns of different users. The main contributions of the dynamic dashboard lie in two parts. 1) It automatically removes the redundant companies X  reports, new s and other information by clustering methods . 2) It ranks the information by both the relevance to the current user and the importance of information. The details are discussed in Section 4. Report Summarization: the BCIN system provides users a report summary which is generated from multipl e reports to show the updated changes about the process of the disaster. In the summarization process, structured information extracted from text and stored in the database is use d to generate the summary to reflect the latest and changed status of an entity. Details of summarization approaches are discussed in Sectio n 5 . Community Generation: Participating companies and organizations interact in different communities, such as being members of the same industry sector, or using the same shipping company . Identifying how participants interact with these communities in a disaster situation is very important since it may reveal information that would be helpful in a recovery scenario. Using spatial relationship techniques we can track assets like facilitie s, or equipment, which are important to the participant s. The geolocation of such participants can be organized into dynamic communities, and these communities can be informed about events or activities relevant to their spatial footprint s. By generating d ynamic communities, users can directly select those events happening around them and make more efficient and accurate decision. We adapt spatial clustering algorithm s in an interactive way to provide users a multilevel view of related communities. The det ails are described in Section 6.
 These different components are tightly integrated to provide a cohesive set of services and constitute a holistic effort on developing a data -driven solution for disaster management and recovery. The BCIN system is an information sharing system for companies and government agencies. To provide a user -friendly interface to all these users, we do not request a unified form at for them to submit the reports. Instead, we use information extraction methods to integrate reports from different sources. For example, Table 1 shows an example of EOC reports . Time: October 21, 2005 12:30 p.m.

 In the BCIN system , the key information is  X  X hat was/is/will be the status of Facilities/Services/... at the time of ... X . From the EOC reports, we need to extract such information in the form of a triple: (entity, time, status), which reveals the status information of the enti ty at a certain time. In EOC reports, the entity may be a facility or public service like  X  X iami International Airport X ,  X  X chools X ,  X  X us X , and an order like  X  X urfew X . If the entity is referred to an order, the triple means whether the order is in effect or not at that specific time. We extract these triples through two steps: first, we extract entities and time expressions, then , we classif y a pair of (service, time) to a proper category,  X  X o relation X /  X  X pen X  /  X  X lose X  /  X  X nclear X . We assume that the information of one event will not span on different sentences, so we process every sentence individually to extract an event. To extract those triples, both entity and relation extraction will be performed. For each report, sentence segmentation is conducted first, and each sen tence is POS -tagged. To extract entities and time expressions, we manually label some news and train a linear chain conditional random fields (CRF) model to tag all words of sentences, using  X  X IO X  annotation [7,8] . A word tagged as [TYPE -B]/[TYPE -I] means it is the beginning/continuing word of the phrase of the TYPE, and the ones tagged as O means it is not in any phrase. Here TYPE can be E or T , referring to the entity and time expression. Using CRF, given the sentence X, the probability of its tags Y is as follows:  X   X  |  X  = where  X   X  is the normalization constant that makes the probability of all state sequences sum to one;  X   X   X   X  X  X  1 ,  X   X  feature function over the entire observation sequence and the states at positions i and i-1 while  X   X   X   X  X  X  1 ,  X   X  functi on of the state s at position i and the observation sequence; and  X   X  are the weights learned for the feature functions  X  , reflecting the confidence of feature functions by maximum likelihood procedure. The most probable labels can be obtained as by Viterbi -like dynamic programming algorithm [7] . We use for features the local lexicons and POS tags, and plus the dictionary composed of the existent entity names in the database.

Table 3. Features used to classify whether the entity e is associated with the time expression t . If a sentence contains an entity but no time expression, the time associated with the report will attached to the end of the sentence. To generate the triple by connecting the entity with the time expression with a proper status label, we train a multi -category SVM [9] to classify each pair of (entity, time) to a pr oper category,  X  X o relation X /  X  X pen X /  X  X lose X /  X  X nclear X . Table 3 shows the features we used for classification . Among them, TenseOfSentence(s,t), NegativeVerbsInSentence(s,t) and PositiveVerbsInsentence(s,t) are extracted by heuristic rules to indicate t he tense of the sentence, the verbs with and without negative modifi er semantically in the sentence , respectively. Note that FromDocument(t) indicates whether the time is the time associated with document or not.
 Finally, we extract those pairs of entity and time expression in the  X  X pen X  or  X  X lose X  categories to form the triple. Meanwhile the time expressions are formatted into an absolute form of expression from relative time expression such as  X  X ext Monday X ,  X  X his afternoon X  and etc. using the time of re port as a benchmark . The structured information extracted from the report in Table 1 is shown in Table 4. Table 4. Information extracted from the EOC report shown in Table 2 .

 Miami International Airport hurricane evacuation centers The dashboard s provide condensed view s for users to quickly explore the recent news and reports rapidly. It cannot display all the information in such a small area. Usually, when a disaster happens, the system will receive a huge amount of information from official government, companies and media , which is about almost everything . So it is necess ary for the system to select a small portion of entities that a user rea lly cares about to display in the dashboards. Another problem in practice is the information sent from company users may have a lot of redundancies . For in stance, when a hurricane arrives South Florida, almost all th e company users in that area will repor t the same hurricane information:  X  The storm has arrived South Florida  X . Thus, the same information may be reported hundreds of times by different users. Therefore, the system has to identify which information is redundant and the redundant information sho uld not appear in the dashboards. We address these problems by introducing the dynamic dashboard supported by the content recommendation engine in our system. The engine X  X  main task is to extract the most important, relevant and non -redundant information about entities from news and reports. Figure 6 shows the data flow related to the content recommendation engine. In the system, the re are four main dat a sources: EOC reports, news, compan y reports, and company messag es. Since reports and news may contain information about multiple entities, in content recommendation engine, each of reports or news is divided into several documents, and each document consists of a sentence containing entity status information plus a context window (one previous and next sentence) . The content recommendation consists of two steps. The first ste p is text clustering, which is to cluster the same description of entities into one cluster . The second step is ranking the text by the relevance and presenting the top k items to the dashboards. Note that the content recommendatio n engine is based on the text data while situation dashboard, thread dashboard and company dashboard displa y the structure information . The results of the information extraction of the text data are used to transform the result s of recommendation engine to the format s that those dashboards need.
 The four dashboards are denoted as Db S (Situation Dashboard), Db T (Threat Dashboard), Db E (Event Dashboard),Db C (Company Dashboard). The maximum numbers of items allowed to show in the dashboards Db S , Db T , Db E , Db C are denoted as size size E , size C respectively. Dashboard EOC Reports Company Reports News Company Messaging The content recommendation engine recommends information from different data sources to the four dashboards. Table 5 shows the relationship between the data sources and the four dashboards. Since the dashboard s show the latest information , we use the last 48 hours records and news as the input of the engine.
 For any user u in the system, t he set of information submitted by u is denoted by I ( u ) and the set of reports/news of which the details are viewed by u is denoted by J(u). u  X  X  profile in the system is composed of I(u) and J(u) . Before performing clustering, we first transform the text data (report, new s and so on) to the vectors. We adopt the tf -idf trans formation here [1]. Suppose the set of documents is D ={ d 1 ,d 2 ,... d N }, which is the dat a source of one dashboard show n in Table 1, and a set of words W ={ w 1 ,w 2 , ... , w number of occurrences of the considered word w i in document d i=1,2...,M, j=1,2,...,N. |  X  :  X   X   X  X  X  | means the number of documents which contain word w i ,  X   X  X  X  , and  X   X   X  X  X  . We have The similarity between two documents can be calculated by the cosine similarity [2].
 Suppose  X  (  X   X  ) and  X  (  X   X  ) are the transformed vectors from two document d i and d j , d i  X  D , d j  X  D . The similarity sim( d and d j is defined below: Function t ( d ) is the tf -idf transformation from document d to the vector . We apply the k -medoids [13] algorithm to cluster the documents . Note k is a user -defined parameter, which is determined by the managers of the system. It is also relevant to the number of items allowed to be display ed on the dashboards. After clustering, each cluster contains the duplica ted information about an entity and one document can be selected from a cluster to show the status of the entity. But before that, we have to decide which cluster and which document should be selected. For a specific user u , there are three priorities of the information. The three priorities from highest to lowest order are of EOC reports, Company Partner X  X  information , that is the messages received , and other users X  information , that is the company reports . In the system, the three priorities are denoted by user -defined param eters pr 1 , pr 2 and pr 3 respectively, pr 1 given document d i  X  D , we use pr ( d i ) to indicate the priority of this document, pr ( d i )  X  { pr 1 , pr 2 , pr 3 }. Suppose the current user in the system is u , we can obtain the u  X  X  feature f u by the users profile as: The parameter  X  is used to tune the importance weights of the reports submitted and viewed as the profile . The Importance Score of each document d i D is calculated as follow: For each dashboard, we use a top -K query to greedily search the K highest scores X  documents from its corresponding data sources , selected from the same cluster . The set of K highest scores X  docum ents is just th e result of the content recommendation engine. Normally, since the EOC official reports has the highest priority, even some of them are not very rel evant to the current user, information from these reports still is likely to appear on the Event Dashboard, where information can be from arbitrary sources. Besides providing the dashboard s for a quick view of the current information , BCIN also allows users to searc h reports with keywords or quer y form s like traditional i nformation system s. To provide a belief view of the latest information the user is interested , we lean on multi -document summarizatio n to generate a summary of the return ed reports, focusing on the latest status of the entities involved . Using the last 48 hours as the criteria , we divide the returned documents into two sets, D 1 = d 1 1 , d 2 1 ,  X  , d N 1 the documents submitted within the last 48 hours and D d Since in Section 3, we extract structured information from sentences, sentences in D 1  X  D 2 can also divided into two set s, S 1 = s 1 1 , s 2 1 ,  X  , s M 1 1 containing M 1 sentences having the structured information , and S 2 = s 1 2 , s 2 2 ,  X  , s rest M 2 sentences . Our task is to extract sentences from D and D 1  X  S 2 , and the extracted sentences should be discrimi native from D 2 . Users can tune the parameter to control how many D 1  X  S 2 , the BCIN system adopts the sentence selection method proposed by Wang et al.[10] . We take the sentence s as documents  X  features and different document set s as the label s, and then use the Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method to select the sentences which correlate strongly with the label s while keeping the redundancy of the selected sentences minimum. Formally, the sentence is selected according to the following formula [11] : where  X   X  is the subset of S composed of k sentences extracted, l is the document label indicating which document set D document from , and  X   X  ,  X  is the mutual information of two attributes a and b in all documents.
 To extract sentences from D 1  X  S 2 , we make use of the extracted structured information . Since triples (entity, time, status) in each document have been extracted, instead of taking the sentences as features of documents, we take the extracted ent ities as the features and the status as the value. Using the following formula where E is the set all entities extracted from D subset of E composed of k entities select ed, we can select a set of entities . Then for each selected entity, the latest sentence containing the entity will be se lected to form the summary. There are two characteristics in disaster recovery scenarios which motivate us to consider geo -location information in the BCIN system. The first characteristic is that any event extracted from a report is associated with a/several location(s) indicating the place(s) where the announced event takes place. The second characteristic is that spatially co -located entities are more likely sharing similar disaster damage situation. Th ese two characteristics mo tivate the concept of community as we mentioned in Section 2.1. A community is a certain geographical region in which entities tend to share more recovery status or interests in common. So geographically identif ying those communities is one of the most imp ortant issue s to h elp companies understand what the current disaste r situation s are or their interested resources nearby . The BCIN system addresses community generation by adapting existing spatial clustering algorithms. In practice, we provide an interactive spatial clustering interface for users to access multi -level co mmunities in a top -down manner and consider physical or non -physical obstacles when generating spatial clusters to form more practical communi ties. Spatial data clustering identifies clusters, or densely populated regions, according to some distance measurement in a large, multidimensional data set [2,13] . Many spatial clustering techniques [ 12, 14,15] have been developed for identifying clusters with arbitrary shapes of various densities and with different physical constraints.
 In practice, communities formed by geographically related entities can be of various shapes. So we extend DBScan [14], a well -known density -based clus tering algorithm , which is capable of identifying arbitrary shape of clusters, to generate dynamic communities . We consider the method of spatial clustering with constraints. Generally, there are three types of constraints [13]: 1). Constraints on individual objects: Such constraint s are non -spatial instance -level constraints that can be preprocessed before performing clustering algorithms . 2). Constraints as clustering parame ters: Such constraints are usually confined to the algorithm itself. Usually, user -specified parameters are given through em pirical stud ies . 3). Constraints as physical obstacles: Such constraints are tightly intertwined with clustering process. It is clea r that physical obstacles are such constraints which prevent two geographically close entities from being clustered together. In real case, the bridge, highway and rivers are of this type.
 In our BCIN system, we focus on object constraint s and physical con straint s. Object constraints: We have two ways to obtain object constraints: 1) users submit formatted reports through report interface. Those reports are immediately recorded in the dat abase; 2) our system extract s entity status from reports . For example, Table 4 can be used as object constraints . Obstacle constraints: Polygon is a typical structure in spatial analysis to model objects. Obstacles modeled by a polygon can be represented as a set of line segments after performing polygon reductio n [ 15]. Figure 7 shows the communities generated by clustering all open facilities and companies in Miami with the constraint:  X  X 75 closed X . In order to deal with im balanced size of clusters, we provide user s with an interac tive mechanism to track the sub -community information within a large size community. By using this mechanism, users can obtain clusters with different granularities and more meaningful results. Figure 8 shows the interactive clustering results within the largest cluster in Figure 7. Through a series of interview s with public and private sector partners we identified the specific information both side could share and neede d as part of their preparedness and recovery processes. The system then functionally established four key capabilities: Messaging, Reporting, Resources, Situational Browsin g, so we can do things like alert a user via messag es that a particular resource has been reported available at a local business. The proposed enhancements to the base system we have discussed in this paper provide new ways to connect reports, with resources, and the people/ communities that need it.
 FIU has spent over $600K in the develop ment of the application and has received over $400K in sponsored research or industry donation. The system is monitored 24/7 via scripts that verify application, database, web server, and hardware availability. The system is managed in a revision control s ystem and is run through a test suite that validates key functionality such as report submission, field validation, and role based access control. Over 100 companies (local and national) and go vernment agencies in the south F lorida area are utilizing the s ystem  X  working closely with County emergency managers to collaborate on their mutual interest of disaster preparedness, response and recovery. The private sector benefits by receiving timely, accurate, information which impacts business operations and has t he ability to report in situational information regarding disaster impact and infrastructure needs which are a priority for their business resumption. The public sector benefits by helping the business community receive and better understand disaster relat ed information and can use disaster related situational reports from private sector to make better assessment of disaster impact.
 Before the deployment of the BCIN, in a disaster situation, simultaneous reports from thousands of participants would overwhel m participants, making it very difficult to assess the status without dedicating a significant amount of time by all parties to process this potentially huge volume of information. Using the proposed information extraction and report summarization techniq ues, the flooding status of an important commerce area such as Dadeland can be determined even if there are 1,000 companies providing status information. For instance, if these Dadeland based companies each logs into the system and enters a Flood report, or uploads a relevant document that contains relevant information, in an unstructured format, such as flooding area, depth, and public safety issues (nearby canals, down powerlines). The exercise has shown that the proposed techniques are able to identify critical common features of the flooding and summarize these, providing situational reporting in the Dynamic Dashboard. Further, if many of these companies are displaced by the damage, Dynamic Community Generation can inform community members about logist ical concerns or assistance opportunities available. Up to now, BCIN has been exercised at Miami -Dade County Emergency Management for the hurricane disaster management and recovery for three times . Miami -Dade, Florida is a very concentrated urban area (4th largest in the US), with tens of thousands of commercial concerns in a 25 square mile area. Miami -Dade County Emergency Management is interested in assisting this large, diverse business ecosyste m to prepare and recovery quickly from hurricane impact. Table 6 is a belief description of the exercises BCIN has taken part in. In a regional disaster such as a hurricane, business continuity professionals are under extreme pressure to execute their co ntinuity of operation plans because many of the usual sources of information and services about the community and supply chain are completely disconnected, sporadic, redundant, Date Description of the Exe rcise Jun/01/ 2009 In Florida Dept. of Emergency Management's Jun/29/2009 In Miami -Dade UASI exercise , BCIN was the Aug/20/2009 In a full scale company training of BC IN where and many times lack actionable value. The BCIN system focuses user input and collaboration around actionable information that both public and private sector can use. According the user surveys after these exercises, BCIN provided simple and effective interface s for companies to communicate with each other and get information on critical needs , and scalable inform ation sharing and recovery collaboration tools between these participants.
 Feedback from our users suggest that our system can be used not only to share the valuable actionable information such as when are the schools going to close, what bridges have fai led, etc , but to pursued more complex problems such as how county emergency management can collaborate with local banks to provide portable ATMs at shelters, whether we can provide a supply waypoint at local hospitals where nurses serving hospice patients can receive medicine, whether we can have a wireless provider setup cells -on-wheels ( COW s) to provide local businesses at an area mall with communications. There are many such collaborative missions that can be undertaken on our system which allows public private sector entities to leverage their local capacity to serve the recovery of the community.
