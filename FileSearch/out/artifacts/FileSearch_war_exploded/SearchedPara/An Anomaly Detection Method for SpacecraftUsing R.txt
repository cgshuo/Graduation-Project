 Anomaly detection is a key issue in the development of recent advanced space-craft. The space environment is very harsh for spacecraft due to a variety of factors such as direct radiation, great temperature difference, and so on. In ad-dition, the space is so distant from the earth that it is extremely difficult to directly inspect and repair a damaged component. Therefore, early detection of anomalous symptoms is important to avoid disastrous situations such as loss of control. Although several anomaly detection/diagnosis methods using mod-ern reasoning techniques have been developed, they have difficulties in acquiring accurate and complete models and knowledge of the spacecraft systems and in monitoring the system behavior exhaustively and efficiently.
 based on data mining technique, autoregressive model and the relevance vector regression , and constructs a predictive model for each time series in the telemetry data. Then, it monitors online telemetry data and detect anomalies by checking the probability density of the observation. Limit-checking checks whether the value is within the pre-defined upper and lower limits. Though the limit-checking can be applied to any types of spacecraft, it lacks flexibility and expressiveness and suffers from false alarm problem. are utilized to simulate the spacecraft behavior and examine the validity of the actual telemetry data. This approach would provide an ideal performance if an accurate and complete model and infinite computational power were available. In practice, however, both of them are not available.

 machine learning techniques to the telemetry data. Actually, some researchers have developed anomaly detection methods for spacecraft using regression tree learning[7], temporal pattern clustering[8], association rule mining[9]. 3.1 Autoregressive Model Autoregressive (AR) model is the most basic data mining technique for time-series data[3][10][11]. For the purpose of applying AR model to anomaly detec-tion problems for spacecraft, we define AR model as ..., X  j (1 series, and the notation AR represent that the target value  X  is based on AR model. This modified AR model implies that the value of a target time-series depends not only on the past values of itself but also on those of other series. The capability of modeling the relationships among some series is a great advan-tage. Fig.1 is the concept of this model. We made use of the framework of the relevance vector learning to extend this model to nonlinear and probabilistic. 3.2 Relevance Vector Regression The relevance vector regression (RVR) originally proposed by Tipping[5] is a state of the art kernel-based nonlinear regression learning method[1][2][4][6]. telemetry data and omit the notation j for simplification.

 over w are indroduced. Then, after maximizing logarithm likelihood w.r.t.  X  and  X  , we obtain a conditional distribution model for a new datum x  X  as where y  X  is the predict value of the new target t  X  and  X  2  X  is the variance of the prediction. See [1][4][6] for more details of the sparse Bayesian learning. 3.3 Anomaly Detection System The anomaly detection system based on the proposed method operates as fol-lows, 1. (Learning) Learn the relevance vector autoregressive model using a set of 2. (Prediction) Compute the next probable range of the target series. 3. (Monitoring) Obtain and check the (pseudo-)telemetry data. 4. (Alarming) Give an alarm if the data is out of the predicted range. 5. Repeat steps 2-4 redefined AR model Eq.(1) and the RVR Eq.(3). The reasons are, 1. The AR model completely cannot be modeled as the complicate spacecraft 2. The RVR adopts the relevance vector for the prototypes of the model formed As the result, some training data can be mistaken as anomaly though all training data are normal because these data have relatively so large AR that the system regards them as the data which is far from the prototype data.
 and corresponding prediction values, y  X  ( x i ). If the AR model completely describes the system behavior, (5) must be zero in theory. Therefore, we extended (3) as We performed an experiment with telemetry data obtained from an orbital ren-dezvous simulation. This telemetry consists of 27 time-series variables in total, 13 of which are from position and attitude control subsystem , and the rest are from propulsion subsystem . In more detail, the former group consists of 12 nu-merical observation time-series variables regarding the position and attitude of the vehicle and one command sequence. The latter group consists of 14 discrete-valued time-series variables, each of which indicates the command input to each of the 14 thruster engines.
 we performed following two scenarios.
 Comparison of Proposed Method with normal RV Autoregressive Model First, we have compared the proposed method with the normal relevance vector au-toregressive model.

The solid line in the upper figure shows the pitch angle and the dotted line shows the predicted range, and the solid line in the lower figure shows the probability density of the observation. The system gives the alarm when the probability became lower than the computed limit 2 . We can see that the normal model gives many false alarms. On the other hand, the proposed method correctly gives alarms after a little time delay. The proposed method also succeeded in detecting anomalies in the series representing the pitch rate as shown in Fig.4. Comparison with Conventional Limit-Checking. We compared the proposed method with the conventional limit-checking. We set the limit on the standard deviation for the proposed method and on the maximum absolute value in the normal phase for the limit-checking. Fig.4 shows the result. The conventional limit-checking fails to detect slight anomalies like this case. On the other hand, the proposed method is capable of detecting this anomaly because it can dynamically estimate proper range of the target series.
