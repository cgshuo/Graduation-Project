 Database workload characteristics can be different depending on database applica-tions. Since database applications become more complex and various, database administrators need to carefully consider p eculiar workload characteristics [2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14]. Changing DBMS resources can differ in resource usages and the DBMS performance depending on the different kinds of workload. Resource usages should be taken by performance indicators in database systems for tracking the current DBMS state. 
Several studies on database workloads have been reported [2, 6, 1]. These studies take no account of analyzing relative inter-relationships between performance indica-tors and resources, or use only a few resources in order to analyze workloads. In our previous studies, some performance indicators are shown to be affected by particular resource changes. For example, the data buffer ratio was increased by expanding the data buffer, but it seemed to remain unchanged by expanding other resources, in for identifying relative resources that can have an impact on DBMS performance depending on the different kinds of workloads. DBMS performance through analyzing relationships between performance indicators and resources in a workload type. To cons truct a standard workload environment, the TPC-C and TPC-W [12, 13] were used. The workload data, which are represented by fourteen performance indicators, were investigated in response to changes of four tuning parameters (data buffer, private memory, shared memory, and I/O process). The relationship is determined by the Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient with the t-test. Furthermore, we identify certain resources that can affect the DBMS performance within the TPC-C and TPC-W workloads. To verify our hypothesis and methodol-ogy, we measure the maximum load that can be executed in the individual system for the TPC-C and TPC-W. This research can aid database tuning and automatic DBMS managements. 
This paper is composed as follows. Section 2 explains collecting workload data using TPC-C and TPC-W benchmarks. Section 3 introduces the method that can analyze the relationship between performance indicators and resources. Section 4 describes the relationship results using TPC-C and TPC-W and shows experiments in order to support the proposed method. Section 5 presents the conclusions and plan for future work. database resources: data buffer, private memory, shared memory, and I/O processes data in the private memory is not shared. 
The resource size is changed by the database tuning parameter. Resources (data buffer, shared memory, private memory, and I/O processes) can be adjusted by tuning four system parameters (db_cache_size, shared_pool_size, pga_aggregate_target, and dbwr_io_slave), respectively [3]. 
Table 1 shows how a parameter is changed during workload collection. The initial During workload collection, only one parameter is subject to change at a time, while leaving the others unchanged. For instance, the value of db_cache_size increases from 32MB to 480MB by 32MB intervals, while other parameters remain as initial values. The workload data is collected 114 times. 
To analyze workloads of database systems, we use 14 performance indicators of a catalog hit ratio; the latch contention ratio, the memory sort ratio; the memory parsing ratio; the data variance ratio; the data buffer reads; the non-data buffer reads; the data writes without checkpoints; and the redo size [1, 2, 4, 8]. This paper proposes a new method to effectively identify relative resources, which is able to define the incremental or decremental relationship between the resource and The Pearson X  X  correlation coef ficient measures the degree of which two variables are linearly related. The Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient is used to test this relationship, and the equation is shown below [5, 7]. Th e equation is defined as the covariance of X with Y divided by the product of the standard deviation of X and the standard devia-tion of Y . X and Y indicates the mean of the variable and n represents the number of and -1. If the correlation coefficient is pos itive, it indicates that one variable increases accordingly when the other variable increases. If the correlation coefficient is nega-tive, it indicates that another variable increases accordingly when the variable decreases. tively. Therefore, if the coefficient is positive, the performance indicator seems to be indicator seems to be decreased by expandi ng the resource. Since not all correlations show the incremental or decremental relationship, we apply significance level test using the t-test in order to define the real incremental or decremental relationship. 
The t-test sets null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, and significance level and finds acceptance area, the relationship between resource and performance indicator is mean-ingless. Otherwise, the relationship is meaningful. The t-test shows in Equation (2). r is the correlation coefficient between two variables, and n is the number of data. Example 1. Let us obtain the incremental or decremental relationship between values of performance indicator (P, Q) and values (in megabytes) of resource K. The as-sumptions for t-test are followings : [Identifying relationship between resource K and indicator P] 
The correlation coefficient between k and P is about -0.48634. We expect decre-mental relationship from the coefficient. Th e t-test value about the correlation coeffi--3.355  X  t  X  3.355, null hypothesis is accepted. In consequence, resource K and indi-cator P do not have the meaningful decremental relationship. [Identifying the relationship between resource K and indicator Q] 
The correlation coefficient between K and P is about 0.98948. We expect incre-mental relationship from the coefficient. Th e t-test value about the correlation coeffi-cient between K and Q is about 19.34525. At the 0.01 significance level, the critical within the reject area, null hypothesis is rejected. Therefore, resource K and indicator P have the significant incremental relationship. Using TPC-C and TPC-W workloads, we calcu late correlation coefficients between expanded resources and recorded performance indicators, and obtain the t-test values of correlation coefficients. At the 0.05 sign ificance level, the relationship between the resource and the performance indicator can be accepted when the t-test value exists in test. 
Table 3 shows performance indicators that have the meaningful relationship be-tween the 14 performance indicators and expansions of db_cache_size in TPC-C. There are five performance indicators that exist in the rejection area of null hy-pothesis. There exists the significant incremental relationship in the data buffer hit ratio and the disk writes with checkpoints. On the other hand, the significant decremental relationships are shown in the data buffer reads, the data buffer and the disk writes. 
Table 4 shows performance indicators that have the meaningful relationship be-tween the 14 performance indicators and expansions of shared_pool_size in TPC-C. There are seven performance indicators that exist in the rejection area of null hy-pothesis. All of the seven performance indicators show the significant decremental relationships. In expansions of other parameters, no performance indicator exists in the rejection area of null hypothesis. 
For TPC-W, a similar methodology is applied. Table 5 shows performance indica-tors that have the meaningful relationship between the 14 performance indicators and expansions of db_cache_size in TPC-W. There are two performance indicators that exist in the rejection area of null hypothesis. The significant incremental relationship is shown in the data buffer hit ratio is, and the significant decremental relationship is hypothesis. 
Because the incremental or decremental relationship can detect the change of the performance indicator to expanding the parameter, it is used for identifying resources that can affect the DBMS performance. The data buffer and the shared memory in the TPC-C can have an impact on the DBMS performance because the significant incre-mental or decremental relationship exists. Only the data buffer can affect the DBMS performance in the TPC-W. 
In order to prove our claim, we measured the maximum number of warehouses and emulated browsers that can be executed in the individual system for the TPC-C and TPC-W. The measured results are shown in Figure 1. 
In the case of TPC-C, expanding the data buffer can change the maximum number might reduce disk I/O and enhance DBMS performance. However, as update queries occur frequently in the TPC-C environment, the expansion of data buffer over 416MB can change the maximum number of warehouses in our experiments. 
Expanding the shared memory can change the maximum number of warehouses maximum number of warehouses. Oracle database management system is used for our test. The excessively large shared memory in Oracle reduces DBMS performance of updating queries, because the time is de layed about searching free list and allocat-ing, reallocating or deallocating objects. Other resources had no influence on the number of allowable warehouses. 
In the case of TPC-W, only the data buffer affects the number of allowable emu-lated browsers while others do not. That is, expanding the data buffer can change the maximum number of emulated browsers (from 45 to 50) over the 4 th phases. Expending the shared memory has not an impact on DBMS performance in TPC-W environments, because the time is not delayed about searching free list and allocating, no influence on the number of allowable warehouses. k N .

Pearson X  X  correlation coef-relationship. The relationship is shown by expanding db_cache_size and shared_pool_size in the TPC-C, while it is shown by expanding db_cache_size in the TPC-W. Therefore, the data buffer and the shared memory are the resources that can be tuned to enhance the database performance in the TPC-C, while only the data buffer can be a resource in the TPC-W. 
This study produced evidences which prove our previous information of effective workload type. Furthermore, this study will pave the way toward automatic database management that reduces human intervention and burden.
