 It is extremely important in ma ny application domains to have transparency in predictive modeling. Domain experts do not tend to prefer "black box" predictive model models. They would like to understand how predictions are made, and possibly, prefer models that emulate the way a human expert might make a decision, with a few important va riables, and a clear convincing reason to make a particular prediction. I will discuss recent work on interpretable predictive modeling with decision lists and sparse inte ger linear models. I will describe several approaches, including an algorithm based on discrete optimization, and an algorithm based on Bayesian analysis. I will show examples of interpretable models for stroke prediction in medical patients and prediction of violent crime in young people raised in out-of-home care.

 Algorithms Machine Learning; Interpretability; Comprehensibility; Understandability; Sparsity, Medical Calculators Cynthia Rudin is an associate professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of T echnology associated with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Sloan School of Management, wh ere she directs the Prediction Analysis Laboratory. Her expertise is in machine learning and knowledge discovery, and she aims to make predictive modeling closer to decision making. Previously, Prof. Rudin was an associate research scientist at the Center for Computational Learning Systems at Columbia University, and prior to that, an NSF postdoctoral research fellow at NYU. She holds an undergraduate degree from the University at Buffalo where she received the College of Arts and Sciences Outstanding Senior Award in Sciences and Mathematics in 1999, and she received a PhD in applied and computational mathematics from Princeton University in 2004. She is the recipient of the 2013 INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award, and a 2011 NSF CAREER award. Her work has been featured in IEEE Computer, Businessweek, The Wall Street Journal, the Boston Globe, the Times of London, Fox News (Fox &amp; Friends), the Toronto Star, WIRED Science, Yahoo! Shine, U.S. News and World Report, Slashdot, CIO magazine, and on Boston Public Radio.
