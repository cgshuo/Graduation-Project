 Unstructured data is a valuable source of information and implicit knowledge. Yet, the bits and bytes of, e.g., text, image, or click-stream data need to be interpreted in order to transform them into business intelligence and actionable information. Clearly, this process needs to be automated to the largest possible extend in order to be scalable to the typical volumes of data. One way to accomplish this is through the use of machine learning and statistical modeling techniques. This talk will provide an overview of recent progress and new trends in categorization, and knowledge extraction. Thomas Hofmann received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of B onn in 1997. Since then he has held postdocotral positions at the Massachussets Institute of Technology as well as the University of California at Berkeley and the International Computer Science Institute. From 1999 until 2004 he was Assistant and Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Brown University. Since December 2004, he is Full Professor of Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt. He is also Director of the Fraunhofer IPSI as well as Chief Scientist and co-founder of Recommind Inc.
