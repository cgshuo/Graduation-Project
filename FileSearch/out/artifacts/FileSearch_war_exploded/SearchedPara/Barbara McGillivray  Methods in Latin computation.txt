 Federico Boschetti 1 The book under review opens the series of Brill X  X  Studies in Historical Linguistics with a new methodological approach to the observation of diachronic phenomena which moves the focus from qualitative to quantitative aspects. For this reason the author aims to illustrate how to apply computational methods to historical language data, in particular to a corpus of lemmatized and morpho-syntactically annotated Latin texts. The volume is addressed to a heterogeneous audience composed of computational linguists, Latin linguists and those within the growing community of Latin computational linguists (for an overview on methods and tools at disposition of Latin computational linguists, see Passarotti 2010 ; Babeu 2011 ; Spinazze ` 2015 ). Such communities are likely to have different backgrounds and cultural gaps which need to be filled in at least in a cursory fashion in order to understand the overall structure of the work presented here. This difficult task is achieved through a prudent organization of the content: case studies are contextualized within the domain of Latin linguistics in order to demonstrate how open questions can be handled by new methods. Each case study is followed by a section devoted to technical details related to computational and statistical procedures. The writing is modulated between expository and scientific registers.

The volume is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter is devoted to a general overview of historical languages, corpora, and computational methods, in order to identify the challenges that Latin computational linguistics faces compared to computational linguistics applied to modern languages, especially English. Among the other relevant differences, the author observes the small number of morpho-syntactically annotated corpora, the morphological richness and consequently the scarcely predictable word position of Latin, diachronic changes in the subcorpora, and the absence of native speakers. Despite these limitations, the author points out that Latin corpora can be used not only to build lexical resources but also to study linguistic phenomena and to find new results. The collaborative approach widens the perspective of historical linguistics, because resources and tools are created asynchronously by several teams and their interoperability allows them to be reused beyond the original purposes for which they were first developed.

The second chapter reviews computational resources and tools for Latin. The principal textual corpora are examined: the Index Thomisticus, Musisque Deoque (texts with variants), Poeti d X  X talia in Lingua Latina, the Corpus Grammaticorum Latinorum, the CETEDOC Library of Latin Texts, etc. The author stresses the importance of annotated corpora, at different levels of analysis (morphological, syntactic, semantic), because  X  X  X he annotation layer added to a text determines the range of searches possible on it X  X  (p. 21). Four morpho-syntactically annotated corpora are described: the Index Thomisticus Treebank (created by Marco Passarotti at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan), the Latin Dependency Treebank (created by David Bamman and Gregory Crane at the Perseus Project, Medford, MA), the PROIEL Project Treebank (supervised by Dag Haug at Oslo University) and the CoLaMer Treebank (under development at the Universities of Ko  X  ln and Regensburg). Finally a lexico-semantic resource, Latin WordNet (developed by Stefano Minozzi at the University of Verona in collaboration with the Bruno Kessler Foundation), is described.

The third chapter is devoted to outlining the method by which the first valency lexicon for Latin verbs was created. According to the theory of Dependency Grammars (which constitutes the theoretical framework followed by the author) the valency of a verb is the structure of the arguments required by the verb in a specific sense. The creation of a valency lexicon can be based both on information extracted from dictionaries or data extracted from different corpora, although in the former case it is not possible to answer questions about quantity (the ratio of concurrent phenomena) and diachronic change (the variation of the ratio between concurrent phenomena over the time). Hence, argument patterns are extracted from the available treebanks in order to support the valency of lexicon entries with the evidence of the texts they are based on. As the author claims,  X  X  X he result is a lexical resource available [to study] various aspects of Latin morpho-syntax in a corpus-based fashion; the argument structure of prefixed verbs, Latin word order X  X , etc. (p. 59).

The fourth chapter is devoted to selectional preferences acquired from corpora using the Valency Lexicon and the application of two different methods: a knowledge-based approach, which uses Latin WordNet, and a knowledge-free approach, based on distributional similarity, which in NLP is largely applied to evaluate semantic associations (see Turney and Pantel 2010 ). Selectional prefer-ences are the semantic preferences that a verb has for its arguments. The lexical fillers for the arguments (i.e. the lemmas of the actual words representing the arguments) are extracted from a treebank. For example, a transitive verb such as  X  X  X ibo X  X  (I drink), occurs with lexical fillers such as  X  X  X qua X  X  (water),  X  X  X inum X  X  (wine) or  X  X  X ac X  X  (milk). With the first method mentioned above Latin WordNet was used to shift from the lexical level to the semantic level. In this case semantic preference was defined by the identification of common hypernyms (called semantic properties by the author) related to lexical fillers. If the fillers of  X  X  X ibo X  X  are merged with the fillers of one of its synonyms,  X  X  X aurio X  X , it is simple to find a hypernym common to the majority of the fillers, which expresses the concept of drinkable substance and is associated to the following list of Latin synonyms:  X  X  X oculum X  X ,  X  X  X otio X  X ,  X  X  X otus X  X ,  X  X  X ucus X  X . Data related to verbs are grouped into frames and constructions, where a frame is  X  X  X  collection of syntactic and semantic features, such as the number of verbal arguments, the valency pattern, and the semantic properties of each argument X  X  (p. 69), while a construction is  X  X  X  collection of frames probabilistically sharing some syntactic and semantic features X  X  (p. 69). According to the second method, semantic affinities are extracted from textual corpora. The distributional approach is based on the hypothesis that semantically similar words tend to co-occur in similar contexts. In order to evaluate the two methods, calibration and the discrimination measures of the system are computed. The calibration measure is the capacity of the system to distinguish high and low probabilities for entities to be good fillers in a particular argument position, and the discrimination measure is the capacity to estimate the selectional preference probability of each single noun (see p. 83). The tests performed by McGillivray demonstrate that the knowledge-based approach offers better performance than the knowledge-free approach, even if the two methods could be combined.
 The fifth chapter constitutes a closer look at automatic selectional preferences for Latin and provides technical details about the model and the statistical methods adopted. The first part of the chapter describes the structure of Latin WordNet and presents a few complete examples under the magnifying glass. All the synsets (i.e. the sets of synonyms) and their related semantic properties (i.e. the terms belonging to the hypernymic hierarchy) in which  X  X  X omo X  X  (man),  X  X  X undus X  X  (globe) and  X  X  X erra X  X  (earth) occur are listed in order to clarify for the reader how semantic properties are extracted from Latin WordNet. The second part is devoted to the theory of word spaces (see Baroni and Lenci 2009 ), how to calculate the similarity distance between words and how to cluster similar words. The purpose is to present mathematical and statistical concepts and formulae in a way that is accessible to non-experts. Step by step, the author shows how to create a contingency table of observations and variables in the domain of Latin linguistics, how to express the semantic similarity between words through the cosine distance between vectors in a lexical vector space, and finally how to visualize the dendrograms that represent the hierarchical clusters of similar terms. The third part explains the formulae for the probabilistic model and the formulae for the evaluation of the system. The concept of conditional probability is introduced and the Bayes X  theorem is illustrated and exemplified. Given the theoretical instruments, the author demonstrates how the selectional preferences can be expressed as probability distributions. Finally, formulae for the evaluation of the system are explained in detail.

The sixth chapter is devoted to a corpus-based investigation of Latin spatial preverbs (i.e. prefixes of the verbal stem related to motion). The main aim of the author here is methodological, namely to show the potential of this new investigative paradigm for the analysis of historical linguistic data. Valency lexicon and statistical techniques are used to demonstrate how a quantitative approach can produce valuable results for the study of linguistic variation. A case study concerning the behaviour of prefixed verbs (such as  X  X  X b-eo X  X ) in three datasets constituted by two works by Plautus (Archaic era) manually annotated by McGillivray, the Latin Dependency Treebank (authors of the Classical period ? Jerome: Late era) and the Index Thomisticus Treebank (Middle ages) is presented. The arguments of these verbs can be expressed by a simple NP in agreement or not with the case governed by the preverb (e.g.  X  X  X d-eo X  X  ? NP[acc] vs  X  X  X c-cedo X  X  ? NP[dat]) or by a PP in which the preposition is equal or not to the preverb (e.g.  X  X  X b-eo ab X  X  ? NP vs  X  X  X b-eo ex X  X  ? NP). The phenomena under investigation here relate to the diachronic trend of the distribution of these competitive constructions. Before the explanation of the experimental design applied to the corpus, the author provides a survey of the scientific literature on this topic and discusses the main hypotheses related to the origin and evolution of the preverbs. In particular, the author is interested in verifying two hypotheses: the first one, that the construction with an NP in agreement with the case governed by the preverb is significantly more frequent in archaic poetical works than in the prose works of later ages; the second one, that the frequency of this construction, with respect to the construction with a PP tends to decrease with time. Previous studies on Latin preverbs follow an example-based approach, which can be biased by the researcher X  X  point of view, whereas McGillivray proposes a data-driven approach, which is neutral and reveals not only the presence of the phenomenon, but also the size of the phenomenon. McGillivray applies the Chi square test to reject the hypothesis of independence between  X  X  X onstruction X  X  and  X  X  X uthor X  X , and she applies linear regression models to explore the correlation between construction and more than one independent variables (e.g.  X  X  X onstruction X  X  and both  X  X  X uthor X  X  and  X  X  X reverb X  X ). The author has found partial evidence for  X  X  X he increasing prevalence of prepositional constructions to express spatial complements of [prefixed verbs] X  X  (p. 177) and she points out how it is not only the case that known facts explored in the literature with an example-driven approach can be corroborated by corpus-based studies, but also how quantitative evidence supports new specific results. For instance, the multivariate techniques provide evidence for the claim that Late era authors of the analyzed corpus prefer different prepositions as opposed to the preverb of the prefixed verbs.
The seventh chapter provides a statistical background to the investigation on preverbs. Like the fifth chapter, it separates technical details from the narrative of the experimental framework and, also in this case, it is intended for a non-expert audience. Three techniques are explored. Firstly, the Pearson X  X  Chi square test of independence is introduced; it is one of the most diffuse tests in the field of digital humanities and computer assisted classical studies. Secondly, linear regression models are illustrated and exemplified on the treebank data. Correspondence analysis and multiple correspondence analysis close the description of the advanced techniques.

The last chapter contains the conclusions and summarizes the main achievements of the book. The author stresses the fact that the application of quantitative methods is the basis for systematic and replicable investigations. The phase of collecting the data to build a corpus, the phase of analysis by annotation and the phase of interpretation by quantitative studies are not only separate but they can be performed by independent teams, in order to supplement the resources and provide both analyses and interpretations as new resources within an incremental process. From the author X  X  perspective, Historical Linguistics and Computational Linguistics should strengthen their synergy and then widen it to other disciplines.

In this reviewer X  X  opinion, one further interesting direction of research could involve taking a philological approach to the texts contained in the corpora under observation by utilizing the methods offered by Computational Philology. Historical Linguists work with texts, but any texts digitized in corpora and annotated in treebanks will be affected by the choices of the editors of the critical editions from which those texts are extracted and by the interpretations of the annotators who analyze the texts (morpho-syntactically, semantically, metrically, etc.). Some phenomena, like the diachronic trends in the distribution of preferred constructions, may be significantly affected by the biases of these editors and annotators. For instance, the quantitative study of short term word repetitions may be affected by the bias that editors had against these kinds of repetitions in the past, which they often interpreted as copyist errors and which were consequently substituted with conjectural reconstructions. An editorial choice or a biased annotation at any level of analysis can shadow or discard a relevant phenomenon. For this reason corpora studied with quantitative methods should be enriched with variants, conjectures and multiple interpretations.
