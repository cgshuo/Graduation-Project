 Since the 1989 workshop on kno wledge disco very in databases, the eld has seen sustained gro wth and interest and has attained signi can t maturit y. The main objectiv es of this panel will be to re ect on the successes and failures in the eld of data mining over the last eigh teen years and to exam-ine what insigh ts we can tak e with us as we move forw ard. Categories and Sub ject Descriptors: H.2.8 Database Managemen t: Database Applications -Data Mining General Terms: Algorithms, Measuremen t, Theory Keyw ords: Applications and Implemen tations, Failures and Mistak es, Future Outlo ok, Success Stories
Over the last eigh teen years, the eld of kno wledge dis-covery and data mining has matured considerably . Although the eld has evolved as a result of synergistic co-op eration among researc hers in databases, arti cial intelligence, statis-tics and systems, it has main tained its own iden tity. From a single workshop in 1989, the eld can now lay claim to at least 5 ma jor conferences and numerous symp osium dev oted to its cen tral theme.

At an abstract level, the theme of the eld is concerned with extracting actionable and interpr etable know ledge from data in as ecient a manner as possible. The primary pur-pose of this panel, in the con text of this underlying theme, is to consider the follo wing questions. What have been the ma jor successes and breakthroughs that we as a eld can point to with pride? What have been the critical mistak es or mis-steps that have been tak en along the way? And -nally , what can we hop e to learn from both our successes and mistak es and how can this kno wledge be used to determine how to focus our e orts in the future?
The panelists will be ask ed to examine and re ect on the above questions along multiple dimensions.
 Related issues suc h as the imp ortance of repro ducibilit y of results and availabilit y of suitable benc hmarks, education of data mining graduate studen ts and their readiness for an industrial setting are also fair game for discussion. Suc cess is the result of perfe ction, hard work, learning from failur e, loyalty and persistenc e. { Colin Powell .
This asp ect of the panel discussion will seek to examine the signi can t foundational, practical, and organizational, success stories in the eld over the last eigh teen years. A basic question here is what have been the signi can t founda-tional successes? The goal is to re ect on algorithmic success stories, whic h are ably bac ked by theoretical and empirical evidence. For example, the entire sub-eld of asso ciation rule mining came to the fore about 15 years ago and has since spa wned a proli c follo wing that has since div ersi ed to more generic frequen t pattern (e.g. trees, graphs) mining algorithms. Imp ortan t adv ances have been made in areas suc h as supp ort vector mac hines, ensem ble learning, scal-able clustering, mining on data streams, time-series analysis and mining with tensors. Algorithms like PageRank[4] have simply rev olutionized the way we think about web searc h. All of these, and this is by no means a comprehensiv e list, corresp ond to signi can t foundational success stories.
A related question is where have data mining and kno wl-edge disco very algorithms played an imp ortan t role in an applied setting? Similarly , what approac hes have resulted in imp ortan t impro vemen ts for business and nancial oper-ations, breakthrough scien ti c disco veries and general ben-e ts to mankind? Examples abound and include the use of data mining technologies to detect fraudulen t and money laundering activities, the abilit y to pro cess terab ytes of im-age data from the Sky Surv ey database to detect and char-acterize fuzzy elemen ts in the sky , the abilit y to detect early onset of diseases and predicting their progression to enable better disease-con trol measures, and the abilit y to predict the ecacy and poten tial toxicit y of drugs to enable more informed drug design.

Another relev ant question in this con text is to ask how successful have we been in the con text of educating our grad-uate studen ts and preparing them for data mining careers in industry , governmen t and academia? Have we been more successful in preparing them for academia versus industry and moreo ver is this really a trend speci c to data mining? Similarly , what are the elemen ts, in particular, that con-tributed to the success of conferences in the eld and how can we ensure that the interest is sustained? Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising every time we fall { Confucius
Over the last eigh teen years, while there have clearly been successful deplo ymen t of kno wledge disco very and data min-ing solutions, there have also undoubtedly been mistak es and failures. This asp ect of the panel discussion will examine the low-ligh ts { imp ortan t mistak es and failures { with the end goal of trying to learn from them.

A topic worth re ecting on, in this con text, is whether there has been a failur e to progress in line with expecta-tions in various sub-elds of KDD? For example in a re-cen t article, Hand suggests that recen t progress in classi-cation technology is perhaps at best an illusion [1]. As a coun ter-p oint, Friedman suggests that initial progress in any new eld is usually substan tial (pic king on the low hanging fruit) whereas subsequen t progress, while very imp ortan t, inevitably happ ens at a much slower rate[2].

A related theme would be to examine the above question in the con text of end application driv ers. For example, in business applications, the pro t margin is often the bottom line. While a more accurate data mining mo del may yield better pro ts, the cost of training personnel to adapt and use the mo del may be quite exp ensiv e suggesting a prefer-ence for the simpler mo del in terms of overall pro t margin. A similar set of problems hold in the biomedical con text { a practicing clinician often prefers an easily interpretable mo del for disease diagnosis over a sligh tly more accurate blac k box mo deling tool. Are these instances examples of successes or failures? Similarly , a tool that outputs 100,000 patterns (poten tial hypothesis) that bear further exp erimen-tal validation is not very useful by itself to an exp erimen tal biologist, since the exp erimen tal validation of even 10 of those patterns may consume the better part of their career!
Another topic of interest here is to highligh t some of the classic mistakes made in the eld[3]. Topics of interest here could range from the use of non-represen tativ e training data to the ignorance of population drift when mo deling time-varying data, from not accoun ting for errors in data or la-bels in the mo del to an over reliance on a single technique for the task on hand and from asking the wrong question in the con text of the application driv er to sampling with-out care. A related topic here migh t be to think about the role of benc hmark datasets and algorithms, and re ect on the general imp ortance and requiremen t for rep eatable and repro ducible results.
Each success only buys an admission ticket to a mor e dif-cult problem. { Henry Kissinger.

Early success in any new eld typically point to the pluc k-ing of low-hanging fruit. Follo wing up on success, early or late, is inevitably harder. How then can we build on our successes of the last eigh teen years as we tackle new and exciting problems over the next eigh teen? What are the im-portan t problems brough t to ligh t as a result of our past successes? Failur e is success if we learn from it { Malcolm Forb es.
This section of the panel will also include a discussion on insigh ts gleaned from failures of the past. In other words what can we learn from our mistak es and failures? Mo ving forw ard what errors and mishaps can we avoid and how can we ensure that suc h failures do not recur?
As part of this section of the discussion, panelists will be ask ed to iden tify and suggest topics or areas of researc h that in their opinion are worth pursuing. Similarly they may also re ect on topics they consider solv ed or are best left alone, i.e., not that imp ortan t in their opinion. Panelists will also be ask ed to iden tify emerging technologies in hardw are (e.g. multicore pro cessors) and soft ware as well as emerging application areas, that they feel are particularly imp ortan t and are likely to have an impact on the eld as we move forw ard.
The terms "success" and "failure" often con vey fuzzy se-man tics that are open to interpretation. As part of the dis-cussion, it is exp ected that panelists will o er their though ts on the aforemen tioned questions while de ning their inter-pretation of these terms in the con text of particular domains. After an initial round of discussions by the panelists, the oor will then be opened to an interactiv e session with the audience. Finally , panelists will be ask ed to conclude their presen tations with their outlo ok on how one can learn from the successes and failures of the past 15+ years and what in their opinion are the critical opp ortunities for the eld in the future.
