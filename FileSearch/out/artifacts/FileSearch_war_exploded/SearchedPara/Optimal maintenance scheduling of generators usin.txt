 Y. Yare, G.K. Venayagamoorthy n 1. Introduction
Maintenance scheduling of generating units is an important task in power system and plays important role in the operation and planning activities of the electric power utility. The scheduling problems in the presence of system complexity at different time-scales, different order of uncertainties and pro-blems dimensionality is required for the efficient economic operation of the utility system.

Power system equipment are made to remain in good operating conditions by regular preventive maintenance. The task of generator maintenance is often performed manually by human experts who generate the schedule based on their experience and knowledge of the system, and in such cases there is no guarantee maintenance scheduling is to find the sequence of scheduled outages of generating units over a given period of time such that important mainly because other planning activities are directly affected by such decisions. Modern power systems have witnessed increased demand for electrical energy with a related solving power system optimization problems, such as GMS, unit commitment and economic dispatch problems. The multi-species particle swarm optimizer presented in Iwamatsu (2006 ) extends the original PSO by dividing the particle swarm spatially into a multiple cluster called a species in a multi-dimensional search space. Each species explores a different area of the search space can be used to locate all the global minima of multi-modal into a set of interacting swarms ( Blackwell and Branke, 2006 ).
These swarms interact locally by an exclusion parameter and globally through a new anti-convergence operator ( Blackwell and
Branke, 2006 ). Cooperative particle swarm optimizer is presented in Van den Bergh and Engelbrecht (2004) where cooperative behavior is used to significantly improve the performance of the original PSO algorithm, achieved by using multiple swarms to optimize different components of the solution vector coopera-tively. Three sub-swarm discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented in Xu et al. (2006) , where particles are divided into three sub-swarms. One sub-swarm flies toward global best position, the second sub-swarm flies in the opposite direction, while the third sub-swarm flies randomly around the appropriate number of swarms as required to support conver-gence and diversity criteria among the swarms is presented in Yen and Leong (2009) . The multiple swarms in Yen and Leong (2009) are encouraged to explore different regions, and their collective efforts and knowledge are shared among the swarms, thus the diversity is preserved. PSO approaches based on some form of implicit or explicit grouping of particles into sub-swarms is presented in Engelbrecht (2005) . Two main approaches of sub-swarms PSO algorithms in Engelbrecht (2005) are the cooperative and competitive PSO algorithms. The cooperative PSO algorithm has some form of cooperation existing between sub-swarms.

The performance of the MS-MDPSO algorithm is illustrated and compared with the MDPSO ( Yare et al., 2008 ) algorithm for solving the GMS problem of the two practical power systems.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The mathematical the concept of the multiple swarms-MDPSO algorithm. Implementation of MS-MDPSO for GMS and typical results are presented in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 5. 2. Problem formulation
The purpose of maintenance operation is to extend equipment may be costly. It is expected that effective maintenance policies can reduce the frequency of service interruptions and the many undesirable consequences of such interruptions. Maintenance done, this may result in an excessive number of costly failures and poor system performance, and hence reliability is degraded, when done too often, reliability may improve but the cost of maintenance will sharply increase. In a cost-effective scheme, reliability and cost of maintenance must be balanced.
Suppose T i C T is the set of periods when maintenance of unit i may start, T i  X f t A T : e i r t r l i D i  X  1 g for each i . Define X  X  t , S allowed to be in maintenance in period t , I t  X f i : t A T i g .
The two main categories of objective functions in solving GMS problem are based on reliability and economic cost ( Dahal and Chakpitak, 2007; Yare et al., 2008; Dahal et al., 2000; Wang and McDonald, 1994). The reliability criterion of optimizing genera-solving the GMS problem in this paper. The net reserve of the system during any period t is the total installed capacity from all generating units P i A I the pre-scheduled outages as a result of planned generator maintenance P i A I for that maintenance period ( L t ). Hence the component
P in time period t . Minimizing the sum of the squares of the reserves over the entire operational planning period enhances reduction in large variations of reserve and better long-term reserve capacity planning in the presence of unit maintenance. Therefore, the objective function to be minimized can be expressed by Min
The objective function in (2) is minimized subject to the following unit and system constraints given by (3), (4) and (5). according to (9):

A mutation operator is introduced into the DPSO algorithm according to (10). Supposing P gd is the particle chosen with a random number less than a predefined mutation rate (for 0 o mutation rate o 0.3), then the mutation equation is given by
P  X  P gd  X  X  randn  X  X  P gd = 2  X  X  10  X  d  X  1, 2, y , N is the problem dimension. 3.2. MS-MDPSO
The concept of multiple swarms with modified discrete particle swarm optimization (MDPSO) to explore the problem time k by P P where m 1  X  m 2  X  ?  X  m j  X  ?  X  m n  X  m for this study .
The MDPSO velocity and position update equations given by (7) and (8), respectively are modified and used in the MS-MDPSO n multiple swarms as shown in V  X  k  X  X  round  X  w iner V jld  X  k 1  X  X  c 1 rand 1  X  P jlbd  X  k 1  X  X  X  k  X  X  X jld  X  k 1  X  X  V jld  X  k  X  X  13  X 
With w  X  0.8, c 1  X  2 and c 2  X  2, the particles have good global searching abilities and converge to the global optimal position.
For mutation rate that lies within the range (0 o M r o 0.3), the mutation equation of the chosen particle is modified from (10) and given by If rand o M r P else P jgd  X  k 1  X  X  P jgd  X  k 1  X  X  15  X  endwhere b gb can be either dynamically changing or fixed, and controls the mutation process. The mutation operation increases the diversity of the population by preventing the particles from moving too close to each other, thus converging prematurely to local optima. 4. Implementation of MS-MDPSO for GMS and results
Two cases studies are presented in this section to demonstrate the application and performance of the MS-MDPSO algorithm compared with MDPSO algorithm for solving the GMS problem of two practical power systems. 4.1. GMS implementation with MS-MDPSO
The global best solution is the evolved single best solution from a set of n global best solutions of the n multiple swarms. The performances of the n global best solutions are measured by comparing their fitness evaluations against each other. The resultant solution with the best fitness emerges as the single global best solution of the n multiple swarms. The global best solution is then used to generate the optimal maintenance i, and when applied to (3) and (5) it produces the optimal available generation from all running units during maintenance and crew requirement for generators undergoing maintenance, respectively, over a maintenance period of 52 weeks. 4.2. 21-Unit test system
A test system comprising twenty one generating units ( Dahal and Chakpitak, 2007, Yamayee and Sidenblad, 1983; Yare et al., 2008; Dahal et al., 2000; Wang and McDonald, 1994 ) with installed capacity, units X  maintenance duration (weeks) and anticipated manpower requirement over a maintenance planning period of 52 weeks is used to demonstrate the performance of the function is preferable for better economic benefit, and is also a guarantee for more effective maintenance schedules produced by the MS-MDPSO algorithm.

Table 2 presents the statistical comparison of convergence of the objective function for the 21-unit test system using the
MDPSO and MS-MDPSO algorithms, obtained after 100 iterations of 5000 trials. The table shows optimal numerical values of the objective function produced by MDPSO and MS-MDPSO to be 13,863,021.02 and 13,749,264.32, respectively, representing 113,756.70 (0.82%) reduction. This indicates improvement in minimizing the objective function given by (2) using MS-MDPSO compared with MDPSO algorithm, especially in cases with large variations of system net reserve. It also represents improvement in the quality of maintenance schedules generated by the MS-MDPSO algorithm compared with the MDPSO algorithm.
The statistical results presented in Table 2 for the 21-unit test system shows, generally, that the MS-MDPSO algorithm produced better maintenance schedules compared with the MDPSO algorithm for the same GMS problem.

Table 3 and Fig. 2 (d) X (f) further illustrates the design and application of MS-MDPSO algorithm for solving the GMS problem by presenting typical evolution of single global best solution gbest 3 , gbest 4 and gbest 5 ) obtained from five multiple swarms 4500 5000 5500 6000 Available Generation (MW) 1.35 1.45 1.55 Objective function station are steam turbines (STs). Also the four thermal plants utilize natural gas supplied from the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) as their raw material input. The three hydrostations (Hs) namely JEBBA, KAINJI and SHIRORO are located in Northwestern Nigeria. Well over two decades of operational experience and available historical data on hydrological conditions reveal that inflow The maintenance window and sequence constraints of the three namely, case a: MDPSO-a and MS-MDPSO-a and case b: MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b described below. 4.3.1. Case a: MDPSO-a and MS-MDPSO-a
The operational data for the Nigerian grid system used to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed MS-MDPSO algorithm and compared with MDPSO algorithm is shown in Table 4 . The 49 generating units of the Nigerian data
Gbest=[gbest gbest gbest gbest gbest ] can be scheduled for maintenance during low water level corresponding to the months of May X  X ctober, the thermal plants supports the hydrogeneration within these periods and should therefore not be scheduled for shutdown maintenance. 5% increased load variation is allowed during the hot season of March to July each operational year. 4.3.2. Case b: MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b
The economic implication in terms of reduced energy cost and increased reliability is enhanced by a logical and appropriate combination of thermal and hydroplants for maintenance within the period of low water level from May to October. These are investigated in this case study. Only five of the thermal plants, namely AFAMG 19, AFAMG 20, EGBINST 1, EGBINST 2 and SAPELEST 6 are allowed to be scheduled for maintenance along
Table 5 . The suppressed loads can be catered for by purchase of additional energy from IPPs, or other sources. The annual base case generation for Nigeria cannot meet the annual load demand due to inadequate generation from some generating units. These and are represented with a zero generation as shown in Table 4 . maintenance planning period of 52 weeks. Table 5 shows 94.35% and 94.30% increases in suppressed loads due to scheduled maintenance planning using MDPSO-a and MS-MDPSO-a, respectively. These translates to 13,524,336,000.00 and 13,517,280,000.00 Naira/year as costs of purchasing additional energy from IPPs to supplement and meet the rising energy demand occasioned by the increases in suppressed loads due to scheduled maintenance. Table 5 shows that case MS-MDPSO-a produces a 0.05% reduction in suppressed load increase compared to case MDPSO-an under scheduled shutdown maintenance.
Similarly, Table 5 also shows 94.32% and 94.27% increases in suppressed load occasioned by scheduled maintenance planning using MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b, respectively. These infer 13,520,304,000.00 and 13,513,248,000.00 Naira/year as costs of 2800 3000 3200 3400 3600 3800 4000 Available Generation (MW) Crew maintenance period, which is interpreted as resulting to an unpredictable energy profile which causes large and sudden variations in loads requiring shedding. Cases MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b however, generate evenly distributed generation throughout the year under maintenance, with an average generation and standard deviation of 3130.557 7 79.781 MW and Reliability Index Cost (Naira) MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b, respectively. Case b: MDPSO-b and
MS-MDPSO-b scheduling generate more even crew distribution over the maintenance period compared with case a: MDPSO-a and MS-
MDPSO-a. Both cases however satisfied the crew constraint placed at 30. Cases MDPSO-a and MS-MDPSO-a have an average crew requirement and standard deviation of 12 7 5.438 and 12 7 4.769, respectively, while cases MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b require 12 7 3.658 and 12 7 3.567, respectively.
 case a: MDPSO-a and MS-MDPSO-a and case b: MDPSO-b and
MS-MDPSO-b without maintenance and with scheduled shutdown maintenance. The RI is computed by taking the minimum of the 3.28 3.3 3.32 3.34 3.36 3.38 3.4 3.42 Objective function for cases MDPSO-a, MS-MDPSO-a, MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b, a. These numerical RIs suggest that the Nigerian power system is MS-MDPSO algorithm compared with MDPSO algorithm. It also imply enhanced capability of long-term predictability of generation and manpower/crew requirement needed for maintenance over the entire maintenance horizon using MS-MDPSO algorithm compared with MDPSO algorithm.

Fig. 5 (a) and (b) shows the plots of RIs versus iterations for case a: MDPSO-a and MS-MDPSO-a, and case b: MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b, respectively, during shutdown maintenance period, compared against the maximum RI of 0.89 representing a case without any ongoing maintenance work taking place over a period of 52 weeks. The plots show that case MS-MDPSO-b generate the best RI of 0.772 while case MDPSO-a produce the worst RI of 0.752 after 100 iterations of 5000 trials. versus the RI for case a: MDPSO-a and MS-MDPSO-a, and case b: MDPSO-b and MS-MDPSO-b, respectively. It can be seen from the figure that at any RI, the corresponding energy cost for case MS-MDPSO-a is lower compared with case MDPSO-a, and similarly case MS-MDPSO-b produce lower energy cost to be purchased compared with case MDPSO-b. On the overall, at any energy cost case MS-MDPSO -b gives the best RI compared with either MDPSO-b, MS-MDPSO-a or MDPSO-a. Without maintenance for the two cases, there is 14,333,760,000.00 Naira to be spent on remains at 0.89 with zero cost with no purchase of energy as shown in Table 6 . In the absence of any ongoing maintenance work, the system has higher RI than the two cases considered during scheduled shutdown maintenance, and there may not be need to spend financial resources on energy purchases as a consequence of maintenance actions.
