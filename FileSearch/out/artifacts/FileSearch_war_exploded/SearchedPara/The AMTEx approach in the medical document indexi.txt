The availability of large medical online collections, such as MEDLINE [1], poses new challenges to information and knowl-edge management. MEDLINE constitutes the primary medical repository of the US National Library of Medicine, including ical information, requiring efficient management and retrieval. MEDLINE documents are currently indexed by human ex-perts, based on a controlled list of indexing terms, deriving from a subset of the UMLS Metathesaurus [2], the MeSH
Thesaurus [3]. The automatic mapping of biomedical documents to UMLS term concepts has been undertaken by the US Na-tional Library of Medicine with the development of MMTx [4].

MMTx was originally developed to improve retrieval of bibliographic material, such as MEDLINE citations [5]. Its appli-cations also include semi-automatic and fully automatic indexing, hierarchical indexing and text mining for various medical and biological concept and relation extraction [5]. The limitations of MMTx in term extraction and in the UMLS Metathesau-in a pilot study of MMTx and AMTEx on a small MEDLINE corpus showed that MMTx performance was low in precision and that its output greatly suffers by over-generating terms, which diffuse the document concept leading to inaccurate indexing of MEDLINE documents [8,9]. This reflects a design choice in MMTx, which attempts to favour recall by not focusing on
MeSH, whereupon MEDLINE indexing has been based, and by incorporating a variant generation process which leads to term over-generation.
 In this article, we briefly review the MMTx approach and we present our alternative method, the Automatic MeSH
Term Extraction method (AMTEx). AMTEx aims at improving the efficiency of automatic term extraction, using a hybrid and accuracy in indexing and retrieval of MEDLINE documents, based on the extraction and mapping of document terms to the MeSH Thesaurus, rather than the full UMLS Metathesaurus mapping of MMTx.
 extraction of medical terminology for indexing purposes. Subsequently, we present the MMTx resources and processes in more detail, and the resources used in the AMTEx approach, namely the MeSH Thesaurus and the C / NC -value method for term extraction. Then, the AMTEx approach is presented and, finally, our experiments and results evaluation. We conclude with a discussion on our results and future work. 2. Term extraction
Term extraction aims at the identification of linguistic expressions denoting specialised concepts, namely domain or sci-of information management applications, because these linguistic expressions are bound to convey the principal informa-tional content of a document. In early approaches, terms have been sought for indexing purposes, using mostly tf idf counts niques may also be applied to measure the degree of unithood or termhood of the candidate multi-word terms (e.g. [16]).
Later and current approaches tend to follow a hybrid approach combining both statistical and linguistic techniques (e.g. [10,17,18] ).

The extraction of terms for the medical, biological and biomedical domain has greatly motivated research for both index-traditional technique for automatic indexing has been the tf idf method [12]. In traditional indexing techniques, document representations ignore multi-word and compound terms, which may perform quite efficiently split into isolated single-word index terms. However, compound and multi-word terms are very common in the biomedical domain [17] and are often used in indexing medical documents. Multi-word terms carry important classificatory content information, since they comprise of purposes shows that multi-word term methods may complement other methods to improve results. Currently machine learning techniques are also applied for indexing, such as the Na X ve Bayes learning model implemented in the KEA (Auto-matic Keyphrase Extraction, [23]). Comparative experiments of tf idf , KEA and the C / NC -value term extraction methods using the extracted terms. 3. Background 3.1. The MMTx approach and resources
The MMTx approach uses the UMLS Metathesaurus  X  and the UMLS SPECIALIST TM lexicon as its lexicographic resources. In ent an outline of the MMTx approach. 3.1.1. The UMLS medical knowledge resource
The Unified Medical Language System ( UMLS ) is a source of medical knowledge developed and maintained by the US Na-tional Library of Medicine. UMLS consists of the Metathesaurus, the Semantic Network and the SPECIALIST lexicon. an abstract representation of the term phrases which are considered as synonymous in the medical domain. Thus, each con-guages. However, the terms integrated in the Metathesaurus do not all share a common structure, i.e. same properties and types of relationships, including synonymy and hierarchical relationships, are not defined. Thus, the Metathesaurus on its own does not have a hierarchical structure, neither fulfils ontological requirements.

The Semantic Network consists of 134 semantic types categorising the Metathesaurus concepts. The purpose of the Seman-(treatment for diseases). The Semantic Network may be viewed as an upper level ontology of the biomedical domain. In this by concepts related by an IS-A relationship). Thus, the Semantic Network of UMLS provides a basis for an ontology of the biomedical domain. Nevertheless, the Semantic Network was not originally designed as an ontology. Problems inherent in the design of the Semantic Network include, among others, circular hierarchical relationships, inconsistencies in the categorisation of concepts and discrepancies between the semantic structure of the Metathesaurus and the Semantic Net-work. Moreover, the lack of relationships between concepts in the Metathesaurus and the Semantic Network has been also observed.

Finally, the SPECIALIST lexicon is intended to be a general English lexicon which includes many medical and biomedical terms. The lexicon entry for each word or term records the syntactic, morphological and orthographic information of the respective lemma. 3.1.2. The MMTx approach process maps arbitrary text to Metathesaurus term concepts and works in the following steps [5]: 3.1.2.1 Parsing . The document text is parsed, using the Xerox part-of-speech tagger and the SPECIALIST minimal commitment the head and modifier components of the phrase. For example, the term  X  X  ocular complications  X  is analysed as: where complications is the head, namely the term that is being modified/specialised and ocular is the modifier, namely the concept specialising the term complications . using the SPECIALIST lexicon and a supplementary database of synonyms. At this stage, please note that, although we have
Finally, inflectional and spelling variants are generated based on all word-forms found in the previous processes. generation process [27]. The mapping process may vary [5]. We may have: simple match , where, for example,  X  X  intensive care unit  X  maps to  X  X  Intensive Care Units  X ; complex match , where  X  X  intensive care medicine  X  maps to  X  X  Intensive Care and Medicine  X ; partial match-gapped , where  X  X  ambulatory monitoring  X  maps to  X  X  Ambulatory Cardiac Monitoring  X ; Application  X .

The normal partial match is assumed as a good matching for correctness, where at least one word of either the noun to  X  X  Thermography  X , where the mapping does not involve  X  X  liquid crystal  X ). 3.1.2.4. Candidate evaluation. The candidate set of Metathesaurus mappings is evaluated. The evaluation process computes the mapping strength between the candidate Metathesaurus string and the text string. The mapping strength weight is cal-culated by a linguistically principled function consisting of a weighted average of four criteria [28]: (ii) Variation is the distance score between the phrase and its variants (this is computed during variant generation). (iii) Coverage denotes the length of the text phrase and the Metathesaurus candidate string participating in the match. (iv) Cohesiveness is similar to coverage and denotes the non-intermittent words of the text phrase and the Metathesaurus
The weight for the last two criteria, coverage and cohesiveness, is doubled in the scoring function and their measures are normalised to a value between 0 and 1000. 3.2. The AMTEx method resources 3.2.1. The C/NC-value method for term extraction
The C / NC -value method [10] is a hybrid method for term extraction. C / NC -value is domain-independent and combines didate term phrases. The three filters available are: is then filtered through a stoplist.

The statistical part defining the termhood of the candidate phrases aims to get more accurate terms than those obtained by the pure frequency of occurrence method, especially terms that may appear as nested within longer terms, such as the the frequency of occurrence of this sequence as part of larger proposed terms in the same text. Depending on whether the term is nested or not C -value is defined as:
In the above, the first C -value measurement is for non-nested terms and the second for nested terms, where a denotes the term in the corpus (both as an independent term and as a nested term within larger terms), T with decreasing term likelihood. The NC -value takes into account the context of each term and assigns weights to specific verbs, adjectives and nouns that appear in candidate term context. The weight factor of a context word w is higher for the respective words that tend to appear with terms and is computed as Here, a is the proposed term, C-value(a ) is calculated as shown in (Eq. (1)), and CF ( a ) is computed as where C a is the set of context words of term a , w is a context word in C quency as context word of a .

C / NC -value has been successfully tested in various domains, such as molecular biology (nuclear receptors [29]), eye pathology medical records [10], biomedical business newswire texts [21] and computer science papers [22]. 3.2.2. The MeSH Thesaurus
The MeSH Thesaurus (Medical Subject Headings) is a taxonomy of medical and biological terms and concepts suggested by the U.S National Library of Medicine. The MeSH terms are organized in IS-A hierarchies, where more general terms, such nomies, including more than 22,000 terms. A term may appear in more than one taxonomy. Each MeSH term is described by several properties, the most important being: 1. MeSH Heading (MH) : the term name or identifier. 2. Scope Note (SN) : a text description of the term. 3. Entry Terms (ET) : mostly synonym terms to the MH.

Entry Terms ( ET ) also include stemmed MH terms and are sometimes referred to as quasi-synonyms (they are not always exact synonyms). In our AMTEx approach, all ET terms are treated as synonyms. Each MeSH term is also characterised by its
MeSH tree number (or code name), indicating the exact position of the term in the MeSH tree taxonomy, for example 4. The AMTEx method Based on the study of the MMTx algorithm and resources, we observe the following:
During the variant generation stage, the iterative expansion of the initial text phrase to all possible variants is quite exhaustive. MMTx extracts term variants, not only based on the terms found in the original text phrase, but also from their variant terms. This is due to an obvious attempt to increase recall of Metathesaurus mappings, a known limitation of
MMTx as discussed in [7]. However, this process also results in term over-generation and increased term ambiguity, which diffuse the original term concept, leading to inaccurate indexing.

MMTx extracts general Metathesaurus terms, not MeSH terms. Although MMTx was originally developed to improve retrieval of bibliographic material, such as MEDLINE citations [5], MMTx mappings were not based on the MeSH Thesau-rus, which contains the controlled list of MEDLINE indexing terms. This design option broadens the application domain of MMTx, but it also affects its accuracy in the MEDLINE indexing task, as shown in our experiments in Section 5.
Term selection is based on a scoring function, for evaluating the importance of all candidate terms, using the SPECIALIST such as the centrality criterion, it is arbitrarily and empirically defined, making it possible for unrelated terms to be into consideration nested terms and term context words. Additionally, C / NC -value has been proven to extract up to 98% of correct terms [29,10,21,22] in various application domains. Finally, WordNet and MeSH can be used as additional lexical resources, if needed, for both general and medical terms.

Based on the above observations we propose two basic changes towards the development of an improved term extraction method that could substitute MMTx: (i) Term extraction based on a well-established method, the C / NC -value method. (ii) Use of MeSH Thesaurus as lexical resource, both for (limited) term variant retrieval, and candidate term mapping. 4.1. The AMTEx algorithm
An outline of the AMTEx procedure is illustrated in Table 1 . In particular, the AMTEx method has the following processing stages: 1. Multi-word Term Extraction: The C / NC -value method is used for term extraction. This method is domain-independent, does not require any lexical resources and has been proven to be particularly effective in multi-word and nested term extraction both in medical and general document collections. During term extraction in AMTEx the document text is annotated for part-of-speech, using the C / NC -value implementation part-of-speech tagger and linguistic filters. didate term list is ranked by decreasing term likelihood (Eq. (3)). Top ranked terms are more important than terms ranked lower in the list and are more likely to be included in the final list of extracted terms. 3. Term Mapping: Candidate terms are mapped to terms of the MeSH Thesaurus (by applying simple string matching). The list of terms now contains only MeSH terms. 4. Single-word Term Extraction: For the multi-word terms which do not fully match MeSH, their single-word constituents are used for matching. If mapped to a single-word MeSH term, this is also added to the candidate term list, retaining its ori-ginal C / NC ranking value. 5. Term Variants: Term variants are included in the candidate term list. The C / NC -value implementation in AMTEx includes inflectional variants of the extracted terms. Also, MeSH itself can be used for locating variant terms, based on the MeSH term, Entry Terms property. However, only the stemmed term-forms are used in AMTEx since the full list of Entry Terms may contain terms, which often are not synonymous. 6. Term Expansion: The list of terms is augmented with semantically (conceptually) similar terms from MeSH. Fig. 2 illus-trates this process: A term is represented by its MeSH tree hierarchy. The neighbourhood of the term is examined and all terms with similarity greater than threshold T Expansion terms more than one level higher or lower than the original term depending on the value of T
AMTEx in its current state does not include a syntactic parser, such as the SPECIALIST minimal commitment parser used measures, namely the nested term estimations. In AMTEx v2 presented here, the estimated head of a multi-word term is successfully used for the refinement of the Single-word Term Extraction process.

Our approach to Term Variant generation is more limited than MMTx. This constrains our term recall to terms that are outperforms MMTx in suggesting candidate terms. It is also due to the fact the AMTEx approach to variant generation is lim-of the original concept to unrelated concepts.

In Term Expansion , the method used in AMTEx for discovering semantically similar terms, is based on the semantic sim-effective, achieving up to 73% correlation with results obtained by humans [34]. An important observation and a desirable (more general terms). Therefore, expanding with threshold T of the terms in the taxonomy: More specific terms (lower in the taxonomy) are more likely to expand than more general terms (higher in the taxonomy). Fig. 2 illustrates this process for various values of the threshold T
Because no synonymy relation is defined in MeSH, we did not apply expansion to the Entry Terms of terms. Word sense disambiguation [31] can also be applied for detecting the correct sense to expand (here, expansion is applied to the most common sense of each term). 4.2. Refining the AMTEx method
In order to determine the optimal set of indexing terms, namely one increasing recall and precision, there exist three thresholds in the AMTEx process that could be refined: (ii) Term expansion threshold ( T Expansion ), whereupon we have experimented in our pilot small scale experiments with
The optimal value for each of these thresholds is not easy to determine, as each of these affects term recall at different stages of the AMTEx process [8]. A simple approach to this optimisation problem would be to consider only the threshold since an increase in precision for example, simultaneously affects recall. A balanced measure such as an F -measure, where recall and precision are equally weighted (shown on Eq. (5) below), would provide us a better indicator for our final threshold: Thus, in our AMTEx v2, we have chosen to be exhaustive with both T thresholds and use the maximum F -measure to determine the T similar terms ( T Expansion = 0.5) added to the candidate list are assigned a weight, as shown on Eq. (6) below: where a term w , semantically similar to term s , has ranking weight, weight(w ), combining its semantically similar term ranks accordingly terms which are added to it by the Term Expansion process. In AMTEx v1, these terms were merely as-signed the weight(s ) of Eq. (2).

In our pilot experiments with AMTEx v1 [8], in the Single-word Term Extraction step, we were attempting to find partial matches in MeSH, for all word constituents of an unmatched multi-word term. We have observed that single term insertion search for single-word mappings using only the head word of the multi-word term. The experiments presented in Section 5 ing weight for these terms, we consider it equal to its source, i.e. the original multi-word term weight. 5. Experiments and evaluation 5.1. Developing AMTEx v2 5.1.1. Defining T FinalList thresholdforAMTEXv2 In order to determine the T FinalList , we have experimented with a corpus of 5819 full PMC documents selected out of 60 Journals. The documents were selected on the basis of having an UID number, which we used to retrieve their respective
MEDLINE index sets. This index set for each document is manually assigned by MEDLINE experts and is used in our exper-number of retrieved terms, and recall is the percentage of correctly extracted terms compared to the MeSH terms appearing shown on Eq. (5), illustrated above.
In AMTEx v2, as discussed in Section 4.2, we attempted to modify the Single-word Term Extraction process, using only the head term constituent for MeSH mapping. Nevertheless, we needed to ascertain that the Single-word Term Extraction step significantly contributes to AMTEx performance, rather than unnecessarily complicating the AMTEx algorithm. Thus, we con-ducted a second experiment on the same dataset, where the Single-word Term Extraction step was not included in the pro-cess. The comparative results in Fig. 3 shows clearly that Single-word Term Extraction improves AMTEx performance.
The peak of a curve in Fig. 3 indicates the optimal F -measure performance for our corpus. We observe that the optimal F -measure performance is reached before the 20th point of a curve. Thus, in AMTEx v2, the T the list. 5.2. MMTx vs. AMTEx method
In our pilot experiments presented in [8], we have compared our first AMTEx version performance to MMTx, which is considered the benchmark method, using a small set of 61 full documents. In this paper, we present a series of comparative experiments we conducted to test our approach in: A significantly larger corpus of full documents.
 A corpus of document abstracts.
 Using both versions of AMTEx, v1 and v2.
 For indexing and retrieval tasks.
 Against MMTx, v24B.

For this reason, we conducted four experiments, comparing AMTEx v1 and v2 to MMTx v2.4B: the first two experiments assess the performance of AMTEx vs. MMTx in the indexing task on a corpus of document abstracts ( Abstract Indexing exper-performance of AMTEx vs. MMTx v2.4B in the retrieval task using again the respective document abstract ( Abstract-based Retrieval experiment ) and full document ( Full Document-based Retrieval experiment ) datasets.

We should note that in MMTx term ranking is less rigorous than AMTEx. In MMTx valid term output has mostly a weight value of 1000, whereas in AMTEx each term is ranked based on its individual weight. Thus, the evaluation score value of the 10th or 100th best answer of MMTx is not particularly adequate, since all its results may be equally weighted. This fact makes hard any controlling processes for the over-generated extracted MMTx terms.

Please also note that for our indexing experiments, we thought it to be fair for MMTx to restrict its term mapping process to MeSH, rather the full UMLS, similarly to our AMTEx, since our ground truth consists of the MEDLINE provided index sets, which are based on MeSH.
 5.2.1. Abstract Indexing experiment
This first experiment was conducted to test the performance of the three systems in the indexing task in a document ab-stracts corpus. The problems related to processing document abstracts were first identified in our pilot experiments with
AMTEx [8]. These relate to the abstract size, which is quite limited to be used as input to a method using statistics, such as AMTEx. Moreover, the content of the abstract has not been found to contain all necessary textual information for accu-rately indexing the full document. We have concluded at the time that we needed to consolidate our AMTEx approach before embarking on such an experiment.

For the Abstract Indexing experiment presented here, we selected a corpus subset of the OHSUMED standard TREC collec-tion corpus [32]. OHSUMED is a collection of MEDLINE document abstracts used for benchmarking information retrieval sys-tems evaluation. Our selected subset consisted of 10% of OHSUMED, i.e. 30,000 document abstracts (because MMTx is slow, processing of the entire OHSUMED was not feasible). These were again evaluated in terms of precision and recall against the MEDLINE provided MeSH index term sets.

For processing of document abstracts, AMTEx algorithm was slightly modified to respond to the problems of document document input during the term extraction step. Subsequently the extracted terms are associated to their respective source document by string matching. This modification of the AMTEx process has been thought necessary, since AMTEx term extraction is not only linguistic but also statistically based.

Table 2 demonstrates the comparative performance of AMTEx v1 and v2 against MMTx v2.4B in terms of average docu-ment precision and recall. We observe that AMTEx shows improved precision compared to MMTx, and a reasonable recall by merely a fifth of the average term output compared to MMTx. 5.2.2. Full Document Indexing experiment
In our second experiment we have assessed the performances of our two versions of AMTEx against the MMTx v.2.4B in the indexing task using a full document dataset, our 5819 PMC full document corpus. The results were evaluated for preci-ods process single document input during the term extraction step.

The results in Table 3 shows average term output, precision and recall for each document, for all three systems. We ob-serve that AMTEx v1, shows a precision result that is higher than MMTx, whereas the average extracted terms are much less. AMTEx v2 demonstrates the best recall of the two AMTEx systems, for a fraction of the average MMTx term output.
Finally, Table 4 illustrates the comparative results of all systems, in both full document PMC and OHSUMED document abstracts indexing experiments in terms of time efficiency. We observe that the time taken for OHSUMED processing was longer in all systems. Nevertheless, both AMTEx systems are shown to perform much faster than MMTx. We believe that this is due to the algorithmic simplicity of AMTEx compared to MMTx especially with regards to variant generation and term expansion processes (even though MMTx was tested using MeSH rather than the full UMLS). 5.2.3. Abstract-based Retrieval experiment
In our third experiment, we attempted to test AMTEx performance in the medical document retrieval task based on the document abstracts dataset. Documents are represented by term vectors produced by AMTEx (v2.0) and MMTx, respectively.
Document matching is performed by Vector Space Model (VSM, [34]). Both methods (i.e., retrieval by AMTEx and MMTx vec-tors) are compared against retrieval using vectors of MEDLINE provided index term sets, i.e. the terms used as ground truth in our indexing experiments. We have used the OHSUMED standard TREC collection corpus subset used in the indexing experiment. However, for this task the results were evaluated against 64 TREC provided queries and answers [32]. These con-stituted our ground truth for all systems performance.

Fig. 4 illustrates the performance of AMTEx v2.0 compared to MMTx and the MEDLINE provided index term sets. Each values for the best answer or best match (which has rank 1), while the right-most point corresponds to the average preci-sion/recall values for the entire answer set.

We observe that for this retrieval task based on the OHSUMED document abstracts dataset AMTEx approaches the per-formance of the manually assigned MeSH terms as we gradually reach the entire answer set, while the increased recall of MMTx results in significantly better precision than both the manually assigned MeSH terms and AMTEx.
The poor performance of AMTEx is due on the combined effect of two reasons. First, given the nature of the corpus, namely the OHSUMED document abstracts, our method AMTEx method due to its statistical part for term extraction, was slightly modified to treat the whole OHSUMED collection as a single document, rather than processing the very small individual doc-ument abstracts. The term results of this process were subsequently mapped to individual documents. At this stage the
MMTx has the advantage of extracting few terms, even for small document size, which can be subsequently expanded, thus increasing MMTx term recall.

Secondly, this effect is further supported in retrieval, due to the nature of the Vector Space Model (VSM) [33] in document matching. In particular, document matching relies on comparison of term vectors and in VSM partial matching is supported, favours representation with many terms, without any regard to excessive terms, while AMTEx output incorporates semantic similarity of terms from the 6th step, not suitable for strictly string matching retrieval results.

As we shall see in our fourth and last experiment, using the PMC full document dataset the combined effect of these two factors is overcome and AMTEx performs clearly better when a full document rather than a document abstract is provided. 5.2.4. Full Document-based Retrieval experiment
In the fourth and last full document retrieval experiment we used the 5819 PMC full document corpus also used for the indexing task. In this experiment our AMTEx method (v2.0) is again compared to MMTx, which was considered the benchmarking method for this task and to the retrieval results of the manually assigned MeSH terms. However, for this task the results were evaluated against 15 TREC provided queries (for PMC, there are no relevance judgments available by TREC or elsewhere). Relevance judgements on the first 25 answers retrieved by all the three competitive methods (AMTEx, MMTx and manually assigned MeSH terms) for all the 15 queries were provided by a domain expert (it was impossible to evaluate answers for the entire set of the 64 TREC queries as in the previous experiment as this would require 64 25 3  X  4800 relevance judgments by our domain expert). The queries used for this experiment are presented on Table 5 below.
Fig. 5 shows AMTEX (v2.0) clearly outperforming MMTx and nearing the performance of the manually assigned MeSH index terms.

Notice that although MMTx is tuned towards higher recall (by revealing more indexing terms) this does not always lead to improved retrieval performance. A possible explanation could lie in the fact that the document indexing is based on man-ual assignment of MeSH terms based on the document conceptual classification done by human experts, whereas retrieval is based on string matching (on terms or term parts found in the document) and the evaluation of these results.
Based on all four experiments we conclude that the AMTEx selective term output method is very well suited for both indexing and retrieval, performing faster and providing a better and concise term output, whereas MMTx increased recall statistical term extraction process.
 6. Conclusions
This article discusses the automatic mapping of documents to the correct MeSH index terms. We consider the term extraction problem for the automatic indexing of documents in large medical collections, such as the MEDLINE collection and we briefly present related approaches to this problem, focusing on the MMTx method, which attempts to map terms in medical documents to UMLS Metathesaurus concepts.

We propose and present the development of an alternative method, the AMTEx method, aiming at providing more accu-matic indexing of MEDLINE documents, using the MeSH Thesaurus resource and a well-established method for extraction of domain terms, the C / NC -value method.

In this article, we present the experiments we conducted for the refinement of the AMTEx method. We show how we refined our term output by term weighting and by applying a final cutoff threshold. The AMTEx algorithm is consolidated to include a refined process in Single-word Term Extraction stage, which is shown to improve its results.
AMTEx is also compared to MMTx in the indexing and the retrieval tasks. The results show that AMTEx performs very well in both tasks, with its average term output being 20 X 50% less than MMTx and its processing speed 3 X 5 times faster than
MMTx. MMTx X  X  increased recall may present better results in the small size document retrieval task, where the small doc-ument size is prohibitive for the optimal application of AMTEx statistical term extraction process.
