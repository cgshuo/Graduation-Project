 Today plenty of data is emerging from various city systems. Beyond the classical Web resources, large amounts of data are retrieved from sensors, devices, social networks, govern-mental applications, or service networks. In such a diver-sity of information, answering specific information needs of city inhabitants requires holistic IR techniques, capable of harnessing different types of city data and turned it into actionable insights to answer different queries. This tuto-rial will present deep insights, challenges, opportunities and techniques to make heterogeneous city data searchable and show how emerging IR techniques models can be employed to retrieve relevant information for the citizens. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Experimentation
Majority of people reside in cities (estimated over 70% of the world population by 2050) -a situation posing sev-eral challenges for municipalities, governments, citizens and businesses. In an urbanizing world, cities comprise of dif-ferent systems ranging from transport, water, and electric-ity data management infrastructures to social, communica-tion and service networks. The data emerging from these systems is a precious resource to make cities more intelli-gent, innovative and integrated beyond the boundaries of isolated applications. Today, beyond the classical Web re-sources (e.g. documents) large amounts of data are retrieved from sensors, mobile devices, social network messages, gov-ernmental applications, or service networks. In such a di-versity of information, the specific information needs of the city inhabitants requires a holistic IR and data management techniques, capable of harnessing different types of city data and to turn into actionable insights. In fact, existing local some vital information needs. However, when it comes to answering more complex user information needs, the exist-ing local search engines have certain limitations in terms of understanding these complex needs and also capturing the required information from different city data sources in re-sponse to them.

There exists a number of unique challenges and oppor-tunities for the IR community to make such a type of het-erogeneous city data searchable. To achieve that, there is a need first to acquire, integrate, manage, and analyze rele-vant city data across different sources to dynamically answer different queries [2]. This is unlike the classical local search engines which rely on a limited number of sources (e.g. Web documents) or a curated proprietary knowledge base to un-ambiguously acquire the city-related information. In fact, the source of information in a city setting may range from streams, each of those providing different sort of informa-tion with varying timeliness and relevance. It is a unique data-centric application domain for many foundational IR techniques to be applied on.

This tutorial will present the deep insights, novel chal-lenges, opportunities and techniques to make city data query-able. We will present what X  X earching the city data X  X ctually means beyond the current approaches to answer the possi-ble information needs of the city inhabitants and how they differ from searching the Web or enterprise data. We will also present how common IR techniques and emerging mod-els [1, 3] can be employed and adapted to retrieve the rel-evant information for the users, and how the relevancy can be improved by considering different city-specific aspects in different stages of search process.
