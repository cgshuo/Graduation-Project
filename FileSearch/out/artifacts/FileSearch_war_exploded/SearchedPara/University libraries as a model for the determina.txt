 1. Introduction
Nowadays only few people would disagree with the assertion that we live in an information dominated era, where  X  ... the gence of the new industry already in 1960, when he introduced the terms  X  X nowledge work X  and  X  X nowledge worker X  ( Druc-ker, 1993 , 5). Only 2 years later Machlup published the first important study on the  X  X nowledge industry X  which concluded industry X  in the United States ( Machlup, 1962 , 386).

Another ground-breaking study was performed by Marc Uri Porat in 1977, who introduced the term  X  X nformation econ- X  mation services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms X  ( Porat, 1977 , 4). The signif-
Taylor (1981) who updated Porat X  X  data concerning the information economy; or to Apte and Nath (2004) , whose aim was to measure the size and the structure of the US information economy and to compare the results with Porat X  X  study. Also the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced an approach to measure the information sector which was strongly influenced by Porat X  X  work ( OECD, 1981 ) and which triggered measurement activities in a number of OECD ( Schmoranz, 1980 ). In comparison to Porat, a wider suggestion dividing a national economy into a production sector and an information sector was used by Jonscher (1983) . While the former covers the functions of creating, processing and handling of physical goods, the object of the latter is information.

Besides approaches which tried to determine the proportion of the information sector on the basis of the value-added (gross domestic product), several occupational concepts were introduced in the past. Machlup (1962) was also the first who analyzed the occupational structure with regard to knowledge production in the United States though this aspect, in comparison to the so-called industry approach, comprised only a small part in his book. While Machlup (and most other authors) determined the number of knowledge producing occupations, Porat (1977) investigated the employee compensation of information occupations.

In the early 1980s, the OECD (1981) introduced an occupation scheme for information workers, which was based on Por-at X  X  suggestion. It distinguishes among four main categories (information producers, information processors, information distributors and information infrastructure occupations) and eleven subcategories. Dostal refined this scheme in that he did not entirely assign an occupation to an information worker category (or not). Moreover, he tried to measure information force into six categories whereof knowledge workers and data workers were combined to so-called information workers. All these occupational approaches do not only differ with regard to the reference scheme used to define information workers but also with regard to the assignment of the various occupations to it and, as a consequence, the proportion of information workers/knowledge workers measured (30.7 X 53%) ( Karlics, 2011 , 149).
 As the studies by Boon, Britz, and Harmse (1994), Dordick and Wang (1993), Engelbrecht and Mahon (2003), Lal (2005), than the United States. 2. Research questions and definitions
In our research we investigate the possibility, to project the need for information specialist serving knowledge workers in and research students) at universities. This should be performed by means of quantitative methods from library and infor-mation science (Library Planning Model) and economics (input output analysis, occupational analysis). Accordingly, the prime research question is:
Which is the need for information specialists in Austrian knowledge industries? Is it possible to project the staffing requirements for them on the basis of the number of librarians (performing information management functions) within universities? As a by-product of our study, we also try to answer the following questions: Which is the size of the Austrian information sector both with regard to value-added and workforce?
Which sectors use goods from the information sector in which amount? From which other sectors does the information sector receive its input?
The key terms which derive from these research questions ( X  X nformation sector X , in particular  X  X nowledge industries X ,  X  X nformation specialists X  and  X  X nformation management functions X ) are explained in the following. 2.1. Information sector
Up to now it has been common to divide national economies into three sectors which include agriculture, manufacturing information sector due to statistical data, the general perception of the increasing importance of information and the com-puterization of society. Since the information sector was demarcated very widely in previous publications and since we in-tend to perform a more precise analysis, we follow a suggestion by Hayes (2001) in subdividing the information sector into the information technology industries segment, the information transaction industries segment and the knowledge indus-tries segment.

Information technology industries : This segment includes industries that produce hardware and software for telecommu-nications, computers and a variety of other technologies that acquire, communicate and process data (such as medical and scientific instrumentation).

Information transaction industries : This segment covers those industries in which the primary emphasis is on the com-puter-based processing of transactions which represent actions taken but have substantive value only in that processing.
This includes telecommunication services, banking and related financial activities, retail and wholesale transactions, res-ervation services (such as for hotels, air travel, cars, tourism), and a wide variety of similar transaction processing contexts.

Knowledge industries : This segment consists of organizations in which the substantive content of the information is sig-nificant. These industries mainly deal with the creation of new knowledge, the intellectual analysis of existing knowledge and/or the distribution of knowledge. They include education, research and development, the professions (law, medicine, ing). Also libraries are an integral part of this segment. 2.2. Information specialists and information management functions
Traditionally, information management functions are well defined in libraries and information centers where they are performed by librarians or information specialists. Basically, they include of the following main tasks: information selection, information acquisition, information description, information preservation, creation of information products and provision of information services. 3. Methods and data sources
The methodology involved in this investigation consists of several analyses and various sets of data to which the models are applied. 3.1. Library Planning Model
The Library Planning Model (LPM) ( Hayes, 2001 ) is a means for estimating staffing requirements to meet identified work-vided from two different sources: university data (delivered from data warehouse uni:data which is maintained by the Aus-input data are applied to workload factors which express the duration estimated to perform a transaction for the various information management functions. As a result (among others) the LPM offers estimates for the reader services staff and mation management functions in the knowledge industries. To avoid random fluctuations and to adjust differences among culate these two indicators for the average Austrian university library. 3.2. Input X  X utput calculation
Input X  X utput tables are elements of the national accounts and represent the intersectoral relations of products and indus-tries within an economy. The input X  X utput system comprises three parts: supply and use tables at basic and purchasers X  prices and symmetric input X  X utput tables usually provided at basic prices. Whereas supply tables give a detailed picture about the supply of goods and services by domestic producers and imports, use tables (see Table 1 for a small excerpt) de-components.

In our project these tables had a size of 73 products (according to CPA product classification) by 73 industries (according the value-added and to investigate the interrelations among the (sub)sectors, it was necessary to assign the various prod-ucts/industries to these (sub)sectors (see Table A1 in the Appendix A ) before being able to perform these analyses.
Supply and use tables are created annually with a time delay of 3 years. In our project the most actual version were the also to this year. 3.3. Occupational analysis
Occupational data were used to determine the size of the information sector with regard to workforce. They are collected for information specialists in knowledge industries and evaluate whether their number can be projected from the number of librarians, these data were required in two dimensions: by industry and by occupation. In Austria (and the European Union) the commonly used classification system at that time was the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) which was approved by the International Labour Organization in 1988 ( ILO, 2004 ).
 The tables from Statistik Austria (2011) were relatively detailed having been provided at a 3-digit level for both NACE and
ISCO-88 (see Table 2 for a small excerpt). As a consequence, the number of information specialists in the knowledge indus-tries could be easily computed since the corresponding ISCO classes are  X 243 Archivists, Librarians and Related Information between information specialists and knowledge workers which are the main beneficiaries of information management functions, we were also interested in the number of the latter. Their determination is not straightforward. We used the  X  X ECD information worker scheme X  ( OECD, 1981 , 24) for this purpose assigning the following subcategories to them: scien-tific and technical workers, consultative services, educators and communication workers. 4. Research model knowledge industries on the basis of university libraries. The underlying assumptions are as follows: 1. Universities are a representative of the knowledge industries, information management functions within them are pro-vided to a great extent by a university library. 2. The staffing requirements of libraries are primarily determined by the factors media purchases (which cause the need for technical services staff performing the tasks of information selection, information acquisition, information description and information preservation) and the number of its users (causing the need for reader services staff who are in charge of the creation of information products and the provision of information services). industries (though varying among industries), whereas the users of a university library (researchers and students linked to the knowledge workers in the knowledge industries.

This brings us to the underlying research model (see Fig. 2 ) which shows the general framework of our project. Basically, it can be divided into two contexts: the university/library context and the knowledge industry context (including universi-forming information management functions in the knowledge industries segment is the intended outcome.
 university/library context and the national economy context since we assume that these ratios are applicable also to the knowledge industries.

To estimate the staffing for information management functions in the knowledge industries segment ( X  technical services and number of  X  knowledge workers  X . The input X  X utput tables are used to identify how much knowledge industries spend on ly, the sum of these two should approximately correspond to the real number of information specialists in the knowledge industries (research question 3). If our assumptions hold true, this value should approximately correspond with the number of information specialists collected from the industry-occupation matrix.
 5. Findings 5.1. Size of information sector
As already mentioned, we computed the size of the information sector both by value-added and by workforce. As is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , the services sector was still the largest one according to both calculations amounting to nearly 38% of the total value-added and to 36% of the total workforce in 2005. Interestingly, the information technology segment has only a proportion of less than 2%. The largest segment of the information sector is constituted by the knowledge indus-jobs are more labor-intensive which is not surprising according to the definition of the knowledge industries. The opposite holds true for the information transaction industries (4.8% vs. 8.9%). 5.2. Interrelationship among (sub)sectors
In this analysis we investigated the consumption of goods which consists of intermediate use, final consumption, gross capital formation and exports. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , these components differ among the four sectors. The relevant con-sumption category for investigating the interrelationship among the sectors is the intermediate use which shows which sec-tor (industry) uses goods from which (other) sectors (industries) in which amount. Its proportion had the same relative magnitude for information products, services and manufacturing products in 2005 (between 35% and 42%). Only for agricul-tural goods the proportion of the intermediate use was considerably higher (60%).

When considering Table 3 , which shows the use of goods and services by the various sectors in more detail, the most remarkable aspect is that there is a diagonal dominance. This means that industries from a particular sector are the main purchasers of goods produced in it. This holds also true for the information subsectors where more than half of the total intermediate consumption goes into the information sector (73% of IT goods, 59% of information transaction goods and 55% of knowledge industries goods). However, larger proportions of IT products are also used in the manufacturing sector of knowledge industries goods are input in both manufacturing sector (20%) and services sector (23%).
 5.3. Information specialists in knowledge industries
The prime focus of our research was the determination of the staffing requirements for information specialists in Austrian knowledge industries, and in particular whether their number can be extrapolated from university libraries. The number of information specialists (3477) could be easily calculated by means of the industry occupation matrix (see Table 4 ). media purchases  X  X nd X  FTE reader services staff per primary library user  X  X hichamounted to16.54and0.004247fortheaverageAus-trian university library. Multiplying the latter with the number of knowledge workers (337,755 of purchases of publishing products by the knowledge industries, which correspond to the media purchases by university libraries. The problem was, however, that the use table was not detailed enough (73 products 73 industries). As a conse-output table yielding to a need for technical services staff in knowledge industries which is much too high (35,815 FTE). ring this ratio, which amounted to 0.007733 to the knowledgeindustries context and multiplying it with the number of knowl-6. Conclusions
It was the main goal of our study to investigate the possibility to project the need for information specialists serving knowledge workers in knowledge industries of a national economy on the basis of an average university library serving their counterparts (researchers and research students) at universities. This should be performed by means of quantitative meth-ods from library and information science (Library Planning Model) and economics (input output analysis and occupational analysis). Due to the chosen approach, we are aware that our study is experimental to some degree.
 Though we could attain a very close fit between the projected and the actual number of information specialists in Austrian knowledge industries in the revised model, we do not want to conceal various problems which occurred in our investigation. One critical issue was the high aggregation level at which economical analyses are usually conducted. In our case, the use tables were only available as a 73 73 matrix. However, we would have needed the use table at a 3-digit NACE versity library correspond approximately to the input of publishing products in knowledge industries.

One further aspect, which was not considered in this study is the changing role of librarians due to the increasing impor-tance of electronic resources. Even though a short survey concerning the workloads of electronic resources was conducted, reflected in this study.

The occupational table was available at a sufficient level of detail. The problem here were the small cell values for the below 3000 lack significance according to an information by Statistics Austria. As already the total number of information specialists in knowledge industries was slightly higher, we met this requirement only narrowly. A further problematic issue was that the occupation table reports head counts while the projected value from our calculation corresponds to FTE. How-ever, since our goal was to reach a sufficient congruence between these two values, this is not a critical issue.
Finally, it must be considered that our projection of the need of information specialists in knowledge industries on the dental, we are preparing a replication of the study for other EU countries.
