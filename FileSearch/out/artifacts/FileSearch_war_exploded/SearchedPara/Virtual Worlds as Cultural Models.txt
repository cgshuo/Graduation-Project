 WILLIAM SIMS BAINBRIDGE National Science Foundation 1. VIRTUAL WORLDS AS CULTURAL MODELS
Based on over 4,000 hours of participant observation from a human-centered computing perspective, I can report that at least thirteen gamelike virtual worlds are based on concepts of society that are coherent enough to constitute theories. This is not to say that their designers have read the social theorists whose works I cite, although that may be true in several cases. Rather, to have any chance of competing in the marketplace, a fantasy needs a strong concept, and many of these worlds have drawn their concepts from existing bodies of popular literature that have already been refined to give them distinctiveness and some measure of validity. Thus, fantasy becomes a form of social theory.
Furthermore, virtual worlds can be valid laboratories for testing and extending social-scientific theories [Bainbridge 2001b].

This essay will not present a single theory to cover all the cases, because many theories might do so, and it is necessary first of all to sketch the contours of this new scholarly domain. However, the author has previously worked in the new paradigm in the sociology of religion [Warner 1993], and many of these worlds explicitly concern religion, magic, or other supernatural concepts. In this perspective, religion is a socially-constructed fantasy that compensates people emotionally for the inescapable deprivations of human life, such as low social status, ill health, and death [Stark and Bainbridge 1985, 1987, 1996].
Samuel Taylor Coleridge [1817] argued that the essence of art is suspension of disbelief , and gameworlds are the distinctive new artform of our era. In the realm of religion, there really may be no natural difference between belief and suspension of disbelief, but during the long historical period when church and state were united, citizens were artificially required to exhibit shared faith rather than freely express their personal hopes and dreams.

Multiplayer online games compensate players for lack of status in the wider world, allowing them to earn honor with other players and to triumph over many non-player characters. While these games cannot cure real-world ill-nesses, the avatars are generally stronger and more robust than the players.
Most of them conceptualize an avatar X  X  defeat as a death from which resurrec-tion is prompt and sure. It is hard to predict whether human society is moving into a secular era, but if it does, these gameworlds may become minor heav-ens substituting to some degree for religion in people X  X  lives [Bainbridge 1997, 2006, 2007a; Bainbridge and Bainbridge 2007]. Players may develop expec-tations for real-world society based on their gaming experiences [Castronova 2007]. If that happens, then these virtual societies may function as etopias , electronic utopias that critique conventional society and propose alternatives to it [Bainbridge 2009]. 2. THIRTEEN MODELS OF SOCIETY
As the most popular of these gamelike worlds, World of Warcraft can help peo-ple who have never visited them understand what they are like. In May 2008,
I organized a major scientific conference in World of Warcraft , encouraged by the journal Science which provided valuable publicity [Bohannon 2008], and leading to a book titled Online Worlds [Bainbridge 2010b]. On three successive days, plenary sessions brought together in one virtual location 120 avatars rep-resenting scholars whose bodies ranged from Australia through North America and Western Europe to Russia. After each session, an expedition took a subset of participants on a shared adventure. Figure 1 is a group photo at the end of the second day X  X  activities, which concluded with a run through a tropical jungle to a seaport called Booty Bay where the third day X  X  session was held.
Every avatar needs to be developed through a number of levels of  X  X xperience, X  which at the time ran as high as 70, and this jungle was designed for characters that had already reached 35, so more advanced participants needed to protect the less-advanced ones from aggressive beasts as they ran together through the wilderness.

Cooperation by avatars that possess different abilities is central to all the virtual worlds discussed here, and all of them incorporate systems for creating and managing long-lasting social groups. In World of Warcraft , they are called guilds , and all conference participants belonged to a guild called Science. Like all such groups, Science had its own text chat channel in which all communi-cations for the conference sessions and expeditions took place. Outsiders could neither write into this channel, nor read it.

Much of the normal activity in a gameworld like World of Warcraft consists of carrying out difficult missions or  X  X uests X  having to do with the culture of the world and collecting or crafting virtual resources like clothing, weapons, and consumables. Some quests can be completed alone, but others require tem-porary teams, typically with five members. For the conference, several high-level characters contributed virtual money or resources like carrying bags for the other items, and each participant X  X  avatar was given a red and gold Sci-ence guild tabard carrying the symbol for infinity. A tailor avatar made red t-shirts for all participants; an engineer made working telescopes; an alchemist made magic potions allowing avatars to swim under the ocean; and a level-70 priest completed over a hundred quests to earn 10 virtual gold coins for each and every participant. Each avatar in World of Warcraft belongs to one of two opposed factions, the Horde or the Alliance, and Science was a Horde guild.

With nearly twelve million subscribers and offering four vast virtual conti-nents with hundreds of cities and villages, World of Warcraft (WoW) is truly a world [Bainbridge 2010c]. In addition to scores of groups of non-player-characters operated by simple AI routines, at any given time one of the scores of WoW servers may host as many as four thousand users divided into the two competing factions, each consisting of five (or, soon to be, six) races who have banded together for the sake of survival. Tragically, their world is not big enough for all of them, and the natural environment has been degraded by past warfare and insensitive exploitation so they must kill each other in order to live. The heart of the Alliance is the Human race, who belong to a declining civilization, and the heart of the Horde is the Orc race who are for the first time advancing from the tribal to the urban stage of development. World of Warcraft can readily be understood from the standpoint of theories about the rise and fall of clashing civilizations (e.g., Sorokin [1937 X 1941], Huntington [1996]. As a model for the real world, WoW suggests we cannot all become modern, rich, and live in peace, but must find ways of conducting wars against each other that do not result in total extermination of our entire species.
 Superficially, Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) looks similar to World of
Warcraft even including duels between Humans and Orcs, but it is based on the very different theory that all people can cooperate in a single alliance against evil. Notably, a player cannot primarily take the role of an Orc, outside of a special activity called  X  X onster play, X  but can be only a Human, a Hobbit, an
Elf, or a Dwarf. Much of the action concerns building fellowships between them in their struggle against external demonic powers that are operated entirely by the computer system. LOTRO is based on a set of four novels by historian and philologist J. R. R. Tolkien [1954], who opposed modern technology and advocated the return to an idealized form of medieval society. Having gained his abhorrence of technology by watching friends die in the trenches of World
War I, Tolkien was a Roman Catholic who developed his mythos X  X n parallel with the similar Narnia mythos of his good friend C. S. Lewis  X  as a Christian allegory. It is noteworthy that World of Warcraft contains churches, but Lord of the Rings Online does not, for the same reason there was no church in the
Garden of Eden: If you are at One with God, you need no priests to mediate for you. Many sociologists have argued that Roman Catholicism (and perhaps
Islam but not Protestantism, Judaism, or Atheism) binds all humanity into a single potentially harmonious community [Durkheim 1897, 1915; Greeley 1989], and this was Tolkien X  X  hope.

Dark Age of Camelot has similarities with both WoW and LOTRO, but is low fantasy rather than high fantasy like them because it presents a world that is closer to real human history. In the Dark Ages, a few years after the death of King Arthur, three cultures compete in northwestern Europe: Albion (English),
Hibernia (Celtic), and Midgard (Norse). Costumes, architecture and locations are somewhat realistic, but in two respects, it is a fantasy world rather than a depiction of real history. First, it presents the view of the Dark Ages held by poetic writers from the Renaissance through the nineteenth-century rather than the cold facts unearthed by more recent historians and archaeologists.
Second, it weaves much of the real folklore of its three cultures into the virtual world, treating the mythologies of Dark Ages societies as at least partially real.
Thus it is what I call a vector history , presenting a view of a past period that is not the modern view, but seen from a third historical and cultural perspective that is neither then nor now [Bainbridge 2010a].

Age of Conan presents a fictional Hyborian Age that existed after Atlantis but before classical Greek civilization. Players create characters in one of three cultures, which are very different but not at war with each other, and have some affinities with real past cultures: Cimmeria (Celtic), Aquilonia (Roman), and
Stygia (Egyptian). Conan is a well-known character from Robert E. Howard X  X  stories and a series of movies, a Cimmerian barbarian who has seized the throne of Aquilonia and must fend off Stygian plots to unseat him, often involving black magic. Conan is incapable of developing a friendship, and his female lovers drop into his arms without courtship, while his male enemies fall beneath his sword without so much as a prayer for their souls. Indeed, Conan is a psychopath, and the stories were written by a mentally ill poet who committed suicide at age thirty upon hearing his mother was about to die [De Camp et al. 1983].
The remarkable result is a psychoanalytic fantasy mythos that unintentionally illustrates two points from Freud X  X  [1930] theory of history. First, Freud argued that civilization increasingly inhibits the natural lusts of human beings, and, by returning to the barbaric past, we liberate our personal passions. Second, the history of any individual person recapitulates the history of humanity in general, from instant gratification of  X  X d X  impulses in infancy to dominance by the  X  X uperego X  in maturity. Conan represents wish-fulfillment regression to childhood, although in the actual online virtual world a player can succeed only with a strong  X  X go X  that negotiates well between id and superego.

Pirates of the Burning Sea is set in the Caribbean in 1720 and reflects a general view of society called political economy . In an interview with a New
Yo rk Ti m e s reporter, game developer Russell Williams said,  X  X f you look at the reality of the Caribbean in 1720, the economy drove the combat, and the com-bat was part of the economy, and that X  X  because it was all about the European powers trying to exploit the rich natural resources of the area X  [Schiesel 2008].
Players can create characters in any of four factions: British, French, Spanish and  X  X irates. X  Much of the action takes place at sea, piloting reasonably real-istic sailing ships either in battles or in commerce, and other action involves economic activity as well as swashbuckling missions on land. While local war-fare erupts constantly around particular seaports, there is no global war, and members of any faction can visit and conduct business in ports belonging to the others. In real history, open conflict had raged a decade earlier in the War of the Spanish Succession, and the entire eighteenth century was marked by a cold war between major European powers that frequently erupted into hotter conflicts. Thus, quite apart from its laudably realistic portrayal of a particular century in history, Pirates of the Burning Sea is a complex variant of the clash of civilizations, in which much of the political competition is economic in nature.
Set in ancient Egypt, A Tale in the Desert lacks combat and non-player characters, emphasizing instead puzzle solving, and most of the puzzles have strong social dimensions. Users must perform such mundane but realistic tasks as collecting straw to make mud bricks and growing vegetables to feed to sheep in order to get mutton, oil, leather, and dung. Over time, a user builds a system of machines for processing flax to make fabric, potter X  X  wheels and kilns for making clay jugs, and workbenches for glass and metal products. In so doing, a beginner needs extensive help from advanced users, because many of the necessary raw materials are unavailable to beginners. Additionally, many of the tasks are group rituals X  X uch as deity worship, vigils, and even weddings X  X o membership in cooperative social groups is absolutely essential.
The social-science theory that seems to fit this virtual Egypt best was developed by anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski [1922] in his study of the Trobriand islanders, who built their seagoing boats in group rituals and used them to sustain noneconomic but symbolic trade with fellows on other islands. This theory says that in any society, technology is embedded in social rituals, and the economic rationality of engineering may be only secondary to its culture-constructing properties.

Entropia Universe , recently renamed Planet Calypso when it migrated to an advanced graphics engine, represents colonization of an earthlike planet where some combat between players occurs but most of the activity concerns hunting, mining, and manufacturing in order to establish a new virtual society. The theory that comes immediately to mind for analyzing Calypso is Frederick
Jackson Turner X  X  [1895, 1896, 1906] frontier thesis that the American frontier represented a safety valve for the social problems of more settled areas, thereby establishing strong democratic traditions and sustaining the conditions needed for maximum cultural and technological creativity. However, one might say that Calypso has not yet reached the stage of social, economic, or political development of the frontier in the nineteenth-century United States, because there is no agriculture, and very few of the residents exercised the option to build virtual homes. Then the proper analogy would be to an earlier era, and the hunting economy resembles that of the early Hudson X  X  Bay Company [Carlos and Hoffman 1986; Carlos and Nicholas 1990; Carlos and Lewis 1993]. At any rate, theories developed to explain features of the settlement of largely open lands in the Americas could be applied usefully to this simulation of planetary colonization.

Anarchy Online also concerns colonization of a planet, Rubi-Ka, but one that began centuries ago and had established one major city plus several smaller ones. The entire planet was owned by the Omni-Tek mining corporation that exploited its resources for its own benefit and treated the colonists like slaves.
A popular revolt liberated many of the smaller cities, and the planet is now divided into territory run by Omni-Tek, an equivalent territory operated by the Clans that developed out of the revolution, and a smaller set of Neutral towns. Mining plus hunting are the major industries, although the collapse of Omni-Tek dominance means that one of the best ways to get resources is to loot them. While one might apply some aspects of frontier theory, Anarchy
Online clearly draws upon European class-conflict theory. The aspects of world systems theory that apply to colonization might fit well, although the ideology of the Clans is not well enough developed to determine whether they fit the category of primitive rebels [Hobsbawm 1959; Wolf 1969] or have sufficient class consciousness to qualify as modern rebels .

The Matrix Online was a virtual world recreation of The City from the Ma-trix movies, that operated from 2005 until 2009. The series consisted of artistic speculations based on post-modern European philosophy, notably Jean Bau-drillard X  X  [1994] book, Simulacra and Simulation . Baudrillard took the Marxist notion of false consciousness to its illogical conclusion that reality has dissolved into illusion. Originally, false consciousness had a very clear political-economic meaning. The elite has organized society to serve its own interests, so it pro-mulgates an ideology that deceives the working class into believing the society is based on justice and designed to serve the working-class needs. In this for-mulation, sometimes called the sociology of knowledge [Manheim, 1936; Berger and Luckmann 1966], there is an objective reality, and it consists of exploita-tion of the working class by the elite by means of deception. In post-modern, post-Marxist thought, there is no objective description of society, and illusions compete with illusions to define a precarious reality. The Matrix movies took one step forward, denying the objective existence of physical reality as well by postulating that the world we experience is really a computer simulation.
Tabula Rasa was a well-designed science fiction world, setting its action on two distant planets. It was launched in late 2007 but closed down in early 2009 because it did not meet the economic expectations of the company that hosted it. The chief designer, Richard Garriott, was not only a leader in the prior history of gamelike virtual worlds, but also the son of an astronaut who belonged to the spaceflight social movement and used Tabula Rasa to promote space exploration [Bainbridge 1976]. Each of the half dozen main groups of characters had gone into space for a distinctive reason, thereby exemplifying the many motives that might promote spaceflight. In October 2008, Garriott actually took a memory unit containing all the Tabula Rasa avatars up to the International Space Station, using his multimillion dollar trip to promote this virtual world as well as his personal ideals. Tabula Rasa illustrates a particular problem faced by virtual worlds: They require significant resources to maintain, yet some of the intellectually most interesting examples may not be commercially successful.

EVE Online is a long lasting and constantly evolving virtual universe in which essentially all the action at advanced levels is created by the users them-selves. Unlike all the other cases, the user does not ever inhabit a humanoid avatar, but operates a series of progressively more powerful spaceships. Begin-ners carry out a large number of set missions, but these are chiefly tutorials to instruct the user in the details of the very complex tools and environments.
After the early levels, the user is expected to join or form a corporation , compa-rable to a guild in other gameworlds but owning one or more solar systems, after which the action consists of military and economic competition against other corporations, which the users themselves organize. The Council of Stellar Man-agement is a legislature of users, standing for election every six months, that advises EVE Online X  X  creators about adjustments or innovations in the rules and the technology. So, the social theory illustrated by EVE Online is democracy in the free market, in which self-defense is organized by corporations.
Star Trek Online which opened on February 2, 2010, is the most recent of these examples. Although the Star Trek television shows were rather cerebral, and each episode tended to focus on social issues faced by a small number of particular characters, Star Trek Online is a high-intensity action environment achieving excitement by bringing many people together on interplanetary bat-tlefields. However, two related features of the television series were carried over: (1) structuring experiences in terms of episodes that often consist of three or four scenes, and (2) an emphasis on human diversity as expressed in the Vulcan proverb,  X  X nfinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. X  Thus, Star Trek
Online offers a distinctive perspective on the complex and often uncomfortable process of globalization in the real world, suggesting that diversity and vitality can somehow be maintained despite consolidation of many advanced sentient beings into the United Federation of Planets.

Dungeons and Dragons Online is not merely an Internet-based version of the table-top game that was tremendously influential in the development of this entire artform, but also illustrates an extreme form of economic system con-nected to religion. The player X  X  avatar is explicitly a mercenary, hired by various factions in Stormreach city to enter sewers and tombs where the archetypical enemy has returned from the dead or is conducting rituals or experiments con-cerned with raising the dead. The city is dominated by four powerful families called houses (Deneith, Jorasco, Kundarak, and Phiarlan), and thus is a feu-dal oligarchy. In addition, the church of the Silver Flame offers much work for low-level avatars from its headquarters in the Catacombs, and higher-level avatars can get work from The Twelve who conduct research in magic. The central hub of the city is the Market, and vigorous commerce takes place using two currencies, coins that can be acquired by looting in the virtual world, and points that can be bought for real-world dollars. 3. ECONOMIC SYSTEMS
Gamelike virtual worlds combine social, cultural, economic, and even political systems into complex civilizations where people, simple artificial intelligences, and massive information systems interact. Consider the scene in Figure 2, which shows the auction house in the Human city of Bree, in Lord of the Rings
Online . The woman in the foreground is my avatar, Rumilisoun, a level 63 Elf lore-master and historian. The two figures standing on the higher level are auctioneers. They look like people, but really are two interfaces to the complex auction database. The two figures standing on the same level as Rumilisoun, in front of the female auctioneer, are avatars of players. They are not partners, but came to the auction house separately to buy or sell. The well-armored man is a member of the captain class of avatars, while the woman is a hunter.
The other figure, standing at the right and holding a banner, is the captain X  X  herald, a character who assists the captain in battle, and may be treated either as a secondary avatar or as a non-player character (NPC) operated by a simple artificial intelligence program.

Rumilisoun has been exploring Middle Earth for five months, and in a few days she will reach the current maximum experience level of 65, which means she is able to visit any part of the world with confidence and defeat any individ-ual NPC enemy. She tends to be a loner and has never relied on the temporary small groups called fellowships to complete her quests, preferring to operate solo. In the Tolkien mythology, Elves lack commitment to Middle Earth, and many of them are leaving it rather than battle against evil forces. The Lord of the Rings Online instruction manual explains:  X  X  keeper of ancient lore, the
Lore-master uses his knowledge of ancient wisdom to stave off the advance of the shadow for a time. He can use this knowledge to attack his foes or to treat the wounds and suffering of his companions. He can even communicate with animals and request their aid. X  In particular, Rumilisoun has adopted a bear she named Beorn, who is her secondary avatar and helps her in combat.
Avatars in virtual worlds are not merely representations of their users, but often take on personalities of their own. In creating this avatar, I carefully considered her role in my research and in the mythos, deciding she would be the granddaughter of the first Elf lore-master, R  X  umil, who invented writing.
She quests through Middle Earth not to save it but to document it, salvaging historical manuscripts and writing her own history of the wars that other people are fighting. Thus, I selected the vocation historian for her.
In Lord of the Rings Online , historians practice three professions: scholar, weaponsmith, and farmer. A scholar crafts potions, scrolls, and other intellec-tually demanding items that are useful for the full range of avatars, but each one specific to a particular kind of character. Given her anti-social nature, Ru-milisoun tends to make things that are useful to herself, such as potions to restore her morale and scrolls to ward off harm. She can buy most needed in-gredients from the auction house, but she finds it much more efficient to search for them among the relics and ancient manuscripts in ruined castles. The craft of weaponsmith is especially problematic, because a lore master like herself cannot use any of the swords, axes, or daggers she has learned to make, and she must buy all the ingredients from the auction house. Farming is peaceful, cheap, but not very useful, although she occasionally grows flowers she can use in certain potions during her scholarly work.

All of the gamelike virtual worlds incorporate complex divisions of labor , in which avatars specialize in certain roles and professions that require them to cooperate and trade with each other. Prospectors gather metals, post them in the auction system, and then weaponsmiths buy the metals to make their products. Most of the worlds have virtual currencies X  A Tale in the Desert does not X  X nd Rumilisoun needs money to pay the biweekly rent on the cottage she has near Bree. She earns some of her money through carrying out missions and looting the dead bodies of Orcs and Goblins, but she also sells some unique items through the auction. The auction system allows a seller to set a minimum bid, an immediate buyout price, and a sales duration up to 48 hours. It is also possible to limit customers to members of one X  X  own kinship , the large persistent groups equivalent to guilds in World of Warcraft . This illustrates the fact that every economic system is also a social system. 4. SOCIAL SYSTEMS
Many of the gameworlds naturally generate quantitative data of value to re-searchers. Serious users of the World of Warcraft auction system often employ a special add-on or mod program, called Auctioneer, to track prices, and this data would be useful for some studies in theoretical economics. The largest social dataset readily available is the Armory Web site of World of Warcraft , which lists about a thousand variables describing each of millions of characters who had reached at least level 10 out of the 80 currently available. To provide a glimpse of the kinds of information available on February 18, 2010, I down-loaded limited data on the 6,148 members of one of the largest guilds, Alea
Iacta Est (AIE) in the Earthen Ring realm. AIE is connected to a high-quality weekly podcast, The Instance , which to this point had produced 177 half-hour programs. 1 A Horde guild, it certainly is not a random sample of characters, but members are among the most knowledgeable inhabitants of the culture.
Table I compares the ten classes of AIE characters, arranged in order of the increasing percentage of avatars who are female each class. Many gameworlds encourage users to create multiple characters, so these are tallies of characters not users. Warriors, of whom only 12.4 percent are female, are the most violent class, usually playing the standard role of tank in battles. This means they stand toe-to-toe with the enemy, monopolizing the enemy X  X  attention and with-standing the enemy X  X  blows with their sturdy chain mail or plate-metal armor.
A second standard role, DPS (damage per second), is illustrated by mages who stand back at a safe distance and hurl magic spells at the enemy. The third role found in many gameworlds is healer, exemplified here by priests, who also stand at a distance, providing protective spells to the tank. Unless a user has two computers and two WoW accounts, called multiboxing , each user operates only one main avatar at a time, so teams are groups of individual people as in the  X  X eal world. X 
Notice that female characters are a minority in all classes, but most numer-ous among healers. Mages, warlocks, and priests are magical classes that lack strong armor and have high fractions female. Paladins are explicitly hybrids of warriors and priests, and a very good class for solo play, which may explain their high fraction female. Notice that paladins have achieved the second high-est mean experience level, 58.5 out of 80, and the highest achievement points, which can be earned by exploring wide territories as well as by completing quests. The one class with a higher mean experience level, death knights, does not start at level 1 like all the others, but at level 55. The gender analysis of this table suggests both that gender stereotypes are reflected in online avatars, and that players of different genders express themselves differently, although in the case of this dataset we do not know the genders of the users. Perhaps more important for present purposes, the table outlines the complex division of labor in the combat classes, something Rumilisoun and the auction systems already illustrated for economic relations.

Classes in Lord of the Rings Online and World of Warcraft are set when a character is created and cannot be changed, although in both gameworlds professions can be changed at some cost. A Tale in the Desert illustrates the alternative in which explicit class and profession classes are avoided, but a character X  X  prior accomplishments will determine its current abilities. As listed in Table II, there are seven disciplines , and any given character can advance in any combination of them by accomplishing tasks, although some of these tasks are very difficult. There is no combat in A Tale in the Desert , although users may compete nonviolently in solving puzzles or undertaking tasks in which only the best performers earn progress points.

Because avatars need not specialize in A Tale in the Desert , very few users have more than one avatar, so Table II reports data on nearly 894 people and exactly 894 avatars. Each avatar requires a monthly subscription fee, so these are all active inhabitants of the world. Remarkably, this was the total user population on February 17, 2020, something like one ten thousandth of the population of World of Warcraft . If we think of virtual worlds as mass media, this low population betokens failure. But in the future, it is possible that thousands of low-population virtual worlds will exist with a few hundred users each, comparable to the customers of local businesses or the members of local church congregations. Then a small population may indicate a different kind of success, and A Tale in the Desert is one of the most interesting virtual worlds despite its unpopularity.

Here is how to read the numbers in the Table II. Of the total 894 citi-zens of ancient Egypt, 427 built their compounds but did not go further in the architecture discipline. They did not, for example, build an obelisk, which is the next step. Another 213 achieved additional accomplishments, becom-ing students, and 225 achieved higher levels of advancement called Prentice,
Journeyman, and Scribe. In the original census data, obtainable by any user inside the world, nobody achieved the higher levels called Master and Sage in architecture, but a few achieved these ranks in other disciplines. Only 29 citi-zens did not complete their compounds yet and earn initiate rank, presumably new users, because having a compound is essential for doing efficient work in the Egyptian economy. In contrast, only 619 citizens achieved initiate rank or higher in the worship discipline, leaving 275 who have not yet experienced the religious initiation ritual. For research purposes, my own avatar, Ren Hotep, completed initiation in all seven disciplines and is counted in the figures of each row of this table.

The challenge named Test of the Singing Cicada in A Tale in the Desert illustrates a feature of informatic socio-economic systems that may exist in other gameworlds, although not publicized so we don X  X  know for sure, and that may become more important in the future. This a self-adjustment comparable to automatic load-balancing which may utilize machine learning. The user must roam the desert wastes of Egypt listening carefully for a buzzing sound that emanates from a cage of insects that had been placed by another user, and the user must find between 4 and 9 of these. If many people have placed cicada cages, then the user must find 9, but if few have, only 4 are required.
A similar adjustment method could be applied to hybrid auction systems (like those apparently in Matrix Online , Pirates of the Burning Sea ,and EVE
Online ), in which some of the items are placed for sale by users and others by the company hosting the virtual world. The system can automatically watch to see if some crucial resources are not being offered for sale in sufficient quantities by users and add some to the store available. Given that these are virtual resources, it costs nothing to create them, although care must be used to avoid debasing the virtual currency by producing too many of them. The creators of gamelike virtual worlds frequently adjust parameters, including the difficulty of particular missions or even the number of points required to ascend one level of experience, doing this manually but often on the basis of serious quantitative analysis. Given that many parameters interact with each other, doing this automatically requires careful design, but dynamic systems incorporating the equivalent of artificial social intelligence X  X erhaps based on trading agent methods [Wurman et al. 2004; Stone and Greenwald 2005] X  could produce interesting and realistic results. 5. COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES
Gamelike virtual worlds employ a variety of often sophisticated methods through which users may communicate and coordinate activities, always in-cluding multiple text chat channels and often including multiple voice chan-nels. There are also tools through which leaders manage memberships and permissions in social groups, for example, setting which classes of members can recruit new members, expel old members, and access the group X  X  collective bank account. Star Trek Online offers an interesting contrast with the twelve better-established worlds, because it intentionally offers a much more chaotic environment that works against the development of long-term social groups, at least in the early weeks after its launch, and raises difficult design and communication issues.

One key decision was to bring all the users together in a single virtual environment, a feature shared with EVE Online and A Tale in the Desert . This is not the approach taken by World of Warcraft , which has multiple servers called realms or shards , each offering a complete version of the world. Each avatar belongs to a single realm and cannot move easily between them. On
February 22, 2010, there were fully 241 of these realms for North American users, 109 for European users, and still more for the millions of users in China and the rest of the world. Users tend to start solo, learning the environment and user interface in a series of rather easy tutorial missions, and not adopting professions or joining guilds until perhaps at level 10. A common route to guild membership is meeting avatars of other users at random, teaming up temporarily for small-group quests and developing a modicum of respect for each other, and then going through the somewhat costly process of creating a new guild. Successful guilds are communities of trust, and some of them last for months and even years.

As it matures, Star Trek Online will develop enduring groups called fleets ,but at the beginning most users stormed around the universe solo, cooperating only by accident while working coincidentally on the same mission. When my initial
STO avatar, Rho Xi, entered a solar system on a mission that sent him there, he never knew whether he would be doing the mission alone or be automatically teamed up with others who arrived for the same purpose at roughly the same time. Each system was what is called an instance , and multiple versions of it might exist at any one time for different sets of users. Instances are also common in World of Warcraft , but teams assemble voluntarily in preparation for each instance, rather than being thrown together by the information system as in STO.

Star Trek Online lets each user into the instance when he or she arrives and adds the others as they arrive in turn. This then requires two sets of algo-rithms. The first decides when the team is complete, presumably factoring in both the number of users who had arrived and the time since the first one came before closing the instance to additional users and opening a new instance for them. Optimizing this algorithm is a difficult problem, and, as STO matures, it may be refined on the basis of experience. Initially, however, it was rather permissive, sometimes adding the last user after the others had nearly com-pleted their mission, giving the late-comer full credit just for showing up. The second algorithm determined the number and strength of any opponents that would be faced. Some of the missions simply involve exploring a solar system, but more typically some number of alien spaceships need to be destroyed. The algorithm would balance the strength of the enemy against the strength of the team, and this may best be done dynamically.

Given the rapid-fire quality of STO action, in which users are madly press-ing keys and clicking icons with their mouse cursors, it is very difficult for users to communicate while in the midst of space battles. Thus in the early weeks, I seldom saw team members write anything in the text chat designated for the team. Well-established virtual worlds support voice communications among team members. For example, World of Warcraft has an in-world voice system, although some guilds prefer to use external systems like Ventrillo or
Skype. A WoW raiding party can have as many as 40 members, arranged in 8 groups of 5, and typically only the group leaders may speak, although ev-erybody may listen. This reminds us of the problem of information overload , and well-designed semi-automatic systems can prevent users from becoming overwhelmed. In virtual worlds, such systems often employ additional char-acters who personify features of the system and may possess simple artificial intelligence. 6. AGENTS AND SECONDARY AVATARS
The auctioneers at Bree serve merely as entry points to a database for e-commerce, but most gamelike virtual worlds are largely populated with combat
NPCs often represented as human warriors or monsters, but occasionally as sailing ships or spaceships. Although the AI rules that operate them are simple, several of these NPC may operate in the same area, resulting in complex social interactions that are beyond the user X  X  ability to comprehend. In future years, we can expect these AIs to gain considerably greater intelligence on the indi-vidual level [Merrick and Maher 2009], but already their swarm intelligence is substantial.

A common set-up is a group of NPCs of three or four different types in a limited area. Some will be hostile and attack an avatar when it approaches within a certain distance, while others are passive but will fight back when attacked. Some stand in one location, for example, guarding the gate to a castle, while others patrol small areas, and some patrol larger areas or walk along set tracks that may be quite long and twisting. The algorithms that control these movements often include random numbers so that the movements are varied.
A user sends an avatar into such an area to complete a quest, which may be simply killing a certain number of one of these kinds of NPCs, or looting a certain number of objects from them with some probability of success after killing each one, or reaching a goal that requires passing through the area. The user will not enter such an area unless the NPCs are of the correct strength that the user X  X  avatar can defeat any one of them with complete confidence and have a good chance of defeating any pair. An experienced user will scout an escape route in case three NPCs gain up on the avatar and may use a variety of techniques to lure one enemy away from other enemies to kill them singly.

In recent years, gameworld designers have crafted many mass complex bat-tle scenes in which groups of enemy NPCs battle with friendly NPCs and into which users X  avatars may insert themselves singly or in groups. Tabula Rasa had a number of battlefronts in which forts might be taken by raids carried out entirely by a dozen or more NPCs, and any avatars present would help a dozen other NPCs defend the fort. To add to the complexity, healer NPCs operated on both sides, defending themselves if attacked but primarily assist-ing any nearby allied NPC or avatar who had suffered damage in the combat. A geographically complex seacoast in the Borean Tundra region of World of
Warcraft is being defended by friendly walrus men against invading Vikings as about ten boats deliver groups of five Vikings against comparable teams of walrus men whom the user X  X  avatar is supposed to help. These mass NPC battles are so complex and chaotic that they can easily overwhelm the mind of the user, and, in the excitement, the behavior of the NPCs is indistinguishable from the behavior of real people. Thus, interactions with NPCs constitute social behavior.

Earlier I noted that the captain X  X  herald in the Bree auction house was a secondary avatar. Rumilisoun also has a secondary avatar, a bear named
Beorn, whom she can summon to help her battle enemies. Like the NPCs just described, Beorn can be set to be aggressive so he will attack any en-emy who comes within a certain distance, and then can be left to his own devices. Or Rumilisoun can ask him to attack a selected enemy, run back toward her to draw the enemy away from other enemies, and then roar at the enemy to draw its attention if Rumilisoun herself comes under attack as she hurls hot coals at the enemy. Many NPCs use the equivalent of sim-ple machine learning to decide which of their opponents to fight, and Beorn X  X  roars help Rumilisoun manipulate this fact to her advantage. In Age of Conan , necromancer avatars can have as many as six different secondary avatars at once, all doing different things to the enemy, although they move and function as a unit.

Online role-playing games have employed increasingly sophisticated pro-gramming to control ever more complex secondary avatars as social groups. The newest example is Star Trek Online in which as many as four independently controllable secondary avatars may back up the primary avatar as shown in
Figure 3. In the center stands the primary avatar, and all five of these avatars can be customized with force-field shields, body armor, weapons, and various devices.

Each of the four secondary avatars has her or his own distinctive character and functions. The one at the far left is Azura, a Vulcan science officer, who can operate two devices, a vascular regenerator and a medical tricorder, to heal the other avatars. During a battle on the surface of the planet, she will spontaneously come to the aid of one of the others, and Rho Xi can tell her to heal him when he needs to. Flash Gordon at the far right is a Human engineer specializing in semi-autonomous weapons. He can set out a row of Frisbee-sized chroniton mines, which explode when an enemy steps on them, and a self-aiming phaser turret that shoots at enemies like a tertiary avatar helping Flash who in turn helps Rho Xi.

This team of five often beams down to the surface of a planet or into a spaceship, space station, a building, or even a cavern. The user directs Rho
Xi to walk, and the others follow, moving along their own paths and avoiding barriers in the same way a real person would. Occasionally they are joined on site by additional friendly non-player characters who walk around with them, but most of the time the team of five explores territory until it encounters groups of enemies. These battles are amazingly complex. While the user operates Rho
Xi, the default is that the other team members will attack the enemy nearest to the particular team member until the enemy is killed, and each enemy behaves similarly. They don X  X  just stand in one place shooting at each other, but move as a human might, while enemies wielding swords tend to run toward them. At unpredictable moments, team members perform their distinctive tasks. They constantly fire their ray guns, as the enemy fires back at them, thus filling the virtual air with beams of colored light and explosions.

The user has a set of controls to direct the secondary avatars either together or separately. For example, the team often walks toward a group of the enemy, but not close enough to cause them to react. The user then scans the enemy to decide which one to kill first. If the enemy are Klingons, there may be a targ master among them, a high-level enemy who operates two secondary avatars of his own, vicious boars from the planet Qo X  X oS called  X  X args. X  If the targs are killed, the targ master can summon an endless supply of others, so killing the targ master first is a good tactic. But he is hard to kill. So the user will target the targ master, click one icon to make all four secondary avatars start shooting at him, then press a key to make the primary avatar shoot, too.

Unlike the situations in Age of Conan , however, the user in Star Trek Online can set a target for each secondary avatar separately, tell each of them where to stand, and give them separate instructions about whether to attack any nearby enemy or remain passive unless they themselves are attacked. Sometimes a secondary avatar is knocked unconscious and will remain so until revived either by Azura or Rho Xi himself, because he also carries a vascular regenerator.
Furthermore, on occasion the team includes avatars belonging to two or more users, in which case a subset of their secondary avatars will bring the total to five. I interviewed the developers of Star Trek Online about a year before release, and they felt this ability to mix multiple avatars and secondary avatars was an innovative way to make sure that any one user would always have a team whether or not other people were available at the moment to join it.
Dungeons and Dragons Online rivals Star Trek Online in the complexity of its control system for secondary avatars, allowing one avatar to have as many as five main secondary-avatars and an occasional tertiary avatar as well when one of the secondaries has a virtual animal to assist it. The distinctive point about DDO secondaries is that they, like the primary, are mercenaries, specifically called hirelings . In the Market, an avatar can hire one mercenary, paying virtual gold. But it is also possible to hire five avatars using points, which can be bought inside the game for real dollars. Except when special sales are in effect, the lowest cost to buy a point is one US cent, when buying 5,000 of them for $49.99. Most of the dungeons cannot be completed solo, and the main gain comes at the moment of completion so there is good reason for players to team up. The only way to complete most missions solo is by the use of hirelings.
Suppose a middle-ranked solo avatar nears the conclusion of a dungeon that will award many experience points and virtual coins, but dies. Without leaving the dungeon, the player can enter the DDO store, buy a magic cake to restore the avatar to life, and hire five mercenaries for the final battle, for just under $5.00.

Gamelike virtual worlds differ in the particular mixes of social features they possess, and Table III roughly answers seven questions about each of the thirteen. For example, World of Warcraft represents users as human-like intelligent bipeds, although they differ in terms of such details as whether they have horns and tails. However, users ordinarily cannot be represented as sailing shipsastheycanin Pirates of the Burning Se a, or as spaceships as they must in
EVE Online and can in Star Trek Online . However, the first four worlds listed in the table all have options for advanced characters to ride horses or other mounts, thus becoming hybrid human-horse representations, although their actions are usually limited while mounted. Many specific World of Warcraft quests involve wearing disguises or briefly driving vehicles, and, with any of these gameworlds, there may be some situations in which the description in the cell of the table does not apply. In World of Warcraft , the most common secondary avatars are the animal pets of hunters, and the minions of warlocks.
Only A Tale in the Desert lacks enemy non-player characters, and it also lacks any internal money that could support an auction system. Age of Conan has a system for selling virtual goods, but without the competitive bidding that defines an auction.

Despite its great popularity, World of Warcraft is deficient in lacking virtual homes for characters, and some of the other cases are more complex than the simple YES/NO in a box implies. Every character in Pirates of the Burning
Sea has a ship and many own lumber mills, offices, and mines, but the human avatar cannot walk around inside them and thus they are really not homes in the usual sense of the world. However, advanced characters who complete a long series of quests can acquire a real home with beautiful furniture and a virtual spouse. Rumilisoun has abandoned her modest cottage and now owns her own mansion in Lord of the Rings Online , complete with furniture she bought and trophy animals she had stuffed by a taxidermist NPC. Her kinship owns a very large virtual hall at a different location which has become a museum for such trophies. My avatars have belonged to guilds that owned major headquarters in both Age of Conan and Dark Age of Camelot , but only in the latter case did individuals seem to own homes within these guild compounds. The personal home in Star Trek Online is the bridge of the avatar X  X  spaceship, and avatars of other users may be invited to visit. The existing research on virtual world avatars has not given enough attention to the phenomenon of a virtual home, which is a location reserved for private social activities that exist in all real human cultures.. 7. CONCLUSION
Every successful virtual world offers a diversity of communication and interac-tion functions that mirror those in the real world, doing so through information systems that possess some degree of intelligence. However, not every virtual world is based on a coherent theory of society, and the best way to conclude this essay is to describe a problematic case, Star Wars Galaxies . This gameworld allows users to visit many of the locales depicted in the Star Wars movies and is set in a time period immediately after the destruction of the first death star even including an NPC representing Luke Skywalker standing near his fighter spaceship as it cools down from the battle. Solo-player video and computer games in the Star Wars series have generally been of very high quality, and this virtual world has many fine features, but philosophical coherence is not among them.

Building a virtual world based on an existing entertainment franchise presents distinctive challenges. A solo-player game can cast the user in the role of the story X  X  hero, and indeed many of the Star Wars games allow one to become Luke Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi. A massively multi-player game-world cannot do this, because the users cannot all simultaneously operate the same avatar. This is not a problem for Lord of the Rings Online or Star Trek On-line , because the original stories were based on inclusive moral philosophies X  in both cases dealing with issues of diversity in unity X  X hat provide roles for an infinite number of characters to play. The fundamental story line of Star
Wars contains many interesting ideas, but they are elitist and individualistic in the extreme.

When Star Wars Galaxies launched in 2003, it was not possible for a user to become a Jedi knight, the quasi-monastic, pseudo-Zen elite cult that possesses magical powers and to which Luke and Obi-Wan belong. But now anyone may create a Jedi avatar who receives precious little special instruction to gain their abilities. The six movies that form the core of the Star Wars mythos make it very clear that only a very tiny fraction of humanity can become Jedi and that they must train strenuously from early childhood, and the wider society is not involved at all. For example, Jedi masters are not church clergy who serve a laity, and there is no hint that the Jedi philosophy of detachment from emotion and from social relationships is shared by the general public. Perhaps other analysts will argue that Star Wars Galaxies really does embody a social theory, but despite my respect for it, I have difficulty seeing how it does.
Given the variety of social theories embedded in gamelike virtual worlds and the different degrees to which they have such theories, they can be used as laboratories for social science research. In my own explorations, I have often collected quantitative data about avatars and user X  X  behavior, extensive verbiage from the text chats which reflects attitudes and beliefs of users, and innumerable direct observations of human behavior. A vast array of future research projects are possible, and theoretical insights may come especially from examination of how users interact with each other and with artificial intelligences in the context of the guiding theories of comparable gameworlds.
