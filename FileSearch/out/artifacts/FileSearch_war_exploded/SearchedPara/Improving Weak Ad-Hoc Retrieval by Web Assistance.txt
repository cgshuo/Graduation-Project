 Ad-hoc retr i eval i s the fundamental operat i on i n IR ( i nformat i on retr i eval) . G i ven a few-word query represent i ng an i nformat i on need, an IR system i s expected to select, or rank to the top, the set of all relevant documents from a target collect i on . Ad-hoc retr i eval also serves as a pre-process i ng step of reduc i ng a huge collect i on i nto a small, s i gnal-r i ch set for other NLP-i ntens i ve tasks such as quest i on-answer i ng, sum-mar i zat i on, etc . Improv i ng ad-hoc retr i eval has i mportant ram i f i cat i ons not only for normal search i ng, but also for other process i ng downstream .

Over the h i story of TREC ad-hoc exper i ments, one f i nds some quer i es that g i ve good to excellent results wh i le others return i rrelevant answers . We call them strong and weak quer i es respect i vely . Generally, i f the query words are prec i se i n mean i ng l i ke TREC top i c #312 (hydropon i cs), i t has no amb i gu i ty and documents conta i n i ng i t have h i gh probab i l i ty of sat i sfy i ng user needs . However, one l i ke #379 (ma i nstream-i ng) i s vague ; returned results are unsat i sfactory . There are also other factors such as top i c aspects, requ i rements i n a query, etc . that contr i bute to poor effect i veness . What makes a query easy or d i ff i cult i s elus i ve and an unsolved i ssue . S i nce 2003, TREC i n i t i ated the Robust Track [1] that expl i c i tly focuses on how to i mprove the poor performers of a query set . New effect i veness measures were i ntroduced to observe effects on these weak quer i es . Th i s paper expla i ns how data fus i on can i mprove weak query effect i veness, together w i th exper i mental results . It i ntroduces our approach of explo i t i ng the web to def i ne alternate quer i es for enhanc i ng ad-hoc retr i eval, and proposes SVM class i f i cat i on to select sal i ent terms from longer quer i es to probe the web . There are many retr i eval act i v i t i es on closed collect i ons or pr i vate i ntranets that TREC exper i ments s i mulate . They may i n part i cular benef i t from th i s study . The paper i s organ i zed as follows: Sect i on 2 d i scusses some factors that make quer i es weak . Sect i on 3 compares the WWW to other external resources that may a i d re-tr i eval . Sect i on 4 deta i ls our method of web-ass i sted ad-hoc retr i eval . Sect i on 5 re-v i ews methods to select words from longer ad-hoc quer i es to probe the web, and Sec-t i on 6 i ntroduces a new method based on class i f i cat i on, and i ts outcome . Sect i on 7 d i scusses how data fus i on can help weak quer i es . Sect i on 8 has our conclus i on . What makes a query weak and d i ff i cult for retr i eval? Two ma j or causes are (see also [2,3]): 1) retr i eval models generally do not account for word relat i onsh i ps or semant i c i nferences from free texts . Th i s bag-of-words approach causes i rrelevant retr i evals because of wrong i nterpretat i on or unsolved amb i gu i t i es ; 2) short quer i es (one or few words) do not capture the part i cular aspects of a top i c that a user has i n m i nd: e . g . a s i ngle-word query, even i f i t has prec i se mean i ng, i s adequate only i f the requ i rement i s anyth i ng concern i ng the word . W i th i n the bag-of-words approach synonyms cause term m i smatch wh i le homographs mean i ng m i smatch, lead i ng to retr i eval d i ff i cult i es . Also, hyponyms i n quer i es such as  X  X eather-related acc i dents X  are d i ff i cult because documents usually report i nstances of such general concepts i n spec i f i c word i ngs: e . g .  X  X ornadoes X  . The bottom l i ne i s that many retr i eval fa i lures may be attr i buted to i n-adequate user need representat i on .
 S i nce weak quer i es are the focus, two new measures were i ntroduced i n TREC2003 to study effects on them [1]:  X #0p10 X  i s the number of quer i es that have zero prec i s i on at top 10 retr i eved, and  X  X rea X , i s a we i ghted sum of the average prec i -s i on of the 25% weakest quer i es i n a set (e . g . 12 out of 50) . The we i ght i s calculated as  X  k = r x 1/k, where r = query rank (weakest has rank 1) and x = s i ze of set . Th i s we i ghs the weaker ones heav i er . The weak queries in a set are not constant . They may change for d i fferent retr i eval methods .

In Table 1, we show some results of retr i eval us i ng our PIRCS system [4] . The ac-ronym stands for Probab i l i st i c Index i ng and Retr i eval  X  Components  X  System, and i s based on the probab i l i st i c model of [5], but appl i ed to document components (content words) us i ng document self-relevance . The rows  X  X -i n i  X  and  X  X -prf X  (d means  X  X e-scr i pt i on X  query ; t means  X  X  i tle X ) show respect i vely i n i t i al and pseudo-relevance feed-back (PRF) retr i eval results respect i vely for three top i c sets:  X  X ard50 X ,  X 601-50 X  and  X 651-49 X  .  X  X ard50 X  cons i sts of 50 selected from TREC #301-#450 top i cs that are known to be more d i ff i cult .  X 601-50 X  and  X 651-49 X  are top i c sets (s i zes 50 and 49) i ntroduced i n the robust track of TREC2003 and 2004 . Retr i evals are done on TREC-8 collect i ons . S i nce our ob j ect i ve i s to i mprove weak quer i es, we generally w i ll em-phas i s the  X  X ard-50 X   X  X rea X  results . Table 1 shows that  X  X ard50 X  i s i ndeed more d i ff i -cult than the other two sets, hav i ng an  X  X rea X  measure of only . 0063 and #0p10=7 for d-i n i. Also, PRF procedure (d-prf) does not work for these new measures:  X  X rea X  drops to . 0049 compared to d-i n i , wh i le #0p10 more than double to 15 (although overall MAP i mproves to . 1524 from . 1182) . For a weak query, an i n i t i al retr i eval usually does not obta i n any (or only few) good documents and hence defeats the assumpt i on of PRF (wh i ch was recently stud i ed i n [6]) . Query set  X 601-50 X  shows the best  X  X rea X  value . 0839 (d-prf) among the three, and i mproves over i ts d-i n i. Apparently quer i es i n th i s set are suff i c i ently strong for PRF to work . Data rows t-i n i and t-prf show re-sults us i ng the short  X  X  i tle X  sect i on of TREC top i cs . They behave s i m i larly to  X  X escr i p-t i on X  but generally at lower effect i veness . Invest i gators i n the past have sought external resources to help i mprove query repre-sentat i on, such as: doma i n-spec i f i c thesaurus or synonym l i sts [7], WordNet [8] i n order to allev i ate m i smatch or m i ss i ng terms, or collect i on enr i chment [9] to a i d i n PRF . The general exper i ence seems to be that thesaural a i d can be useful when i t matches the top i cal doma i n of a query ; otherw i se results may not be cons i stent . Ex-ternal resources employed so far appear l i m i ted i n scale or scope . When the con-cepts/top i cs of a query are i nadequately covered, one may result i n no i sy rather than helpful ass i stance . The Web has been i n ex i stence for over a decade . It i s vast, dy-nam i c, up-to-date, and for pract i cal purposes an all-doma i n thesaurus that may rem-edy the shortcom i ngs of the other types and be useful to help ad-hoc retr i eval . The Web has been employed i n other tasks, such as quest i on-answer i ng [e . g . 10] or crossl i ngual IR [e . g . 11] . In [12] we i ntroduced a general method of web-ass i sted ad-hoc retr i eval ( i nclud i ng weak quer i es) that, unl i ke other schemes [13,14], does not need i dent i fy i ng wh i ch query i s weak . Th i s i s d i scussed i n the next sect i on . Our web-ass i sted ad-hoc retr i eval procedure i s shown i n F i g . 1 and l i sted below as four steps: Steps 2 and 3 are stra i ght-forward, s i m i lar to steps for PRF . Here we employ the terms to create alternate quer i es rather than for query expans i on . A f i xed number of terms are chosen based on occurrence frequenc i es (&gt; 10) i n the web output . The use of redundancy as the pr i nc i ple of polyrepresentat i on X  . Step 3 may i nvolve web page structure for m i n i ng terms but w i ll not be i nvest i gated here . Step 4, data fus i on of suff i c i ently d i fferent retr i eval l i sts, i s very useful for weak quer i es, and w i ll be d i scussed i n Sec-differing alternate queries from the web using differing web probes and web output . Step 1, select i ng appropr i ate terms (from longer quer i es) to serve as keys to probe the web, i s not tr i v i al, and w i ll be the focus of the next two sect i ons . Unl i ke a thesaurus, the web i s unstructured . Gett i ng assoc i ated terms for a query re-qu i res web search i ng and text m i n i ng . The most i mportant step i s to def i ne su i table key terms as web query and get relevant responses . We employ the popular Google eng i ne for th i s study . Google uses Boolean query to subset the i r web page store to a manageable s i ze, then employs l i nk analys i s and the key terms to rank the pages for output (see http://www . google . com/ i ntl/en/help/ref i nesearch . html) . Thus, for Step 1 (Sec . 4) a web query needs to be Boolean, and because of the no i sy nature of the web, we employ only the AND operator . If the or i g i nal ad-hoc query i s short (e . g . &lt;=6 terms, l i ke quer i es from the  X  X  i tle X  sect i on of TREC top i cs), one j ust AND all terms . If i t i s long, l i ke a sentence, one needs to select terms appropr i ately, otherw i se the long AND express i on w i ll return null . Th i s s i tuat i on i s s i mulated by the  X  X escr i pt i on X  sec-t i on (vary i ng 2-20 terms) of a TREC top i c used as an ad-hoc query . Our concern i s how to select appropriate salient terms from longer queries for web probing. 
Term select i on has occurred i n var i ous contexts and i s d i ff i cult: e . g . i n [16] re-searchers try to m i m i c ed i tors i n form i ng headl i nes for a news story . Its purpose i s for human consumpt i on and i ts requ i rements may be d i fferent from ours . In PRF, terms need to be selected from an i n i t i al retr i eval to expand a query . Current common ap-proach i s to use scores of terms . The technology to select prec i sely a few terms may not be rel i able [6] . In [17], i nvest i gators compare query term d i str i but i ons i n docu-ments-w i th-query-terms and i n a general collect i on v i a KL d i vergence to i dent i fy i mportant terms and evaluate a clar i ty score for a query . Th i s requ i res the equ i valence explore methods of term select i on w i thout rely i ng on an i n i t i al retr i eval . The follow-i ng l i sts some poss i b i l i t i es . 5.1 Manual Select i on: T i tle Terms Each TREC top i c conta i ns mult i ple sect i ons such as:  X  X  i tle X ,  X  X escr i pt i on X ,  X  X arrat i ve X  . The  X  X  i tle X  sect i on (mostly 2-4 words composed manually) i s a succ i nct representat i on of users X  needs . They may be cons i dered as manual selection from the  X  X escr i pt i on X  (although for a few quer i es there are words i n the t i tles that do not appear i n the de-scr i pt i on) . T i tle words are used d i rectly w i thout mod i f i cat i on for web prob i ng . Alter-nate quer i es are then formed and employed for target retr i eval . The result i s very good as shown i n Table1 last row . An average of four runs (us i ng web pages for creat i ng alternate quer i es, sn i ppets only, and whether phrases are used -or not -dur i ng web prob i ng) atta i ns a  X  X ard50 X   X  X rea X  value of . 0129, more than double that  X  X -i n i  X  value of . 0063 . Lesser i mprovements are also observed for other query sets (except  X 601-50 X  #0p10) . Moreover, MAP i mproves over both t-i n i and t-prf, show i ng that web ass i s-tance can be effect i ve for both weak and non-weak  X  X  i tle X  quer i es .
 5.2 Term Select i on by Term We i ght A s i mple automat i c term select i on method i s by term we i ght w . We have exper i -mented w i th select i ng 4 or 5 (w4, w5) best we i ghted terms from the  X  X escr i pt i on X  quer i es . Select i ng less w i ll m i ss many good terms when compared w i th  X  X  i tle X  as model . It i s found that the normal  X  X f* i df X  we i ght (good for retr i eval) does not prov i de as good result as the average term frequency  X  X vtf X  we i ght i ntroduced i n [18] . Th i s i s document frequency of term k respect i vely .

In F i g . 1,  X  X 4 X ,  X  X 5 X  rows show that alternate quer i es result i ng from them atta i ns average  X  X rea X  values of only . 0014-. 0018, far from t-i n i. MAP however i mproves over t-i n i. Select i on by term we i ght seems to favor strong quer i es . 5.3 Term Select i on by Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagg i ng Another approach for term select i on i s based on POS for each  X  X escr i pt i on X  word, such as tagg i ng v i a MINIPAR [19] . For example, TREC query #310:  X  X v i dence that rad i o waves from rad i o towers or car phones affect bra i n cancer occurrence X  i s parsed by MINIPAR w i th the output: In one method, 6 words are chosen i n order of: words from phrases (  X  rad i o wave  X  ), nouns, verbs, or ad j ect i ves . Th i s produces a 6-word web query i n backward order: (rad i o ^ wave ^ occurrence ^ cancer ^ bra i n ^ car) .  X  X hone X  i s ass i gned lower pr i or i ty than the f i rst of the con j uncts . After web prob i ng and terms i n returned output f i ltered by an occurrence threshold, the follow i ng alternat i ve query i s formed w i th i ntegral values denot i ng proport i onal we i ghts der i ved from frequenc i es:  X  cell 7, phone 6, phones 4, cancer 4, research 3, rad i o 3, bra i n 2, rad i at i on 2, health 2, exposure 2 .. X  plus 44 other frequency two and one words .

Other ways of select i ng terms from the parse are poss i ble [12], l i ke cons i der i ng the government  X  X ov X  relat i onsh i p to form phrases, or use MINIPAR X  X  semant i cally tag-g i ng capab i l i ty . Th i s approach has certa i n l i m i tat i ons . F i rst, POS tags may not i nclude the i mportant words among the 5 or 6 selected . For example, ad j ect i ves l i ke  X  X ydroe-lectr i c X  (query #307) and  X  X eenage X  (#658) conta i n the ma i n concepts of those quer i es, yet are ranked below less i mportant nouns . MINIPAR g i ves qu i te accurate POS tags on the whole, but also have occas i onal errors such as:  X  X aunched X  (#303),  X  X alvag i ng X  (#411) tagged as punctuat i on . They may cause the format i on of less effect i ve alter-nate quer i es .
 Table 1 data row 5 shows average result of f i ve d i fferent alternate quer i es based on POS-def i ned web quer i es .  X  X ard50 X   X  X rea X  value . 0036 i s worse than that of d-i n i . 0063 . It also performs worse for  X 601-50 X  set, but i mproves for  X 651-49 X  . Select i ng terms v i a POS for web prob i ng and alternate query retr i eval works for certa i n quer i es but not for others . However, they are still useful during data fusion as discussed later in Section 7 . S i nce manually-created  X  X  i tle X  terms can lead to alternate quer i es w i th good results, we propose to use the  X  X  i tle X  words as model and tra i n an SVM class i f i er to automat i cally select  X  X escr i pt i on X  query terms . SVM class i f i cat i on has been shown to be effect i ve for text categor i zat i on (e . g . [20] though a d i fferent problem), supports non-l i near class i f i cat i on and eas i ly ava i lable . The class i f i er we used i s the  X  -SVM (Support Vec-tor Mach i ne) wh i ch i s ava i lable from the LIBSVM program [21] .

A hyperplane class i f i er attempts to separate i nput attr i buted vectors x i nto two classes by the dec i s i on funct i on: sgn(wx + b) . The parameters w and b can be tra i ned the un i que hyperplane (sgn(wx+b)=0) that g i ves max i mum marg i n of separat i on be-tween classes . Here, x i i s a vector w i th attr i butes that character i zes a  X  X escr i pt i on X  query term, and y i = 1/-1 depend i ng on whether th i s term i s i n the correspond i ng  X  X  i -d i mens i on feature space ij (x i ) and tra i ned on the same above requ i rement w i th only where K i s a kernel such that K(x i ,x) = ij (x i ) X  ij (x) i s dependent only on the dot prod-uct of x i and x, and  X  i are Lagrang i an mult i pl i ers of the dual problem . The  X  -SVM [22] deals w i th non-separable problems by us i ng soft marg i ns, i. e . allow i ng some errors i n the tra i n i ng samples w i th  X  a parameter i nterpreted as an upper bound on the fract i on of marg i n errors . We used the default rad i al bas i s funct i on as kernel .
For tra i n i ng, all terms from 550 TREC ad-hoc top i cs accumulated s i nce TREC-1 m i nus the test set under cons i derat i on are used, s i m i lar to cross-val i dat i on procedures . The three test sets are the terms from the  X  X ard50 X ,  X 601-50 X  and  X 651-49 X  top i c sets .
 Tra i n i ng data excludes twelve top i cs because the  X  X escr i pt i on X  does not conta i n any of are also d i scarded . In pract i ce, the query terms are obta i ned from our retr i eval i ndex f i le, and i nclude some two-word phrases . Th i s leads to the follow i ng stat i st i cs for (tra i n i ng/test i ng):  X  X ard50 X  set (4440/425),  X 601-50 X  (4432/433),  X 651-49 X  (4537/328) .
Each term needs to be character i zed by a set of attr i butes that may descr i be i ts sal i -ence for web prob i ng . After some exper i mentat i on, the follow i ng four attr i butes for a term k are used: query-focused term we i ght w qk , cf k /df k (average term frequency i n documents that conta i n term k), q k , (query term frequency), and  X  i df-rat i o X  def i ned as follows: attr i bute-1: w qk = log [q k /(L q -q k )*(N w -F k )/F k ] attr i bute-2: cf k /df k = (1+  X  *q k )* F k /D k attr i bute-3: q k attr i bute-4: i df-rat i o = log(N d /m i n q {D k })/log(N d /D k ) q = frequency of term k i n query, L q query length, N w , N d are respect i vely the num-ber of terms and documents i n the target collect i on, F k ,, D k are the collect i on and document frequenc i es of term k . w qk i s a query term we i ght used for our PIRCS re-tr i eval and we assume that good we i ght for retr i eval may also be good for web prob-i ng . cf k /df k i s an average term frequency factor [18] that i s useful as term i mportance i nd i cator ; here we we i ghted i t w i th a funct i on of q k . q k i s used by i tself also because of Luhn X  X  observat i on that repeated use ( i n document/query) of a content term i nd i cates i ts i mportance . S i nce tra i n i ng data has no query i dent i ty, i df-rat i o may restore some i nd i cat i on of a term X  X  relat i on w i th others i n a query . These attr i butes are used succes-s i vely as sets of 2, 3 and 4 for character i z i ng terms . The i r results w i ll be denoted as class i f i cat i on w i th two attr i butes c2, c3 and c4 respect i vely .

A test  X  X escr i pt i on X  query, after term select i on by class i f i cat i on, may end up empty, or j ust 1 or 2 terms (because most terms may be class i f i ed as -1) . We augment these quer i es by the terms from w4 (Sec . 5 . 2) before do i ng web prob i ng . If the class i f i cat i on query has &gt;6 terms, i t i s also truncated to s i x . 6.1 Class i f i cat i on-Based Term Select i on: Alternate Query Results In Table 2, rows character i zed by c2 for example mean us i ng the f i rst two attr i butes dur i ng class i f i cat i on . c2||d, c3||d and c4||d mean concatenat i ng the selected terms w i th or i g i nal  X  X escr i pt i on X  (equ i valent to double-we i ght i ng the selected terms) and lead to c2||d &gt; c4||d ~ d-i n i &gt; c3||d . c2||d exceeds d-i n i and h i nts that some i mportant terms are be i ng selected by the procedure . Us i ng only the selected terms for retr i eval (not shown) i s worse than d-i n i however .

Rows c2fpg and c2snpt denote alternate query (formed by web prob i ng w i th se-lected terms only and employ i ng full page or sn i ppets) results . The  X  X ard50 X   X  X rea X  values for c2fpg ( . 0069), and c2snpt ( . 0094) i mprove over d-i n i value of . 0063, but less than  X  X  i tles X  ( . 0129, Table 1) wh i ch can be cons i dered as manually-selected  X  X l-ternate quer i es X  . It appears that learn i ng from the  X  X  i tles X  does help i n focus i ng the enhanced query (c2||d), or def i n i ng better web quer i es (c2fpg, c2snpt) for the weak value .

The best  X  X pg X  and  X  X npt X  results of the three query sets (Table 2) v i a class i f i cat i on are h i ghl i ghted . c4fpg and c4snpt are good for 651-49 set, but overall c2fpg and c2snpt seem to perform best . It i s surpr i s i ng that us i ng only f i rst two features i s supe r i or . One could cons i der these results as d i sappo i nt i ng compared w i th the or i g i nal d-i n i. However, much better i mprovements can be obta i ned by comb i n i ng these re-tr i eval l i sts . Th i s i s d i scussed i n the next sect i on . Assume that one uses two d i fferent algor i thms or representat i ons for a query and results i n two retr i eval l i sts R 1 and R 2 . When l i nearly comb i ned i nto one R=C(  X  ,R 1 ,R 2 ) =  X  *R 1 +(1- X  )*R 2 w i th 0&lt;  X  &lt;1, the average prec i s i on of R, prec(R), may i mprove above prec(R 1 ) and prec(R 2 ) . The i ntu i t i ve explanat i on for th i s i s that d i ffer-ent methods are more l i kely to retr i eve the same core relevant documents, than the same non-relevants . C omb i n i ng retr i evals may synerg i st i cally y i eld better results than the components [23, 24] . When th i s does not mater i al i ze, prec(R) tends to l i e around the average of prec(R 1 ) and prec(R 2 ) i f extreme values of  X  are avo i ded . Th i s phe-nomenon i s observed from past data fus i on exper i ments . For weak quer i es, comb i na-t i on may have spec i al enhanc i ng effect as the follow i ng shows .

Cons i der a set of n=5 quer i es Q i . Assume that Method 1 produces an average pre-perform i ng 2 quer i es, one gets an  X  X rea X  value of . 0 . Suppose a sufficiently different Method 2 produces another sequence l i ke: (Q 3 . 0 ; Q 1 . 0 ; Q 4 . 2 ; Q 2 . 2 ; Q 5 . 2) . Comb i n-i ng correspond i ng retr i eval l i sts of the two w i th  X  tend to produce a sequence qual i ta-i n Method 1(2) but stronger i n Method 2(1) ; we assume they average out and rece i ve no boost . Th i s sequence results i n an  X  X rea X  value &gt; . 0 for the worst 2 quer i es and comb i nat i on i mproves on the component methods . If Method 2 i s not much d i fferent, Q , Q 2 may both reta i n . 0 prec i s i on, w i th l i ttle change i n  X  X rea X  after comb i nat i on . When one employs several sufficiently different methods, the probab i l i ty of quer i es rema i n i ng weak and close to . 0 prec i s i on for all methods (l i ke Q1) d i m i n i shes, and  X  X rea X  w i ll have reasonable probab i l i ty of gett i ng i mprovement after comb i nat i on . Th i s i s also the reason why i n i t i al and PRF retr i eval l i sts should not be comb i ned because the same weak quer i es dur i ng i n i t i al retr i eval w i ll generally rema i n weak dur i ng PRF . For example i n Table 1, the worst perform i ng 12  X  X ard50 X  quer i es for d-i n i d i ffer from those of d-prf by only 2 i n our system . When they are comb i ned as C( . 6,R d-i n i ,R d-prf ) the resultant  X  X rea X  value rema i ns weak at . 0056, m i d-po i nt between that of d-i n i and d-prf .

We s i mulate suff i c i ently d i fferent retr i evals by us i ng var i ous alternate query re-sults: e . g . alternate quer i es v i a term select i on by POS, by class i f i cat i on w i th d i fferent parameters, and mak i ng use of the enhanced i n i t i al retr i evals c2||d . The follow i ng i llustrates how one can employ comb i nat i on to i mprove the  X  X rea X  for  X  X ard50 X  v i a tra i n i ng from  X 601-50 X  and  X 651-49 X  sets . Spec i f i cally, the area-sum( X 601-50 X , X 651-49 X ) i s used as an ob j ect i ve for choos i ng comb i nat i on coeff i c i ents .

In Table 2, last row  X  X os X  denotes an alternate query based on POS w i th 5-term se-lect i on ordered by phrases and nouns . In add i t i on, we assume the three d i fferent types retr i evals .  X  X 2||d X , c4fpg,  X  X 3snpt X  are chosen for data fus i on because they have the h i ghest area-sum( X 601-50 X , X 651-49 X ): . 1017, . 0757, . 0803 respect i vely for i ts type . The progress of data fus i on i s shown part i ally i n Table 3 . Comb i nat i ons C(  X  ,R c2||d ,R c3snpt ) and C(  X  ,R c4fpg ,R pos ) for all  X  i n steps of 0 . 1 are done i ndependently, and the run w i th  X  that max i m i zes area-sum( X 601-50 X , X 651-49 X ) i s chosen . For C(  X  ,R c2||d ,R c3snpt ) i t i s seen that we have m i ssed the best  X  =0 . 7 wh i ch w i ll g i ve  X  X ard50 X   X  X rea X  of . 0098 i nstead of . 0079 at  X  =0 . 5 . However,  X  X ard50 X  values are un-known dur i ng pred i ct i ve process i ng . F i gure 2 shows the average prec i s i on of the worst 12 quer i es before and after data fus i on . The top plot shows enhanced i n i t i al retr i eval c2||d comb i nes w i th alternate quer i es c3snpt and i mproves only from pos i t i on 3 to 8 over the components, because c2||d has much better effect i veness than c3snpt .
 The outermost ser i es of query numbers on the x-ax i s belong to the comb i ned result . It i s seen that quer i es l i ke 401, 442 rema i n weak and not affected much by comb i nat i on . The m i ddle plot shows alternate quer i es c4fpg and pos, and comb i nat i on i mprove-ments are relat i vely large at all pos i t i ons except for the f i rst . The search for  X  i n f i nal retr i eval d-i n i value of . 0063 (Table 1) by 105%, and i mproves over the enhanced i n i t i al retr i eval c2||d value of . 0071 by 82% . The f i nal MAP value of 0 . 1624 i mproves substant i ally over d-i n i value of 0 . 1182 . 37 of the 50 quer i es i mprove and i s stat i st i -compared w i th the enhanced c2||d . Compared to d-prf MAP of . 1524, the i mprove-ment i s not s i gn i f i cant (28 out of 50) . St i ll i t shows that data fus i on w i th web-ass i stance enhances both weak and strong quer i es for the  X  X ard50 X  set . One also ob-serves that, except for quer i es 389 and 401 wh i ch rema i n unaffected and close to . 0 389 and 401, none of the d i fferent alternate quer i es prov i de a better retr i eval . Had we have a strategy to choose the best  X  =0 . 7 at C(  X  ,R c2||d ,R c3snpt ) comb i nat i on, a f i nal  X  X rea X  of . 0138 would result .

Although the alternate quer i es themselves may have med i ocre performance, the i r ab i l i ty to prov i de  X  X  i fferent X  retr i eval l i sts contr i bute to the large  X  X rea X  i mprovements after data fus i on . When s i m i lar procedures were done for query set  X 601-50 X  us i ng max (area-sum( X  X ard50 X , X 651-49 X )) for  X  pred i ct i on, the f i nal area i s . 0748 . For  X 651-49 X  set, i t i s . 0946 .

When one starts from  X  X  i tle X  quer i es, compose alternate quer i es after web prob i ng, and perform data fus i on from the i r retr i eval l i sts, the  X  X ard50 X   X  X rea X  atta i ned range from . 0137 to . 0185 (data not tabulated), and also i mproves over i ts t-i n i average  X  X rea X  value of 0 . 129 (Table 1), though not as substant i ally as for d-i n i. Longer weak quer i es that requ i re sal i ent term select i on st i ll perform less than short  X  X  i tles X  that are composed manually . d i fferent X  retr i eval l i sts i mproves the i r effect i veness . Th i s i s supported by the pred i ct i ve exper i ments i n th i s paper: the  X  X ard50 X  query set  X  X rea X  measure i s i mproved by 105% compared w i th that from the i n i t i al ad-hoc retr i eval and  X 0p10 X , number of quer i es w i th zero prec i s i on at ten documents retr i eved, decreases from 7 to 4 . Th i s represents i mproved qual i ty of retr i eval serv i ce to users . To real i ze such a strategy, we employ the web as an all-doma i n thesaurus, and search i t for related terms to help construct d i fferent alternate quer i es . When the or i g i nal quer i es are longer, POS and SVM clas-s i f i cat i on methods were used to select sal i ent terms for web prob i ng . Short quer i es do not need sal i ent term select i on, and web-ass i stance i s also effect i ve .

Our approach of web-ass i stance and data fus i on i s appl i ed to all quer i es i n a set . It would be useful to have a method to i dent i fy wh i ch query i s weak (or strong) w i th other ways of i mprov i ng sal i ent term select i on for web prob i ng .
