 The main goal of knowledge base population (KBP) is to dis-till entity information (e.g., facts of a person) from multiple unstructured and semi-structured data sources, and incor-porate the information into a knowledge base (KB). In this work, we intend to release an open source KBP toolkit that is publicly available for research purposes.

A knowledge base is a centralized repository for informa-tion. Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 . In KBP2010, 45 teams registered but only 23 submitted results, most probably because some ba-sic analysis components are not available. Therefore, we are distributing a toolkit based on our KBP system which achieved highly-competitive performance in KBP2010. The toolkit is able to not only set up a baseline KBP system for the default task defined in KBP2010 (extracting facts for pre-defined persons or organizations), but also facilitate the development of techniques and customization in distill-ing diversified new entity or attribute types (e.g., product KB for firms, medicine KB for pharmacies).
Our toolkit aims to deal with the following challenges: (1) unstructured information extraction , which re-quires to distill various entity facts (attribute-value pairs) from multiple unstructured and semi-structured data sources. In KBP2010, we developed three pipelines including pattern matching, supervised classification based Information Ex-traction (IE) and Question-Answering based [1]. We choose pattern matching as our baseline technique in the toolkit, because it can be easily customized to distill information for new types of entities and attributes. In contrast, the other two pipelines require domain-specific resources and domain http://nlp.cs.qc.cuny.edu/kbp/2010/
