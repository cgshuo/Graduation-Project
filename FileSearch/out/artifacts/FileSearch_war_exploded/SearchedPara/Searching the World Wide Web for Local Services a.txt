 Many search engines have been designed to capture webpages and other resources on the Web. On Google alone, 250 to 300 million queries are run every day [1]. People search the Web for many reasons and this is reflected in the search queries. Spink et al. [2] report some changes in Web search topics from entertainment and sex in 1997 to commerce, travel, employment, economy and finding people and places in 2001. This indicates that people are gradually increasing use of the Web in responding their life X  X  requirements. Although a certain part of Web queries contain location names or have geospatial dimensions such as driving, shopping or accommodation, general search engines do not provide results in a useful way based on the requested geographical locations [3]. 
This paper sets out to address challenges of location-based search through analysing location-based queries. We first review previous work on geospatial location-based queries. We believe that by distinguishing location-based query patterns, search engines would be able to develop more effective location-based services. for years. However, there are many issues with geospatial information retrieval on the Web which affect search engine results among them the ambiguity of location names and multiple locations related to a webpage are notable. 
Some basics concepts are adopted from other fields especially geography. In 1984, The five themes of geography are movement, human-environment interaction, location, place and region . Based on these themes, location refers to  X  X here X  referring to its relation with other places. Relative location is useful when we have a reference point. For example, we can say the British Museum is located in the centre of London 3 kilometres from City University. 
In the context of the Web, location can be defined as  X  X  place on the Internet where an Internet resource, such as a webpage, is stored X  [7]. However, in many cases, this search engine have been unsuccessful. Current search engines have offered some the USA and Canada [8]. Yahoo Local 2 has a similar function for the USA. The SPIRITS project has tried to make a universal location-based search tool through combining geographical ontologies with query expansion, machine learning and geospatial ranking [9]. Other geographical search tools such as Northern Light 3 or GeoSearch 4 offer limited services. Localization of a website is the procedure of designing a website based on local cultures and needs, and it consists of three levels: identification of website subjects, identification of the target culture and applying localized aspects in the design process [ 10]. Major general search engines such as Yahoo, Google and MSN have developed local services for different countries, regions and languages. Using mobile technologies and GIS techniques, many location-aware or GPS-based devices have been established. 
General issues and techniques of information extraction as well as extracting geographic information such as addresses an d location names have been identified in [11, 12, 13 &amp; 14]. Olga [15] describes an algorithm for finding the class of geographic names i.e. city, region, country, island, river, and mountain by using patterns and adding them to a name and sending this query to a search engine. Based on the number of results, the algorithm determines which geographical category is suitable for the name. For example, the number of retrieved documents for a query like city of Tokyo is probably much higher than something like Tokyo country . table. The system is very accurate for all geographical features excluding city names. The method is time-consuming and is not useful for real-time search. Geographical web services and systems need defining and utilizing ontologies. Such geographical ontologies have been described in [9, 16 &amp; 17]. Watters &amp; Amoudi [3] report on the GeoSearcher project for re-ranking search results based on a location-based approach. GeoSearcher sends a query and a reference point to a search algorithm calculates the distance of select ed webpages from the reference point. The results are then ranked in ascending order of distance. This approach also is slow and needs various online resources. 
Gravano et al. [18] divided Web queries into global and local based on search results. If the best results of a query are local webpages i.e. the information is suitable example, the query wild flowers seems to be global while the query real estate retrieves more local results. The authors used this algorithm to re-rank search engine results for local queries. This method relies on the frequency of location names in the and all location names in a page ar e considered by the algorithm. Work on geographic queries has also been reported by Sanderson &amp; Kohler [19]. The authors ran a survey on the Excite Search Engine 5 to analyse geographic queries. 18.6% of queries had geographic names (including name of mountains, seas, etc.) and 14.8% had location names (cities, states and countries). Geographic queries were classified in different categories and the results show that locations, commerce and services as well as recreation are most common subjects of geographic queries. The study also indicates that geographic queries are often longer than other queries. To support this study, we conducted a survey on the MetaCrawler Search Engine 6 to MetaCrawler that allows tracking of current searches. A random set of 4350 queries was extracted from the Exposed MetaSpy which shows all searches including sex and nudity queries. All queries were manually controlled by the researchers and location names were compared with to various resources in the case of ambiguity. Symbols, characters and Boolean features were ignore d. A typical analysed entry looks like this: Queries written in non-Roman scripts such as Arabic or Chinese were excluded. For similar locations, wherever possible, we considered the bigger or more famous one; otherwise, the same query was sent to MetaCrawler and the location was judged based on the ten first results. Several patte rns for location-based queries were defined based on the surveyed queries. Many webpages have geospatial values and it is possible to assign a location to them. This location might refer to the source [3] or to the target [20]. We define geospatial queries (GSQ) as those containing location names or their subjects refer to special level. For the USA, the name or abbreviations of states are common. Geospatial queries can be divided into two major categories: local queries and location-based queries. 4.1 Local Queries (LQ) A local query (LQ) asks about natural or human-made features on the Earth or location name in them. The quality of a webpage is defined differently by each search engine; however, the search engine X  X  ranking algorithm is applied equally to all webpages. Local queries can be categorized in two groups: Factual Local Queries. These queries ask about facts, figures, geographical and other information which describe a special location. They might be geographic factual questions which ask about geographical facts in the world by use of natural language France. For subject local queries, the quality of a document is more important than the this information comes from. It is possible that the best results for the above mentioned query is obtained from America or Asia but not France. In this case the 4.2 Location-Based Queries (LBQ) We define a location-based query as one that looks for a service, product, business or information is important for location-based queries. For example, if you are looking pollution in Queensland irrespective of the physical location of the document. A query such as wedding service, Queensland seems to be more related to the location. In the latter case, both the quality of information and the location of webpage or the geographical scope of a website is important. The user is probably interested in finding a wedding service in the Australian state of Queensland. 
The location of Web resources can be defined in various ways. The location of a webpage can be considered as its physical location. For example, GeoSearcher [3] tries to find the IP of servers which host web pages and ranks the search results based on the distance of servers from the user X  X  computer. This is a robust algorithm; webpage is better to be extracted through the addresses, metatags, headings and other information in that page or even through the link structure of Web documents. Living needs and daily activities are reflected in the Web queries. People search the Web to find houses, restaurants, car services, jobs and recreation opportunities in their that are not only ranked higher by a search engine but are also geographically close to user or to the location which is determined by the user. The following examples can be considered as location-based queries: Property for sale, Heating and cooling service in 4.3 LQ and LBQ Similarities and Differences At the first glance, it seems to be impossible to determine if a query is location-based or not. The real intention can only be determined by the user. However, there are some criteria that can help us to judge whether a query is LQ or LBQ: Nine different patterns for location-based queries have been determined through the judgement. The list of abbreviations and symbols used in defining patterns are direction or sequence of elements in this pattern. A location-based query often consists of two important components: 1) A service, product, profession or business name (S); and 2) location name (L). As we will show, S is the basic part of a location-based query. 
The following patterns are high-frequent in location-based queries. Fig. 2 shows the order of elements in location-based queries in LBQ patterns. 5.1 Omission of Extra Keywords This is a common pattern for LBQs. People are used to enter a service name S and a location name L without extra keywords or more information (patterns 1 and 3). However, S and L can be divided into two sections (patterns 2 and 4): Examples: New York cabs, Locksmith Melbourne, Cheap takeaway TX, Real estates, Michigan 5.2 Spatial Relationship Many queries have one or more words in them which indicate relations between S and around etc. are used frequently. The query is constructed as: Examples: Car rent in NY, cheap accommodation in Hawaii, Motels around Tokyo 5.3 Geographical Directions Location names accompanied with compass directions (K d ) can make location-based query patterns. North, Southern and South West are examples of directions. The pattern looks like: Examples: Back packers north of Queensland, car delivery in the western London, Thai food 5.4 Possession Many queries follow the rules of natural languages. Possessive prepositions (P) especially OF are used in many location-based queries: Examples: Hotels of Esfehan, Ethnic butcheries of Calgary 5.5 Other Patterns Service Names. Users might use a subject without entering a location name as a reference point. If the subject is a service or business, it is probably a location-based query. This pattern is very common: Examples: List of summer pools, Real estate, Buy coral calcium, Garage sale Addresses and Places. Adding an address (A) such as street address, zip code, building name etc. to a subject indicates that probably the user is interested in a location-based search. In combination with a service or facility name they can make an LBQ: Examples: Oxford Street London shopping, Car service post code 3233 To find the portion of geospatial queries among all Web queries, we added the number of queries containing location names to the number of location-based queries which followed pattern number 8. Table 2 indicates that 14.16% of queries contain location names. Also, more than one third of geospatial queries do not have any location name in them. Altogether, 22.67% of all queries can be considered as geospatial queries which supports the necessity of establishing and improving search facilities for this sort of queries. More than half of the location names are capitals, big cities or small towns (Fig. 1). States and provinces are ranked second and they often include the full name or abbreviation of U.S states. 6.1 Evaluation The dataset was used to measure the coverage of the above-mentioned patterns. Table 3 shows the results of the evaluation. Among the 4350 queries of the dataset, 686 queries (15.76%) have been considered as lo cation-based queries. The last column of the Table 3 surprisingly indicates that about 54% of location-based queries follow pattern 8. In other words, people usually use location-based queries without adding a location. This fact emphasises the importance of developing various methods and tools for determining location-based queries automatically. 
Patterns 1, 3 and 9 cover more than 90% of all location-based queries. They contain only a service name with or without a location name. As a result, it is possible to distinguish and control most of the lo cation-based queries through having access to yellow pages and databases of location names. A comparison with Sanderson X  X  and Kohler X  X  work (Table 4) shows that the proportion of queries with location names in both studies is similar. 6.2 Categories of Subjects Table 5 illustrates different categories of services and products in LBQs. Most of the LBQs look for dealers or services of cars, mobiles, electronic devices etc. 6.3 Ambiguities The patterns described above can help to determine location-based queries. However, it is not possible to differentiate between LBQs and other queries completely without the user X  X  direct assistance. There are several important ambiguities: Service or Subject. It is hard to understand whether a subject is referring to a service estate X  can be a LBQ if the user is searching to find accommodation; or it might be a simple request for facts and information about the profession of real estate.
 Location Name Ambiguity. Many locations in the World have similar names. For example, Newcastle is a city in England as well as in Australia. Sometimes, the name of a location is similar to a person or any other proper name, for example Washington. languages follow different rules and the main challenge is proper transcription. This is a big issue for the Internet; because the content of the Web is developed by numerous people without any linguistic control. User Intention. A query can be similar to an LBQ even though the user is asking for general information or a user may ask a general query while he is interested in location-based information. A location name in a query is not enough to consider it as based information or not. In the Google Local interface for example, the location input is simply separated from the service name. However, these tools have a limited location-based facilities. In this paper, we reviewed the specifics of geospatial queries on the Web that include more than 22% of search queries. While 14% of Web queries have at least a location name in them, they cannot easily be judged as location-based. We discussed earlier that location-based queries are intended to search for products and services related to insufficient in both availability and quality. Although some spatially-aware search tools have been developed, people use general search engines for location-based purposes. In the future, we plan to examine algorithms to determine location-based queries automatically based on the described patterns. This can help search engines to distinguish such queries and treat them properly based on their geospatial dimensions.
