 1. Introduction During the last years, with the expansion of the World Wide Web (WWW), the concept of web-based Personal Health edge. An interesting example of such as kind of tools is Google Health. led to have a vast amount of disseminated information belonging to the same organization with different levels of quality ( Batini &amp; Scannapieco, 2006 ) what makes even more complicated the management of this information.
A way of alleviating this situation consists in limiting somehow the number of web-based PHRs in a collection that are ferent requirements for each one of the users. As Mostafa and Lam (2000) suggested in order to provide a more personalized and tailored knowledge to health-care professionals, the need of an efficient and reliable document filtering process is  X  an extent commensurate with the perceived need. But even techniques like automated retrieval based on interest profiles the focus of the present work is to define the adequate filtering technique to best satisfy users X  information needs.
Soft Computing techniques have shown to be quiet efficient ways of implementing different filtering strategies in order to able better performance in processes required for the management of documents in web dynamic repositories. back on a document is also explained. For this purpose, content analysis and demographic studies are used.
On the other hand, a complex user profile is proposed in Zhang (2008) . This user profile is used to build an adaptive fil-tering model that is represented by graphical models.

Web-based PHRs tools use standards for representing and exchanging data about health-care. One of the most important standards is the Continuity Care Record (CCR) described by Kibbe and Waldren (2005) . In the CCR standard the relevant stood and processed by any application which is CCR-compliant. There are seventeen sections of the CCR standard, although Google Health can be seen in Fig. 1 .

In order to solve the problems in filtering tasks for XML documents, in Herrera-Viedma and Peis (2003) a fuzzy evaluation method of XML documents based on Computing with Words ( Zadrony &amp; Kacprzyk, 2006 ) is presented. This approach is based on the assumption of all items of a XML document are not equally informative. This difference in importance is rep-resented by means of linguistic attributes that are defined and used by an evaluation method to generate linguistic recommendations.

Since we have proved that using fuzzy logic in general and fuzzy deformable prototypes in particular can be successfully approach. Part of our contribution is aimed at creating more flexible and understandable models for executing document filtering tasks.

Cyganiak (2005) , we posit that a way of increasing the power of fuzzy models for document filtering in web documents filtering by means of profiles based on fuzzy prototypes. The main conclusion we have reached is that using such as kind of document filtering techniques, users can benefit from a better performance of web-based PHRs repository management sys-tems, i.e., the document filtering process allows users to manage more efficiently the accessible web-based PHRs.
The remainder of the work is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data quality dimensions that are the basis for experiments that have been conducted to validate our proposal are explained and analyzed, and in Section 5 some conclu-sions and future works are pointed out. 2. Data quality model for web PHR document filtering common DQ management work. Meeting the overall level of DQ of a document enables a stakeholder (a user or a system) to reaches an adequate level of quality according to certain DQ model (a set of DQ dimensions). It must have been highlighted that the  X  X  X itness for use X  X  depends on both the data quality requirements established by an user for the task in which the documents are being used, and also according to the role that the user is going to play. Commonly, the DQ requirements need to establish the adequate mechanisms for obtaining the measures for the DQ model.

Due to the nature of the data, measurement of data quality is quite complex since many issues have to be observed, like subjectivity or the definition of the measurement methods when defining the corresponding measures ( Caballero et al., 2007 ). Besides, the measurement must be done within an organizational environment. For making operative our proposal, a DQ model for assessing incoming documents into the document repository, and to improve the performance of the pro-posed filtering model has been chosen.

For our proposes, we have chosen a DQ model which consists of the following dimensions: completeness, reputation, time-used in CCR is XML, we have described the measures and methods as they should be implemented for managing XML. 2.1. Completeness Attending to health-care professionals X  requirements, and taking into account the definition found in Pipino, Lee, and will be the degree of completeness of the overall document.

In orderto measurethe completenessof eachelementwe have defineda derived measure , name takenaccordingto the mea-surement terminology provided in DQMIM ( Caballero et al., 2007 ), this derived measure which has as measurement function  X  X  X he proportion between the numbers of child items contained in each element divided by the total amount of items could be to be  X  X  X ncomplete X  X  (degree 0). Otherwise, the completeness degree is the ratio between the numbers of elements with a not nullvalueandthemaximumnumberofchildelementsthatcanbegeneratedasspecifiedbytheXSDoftheCCRstandard( Kibbe &amp; Waldren, 2005 ). Thus, the completeness of the whole document will be computed using the following Eq. (1) : where j i is the completeness degree of the element i and N is the number of elements of the CCR document. The obtained value is in the interval [0, 1]. 2.2. Reputation represents the information source. Health data for web PHRs can be supplied by patients, wellness providers and health-care point to compute an indicator of the quality of health data in a PHR. This indicator is based on the reputation of the data provider, and on metadata provided by measurement devices and is especially suitable to cover specific web-based PHR requirements. In this case, we propose to rate reputation in a range [ 1, 1] where the zero, the middle value, represents can be interpreted as an indication of how much reliable a particular source is. 2.3. Timeliness
The timeliness of a document is a way of estimating the level of the freshness of a document for the temporal context in update processes, as well as the update interval, the retrieval delay, etc.

The measure method consists of a procedure that compares the difference between a meaningful date previously estab-lished (which is strongly dependent on the context of the task at hand of users), and the date in which the document was generated, or even on the date of generation/update of the element of the CCR document (child element DateTime) which is date X  X  is the most relevant DateTime in the element. 2.4. Contextual Relevance
The Contextual Relevance ( R c ) of a document is computed by using the compatibility between the document contents and search, learning) and the user domain of knowledge (cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, etc.).
This contextual representation based on ontologies is extracted from the definitions stored in MeSH shown in Table 1 .

In this case the context and the document (or a CCR element) could be considered as fuzzy sets because they consist of words that have a membership degree. Therefore, the compatibility between context and document could be computed by using the generalized Jaccard coefficient as is used in Cross and Sudkamp (2002) . 2.5. Personal Relevance
In order to compute the degree of Personal Relevance ( r p percentage with all the documents on the user profile. Each concept has a weight in the user profile which represents how profile u can be calculated as proposed in Eq. (2) . profiles in which the concept i has a membership degree greater than 0.
 process new documents.

In order to determine the personal relevance of a CCR element, it is necessary to perform a comparison between the fea-the concepts contained within the new element and the concepts that belong to the definition of the user profile are used.
Therefore, a value of personal relevance r p of the document with respect to the user is obtained using Eq. (3) . where w d i is the weight of the concept i in the CCR element d , and w u set u and j D j is the number of different concepts that occur within the CCR element. 2.6. DQ Measure for Fuzzy Document Filtering
In order to obtain a summarizing value for representing the DQ level of a document according to the proposed model, we depicted a new measure dqfdf (DQ Measure for Fuzzy Document Filtering). As can be seen, the DQ model consists of the fol-lowing dimensions: completeness ( c ), reputation ( r ), timeliness ( t ), contextual relevance ( r tion, dqfdf also requires an analysis model C which is set in our work by means of Eq. (4) : curate, and consequently it would be appropriate to use fuzzy rules to assess DQ properly.
 output is a value obtained after a defuzzification process. In this work a Mamdani-style fuzzy system has been employed
The fuzzy inference process is performed in three steps: these inputs belong to each of the appropriate fuzzy sets. The membership functions of these three features, computed by using heuristic considerations, are shown in Fig. 2 . iable that is defined by five membership functions ({ X  X  X ery high X  X ,  X  X  X igh X  X ,  X  X  X ormal X  X ,  X  X  X ow X  X  and  X  X  X ery low X  X  X ). ( Klir &amp; Yuan, 1995 ).

Algorithm 1. Rule example if completeness is POOR AND reputation is HIGH then end if On the other hand, the aggregated degree of relevance is obtained using an operator U represented by a function U : R 2 ! R as is shown in Eq. (5) where denotes a fuzzy disjunction operator (t-conorm). The use of the algebraic sum as t-conorm allows us to obtain bet-dqfdf can be defined as: where the square root is used as the linguistic hedge  X  X  X ore or less X  X  according to the explained in Zadeh (1972) about the decision criteria results. denotes the fuzzy conjunction operator (t-norm). The product as t-norm allows us to obtain the best results on the empirical experiments carried out in this work.
 The previously explained process to compute the dqfdf measure can be considered as a framework to adapt the proposed
DQ model to any environment. The linguistic hedge, the fuzzy operators, the fuzzy rules and the considered DQ dimensions can be changed to build an efficient filtering model in any domain context.

The model can be shown as a linguistic model, i.e., we can only describe the whole filtering model by using natural lan-guage. For example, considering that the CCR elements with high dqfdf values will be processed, the model can be described as follows: If the document has more or less quality AND is relevant to the user then it will be processed.
 The document will be relevant to the user if it is relevant to the user context or profile.

The document will have quality according to a rule set, for example, a possible rule can be:  X  X  X f the document is complete, its timeliness is high and the author has a good reputation then the document will have a high level of quality X  X . 3. Fuzzy prototypes-based filtering
There is a constant flow of incoming information in a web PHRs repository. Taking into account the noise can be intro-needs. Therefore, a filtering model, which discriminates those documents, has to take into account the user preferences. In this work, we propose a filtering model based on the combination of the DQ model previously explained and Fuzzy through automatic document processing (DQ dimension computing). Each user profile is represented by an extension of Za-deh X  X  fuzzy prototypes ( Zadeh, 1982 ) named Fuzzy Deformable Prototypes. In each user profile, each one of the pieces of information has a membership degree with respect to the profiles in which is integrated ( Romero et al., 2007 ). This model management of the continuous flow of incoming PHR contents. 3.1. Fuzzy Deformable Prototypes
In this work, we introduce the concept of Fuzzy Deformable Prototypes ( Olivas, 2000 ) to represent each user profile pro-totype in a web-based PHRs repository. Fuzzy Deformable Prototypes (from now on FDPs) can provide an adequate formal framework for working with this idea. FDPs come from the confluence of two interesting approaches to the concept of pro-tion, and the fuzzy prototypes of Zadeh ( Zadeh, 1982 ). Below is a brief description of both concepts. In the framework of  X  X  X eformable prototypes X  X , a real element is classified according to the minimum energies required for physically deforming gathering of good, bad and borderline elements of a category.

The definition of Fuzzy Deformable Prototypes inherits some features from Zadeh X  X  fuzzy prototype approach, but adding some extensions in order to manage the complexity of the real world problems. For example, in FDPs, the number of fuzzy prototypes depends on the problem.
 membership degree. representing the corresponding high , medium and low membership degrees respectively.

Each level of stratification of 1 has this fuzzy prototype obtained by using this iterative process. Following an iterative process, one can obtain an object summarizing each level of stratification which can be viewed as a fuzzy prototype.
For example, P t ( 1 good ) is the fuzzy prototype of 1 good by Eq. (8) .

For example, considering a researcher into the textitlung diseases field as system user, a web PHR used by this researcher including pneumonia diseases and another web PHR observing cold diseases fully belong to this profile. On the other hand, the degree of representativeness (or prototypicality) of the web PHR that includes pneumonia is certainly larger than the other.
 Taking into account these approaches, FDP ( Olivas, 2000 ) can be defined as a linear combination of Fuzzy Prototypical of membership to each of these Fuzzy Prototypical Categories. Broadening the combination described in the concept of would be: where C real represents the real situation ( w 1 , w 2 ... w ( , v 2 ... v n ) are the attributes that define each one of these Fuzzy Prototypical Categories. 3.2. Filtering model profile.
 groups having similar degree of representativeness. The goal is to generate conceptual prototypes (Zadeh X  X  approach: fuzzy schemes) that allow evaluating new contents from these patterns and performing actions.

In this case, the degree of representativeness of each document in the user profile is computed by using the dqfdf degree sions like completeness are the same for any user, the DQ dimensions related to the personal and contextual relevance allow the computation of a personalized DQ level.

Each fuzzy prototype is formally represented as a set of fuzzy sets. Each fuzzy set will represent the different kinds of affinity of contents to the user profile. A prototype P j three or four parameters respectively: Algorithm 2. Divisive clustering algorithm Compute the dqfdf value of each element.

We start at the top with all documents in one cluster: one sorted list of dqfdf values. distance ( i , i +1) value i +1 value i threshold average ( distance ( i , i + 1)) repeat until maxd &gt; threshold
The steps of the process to obtain the parameters that define each triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy set are the following ones: divided clustering algorithm proposed in Algorithm 2 . A simple example of this process can be seen in Fig. 3 . 2. Representation : The medium, minimum and maximum values of dqfdf on each group and the distance between consec-utive prototypes are used to compute the parameters that define each fuzzy set (see Olivas (2000) ). represented by a set of fuzzy numbers as can be seen in Fig. 4 (three final prototypes).

For document management purposes, the definition is fulfilled with an action frame ( Minsky, 1974 ). These frames are used as parametric definition of the prototypes. The frame contains probabilities of actions to perform when a new web
PHR element is created or updated. This action framework could be used as a spam filter or to emphasize the most important documents according to the user preferences. The main purpose is to maximize productivity by processing more documents with less effort. These actions have been defined by following the instructions of the  X  X  X etting Things Done X  X  (GTD) method ( Allen, 2001 ) for personal productivity enhancement, they are very important for the user in order to enhance his produc-tivity and to reduce the information overload. The actions to be performed could be the following: Read it now : The document is classified and immediately shown to the user.
 Waiting for : The document is classified and a bookmark of new incoming document is activated.

Only store : The document is classified, but the user is not notified about this fact. user, i.e., when the dqfdf value is zero or very close to zero.

The probabilities of actions are defined by using linguistic labels such as very high (VH  X  100%), high (H  X  75%), medium (M  X  50%), low (L  X  25%) and very low (VL  X  0%). The frames are built taking into account both the number of prototypes and the level of overlapping among them. Otherwise, the user specification, an automatic process of extraction or a supervised learning process could be the method to build them. Table 2 shows an example of these frames in the case of three proto-prototypes can be seen in Fig. 4 ). Each document may be associated with several management actions at the same time. This approach can be considered useful to manage web PHR repositories because the model based on Fuzzy Deformable
Prototypes is flexible, there are some parameters (DQ dimensions, rules, computing methods) used to customize the model to several environments; understandable because the model can be defined in linguistic terms; and adaptive, when a new content appears in the repository the model is deformed to manage this content and to update its own definition. 3.3. Filtering process
The task of carrying out an automatic and accurate management of each new or updated CCR elements is complex. It is cured results, without delays or loss of effectiveness.

The process to deal with each of new or updated CCR element in the repository consists of the following steps: 1. Element pre-processing: (a) The element is identified as a type of element of the CCR Standard (procedure, problem, function, etc.). (b) The values describing each element (datetime, descriptions, codifications, actor) are extracted. (c) The descriptions are conceptually represented, i.e., in order to obtain a conceptual comparison between the element 2. dqfdf computation: (a) The completeness level is obtained according to the components that are fulfilled. (b) The timeliness is computed by using a comparison between a reference datetime and the most recent datetime that (c) The reputation level is obtained according to the recommendations provided in van Deursen et al. (2008) . (d) The context and personal relevance are computed by using a conceptual matching process between the concepts that (e) Fuzzification of the obtained values of completeness, timeliness and reputation. (f) The inference process using the defined rules according to Mamdani specification is carried out. (g) Compute the contextual relevance comparing the concepts that occur in the element and the concepts that occur in (h) Compute the personal relevance comparing the concepts that occur in the element and the concepts that occur in the (i) Computing the dqfdf value according to the operators previously explained in Section 2 . affinity with fuzzy numbers. Thus a document can have a positive affinity degree with several prototypes. 4. The current prototype is established with a modified linear combination of the defined prototypes using the degrees of affinity with the prototypes as weight values. 5. Using the prototype that defines the processed CCR element, the system can store the document in the personal repos-itory of the user in which an enough positive relation has been reached. The system can also perform the required or rec-ommended actions to manage the document. The probability of the actions could be computed by using only the most similar prototype or with the aggregation of all similar prototypes. 3.4. Example
Given a set of documents with the same health professional, for example, a traumatologist, we can build his user profile based on DQ criteria and FDP X  X . The source documents used to build the user profile are the CCR elements where the CCR elements where the user role is  X  X  X reating clinician X  X . Once the dqfdf value of each document has been computed, the 90% of these documents have a completeness level of 1, 7% of them has a completeness level of 0.71 and 3% a level of 0.57. On the other hand the reputation of this user is 0.98 and the 15% of documents obtain a timeliness level of 1 and 38% of documents has timeliness level lower than 0.5.

In this case the user X  X  context has been represented by a set of words extracted from MeSH whereas the user profile used to compute the personal relevance has been also represented by a set of keywords extracted from the source documents (see Table 3 ). The degree of representativeness of each keyword is computed as it is explained in Section 2 .
Once all necessary data have been extracted, the dqfdf value for each source document is computed following the process ( Figs. 5 ).

This user profile also contains the parametric definitions of each fuzzy prototype that defines the actions to be performed each new or updated CCR element must be managed according to user X  X  preferences.

Let us explain by means of an example. Let us consider that the document shown in Figs. 5 and 6 is new in the system and it must be processed. After the document pre-processing step, it is necessary to compute the values of the DQ dimensions of this element. The obtained results are shown in Table 5 .

The CCR element is not complete because the values corresponding to its codification are not present. The timeliness is measured using the end of the year 2004 as reference. The contextual relevance is 0.54 because the description contains the the description belong to the user X  X  personal profile with high weights.
 degree of the element is greater than 0 with regard to only prototype P related prototype and its parametric definition will be utilized to manage the CCR element.

Following the step 5 of our filtering process, the actions to be performed in order to manage this CCR element will be the following ones according to the parametric definition of the prototype P (75%). Occasionally the element will be shown as priority to the user because the action  X  X  X ead it now X  X  has only medium probability (50%). This is because the values are high but not enough to pay more attention to the element.
In this example it has not been necessary to deform the prototypes because only one of them has obtained a higher affin-ity than zero. 4. Experiments
Evaluation has always been a key issue in the development of document filtering systems. Therefore, it is necessary to use the correct methodologies and metrics to evaluate the document filtering approach. For example in Liu (2007) an evaluation framework specifically designed for assessing and comparing performance of filtering systems is presented in the context of information access tools. This framework contains all the important aspects in the evaluation tasks such as the methodology and the recommended metrics to provide multiple levels of analysis for document filtering systems. 4.1. Evaluation measures
The management of documents related to users and the filtering of non-related documents require different evaluation ( Yang &amp; Liu, 1999 ).
 We compute the values of P and R for each user i by the following equations: where c represents the total number of elements managed correctly (the performed and theoretical actions are the same); t is the total number of managed documents (some actions have been chosen to manage the document); and s the total num-ber of documents that should be managed (the set of documents to be managed theoretically, according to the point of view of an expert).

The precision and recall measures are related in an inverse way, the higher the level of precision, the lower the level of means high quality level.
 In order to evaluate the aggregated results we compute the average of F -measure (Eq. (12) ) values for each user i : where n i are the number of documents related to the user i , N is the total number of documents and F sure for the user i .
 In addition the misclassification ratio ( MR ) is used to evaluate the filtering of out-space test documents (Eq. (13) ), where n m represents the number of misclassified elements with regard to the non-related documents for each user and n the number of the non-related documents for each user. The filtering model should avoid managing non-related documents, i.e., low MR values. 4.2. Web-based PHR experiment Some experiments have been carried out in order to analyze our approach. Owing to the difficulty obtaining real Personal
Health Records, we needed a clinical database which allowed us to build a CCR collection of documents. However for con-2004 with no patient identification. This clinical information contains around two thousand possible CCR elements according to the subset of the CCR standard supported by Google Health. From these records we built all the possible web-based PHRs and then all of them were stored them into a native XML database.

There are many small patient records, 65% of the records in this collection have less than five elements. There are also a numeric ID.

We have grouped the generated CCR documents into two parts based on the date they were written: (1) the test set, which consists of the documents after 2004 (included), and (2) the training set, which consists of the documents before 2004. In addition, we have randomly chosen five users among the most important departments in the health-care organiza-tion: traumatology (TRA), oftalmology (OFT), otolaryngology (OTO), surgery (SUR) and urology (URO). The training data set for all these users contains all the CCR elements, where each user plays the role of  X  X  X reating clinician X  X . user department, and (2) the set of non-related elements that consists of the remainder elements in the test data set. They help to investigate the system performance in document management and filtering, respectively. The reference date to com-tion used in this experiment. The test data set includes 57 documents related to departments not considered in this study. user profile are built by using the process previously explained.
The assessment process consists in processing every document according to the filtering process explained in Section 3.3 and then comparing the obtained actions and the theoretical actions. The theoretical actions are established by using some external information from the source database that does not appear in the CCR element. The criteria were as follows: If the necessary to perform any action. Table 7 shows results in terms of related elements management as well as non-related ele-ments filtering.

Our first analysis is focused on examining the tasks related to information management, i.e., the precision, recall and F-measure values. High values of these indicators mean high quality of the information management model. The average and minimum value of precision (0.84 and 0.70, respectively) are acceptable values and show that the model is suitable for the proposed objectives. The highest value of precision (0.91) has been achieved by the user with more documents in both train-nization which contains professionals who make very different surgery procedures among us, for example, in the same department there are problems related to the digestive system diseases and to the skin and connective tissue diseases. A similar problem has been detected in the case of the otolaryngology user.

On the other hand, for all the users, we achieved a low MR level, always lower than 10%. This means the documents non-the 90% of cases.

Along with the obtained results in the management process, the filtering results further justify the contributions of DQ-based fuzzy prototypes to filtering in CCR documents: the management performance is good and the actions are effective, while at the same time, the system avoids the information overload.
 only contextual and personal relevance, (3) all parameters. The comparative results are shown in Fig. 8 .
The complete filtering model provides significant improvement to the model which considers only the personal and con-textual relevance. Comparing the average performances, it provides 23% improvement in precision (0.87 vs. 0.70), 14% in F -measure (0.86 vs 0.85) and 63% reduction in MR (0.07 vs. 0.18).Only comparing the recall average performance the results are similar (0.85 vs 0.84). The complete filtering model does also provide significant improvement to the model which con-siders the dimensions of completeness, reputation and timeliness with the exception of the recall performances. This result is not surprising because the MR ratio is high enough to allow an almost perfect value of recall. The improvements on pre-cision, F-measure and MR are 60%, 43% and 93%, respectively. 4.3. OHSUMED experiment In order to carry out a proper comparison with other methods, using the same documents and conditions we choice OH-SUMED like alternative data set ( Hersh, Buckley, Leone, &amp; Hickam, 1994 ). According to previous works, OHSUMED corpus ler et al., 2007 ).

In this work, we use the OHSCAL subset of OHSUMED ( Han &amp; Karypis, 2000 ). This document collection consists of 11,162 documents and includes 10 categories: Antibodies, Carcinoma, DNA, In Vitro, Molecular-Sequence-Data, Pregnancy, Progno-works ( Tan, 2007; Zhang, 2008 ).

The experiment has been carried out according to the following steps: 1. The full documents included in OHSCAL are extracted from OHSUMED to be represented by XML. Next, the document collection is divided into three parts, two parts are used for training and the remaining third for testing. 2. dqfdf computation: (a) The completeness (all the documents have titles, but only a subset of them have abstracts), timeliness (according to (b) The context of each user/category is extracted from MeSH. For example, the context of the user/category Carcinoma is (c) The user profile used to compute the personal relevance is built from the documents that belong to each category in 3. Construction of the filtering model based on FDP X  X  for each category.
We have carried out five independent experiments on OHSCAL. The average of all performances has been used as final result (five-fold cross validation). The average F-measure of the experiments is 0.76. These experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than works like Tan (2007) ( F -measure = 0.72), Yan, Jin-tao, Bin, and Chun-rithm ( F -measure = 0.75) mentioned in Zhang (2008) , but the results are lower than the work by Zhang (2008) ( F -mea-sure = 0.80). This is not surprising because our approach is not only based on the document contents and the influence of some DQ dimensions like reputation, timeliness or completeness in the OHSCAL documents is lower than in the real CCR documents. 5. Conclusions
In this work, an approach to optimize the management of a great amount of web-based Personal Health Records by means of filtering based on Fuzzy Deformable Prototypes (FDP) has been presented. An analysis based on DQ criteria has been also
The novelty of our approach is addressed in the evaluation of documents against a DQ model. Thus, using several DQ dimen-used in the generation of a set of fuzzy deformable prototypes for each user. The prototypes reflect the different kinds of affinities of the contents with regard to the user.
The DQ model and fuzzy prototypes-based approaches are flexibly assembled using techniques mainly grounded on fuzzy of filtering in terms of precision, recall and misclassification ratio.

Further research will include an improvement of the filtering model when context and personal definitions are not spe-according to the CDA format, part of the HL7 standard ( Kim, Tran, &amp; Cho, 2006 ), will be carried out.
