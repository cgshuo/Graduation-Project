 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval. Algorithms, Experimentation, Languages. Personalized Multilingual Information Retrieval, User Modeling. A general characteristic of Information Retrieval ( IR) and Multilingual IR (M IR) [5] systems is that if the same query was submitted by different users, the system would yield the same results, reg ardless of the user. On the other hand, Adaptive Hypermedia (AH) systems operate in a personalized manner where the services are adapted to the user [1]. Personalized IR (PIR) is motivated by the success in both areas, IR and AH [4]. IR systems have the advantage of scalability and AH systems have the advantage of satisfying individual user needs. The majority of studies in PIR literature have focused on monolingual IR, and relatively little work has been done concerning multilingual IR. This PhD research study aims to improve personalization in MIR systems, by improving the relevance of multilingual search results with respect to the user and not just the query. The study investigates how to model different aspects of a multilingual search user. Information about users can be demographic information, such as language and country, or information about the user X  X  search interests . This information can be gathered explicitly by asking the user to supply the required information or implicitly by inferring the information from the user X  X  search history. The study will then investigate how to exploit the modeled user information to personalize the user X  X  multilingual search by performing query and result list adaptation. The main research questions that are addressed in this study are: how to improve the relevance of search results with respect to individual users in PMIR and how to construct profiles that represent aspects and interests of a multilingual search user. 
So far, the work carried out for this study included: (1 ) a proposed framework for the delivery and evaluation of PMIR [3] ; and (2) e xploratory experiments with search history and collection (result) re -ranking on a dataset of multilingual searc h logs [2] . The next stage of experimentation will involve the investigation and development of algorithms for: (1) constructing multilingual user profiles; (2) pre -translation and post -translation query expansion based on terms from the user profile; and (3) result list re-ranking based on the user X  X  interests, and preferred language.
