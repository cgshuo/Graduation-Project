 With the rapid growth of online news services, users can ac-tively respond to online news by making comments. Users often express subjective emotions in comments such as sad-ness, surprise and anger. Such emotions can help understand the preferences and perspectives of individual users, and therefore may facilitate online publishers to provide users with more relevant services. This paper tackles the task of predicting emotions for the comments of online news. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work for addressing the task. In particular, this paper proposes a nov-el Meta classification approach that exploits heterogeneous information sources such as the content of the comments and the emotion tags of news articles generated by users. The experiments on two datasets from online news services demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The emergence of social media is reshaping the way how people consume news. Online readers can actively respond to online news by making comments. Users often express subjective emotions in the comments such as sadness, sur-prise and anger. Such emotions can help understand the preferences and perspectives of individual users, and there-fore may facilitate online publishers to provide users with more personalized services. It is a challenging and practi-cal research problem to automatically assign emotion tags to users X  comments of online news. One natural approach to achieving the goal is to classify users X  comments into dif-ferent emotion tags based on the contents of the comments. On the other side, an increasing number of social news web- X 
This research is partially supported by NSF of China re-search grants 61170184, and also partially supported by NSF research grants IIS-0746830, CNS-1012208 and IIS-1017837. Here the feature vector  X  i is composed by the count of each term in the i th comment.  X  k denotes the combination pa-rameters for each term with emotion e k , and can be esti-mated by maximizing log-likelihood function with L2 (i.e., ridge) regularization. It is worth noting that N E k =1 c ik =1.
The second one is derived from the emotion tags of news articles generated by users, namely User Emotion Tags Mod-el (UM). We can follow the ratio of votes of each emotion to all emotions for tagging emotion for comments. Let u ik de-note how likely the i th comment will be tagged by emotion e according to the information of emotion tags.

To better integrate the two heterogeneous information sources, a Meta classifier approach is utilized for emotion tagging of users X  comments, called Meta Classification Mod-el (MCM). We use the outputs of the above models as fea-tures, and also add a constant feature as the bias. Therefore, the probability that emotion e k will be assigned to the i th comment can be estimated as below,
P ( e k | c i ,u i )= exp( where  X  ,  X  and  X  denote the combination parameters for bias, the source of comments content and the source of e-motion tags of news articles respectively. These parameters can be determined by maximizing the log-likelihood function (i.e., Quasi-Newton optimization method in this paper).
We collected most-viewed news articles and their some most popular comments and emotion tags, in one month of 2011 from the society channel of Sina News and the en-tertainment channel of QQ News 2 . Both Sina and QQ are among the largest news portals in China. We use these Chi-nese datasets since we have not found similar services in En-glish yet, but the proposed model is language independent. We then sample 200 news articles from each news service to construct our two datasets. All news articles and users X  comments are segmented to terms by a Chinese word seg-mentation software: ICTCLAS 3 . The two datasets contain 8,794 distinct terms in 3,593 comments and 9,401 distinct terms in 3,623 comments respectively. For each dataset, one person was asked to label an emotion tag for each commen-t from 8 predefined emotion categories which are the same as the emotion tags in news services. The distributions of labeled comments on the 8 emotions are shown in Figure 2. We compare the performances of emotion tagging using CM, UM and MCM with 10-fold cross validation on two dataset. Two measures are adopted: mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and accuracy ( A @ n ). Given a comment c , its labeled emotion e c and predicted emotion set E nc including n top-ranked emotions, A c @ n is defined as, Thus, A @ n for the collection C is: A @ n = c  X  C A c @ n/ | C | . Table 1 shows MRR and A @ n ( n =1 , 2 , 3) in each dataset. A @ n ( n =1 , 2 , ..., 8) is shown in Figure 3. Based on these results, we can make the following observations: 1) CM per-forms much better than UM. This seems to indicate that http://ent.qq.com/. http://www.ictclas.org.
