In this article we focus on binary variables, i.e. , x over the set of variables x = ( x where Z is a normalization constant and  X  In various applications, the computation of marginal distributions p p called Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), often gives good approximation. LBP is a message passing algorithm. For each directed edge, a message vector  X  and initialized arbitrarily. The update rule of messages is given by where N to a fixed point {  X   X  with normalization b ( x i ,x j ) &gt; 0 and the minimum is taken over all probability distributions on ( x energy defined by F Leibler divergence from ^ p to p .
