 Vocabulary mismatch between documents and queries, when the searchers and authors of relevant documents use different terms to refer to the same con-cepts, is one of the major causes of poor initial results for some queries (or retrieval results, improvement of retrieval accuracy for such queries cannot be achieved by employing standard techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, and requires utilization of additional resources, such as term graphs. Term graphs are weighted directed graphs, in which the nodes correspond to the basic lex-ical units (terms or phrases) and the weighted edges represent the strength of semantic relatedness between a pair of such units. Term graphs are rich sources of terms for query and document expansion and can be constructed either man-ually or automatically. Automatically constructed term graphs (or statistical term association graphs) are derived from document collections by calculating a term co-occurrence based information-theoretic measure, such as mutual infor-mation (MI) [ 8 ], for each pair of distinct terms in the vocabulary of a collection. Besides term association graphs, expansion LMs can also be derived from man-ually curated knowledge repositories, such as ConceptNet [ 6 ]) (large semantic network) or DBpedia (Wikipedia infoboxes represented as an RDF graph). applied to address the problem of vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc information retrieval through document and query expansion. In particular, Karimzadehgan and Zhai [ 2 ] leveraged the MI-based term association graph to estimate trans-lation model for document expansion, Kotov and Zhai [ 3 ] used term association graphs for interactive query disambiguation and Bai et al. [ 1 ] experimented with using different number of top-k related terms from statistical term association graphs for query expansion. All these methods expand a given query or document term with either the top-k or all related terms from the term association graph . We, however, hypothesize that unstructured and indiscriminate utilization of term association graphs results in suboptimal retrieval performance , since statis-tical term association graphs are usually fairly noisy. To overcome this problem, we propose to capture semantic structure in term association graphs through graph clustering and leverage the identified clusters to derive more precise and robust query expansion language models (LMs) to improve the retrieval results of difficult queries.
 a fragment of a term graph, which includes the query term  X  X reek X  from the TREC topic 433  X  X reek philosophy, stoicism X  and the 8 terms that are most strongly associated with it. Previously proposed methods [ 1 , 2 ] include all these related terms into the resulting expansion LM. Instead, we propose to apply graph clustering methods to term graphs to first determine a set of clusters (connected components) with an intuition that such components correspond to sets of semantically coherent expansion terms. Given a query, our method would then include only those related terms from a term graph that are in the same clusters with the query terms. We hypothesize that such filtering allows to effec-tively discard spurious term associations and improve the retrieval effectiveness of resulting expansion LMs. Applying the proposed method to our example, the query term  X  X reek X  will contribute the terms  X  X reece X ,  X  X yprus X ,  X  X ypriot X  and  X  X thens X  to the query expansion LM (shown in gray shade).
 posed clustering-based retrieval methods [ 5 , 7 ] is that our method leverages clusters in a term graph, rather than a document collection. The main con-tributions of this work are two-fold:  X  we propose a method to derive more robust query expansion LMs based on leveraging clusters in term graphs and experimentally demonstrate that the query expansion LMs constructed using the proposed method are more effec-tive in improving the accuracy of difficult queries than the query expansion
LMs obtained by including all related terms;  X  we compare the retrieval effectiveness of term association graphs with term graphs derived from popular knowledge repositories (DBpedia and Concept-
Net). Although ConceptNet [ 4 ] and Wikipedia [ 10 ] have both been individ-ually utilized for different IR tasks, our approach is the first to leverage the clusters in term graphs derived from these knowledge repositories. 2.1 Term Graph Construction and Clustering The proposed method uses mutual information (MI) [ 8 ], a co-occurrence based information-theoretic measure, to captures semantic relatedness between the nodes in the term graph. Infomap [ 9 ]isa state-of-the-art , non-parametric algorithm for finding communities in large networks, which utilizes information-theoretic measures and models stochastic graph flow to obtain the optimal clus-ters. The algorithm uses hierarchical map equation to measure the per-step average code length necessary to describe a random walker X  X  movements on a graph, given its hierarchical partition, and finds the partition that minimizes the code length. For a term graph with n nodes divided into m modules, the lower bound on the code length is defined by the map equation: where Q i is the probability of the random walk to exit the partition i and p the frequency of node j .
 2.2 Datasets For all experiments in this work we used AQUAINT, ROBUST and GOV TREC collections, various statistics of which are summarized in Table 1 . For each exper-imental dataset, we constructed a term association graph using MI as a simi-larity measure. DBpedia term graph was constructed by treating DBpedia 3.9 extended abstracts, which contain all the words in the first section of Wikipedia articles, as a document collection and using MI as a similarity measure. Concept-Net term graph was constructed by removing all non-English terms and negative associations from the core ConceptNet 5 term graph. We considered two versions of the ConceptNet term graph. The first version uses original weights of edges provided with ConceptNet 5 ( CNET ) 2 , while in the second version, the weights between the concepts are calculated for each collection using MI ( CNET-MI ). We further customized Wikipedia and ConceptNet term graphs for each exper-imental collection by removing all the nodes that do not occur in the index of that collection.
 collection term association graphs include COL-ALL , which uses all related terms to construct query expansion LM and COL-INFO , which selects expan-sion terms based on Infomap clustering. Similarly, WIKI-ALL , CNET-ALL , CNET-MI-ALL use all related terms from the corresponding term graph, while WIKI-INFO , CNET-INFO , CNET-MI-INFO filter expansion terms based on Infomap clustering from Wikipedia and ConceptNet term graphs, respec-tively. 2.3 Retrieval Model and Query Expansion We used the KL-divergence retrieval model with Dirichlet prior smoothing [ 11 ] ( KL-DIR ), according to which the retrieval task involves estimating  X  query language model (LM) for a given keyword query Q = { and document language models  X  D i for each document D i in the document collection C = { D 1 ,...,D m } . We define a query as difficult (or hard), if the average precision of results retrieved with the KL-DIR retrieval model is less than 0.1.
 via linear interpolation of the original query model P ( w LM P ( w |  X  Q ) with parameter  X  : involves finding a set of semantically related terms E q i (i.e. all direct neighbors of the query term q i in the term graph that are in the same term graph cluster C q i as q i ) and normalizing the probabilities using the following formula: We pre-processed each dataset by removing stopwords and stemming (using Porter stemmer). To construct collection term association graphs, we removed all the terms that either occur in less than five documents or in more than 10 % of all documents in a given collection. We used the following settings of Infomap parameters: self link teleportation probability was set to 0.1, node teleportation probability was to 0.01 and random seed to 111222333. The optimal value for self link teleportation probability was determined empirically to reduce the number of very small clusters (which include less than 5 terms). We used the KL-DIR retrieval model and document expansion using translation model based on MI term graph ( TM )[ 2 ] as the baselines. The reported results are based on the optimal settings of the Dirichlet prior  X  , interpolation parameter  X  that were empirically determined for all methods and the baselines. Summary of retrieval performance of the proposed methods and the baselines on each experimental dataset is provided in Tables 2 , 3 and 4 . The entries corresponding to the highest and second highest values were highlighted in boldface and italics. We performed statistical significance testing of MAP values using Wilcoxon signed rank test ( and  X  represent statistically significance difference (p &lt; 0.05) relative to KL-DIR and TM baselines, respectively).
 Several conclusions can be drawn from experimental results. First, cluster-based filtering of query expansion LMs derived from both statistical term asso-ciation graphs and knowledge base term graphs improves retrieval performance in majority of cases on all 3 experimental collections. This indicates that graph clustering is effective at capturing semantically strong associations in the con-text of a given collection, while discarding the spurious ones. Secondly, query expansion LMs based on filtered term graphs derived from Wikipedia and Con-ceptNet ( WIKI-INFO , CNET-INFO , CNET-MI-INFO ) generally outper-formed query expansion LMs derived from association term graphs ( COL-ALL and COL-INFO ) as well as document expansion based on translation model ( TM ) according to all metrics on all datasets. Finally, term graphs derived from ConceptNet generally outperformed the ones derived from Wikipedia on all 3 collections, which highlights the importance of commonsense knowledge in IR besides entity information in DBpedia. In this paper, we proposed a method to derive more accurate query expansion LMs by clustering term graphs and experimentally demonstrated that apply-ing this method to statistical term association graphs and term graphs derived from knowledge bases translates into more accurate retrieval results for difficult queries.
