 Abstract Since 1999, the Dutch Language Union (NTU) fosters the exchange of plans and policy initiatives amongst government officials of Flanders and the Netherlands on human language technology for Dutch (HLTD). One of the out-comes is the STEVIN R&amp;D programme for HLTD, coordinated by the NTU and funded by the Flemish and Dutch governments. STEVIN is an example of suc-cessful joint research programming. Its set-up, highlights and scientific results are presented as well as an outlook to future initiatives.
 Keywords HLT programme STEVIN HLT policy design Dutch 1 Introduction Worldwide some 6,000 languages are spoken today. If no digital infrastructure for a language is available, that language might become irrelevant and even disappear altogether in the modern information and communication technology (ICT) driven society. 1 Hence, it is not uncommon that governments support their national language(s) to remain a fully fledged language. One of their means is to finance research and development (R&amp;D) programmes for human language technology (HLT) and/or contract private companies to develop HLT products axled around the national language(s).

Dutch is the official language of two neighbouring countries, of the Netherlands and the Flemish part of Belgium. The observation that language policy decisions taken on one side of the national border affect citizens at the other side of the border led in 1980 to the creation of the Dutch Language Union (Nederlandse Taalunie X  NTU), an intergovernmental organisation. The NTU X  X  mission is to deal with all issues concerning the position of the Dutch language. In an ICT based society, a language needs a digital infrastructure (digital corpora and dictionaries, software and lingware modules, etc.) to maintain its position as  X  X  X sed and useful X  X  language. The existence of the NTU strongly facilitates the coordination of joint HLTD programming in the Low Countries as well as the running of a common HLTD infrastructure centre. The NTU launched several policy initiatives, which a.o. resulted in the creation of the HLT Agency for Dutch (van Veenendaal et al. 2013 ) and an HLTD R&amp;D programme , baptised STEVIN 2 (Spyns and D X  X alleweyn 2013 ).

The next sections discuss the STEVIN programme (Sect. 2 ) and the HLT Agency (Sect. 3 ). The paper ends with an outlook on future plans (Sect. 4 ) and some conclusions (Sect. 5 ). 2 STEVIN 2.1 Why Languages that are below the top 50 spoken languages in the world, like Dutch, face the challenge that some basic digital linguistic resources and necessary building blocks for HLT applications are too costly to be profitably developed by private enterprises. As a consequence, the HLT market for these languages remains limited as software integrators and customers are unaware of the potential and qualities of HLT for the local language. If  X  X  X he X  X  market fails to invest, it is not uncommon for a government to intervene with financial measures, mainly subsidies and/or tax reduction. Supporting HLT R&amp;D for the national languages is in many cases seen as a matter of  X  X  X ational interest X  X  or considered in terms of pride of the local culture that needs  X  X  X rotection X  X  against a more dominant culture. Consequently, the Flemish and Dutch governments decided in 2004 to spend 11.4 million euros on the HLTD sector (industry and academia; D X  X alleweyn et al. 2006 ) to stimulate HLT for the Dutch language. Three main goals were aimed at: (1) promoting strategic research in HLT and developing for Dutch a set of essential HLT resources, called the Basic Language Resources Kit (BLARK); 3 (2) raising awareness of HLTD results and stimulating the demand for HLT products, and (3) organising the management, maintenance and distribution of HLTD resources through the HLT Agency. 2.2 How The Flemish-Dutch joint HLT STEVIN programme was comprehensive in many respects. First of all, it was based on co-operation between government, academia and industry both in Flanders and the Netherlands. Co-operation between governments in research programming saves money and effort by avoiding duplication of activities and enhances scientific excellence thanks to an increased competition. Secondly, the programme encompasses the whole range from basic resources to applications for a broad spectre of language users. To that end, a programme committee, consisting of local Flemish and Dutch HLT experts, wrote a detailed multi-annual research programme (topics, outcomes, instruments, timing, ... ). Several calls for project proposals were issued over time. In total, STEVIN awarded 19 R&amp;D projects (8.909 K euros), 14 demonstrator projects (1,011 K euros), 3 educational projects (100 K euros), 2 master classes (33 K euros) and 33 networking grants (45 K euros). 4 Thirdly, in the framework of STEVIN attention was paid to the distribution, dissemination and utilisation of project results by means of the HLT Agency (see Sect. 3 ).

The NTU was an appropriate coordinator thank s to its intergovernmental (and neutral) status. The participating Dutch and Flemi sh funding bodies were willing to apply the  X  X  X eal common pot X  X  scheme. Flanders contributed 3.8 M euros and the Netherlands provided 7.6 M euros (1/3 vs. 2/3). As the NTU was responsible for the distribution of the funding to the projects, the geographic origin of the money disappeared. A common programme office was established to organis e the project calls, to properly monitor the projects, and to take care of the practic al concerns of operating an R&amp;D programme.
All proposals went through the same  X  X  X ipe line X  X  of common procedures and evaluation criteria. R&amp;D proposals were evaluated and ranked according to their scientific excellence by a committee of international HLT experts. The bi-national STEVIN programme committee additionally checked some  X  X  X ocal X  X  constraints, such as the ratios between speech and language proposals, academic and industrial involvement, and Flemish and Dutch participation. Finally, the HLT board 5 took the decision on the funding, based on the advice (ranking) by the scientific reviewers. It was only at that moment that the funding proportion between participants from Flanders and the Netherlands was considered. Clearly, the scientific quality determined the distribution of the funding in the conviction that increased competition (from groups from both Flanders and the Netherlands) leads to scientific excellence. More or less 36 % of the funding went to Flemish parties and around 64 % to Dutch parties.
It is evident that substantial time and effort was invested in preparing this joint research programme. An entirely new  X  X  X rogramme infrastructure X  X  had to be set up: a.o. a single framework of funding rules, evaluation procedures for the various types of calls, intellectual property rights (IPR) templates depending on specific IPR arrangement situations, and project progress monitoring arrangements. A further complication was the fact that the whole framework had to satisfy various national traditions, and also it had to reconcile the different targets of the various funding bodies (funding scientific research vs. supporting innovation at companies). Even after 5 years of preparation, some important issues (e.g. how to handle IPR) still needed redress and fine-tuning as the programme progressed ( X  X  X earning by doing X  X  was the motto). On the other hand, this created an opportunity to introduce some innovations at the policy level (e.g. regarding the ownership of the results X  X ee Sect. 3 ).

To ensure that the project results would find their way to users (academic researchers and companies targeting actual end users) and to avoid fast obsoles-cence of the materials developed, it was decided that the NTU became the owner and maintainer (via its HLT Agency X  X ee Sect. 3 ) of the STEVIN results. This guarantees a long term responsibility and (re)liability for the management and maintenance of the resources. For the researchers this implied that they actually had to deliver more or less finalised and transferable outputs (well documented corpora, tools etc.) instead of only promising to spend research time. In return, the burden of administrative and scientific progress reporting was relatively low. This shift in focus (materials delivered instead of research time spent) was rather new for the research institutes but justifiable from the funders X  point of view as the main focus of the STEVIN programme was to realise a re-usable BLARK for Dutch (cf. Sect. 2.1 ).

The STEVIN programme has undergone a thorough evaluation by a trusted third party, Technopolis Group. 6 Due to space limitations we can only refer to (Spyns and D X  X alleweyn 2012 ; Spyns 2013 ) for details (e.g., on the evaluation method, the perception of industrial partners on STEVIN, etc.) and recommendations. Accord-ing to Technopolis Group, the general targets of the STEVIN programme have been reached to a (very) large extent. 2.3 What In this section, we briefly outline the results that the various R&amp;D projects delivered (Sect. 2.3 ). We refer to the STEVIN book for a more detailed scientific account, including bibliography, of the projects (Spyns and Odijk 2013 ) and to the STEVIN results booklet for a two page summary of every project, including the non R&amp;D projects (Odijk 2013 ).

The NTU, as the owner of an important number of HLTD resources, took the initiative to set up the HLT Agency. 7 It has as its mission to manage, maintain and distribute as a  X  X  X ne-stop-shop X  X  digital language resources for Dutch (corpora, tools, lexica etc.) for the benefit of research and development in academia and industry so that Dutch remains a  X  X  X ully equipped X  X  language in the current information society. The HLT Agency is hosted and financed by the NTU. A local agency was preferred (to existing international organisations) as it profits from being directly embedded in the HLTD innovation ecosystem. The HLT Agency additionally takes care of clearing IPR issues and managing the licenses of the resources in its portfolio. The growing use of open source distribution models presents new challenges to the HLT Agency in its conception of a central maintenance and distribution point. Therefore, it focusses on knowledge management and service delivery to customers. For the sake of clarity, note that the HLT Agency does not produce resources itself nor performs evaluation campaigns.

At the end of a STEVIN R&amp;D project, the ownership and rights of the results were, in principle, transferred to the NTU and the materials were physically handed over to the HLT Agency. 8 The aim was that materials, tools etc. remain easily accessible for research and industry in the hope that new research results, products and services are created thanks to these materials. Therefore, the HLT board (see footnote 5) decided that for non commercial organisations the STEVIN resources and tools available from the HLT Agency should be provided for free (except for handling costs), unless protected background material is involved. In the latter case, a fair license price has to be agreed upon. STEVIN licenses for commercial organisations are moderately priced (with a modest degree of cost recovery). In order to determine a suitable price for a license for commercial use, a pricing committee was established.

A fully self supporting HLT Agency is most probably an illusion due to the limited commercial volume of the Dutch speaking area. Also, the explicit assignment of the HLT Agency to support the stimulation of the HLTD industry goes against a full cost recovery model. Therefore, prices for commercial use will always be (substantially) lower than what would be the case in a full cost recovery driven price setting scheme. Depending on the resource a flat fee or a royalty based scheme applies. When research groups (as part of an established community) have used open source resources, or were willing to further develop and maintain these themselves on a long term basis, open source licensing schemes or variants were an option. 9 A careful scrutiny of the precise open source license however is needed as the various open source licensing schemes imply different degrees of freedom to operate. In this case, some agreement or link with the HLT Agency remains necessary for the latter to maintain itself as a one-stop-shop for HLTD. 4 Outlook With the advent of the CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) network (Va  X  radi et al. 2008 ), the HLTD horizon has widened to researchers in social sciences and humanities in the European Union. The way these scientists use the HL(T) materials will steer future research agendas. Inevitably (and perhaps luckily) this will impact future Flemish-Dutch R&amp;D co-operation and the jointly funded HLT Agency. Likewise, a similar tendency seems to apply to industrial and technological research. The European Commission has funded the META-Net 10 network of excellence that, amongst other things, also aimed at setting up an HLT infrastructure (called META-Share) to promote sharing and re-using of speech and language resources and technology by private industry. META-Net recently published a strategic research agenda (Rehm and Uszkoreit 2012 ). This will create industry demand driven research agendas that complement the CLARIN academic research agendas. Both surely constitute interesting sources of inspiration for future joint research coordination for HLTD.

The NTU, as the structural funder (for both the Flemish and Dutch governments) of the HLT Agency and the owner of the STEVIN results is one of the founding members of the CLARIN ERIC. 11 Obviously, the NTU membership only covers the jointly funded HLT resources and tools for Dutch. Next to that, the Netherlands have taken the lead in the European CLARIN endeavour and are hosting the CLARIN ERIC coordination centre. Flanders currently adopts a more modest approach: it pays for the Flemish ERIC membership fee, finances networking and training activities in Flanders and participates in the CLARIN ERIC via the NTU. To improve its outreach towards industry (in Europe), the HLT Agency could become a META-Share node in the future. 5 Conclusion STEVIN is an example of effective and successful joint research programming. Several Flemish and Dutch departments and agencies, each with their priorities and working habits, covering economy and sciences collaborated in creating a comprehensive programme that ranged from resource creation over strategic R&amp;D to applied research and applications development. Many useful resources and tools are now available that will strengthen the position of Dutch in the modern ICT society. Technology dissemination, resource management and maintenance, and IPR issues are addressed by the HLT Agency. The existence of the NTU as a Flemish-Dutch intergovernmental organisation proved to be instrumental for starting this HLTD policy coordination effort. All the parties involved recognise that common HLTD interests exist. The NTU, loyal to its mission statement, has taken up the challenging task of trying to pave the way for new HLTD joint coordination initiatives.
