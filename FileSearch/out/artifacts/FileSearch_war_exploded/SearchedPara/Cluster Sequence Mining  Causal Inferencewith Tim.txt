 (CCM)[ 6 ]. CCM extracts and lists pairs of clusters with both high intra-cluster density in the data space and high inter-cluster co-occurrence in the sequence of events. They applied CCM to extract co-occurrence patterns from acoustic emission (signal) events in a fuel cell to infer mechanical interactions among com-ponents. In addition, they also applied CCM to extract earthquake co-occurrence patterns wherein different areas may affect each other[ 4 ].
 and time intervals of events when evaluating co-occurrence. Obviously, order and time intervals play important roles because causal events must precede an observable effect. In this work, we extend CCM by introducing the order and time intervals of events into co-occurrence. We refer to this algorithm as cluster sequence mining (CSM) because co-occurrence does not imply an order of events. In physical phenomena such as earthquakes, there is no typical time interval, i.e., power law. Therefore, we utilize a Bayesian framework to infer a probability den-small number of observations and noise because it combines a prior distribution and observations, i.e., Bayesian learning. We then introduce the inferred pdf of the time intervals into the evaluation of candidate patterns in CSM. To the best of our knowledge, no other method can extract such a sequence of clusters from multidimensional event sequence with order and time intervals.
 of extracting more precise cluster patterns than CCM under uncertainty of time intervals in terms of the F-measure between an embedded true pattern and an extracted pattern. We then applied CSM to earthquake event sequence data to infer the causality of earthquake occurrences. The patterns extracted from the hypocenter catalog data from the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake indicated that high affecting/affected areas were identifiable in the subduction zone farther away from the main shock. 2.1 Problem Definition This section introduces the characteristics of data addressed by this work. We then define the requirements of cluster sequence patterns.

Note that calculation of time intervals has several options; however, in this work we employ the simplest definition, i.e., the nearest posterior event for a prior event with a single correspondence. 2.3 Inference of Probability Density Function of Time Intervals Observed time intervals have uncertainty caused by noise, the number of obser-vations, and the definition of time interval calculation. Therefore, we introduce a Bayesian framework based on a probabilistic model. Assume that time intervals are distributed by a pdf, e.g., a Gaussian, gamma, or exponential distribution.  X  (  X  | t Here, because we assume exponential distribution for the likelihood,  X  (  X  )and  X  (  X  | t as gamma distributions are conjugate distributions of the exponential distribu-Ga(1,1) was used for all experiments. By using Bayes X  rule (Eq. ( 1 )), the update rule of the posterior is given by # { t distribution has greater effect. From the definition of gamma distribution, we optimal parameter of the pdf for a given pattern P A  X  B as  X   X  AB =  X  post . 2.4 Evaluation Function Here, we define an evaluation function to search for cluster sequence patterns. We search pairs of clusters A , B  X  X  using the following evaluation function: thresholds L m in and Supp m in , then these patterns are added to the output pat-the number of time intervals between H i and H j described in Section 2.2 . Third, to eliminate similar patterns, the algorithm checks the inclusion between the patterns and removes patterns from P that have lower evaluation score (Step 3; cates, due to a property of AHC, that both prior and posterior clusters from two patterns are an inclusion relation.
 Algorithm 1. CLUSTER SEQUENCE MINING 3.1 Data Generation Process The synthetic data were generated as follows: 1. Generate N data points in two-dimensional space from a normal distribution indicates an evaluation score for cluster A extracted by CSM. An extracted pat-tern with the highest L score was evaluated. As for the parameters in CSM,  X  = 100 . 0and  X  =1 . 0 in functions F and G were used. Then an average of 30 trials with varying random numbers is plotted in the graph. Here, since CCM extracts a to compare with CSM.
 generation process of the synthetic data, it is obvious that CSM outperforms CCM, however we refer CCM as a baseline. In addition, CSM can infer a prior and a posterior clusters and time intervals between them.
 CSM maintains a high F-measure with a lower number of true pairs, i.e., with significant amounts of noise. When T = 400, CCM is competitive with CSM; however, the standard deviation of the scores in 30 trials was lower than that of CSM (0.015 (CSM) and 0.14 (CCM)), which means that CSM is more stable than CCM.

 We applied the proposed CSM to earthquake event data to identify seismic causality between different areas afflicted by the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. The purpose of this study is not earthquake prediction but to advance the under-standing of the mechanical interactions of seismic induced activity. 4.1 Earthquake Event Data and Settings We applied CSM to the hypocenter catalog data recorded from Jan. 1 st , 2011 to Dec. 31 st , 2012 released by the Japan Meteorological Agency 1 . Each event has an origin time (JST), hypocenter (latitude, longitude, and depth), and magnitude. We omitted events distant from Japan, i.e., only events between 23  X  Nand50  X  N and between 129  X  E and 156  X  E were used. The events within this region with a magnitude greater than four were used for analysis; 5954 seismic events were recorded in that period, and these events are plotted in Fig. 6(a) . merging clusters, and Euclidean distance was used for the distance metric. We did not include depth because there were only minor differences in depth in the same areas. We employed Ward X  X  method empirically by checking the dendro-gram, e.g., a chaining effect and monotonicity.
 to causal inference. In these methods, earthquake occurrence is modeled by a Poisson process; thus, an exponential distribution is also assumed. 0 . 8and Supp min = 8, the balancing parameter in L was set to  X  =0 . 5, which is equal weights in F and G , and the sharpness parameters in F and G were set to  X  =1 . 0,  X  =0 . 03 in order to obtain wide ranging scores. Although we have used several parameters, most of the parameters are not difficult to adjust if a user knows the meaning and effects of each parameter. Note that we performed approximately 10 trials to adjust these parameters. With these parameters, 37 patterns were extracted. The average of estimated time intervals  X   X  AB among the 37 patterns was 3.71 days. 4.2 Extracted Patterns Figure 6 shows the extracted representative patterns. A cluster with red events indicates a prior cluster, and a cluster with green events indicates a posterior cluster. Some clusters in the patterns could be geographically close or an inclu-sion relation of AHC or identical clusters. Most of the patterns are located off event sequence to infer causality between different areas. The results demon-strated that CSM extracts highly affecting/affected earthquake occurrence pat-terns. Note that the current calculation of time intervals in CSM uses only a single correspondence between events; thus, in future DP (dynamic program-ming) matching could be employed to allow multiple correspondences properly.
