 In spite of rapid growth of text-based instant messaging (IM) in diverse settings, emotion communication in IM has received limited empirical scrutiny, especially inside casual settings. The main goal of my dissertation project is to, through design research, critically examine how users communicate their emotions in IM and to establish user-centered design solutions to comprehensively support emoti onal communication via this medium. H.5.2. Information Interfaces and Presentation: User Interfaces Instant messaging (IM); text-based CMC; Design research; emotional communication Technology has revolutionized the way people communicate. People use a variety of media to enhance and extend interpersonal communication depending on social, security, or efficiency factors. Communications media, however, affects the quantity and quality of the messages and can change senders X  and receivers X  behavior and attitudes [1]. Instan t messaging (IM), as one type of synchronous text-based com puter-mediated communication (CMC), is not an exception. Despite the advantages of IM communication (e.g. convenience, mobility, and control) over face-to-face, the absence of visual and aural nonverbal behaviors affects communication. There are two lines of research that have studied the effect of IM technology on interpersonal communication. One line of research showed that the lack of visual and aural nonverbal cues causes some lim itations on users X  emotional communication in IM [12]. IM users sometimes have difficulties expressing their emotions accurately and fail to accurately understand the actual emotion comi ng from their partners due to the absence of visual and aural nonverbal behaviors. According to Mehrabian [6], in everyday communications only 7% of peoples X  emotional communication ste mmed from the words spoken, whereas 38% was attributed to verb al tone and 55% was related to facial expression. Aligned with th is line of research, the absence of visual and aural nonverbal cues in IM and its limits on emotional communication presents a variety of new challenges and opportunities for researchers in the area of HCI and design. A growing number of features, mostly technology focused, such as emoticons, avatars, haptics, a nd dynamic typography, have been integrated with existing IM systems to support emotional communication [5]. This technol ogical-focus leads to developing systems that are novel, but not always able to satisfy user needs in emotional communication via text-based IM. Another line of research, however , showed that as IM began growing in everyday life, especi ally among teenagers and college students [10], despite the absence of visual and aural nonverbal behaviors, communicators disc overed new ways to adjust emotional communication to IM. One of the main theories representing this perspective is Social Information Processing (SIP) [11]. SIP argues that people are able to employ different active and passive strategies to convey visual and aural nonverbal behaviors in text-based CMC. Supporting SIP, a growing number of studies have identified different strategies (e.g. verbosity, speed of response, or degree of agr eement) and diverse text-based emotional cues (e.g. lexical surrogates such as haha, and aha, vocal spelling such as sooo, and weeell) users apply to express their emotions in IM [3,4,9]. User-centered design research [13] is needed to connect these bodies of literature, first to e xplore how IM users communicate emotions, and second to establis h creative solutions to support emotional communication through th is medium. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to , through design research, critically examine how users communicate their emotions in IM and to establish user-centered design solutions to comprehensively support emotional communication vi a this medium. With a more complete understanding of users X  emotional communication in IM, the design issues and corre sponding design solutions involved will identify gaps in theories and models of emotional communication. They will also provide a solid, long-term intellectual basis for the creation of substantially improved text-based CMC applications. Such applications will support emotional communication and minimize emotional miscommunication that may occur due to the absence of visual and aural nonverbal behaviors in IM. To achieve the main goal of the project a mixed-methodology approach will be taken through following three specific aims: Aim #1: Investigating which emotions are most challenging for users to express in IM communication, to narrow the design focus. To reach this aim of the project, a quantitative approach will be taken to investigate to what extent different emotional states (contentment, angry, happy, and sad) influence the type and proportions of emotional cues indi viduals apply to express their emotions in the actual context of informal IM conversations. The type and quantity of emotional cues users apply to express different emotions could be a possible indicator of how challenging those emotions are communicated in IM. Participants will be involved in informal emo tional conversations with their friends in IM and their conve rsations will be quantitatively analyzed to identify how emotional states affect the type and proportion of text-based cues us ers applied to communicate their emotions. Several open-ended ques tions will also be asked about what emotions participants c onsider the most challenging to communicate in IM. Accomplishi ng this aim provides initial results to narrow the design focus for the following aims and refine the problem space. Aim #2: Critically examining how people communicate the emotions identified in Aim #1 in IM. To reach this aim of the project, a qualitative approach will be taken to examine how users communicate the emotions identified in Aim #1 in IM conversations. Parts of IM convers ations related to those specific emotions from Aim #1 will be analyzed through conversation analysis to investigate how emotions are expressed, responded to, and developed in IM conversations. Accomplishing this aim provides a framework for emotional communication in the context of informal IM conversations and will detail the different strategies and emotional cues users apply to communicate the emotions identified in Aim #1 in IM. Aim #1 and #2 will provide an upfront research foundation for Aim #3. Aim #3: Establishing and evaluating innovative non-text based design solutions to support co mmunication of the emotions identified in Aim #1 in IM, based on the findings identified in Aim #2. To reach this aim of the project, based on the strong foundation gained through Aim #1 and #2, design ideation brainstorming and participatory design sessions will be conducted to gain insights and establish a nd evaluate non-text based design solutions to support communication of the emotions identified in Aim #1 in IM. Through an active process of ideating, iterating, and critiquing potential design solutions, the output of this aim will be 1) a concrete problem framing of communication of the emotions identified in Aim #1 in IM, 2) articulation of the preferred styles of the communicati on of those emotions in IM, 3) a set of non-text-based design solutions to support communication of those emotions in IM, and 4) challenges encountered in this design process and insight for future studies. Emotional communication is fundament al to everyday interaction. How well emotions are communicated is crucial to interpersonal relationships and individual well-being [2]. Emotional communication in IM can be challenging sometimes because of the absence of visual and aural nonverbal behaviors in IM. Despite the growing number of technologically-focused solutions for supporting emotional communi cation in IM, limited design research has been done to study the actual users X  behaviors in communicating their emotion in IM and strategies they use to adapt emotional communication to this medium, with the purpose of establishing design solu tions to support emotional communication in IM. This project was started three years ago with the ultimate goal of developing solutions to support IM users communicating their emotions in IM. The idea for th is study developed out of a combination of the candidate X  X  personal experiences and academic interests. It started, on the personal level, with experiencing and witnessing di fficulties IM users have in communicating their emotion in IM and how they overcome this challenge. Additionally, the candidate X  X  academic interests have driven her to pursue design resear ch, prototyping, and developing tools to support individuals and improve the quality of their lives. The candidate X  X  first study (P reliminary Study I) was conducted as an exploratory study on a preexisting set of 168 chat logs from a previously conducted study on th e effects of mood and stress on group communication and performance in NeoCITIES, a multi-player emergency response simulation [7]. The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether two psychological states (mood and stress) affect the type and quantity of emotional cues users apply in task-focused IM co mmunication. The results of this study offered evidence that studying text-based emotional cues in IM merited further study. This study was published and presented as extended abstract at CSCW 12 [8] and full paper at HFES2012 [9]. The candidate also conduc ted another study (Preliminary Study II) to explore the potential of gestures to support emotional expression in IM. Preliminary Study II was presented and published as a work-in-progress at CHI14. The findings of preliminary studies I and II offered evidence that emotional communication in IM merited further attention in all areas of HCI, design, and comm unication. These studies also provided insights to define three main aims of the study. Aim #1 has already been accomplished and the results were reported as a full paper, which has been accepted by GROUP14. The findings of the Aim #1 study specifically helped to refine the problem space and narrow the design focus on communicating sadness and anger in IM. Based on the results of this study, angry and sad emotions were identified as th e most challenging emotions among four emotions of happy, sad, anger, and contentment. Data gathered in this aim of the study also provided a rich data set for conversation analysis during Aim #2. [1] Cathcart R, Gumpert G. (1983). Mediated interpersonal [2] Fussell, S. R. (2002).
