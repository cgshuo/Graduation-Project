 With a lar g e percenta g e of the pop u lation, especially yo u n g sters, u sin g social media to comm u nicate with families and friends nowadays, m u ch personal information s u ch as a u ser  X  s g ender, a g e and personal interests has been revealed online. S u ch personal in-formation is of g reat val u e to both research and ind u stry. For example, social scientists and psycholo g ists can better st u dy people  X  s behaviors based on the tremendo u samo u nt of u ser information collected from social media [11], [16]. Companies can do tar g eted online advertisin g more acc u rately based on u sers  X  personal information. While per-sonal information can be mined from vario u sso u rces, an important so u rce that has been lar g ely ne g lected is u sers  X  bio g raphies written by themselves in social media plat-forms. In this work we st u dy how we can extract u sers  X  personal interests from Twitter u ser bio g raphies.

In many social media platforms s u ch as Twitter, u sers are g iven the opport u nity to describe themselves u sin g one or two sentences, which we refer to as bio g raphies. Com-pared to str u ct u red u ser profiles in Facebook and LinkedIn, bio g raphies are often writ-ten in free form, which is hard for comp u ters to u nderstand. However, beca u se these bio g raphies are written by u sers themselves, they are expected to reflect the u sers  X  back-g ro u nd, interests and beliefs. For example, Table 1 shows a few example bio g raphies from Twitter. We can see that in the first and the second bio g raphies, there are phrases s u ch as  X  X occer fan X  and  X  X ove video g ames X  that clearly describe a u ser  X  s interests. P hrases s u ch as  X  X oftware P rof X  shows a u ser  X  s profession and  X 18 year old X  shows a u ser  X  sa g e. The third bio g raphy, on the other hand, is a pop u lar q u ote  X  X ive life to its f u llest, X  which reveals the u ser  X  s attit u de to life. A recent st u dy based on a sample of u sers fo u nd that aro u nd 28% of Sin g apore Twitter u sers and over 50% of US Twitter u sers revealed personal interests in their bio g raphies, which s ugg ests the hi g hval u eof minin g Twitter bio g raphies [4].

Int u itively, if we can a u tomatically extract phrases s u ch as  X  X occer X  and  X  X ideo g ames X  from u ser bio g raphies, these phrases serve as meanin g f u l and informative ta g s for the respective u sers. We refer to this kind of words and phrases that describe u sers  X  personal interests as i n terest t ag s . In this paper, we try to a u tomatically extract these interest ta g s. We also try to link the extracted interest ta g sto u sers  X  content (tweets) and st u dy their correlations.
 Extractin g interest ta g s can be treated as a typical inform ation extraction problem. A ready sol u tion is to employ s u pervised seq u ence labelin g al g orithms s u ch as CRF with labeled trainin g data. However, man u al annotation to obtain labeled data is labor-intensive. We observe that there are a few common syntactic patterns people u se to describe their interests. We therefore first b u ild a noisy trainin g data set u sin g asetof seed patterns and he u ristic r u les, and then train a CRF model on this labeled data set. With this approach, we are able to achieve an F1 score of 0.76 for interest ta g extraction. We also show some top interest ta g saswellaspatternwordsfo u nd in o u r data set.
While a Twitter u ser may describe her interests in her bio g raphy, these interests may not be clearly reflected in her p u blished tweets. To u nderstand whether and which in-terest ta g s are likely to be represented by u sers  X  tweets, we f u rther st u dy the connection between interest ta g s and Twitter content.

The contrib u tions of o u r work can be s u mmarized as follows. We are the first to st u dy how to extract interest ta g s from u ser bio g raphies in social media. We show that with state-of-the-art information extraction techniq u es, we can achieve decent performance for this task. We also show that not all interest ta g s are reflected in u sers  X  tweets, which s ugg ests that it is not s u fficient to only consider tweets for findin gu ser interests. We expect that interest ta g s extracted from u ser bio g raphies can potentially be u sed for u ser profilin g and many other applications.

The rest of the paper is or g anized as follows. We first review related work in Sec-tion2.Thenwepresento u r observation abo u t lin gu istic patterns of interest ta g s in Sec-tion 3. O u r method and experiments will be presented in Section 4 and Section 5. We analyze and disc u ss the connection between interest ta g s and tweet content in Section 6. We concl u de this work and g ive s ugg estions on f u t u re work in Section 7. O u r work is related to a few different lines of work, which we briefly review below. 2.1 Psychological Studies on User Profiles Bio g raphies in social media have attracted m u ch attention in the psycholo g ycomm u -nity. Different q u estions have been st u died in recent years. Co u nts and Stecher st u died the creation process of profiles and fo u nd that people create profiles to match their self-representation profiles [3]. Lampe et a l. st u dy the relationship between profile str u ct u re and n u mber of friends and discovered that some of the profile elements can predict friendship links [9]. Disclos u re of u ser information in bio g raphies is also an important problem to st u dy in social media [14]. P rofile information has also been u sedtodopre-diction in other applications, s u ch as u ser need prediction [22] and sensational interest prediction [7]. However, st u dies in psycholo g y do not foc u soncomp u tational meth-ods to a u tomatically extract information from u ser bio g raphies. In contrast, o u rworkis abo u ta u tomatic extraction of u ser interests from bio g raphies. 2.2 UserProfileConstruction User profilin g is an important research q u estion, which aims at extractin g and inferrin g attrib u tes of a u ser from all his/her online behavio u r. There has been a n u mber of st u dies on u ser profile constr u ction from different an g les. Roshchina et a l. b u ilt u ser profiles accordin g to personality characteristics mined from review text [20]. They showed that based on a lar g en u mber of reviews, it is possible to differentiate personality types and match u sers with reviews written by people with similar personality. P ennacchiotti and P opesc u proposed a g eneral framework to b u ild u ser profiles [15]. Their work combines classification al g orithms and label propa g ation in social network g raphs. Their method shows enco u ra g in g res u lts on three different tasks, which are identification of political affiliation, ethnicity and b u siness affinity. Demo g raphics information is one of the most important aspects in a u ser  X  s profile. Gender and a g e prediction has also attracted m u ch attention and has been st u died in some recent work [2] ,[5], [12,13], [19].

User interest is also an important type of information for profilin g a u ser. In this work, we extract u sers  X  interests from their bio g raphies, which has not been done in existin g work on u ser profile constr u ction. 2.3 Information Extraction in Social Media With the explosion of content g enerated in social media, info rmation extraction, which aims at extractin g str u ct u red, meanin g f u l information from u nstr u ct u red, noisy content edited by online u sers, becomes more necessary than ever before. Ritter et a l. proposed an open domain event extraction approach, which levera g es the lar g evol u me of Twit-ter messa g es and o u tperforms a s u pervised baseline [18]. Ritter et a l. desi g ned a new pipeline of named entity reco g nition adapted to Twitter corp u s [17]. Benson et a l. u ti-lized a s u pervised principled model to extract events-related information from social media feeds [1]. A similar st u dy was done by Imran et a l. [8], which foc u ses more on val u able information of disasters.

Extractin g ta g storepresent u sers  X  interests is very helpf u ltovario u s applications s u ch as online advertisement, friend recommendation. W u et a l. applied two standard methods (TF-IDF and TextRank) on tweets to g enerate personalized ta g sfor u sers [21]. Li u et a l. solved ta gg eneration problem with a machine translation techniq u e[10]. However, no work has systematically looked at information extraction from u ser bi-o g raphies in social media. In order to desi g nas u itable method to extract interest ta g s from u ser bio g raphies, we need to first u nderstand how u sers typically describe their interests in bio g raphies. In this section, we show some typical lin gu istic patterns we fo u nd from a sample of Twitter bio g raphies.

One a u thor of this paper took a random sample of 500 bio g raphies from o u r Twitter data (described in Section 5) and man u ally examined them caref u lly. First of all, the examination revealed that only 28.8% of bio g raphies contain meanin g f u l interest ta g s. The rest of the bio g raphies often describes the u ser  X  s attit u de, belief or other demo-g raphic information. Amon g the bio g raphies that do contain interest ta g s, the a u thor fo u nd a set of common patterns as shown in Table 2. We can see that the majority of interest ta g s are expressed by the  X  X o u n+No u n X  pattern, where the first no u n (or no u n phrase) is the interest ta g .

It is worth pointin g o u t that in all these patterns, the i nterest itself is described by a no u norno u n phrase s u ch as  X  X ootball X  and  X  X ideo g ames X  and the rest of the pattern can be re g arded as some kind of tri gg er . For example, words s u ch as  X  X an X  and  X  X  u nkie X  stron g ly indicate that there is a word or phrase nearby that describes an interest. This observation shows that context u al words are u sef u l for identifyin g interest ta g s, which will gu ide o u rdesi g n of feat u res when we apply s u pervised learnin g for ta g extraction. Based on the analysis as described in the previo u s section, we desi g no u rsol u tion in the followin g way. O u r method event u ally u ses conditional random fields (CRFs), which rep-resents the state of the art of information extraction. It defines the conditional probability of a seq u ence label y 1: N g iven the observation seq u ence x 1: N as where Z is the normalization factor that can be calc u lated as
Given a set of trainin g data { x , y  X  } ,where x is the observation seq u ence and y  X  is the correct seq u ence label, we can learn the model parameter  X  = {  X  k } K 1 as follows where k  X  2 k is a re gu larization term. After learnin g  X  , g iven an observation seq u ence x , we can infer its seq u ence label  X  y as follows We model a bio g raphy as a seq u ence of words where each word has a hidden label. Followin g the common practice of u sin g BIO notation in seq u ence labellin g , each word in a seq u ence can be assi g ned one of the followin g labels: { B-INT, I-INT, O } where B-INT and I-INT indicate the be g innin g of and inside of an interest ta g , respectively, and O indicates o u tside an interest ta g .Fi g . 1 shows an example sentence with the labels for each word.

In the rest of this section, we first describe how we obtain labeled data u sin g seed patterns and he u ristic r u les. We then describe the feat u res we u se for CRF. 4.1 Generating Labeled Training Data We b u ild a noisy labeled data set here to avoid the time-cons u min g h u man annotation process. O u r g oal is to ens u re hi g h precision for s u ch a u tomatically g enerated labeled data. We first perform P OS ta gg in g on all sentences of bio g raphies u sin g Twitter-P OS-Ta gg er [6] 1 . As we only treat no u n phrases as candidate interest ta g s, we need to identify no u n phrases. We he u ristically treat a consec u tive seq u ence of no u ns as a no u n phrase. To g et a set of labeled bio g raphies, we start from a set of seed patterns and extract no u n phrases inside these patterns. The seed patterns we u se are  X  X lay + N P , X   X  X  P + fan X  and  X  X nterested in + N P , X  wh ere N P stands for a no u n phrase. These seed patterns are chosen man u ally based on o u r observations with the data. Altho ug h we observe that most of the time the no u n phrases fo u nd in these patterns do indicate u ser interests, there are also cases when the no u n phrases are not related to u ser interests, e. g .  X  X ife. X  To ens u re hi g h precision, we then foc u s on the more freq u ent no u n phrases. All extracted no u n phrases are ranked based on their n u mbers of appearances in the whole corp u s and the top-100 ranked phrases are selected as o u r seed interest ta g s. We annotate all occ u rrences of these seed interest ta g s with  X  X -INT X  and  X  X -INT X  in the bio g raphies we have, re g ardless of whether they co-occ u r with o u r seed patterns. 4.2 Sequence Labeling using CRF Both lexical and P OS ta g feat u res are u sed in the CRF model. We do not u se syntactic and dependency feat u res as Twitter bio g raphies are u s u ally short and many of them are not sentences b u t phrases. As o u r trainin g data is g enerated u sin g seed interest ta g s, to avoid over-fittin g , we only u se context u al feat u res, i.e. feat u res extracted from the s u r-ro u ndin g tokens for each position. The feat u re set we u se is shown in Table 3. Different combinations of word feat u res and P OS ta g feat u res are u sedino u r experiments. These feat u res are empirically selected to g et the optimal performance on o u r test data. In this section, we present the empirical eval u ation of the CRF-based method for interest ta g extraction. 5.1 Data We u se a collection of 2,678,436 Twitter u sers  X  bio g raphies, which are all written in En g lish. We preprocess these bio g raphies by splittin g sentences, tokenizin g text and removin g all p u nct u ation marks and URLs.

For eval u ation p u rpose, we created an annotated data set as follows. Two g rad u -ate st u dents were recr u ited as h u man annotators. The annotators were asked to choose words or phrases that describe a u ser  X  s interest as interest ta g s. After disc u ssion amon g the annotators, an annotation gu ideline abo u tambi gu o u s cases was created and the an-notators went thro ug h 500 randomly sampled bio g raphies independently based on the gu ideline. O u t of the 1190 sentences from the 500 bio g raphies, only 10 sentences have different annotations. We discard these 10 sentences and u se the remainin g sentences as g ro u nd tr u th in the followin g experiments. 5.2 Experiment Setup Creation of training data: As we have disc u ssedinSection4,tocreateo u r noisy trainin g data, we first obtain a set of seed interest ta g sandthen u se them to obtain a set of positive trainin g sentences, which each contain at least one of the seed interest ta g s. We also randomly select sentences that do not contain any seed interest ta g as o u rne g ative trainin g data. After experimentin g with different ratios of the positive and ne g ative trainin g sentences, we find that a ratio of 10:1 (positive to ne g ative) g ives the best performance.
 Using CRF: We u se CRF++ 2 , which is a C++ implementation of CRF. We u se the defa u lt parameters of this implementation as o u r preliminary experiment shows that the performance of o u r model does not chan g em u ch u nder different parameter settin g s. Baseline: As o u r task has not been st u died before, there is no obvio u s baseline to com-pare a g ainst. We u se two naive baselines for comparison. The first baseline, which is denoted by S eed , u ses the seed pattern to extract interest ta g s directly. The second base-line first extracts all no u n phrases from u ser bio g raphies and then rank them by their n u mbers of appearances in the whole corp u s. The top freq u ent no u n phrases are selected and labeled as interest ta g s. As the performance of this baseline depends on the n u mber of top freq u ent no u n phrases we choose, we first cond u ct a preliminary experiments to choose the optimal n u mber. Fi g . 2 shows the performance in terms of F-score of u sin g different n u mbers of top freq u ent no u n phrases. The optimal val u e is 700. This method is denoted by BL-7 00 . 5.3 Results Table 4 shows the performance of the trained CRF model and the baselines. While CRF have a comparable performance to S eed ,it g ets a m u ch hi g her recall val u e. This shows that o u r seed patterns can only cover a small proportion of interest ta g sb u t a CRF classifier based on pse u do-labelled data g enerated by u sin g seed patterns can extract more interest ta g s. We can also see that CRF o u tperforms BL-7 00 s u bstantially in all metrics, which shows the benefit of u sin g s u pervised machine learnin g to perform the interest ta g extraction task.

Table 5 displays the top-10 freq u ent interest ta g s identified by CRF and BL-700. We can see that all interest ta g s extracted by CRF are meanin g f u l words or phrases abo u t u sers  X  interests, b u t many words fo u nd by BL-700 are not describin g interests. 5.4 Frequent Patterns In this section, we show the freq u ently u sed tri gg ers that Twitter u sers tend to u se to indicate their interests. We first extract the adjacent n -g rams ri g ht before and after each interest ta g extracted by o u r method in the same sentence. Table 6 shows the u ni g ram patterns aro u nd interest ta g s in Twitter u sers  X  bio g raphies. Words that can directly show interests are hi g hli g hted in bold font. We can see that Twitter u sers often u se words s u ch as  X  X anatic, X   X  X an, X   X  X over X  and similar wor ds to show their interests. In the list of u ni-g ram patterns ri g ht before interest ta g , only  X  X ove X  is a stron g indicator. The other words are act u ally adjective words which are often u sed combined with words in the second col u mn. For example, a u ser who is interested in football may describe himself as  X  X x-treme football fan X  in his bio g raphy. Table 6 also shows patterns formed by bi g rams and tri g rams. We can see some clear patterns stron g ly indicatin g people  X  s interests or preferences, s u ch as  X  X  love, X   X  X  like, X   X  X n love with X  and  X  X s my life. X  One nat u ral q u estion to ask is what is the relationship between a u ser  X  s interest ta g sin bio g raphy and her tweet content. In other words, are the interest ta g s extracted from bio g raphies reflected in u sers  X  tweets? To st u dy this problem, we treat interest ta g sas class labels and u tilize tf-idf val u es of u ni g rams as feat u res. For a g iven interest ta g ,we look at each u ser and predict whether or not this interest ta g is relevant to her based on her tweets.

Tweets p u blished by the u sers between September 2012 and A ugu st 2013 are col-lected. All conversational tweets that starts with  X  X  X + u sername are removed. In each tweet, u ser names, retweet symbols, URLs and hashta g s are also removed.

We extract the top-20 freq u ent interest ta g sandtrainaLo g istic Re g ression classi-fier and an SVM classifier for each ta g .Theavera g e acc u racies based on 5-fold cross validation are shown in Fi gu re 3. The horizontal black line is the acc u racy of random gu ess. We can see that the acc u racy of most interest ta g sarej u st comparable to that of random gu ess and for some ta g s the performance is even worse than random gu ess. SVM classifier works better than LR for most ta g s. Both classifiers perform well in predictin g ta g ss u ch as  X  X asketball X ,  X  X occer, X   X  X olleyball X  and  X  X oftball X , which are related to sports. This s ugg ests that u sers with interest ta g s related to sports are more likely to tweet abo u tthin g s related to their interest ta g s. However, classifiers of those g eneral interest ta g s, like  X  X  u sic X ,  X  X ports X  and  X  X nternet X , have very low acc u racies, which indicates that these ta g s are harder to predict. One possible reason is that these ta g saretoo g eneral to be predicted.

We also consider another way to compare the interest ta g s extracted from bio g raphies and u sers  X  tweets. Here we try to extract ta g s from tweets and compare them with those extracted from bio g raphies. Tf-idf rankin g , a method that has been u sed to g enerate personalized u ser ta g s[21],is u sed in this task. In this method, all posted tweets of a u ser are g ro u ped to g ether into a sin g le doc u ment and then tf-idf scores of terms in the doc u ment are calc u lated. The top-N hi g hly scored words are extracted as u ser ta g s. We apply tf-idf rankin g on o u r data set and compare the g enerated ta g s with the interest ta g s extracted from u sers  X  bio g raphies. For each u ser in the complete dataset, if we treat extracted from tweets by tf-idf rankin g .Theres u lts are shown in Table 7. We can see that the avera g e recall of top-20 ta g s can only reach 7.2%, which is very low.
The above two experiments indicate that interest ta g s extracted from u sers  X  bio g ra-phies are not necessarily reflected in a u sers  X  posted tweets. This s ugg ests that u sin g u sers  X  tweets alone may not be s u fficient and interest ta g s extracted from bio g raphies may provide s u pplementary information of a u ser.
 In this work, we st u dy the interest ta g s hidden in u ser bio g raphies in Twitter. We first desi g nastrate g y based on a set of seed syntactic patterns to g et noisy labeled trainin g data. Then a seq u ential labelin g al g orithm CRF is trained based on this trainin g data set. O u r experiments show that the trained model g ets very g ood performance. We also st u dy the pop u lar expressions people u se to indicate their interests in bio g raphies. We discover that tweet content may not reliably reflect u sers  X  interest ta g sinbio g raphies. Interest ta g s extracted from bio g raphies provide s u pplementary information for u sers.
In the follow-u p work, we are g oin g to improve o u rseq u ential labellin g model by introd u cin g back g ro u nd knowled g e to it, which co u ld solve the low recall problem of the c u rrent model. Demo g raphic and professional information are also val u able and extraction of s u ch information will be st u died in the f u t u re. Combinin g information in bio g raphies and social networks is also an interestin g topic that will be explored in o u r f u t u re work.
