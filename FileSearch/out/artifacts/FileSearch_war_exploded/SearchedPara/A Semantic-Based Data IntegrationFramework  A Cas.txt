 With the development of Chinese agricultural informatization, the amount of agriculture data has grown explosively. There are more than 40,000 a-gricultural web sites including so many repeating and redundant data. For example, there are more than 100 agricultural databases which provide a-gricultural remote sensing data, meteorological data with soil testing fer-tilization, plant protection and agricultural economic geography data [1]. Althrough the technology of gathering and storing the data is improving and becoming mature gradually, the application of these data becomes a challenge[2]. The structures of these data are heterogeneous and the data are stored in different distributed databases so that it is difficult to get over-all information from only one dataset. Further more, these heterogeneous datasets are designed to meet specific needs, so it is not feasible to use a specific dataset to solve any other requirement. More importantly, it X  X  valu-able for us to gain the vital information and infer some new knowledge from these raw agricultural data. data (e.g. RDB), semi-structured data (e.g. XML) and unstructured data (e.g. pictures, videos and so on) [3]. These data exist only for the service of hu-manity which can not been understood by computer, because these data are built by different systems and only used by their own users. Meanwhile, it is impossible to get new knowledge from these kinds of data and provide new valuable agricultural information service directly. The emergence of seman-tic technology make it practicable. The concept and architecture of ST have been proposed by T. Berners-Lee and J. Hendler in 1998 [4 X 6], of which, one purpose is data sharing (DS). There are two steps of DS for ST: 1) retriving the knowledge models from the application, 2) integrating the knowledge models through reusing and extending the existing knowledge models, so that the knowledge models can be used across multiple platforms and ap-plications.
 (URI), and Ontology [7] are three basic features of ST. As the basis, RD-F is a framework for representing information on the Web which enables the computers to encode, exchange and reuse structured metadata [8]. The expression of RDF is  X  X riple X  which consists of a  X  X ubject X ,  X  X redicate X  and  X  X b-ject X . Compared with the traditional databases, RDF represents knowledge by triples so that it is flexible to execute existing operations, e.g., adding, deleting and modifying [10]. Therefore, data can be integrated expediently and managed easily through RDF. RDF addresses one fundamental issue on the Semantic Web: managing distributed data [9] because of the URI. By using URI, every resource on the web can be located even though the data has difference expression but the same URI. Hence, the semantic het-erogeneity can be avoided when integrating data. The ontology is consisted of statements which define the concepts, relationships and constraints [11]. The use of ontology for the explication of implicit and hidden knowledge is a feasible measure to overcome the semantic hierarchic heterogeneity. Un-der the hierarchic structure of ontology, inference can be done to find new knowledge.
 tributed as example, a general framework is proposed in this paper. Seman-tic technology is applied to the framework because of the above characteris-tics. Based on the framework, personalized agricultural information service is provided through integrating multi-sources and heterogenous agricultur-al data. According to the framework, an agricultural ontology has been built, based on which, some new agricultural information and knowledge can be inferred.
 the basic framework. Section 3 uses a case to integrate data and provide service based on our proposed framework. Section 4 summarizes this paper and looks into the future work.
 In this section, we first introduce three components of the proposed frame-work. Then, a method based on ST is proposed to integrate different types of data. Finally, an agricultural information service system is built to provide individual agricultural information service. 2.1 An Introduction of the Framework There are three types of data on the Web. Structured data is always stored in the RDB such as MYSQL and Oracle. Semi-structured data is always presented as XML schema which can be converted into structured data eas-ily. And Unstructured data are always expressed as text, pictures and so on.
 data being transformed include three types mentioned above. For every for-mat of data, there are different solutions to transform them. There are many applications to convert structured data into the local ontology. One of the ap-plications is D2RQ platform [14], which could create the custom dumps of RDB in the RDF formats for loading into a RDF store. By using D2RQ, a mapping file should be designed to transform RDB into RDF. EXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) is published by W3C, Which can transform the semi-structured into RDF through pattern rules. For un-structed data, local ontology is always created manually from this type of data.
 the semantic reasoning can express the ratiocination rules of the ontology language and reason the results from a group of relevant semantic data. In the traditional relational database, the logical relationship among da-ta cannot be described explicitly. It is often hidden behind the connection of database tables, documents and SQL codes. Although the logical rela-tionship can be obtained by query language, it is difficult for a computer program to find and utilize hidden logical relationships and information ac-curately. In contrast, a clear logical connection has been established among knowledgeable individuals in RDF semantic database. The semantic ratio-cination on the RDF semantic database is a natural and simple process that can be understood by computer to obtain a valid inference conclusion. ferent domains or in different expressions, so local ontologies are needed to map to a global ontology. Then, the same thing can be mapped to each oth-er so that there is no ambiguity. This make the inference of the ontologies exact. 2.2 The agricultural information service system s directly. While the basic vision of ST is to make computer understand what the Web describes [12]. Except making computers understand what the Web describes through RDF, ST can also integrate multi-source and heterogeneous data. The framework aims to provide personalized agricul-tural information service. As shown in Fig. 2, there are three components of the framework: data integration, cloud computing platform and agricultural information service system.
 while, some inference rules are added to create the agricultural ontology. Depending on this ontology, the new knowledge can be inferred so that the data become more powerful.
 is agricultural ontology in our work. The agricultural information service system is developed on this platform. And ST plays a core role in providing information service. Due to the stability and extensibility of cloud comput-ing, ST is applied and all data are represented in triples. Based on these knowledge, the system can give farmers appropriate instructions such as the weather of the past years, the price of agricultural products, and expert-s X  advice in order to help them make decisions.
 ontology is designed to provide agricultural information service for agricul-tural users (e.g. farmers, experts). Due to the integration and inference of ST, the system is smarter to provide personalized agricultural information service. This service makes users get agricultural information easily. The agricultural information service system will be introduced as follows. scale automated semantic ratiocination. Based on ST, the expert knowledge and data can be combined to provide individual information service. The architecture of our work is shown in Fig. 3. Three are steps, including data getting, data conversion and data storage for querying, will be implemented, which are detailed as follows.
 specifically, the structured data stored in RDB can be transferred directly. Text may contain much information that computer couldn X  X  understand, so some other methods, like Natural Language Processing (NLP) [15] or trans-ferred mannually, can be adopted to achieve Information Extraction (IE) [16]. For other types of unstructured data such as pictures and videos, the URIs have to be created to represent them on the semantic web for comput-er to understand.
 ate subject-predicate-object (SPO) triples by D2RQ , the agricultural ontol-ogy is accomplished, which is stored as RDF.
 AllegroGraph [17]). According to the RDF database and the large-scale auto-matic semantic reasoning (e.g., domain and range restriction, subclass and sub-property restriction, transitivity and cardinality restriction), some new knowledge will be inferred, which is hidden behind the integrated data. so that they can get information based on automatic semantic reasoning. The interface transforms what the users input into the SPARQL query , which can query the semantic database stored in AllegroGraph and return the outcome.
 can be provided for agricultural users. One of the most important parts of ST is ontology. Due to the ontology, ST can implement the intelligent. Based on the specific domain concepts and accurate relations description, domain ontology establishes the foundation of the knowledge base. Moreover, well developed and widely adopted ontolo-gies act as the cornerstone of the whole progress, providing some basic term relationships and guiding the further development of the domain knowledge base [18]. In this section, a relationship between data sources and ontologies is set up, which is the basis to establish the agricultural ontologies. 3.1 A briefly introduction of the data sources used by the system The sample data source contains the market information of agricultural products, the farming and weather. A mapping relation is built from data sources to ontology. The main classes of agricultural ontology are shown in Table. 1. In Sec. 3.2, some triples will be shown to demonstrate that the per-sonalized agricultural information service works, which is converted from data source based on the conversion method introduced in Fig. 1. includes agricultural product categories, the names of products, and so on. The other part of the data sources is named farming and weather. According to the feature of data sources, the modeling is shown as Fig. 4. Some new relations among raw data are added to the ontology on the basis of agricul-tural expert knowledge so that the ontology will be more logical. In Fig. 5, some triples of created ontologies are illustrated. 3.2 Personalized Agricultural Information Service Our work aims to implement multi-source heterogeneous data integration and provide accurate, intelligentized agricultural information service. Ac-cording to Sec. 3.1, different types of data from different sources are com-bined. With agricultural expert knowledge, the ontology we have built in-cludes many categories (e.g. vegetables, fruit, data, weather and so on). For example, if agricultural users want to get some information about let-tuce on 2016-03-15, they only need to input  X 2016-03-15 X  and  X  X ettuce X , then the weather, temperature, the expert reminds contraposing the weather and the temperature, and the market information about lettuce are presented, which are stored in different distributed databases before the integration. At the same time, agricultural users can find out which products will be profitable through inferring the weather and the temperature in the case of the days from the ontology. More details are shown in Fig. 6. Agricultural users can get knowledge hidden behind the data without considering how it works. This paper proposes a framework based on ST to provide personalized a-gricultural information service so that agricultural users can get valuable information hidden behind the data. Meanwhile, data stored as different formats have been converted into RDF to achieve data integration. An ap-plication is presented to integrate raw data of Chongqing agriculture com-mittee and weather bureau, and provide precise query. Due to the flexibility of RDF, the knowledge model is separated from the web data, so more in-formation could be added at anytime to provide higher quality information service.
