 The ACM DOLAP workshop presen ts researc h on data ware-housing and On-Line Analytical Pro cessing (OLAP). The program has three interesting sessions on mo deling, query pro cessing and new trends, as well as a keynote talk on OLAP query pro cessing and a panel comparing relational and non-relational technology for data warehousing. H.2 [ Database Managemen t ]: H.2.0 General Algorithms, Design, Performance, Theory
Data warehousing technology use has been gro wing over time and it is now a practical need in every ma jor organi-zation, esp ecially in the corp orate world. A data warehouse integrates multiple databases into a single large database to enable adv anced querying and analysis. On-Line Analyti-cal Pro cessing (OLAP) is the most common type of analysis performed in a data warehouse, represen ted by exploratory queries and cub e aggregations. Data mining complemen ts OLAP to explain trends, justify ndings and to compute statistical mo dels. Relational database systems for data warehousing represen t a mature technology , but the curren t gro wth of data and the Internet are pushing them to their limits. On the other hand, mo deling asp ect remains chal-lenging given the ever-c hanging nature of databases, both in structure and in size. New applications, faster hardw are and the Internet are making data warehousing technology evolve even further.

DOLAP 2010 includes 8 long pap ers and 6 short pap ers, accepted out of 27 submissions, group ed into three sessions: mo deling, query pro cessing and new trends. The topics are div erse, including multidimensional design, query pro cess-ing, priv acy , personalization, data qualit y, exploiting ad-vanced CPUs, conceptual mo deling, peer-to-p eer systems and indexing, among others. The program also includes a keynote talk on OLAP query pro cessing and a panel compar-ing relational and non-relational technology for data ware-housing. The keynote talk is given by a recognized re-searc her and dev elop er from the DBMS industry , sharing materialized views with outerjoins. The algorithms relax the requiremen t for the existence of the primary key attributes in the select list of the view to only some of the relations. The algorithms do not require the null-in toleran t prop erty requiremen t for only some predicates used in the view def-inition. Finally , the main tenance of outerjoin views is im-plemen ted by using exactly one update statemen t per view (with merge statemen ts) for eac h relation referenced in the view. Paper [11] studies the real-time computation of a join operation between a con tinuous incoming data stream with a disk-based relation. The authors investigate a stream-based join algorithm, called mesh join and prop ose an impro ved version, whic h enables an optimal distribution of available memory among the join comp onen ts. In the impro ved al-gorithm a change in the size of the disk-based relation does not a ect the size of the disk bu er. Paper [7] presen ts a query rewrite metho d to repair (augmen t with extra terms) dynamically generated SQL queries by OLAP tools work-ing on tables having data qualit y issues. The metho d works for queries having join operators and aggregate functions having the distributiv e (summarizabilit y) prop erty. Data qualit y issues are caused by tables with foreign key columns poten tially con taining nulls, invalid or unde ned values.
Session 3 presen ts researc h on data warehousing and OLAP trends. Paper [5] prop oses an index for optimizing star joins and computing aggregates along dimension hierarc hies. The index is created on a dimension hierarc hy and it is com-posed of (1) a hierarc hically organized bitmap index, having one bitmap index per dimension level and (2) a time index that implicitly enco des time in every dimension. Paper [10] presen ts a GPU-based cub e data structure and algorithms for fast multidimensional aggregation. Benc hmarking ex-perimen ts sho w a substan tial speedup over state-of-the-art sequen tial algorithms. The performance gain is particularly high when the num ber of base cells involved in an aggrega-tion is large. Paper [9] prop oses a framew ork for evaluating recommender systems, whic h is multidimensional and tak es accoun t for the multiple facets of the recommendation al-gorithms, data sets and performance measures. Com bined with supp ort for visual analysis, operations suc h as drill-down or slice/dice, allo w assessmen t of the performance of recommendations in terms of business objectiv es. The pa-per introduces a metho d for designing and dev eloping the prop osed multidimensional framew ork, and outlines appli-cations. Paper [6] prop oses a framew ork based on exi-ble sampling-based data cub e compression techniques for computing priv acy-preserving OLAP aggregations on data cub es, while allo wing appro ximate answ ers to be ecien tly evaluated over suc h aggregations. This is accomplished by an accuracy/priv acy con tract, whic h determines how OLAP aggregations must be accessed, balancing accuracy of ap-pro ximate answ ers and priv acy of sensitiv e ranges of multi-dimensional data. Paper [15] studies how to mo del a hierar-chy of cub e measures exploiting an external kno wledge base. The pap er prop oses mec hanisms to incorp orate suc h kno wl-edge in applications and dynamically rewritten queries. A summary of the keynote talk and the panel follo ws. The keynote [2] presen ts an overview of query pro cessing in the Oracle DBMS, including query optimization, paral-lel/serial executions and OLAP . The talk presen t technical details about cost-based optimization, adaptiv ely optimiz-ing queries reusing optimization history and shared-nothing parallel pro cessing. On the other hand, the panel [13] com-
