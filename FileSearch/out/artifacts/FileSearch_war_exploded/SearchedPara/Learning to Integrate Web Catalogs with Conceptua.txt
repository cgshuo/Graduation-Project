 With the fast growth of various Web information sources, many applications are in need of integrating different Web portals and many on-line vendors [1]. For example, B2C companies such as Amazon may want to merge catalogs from several on-line vendors into its catalog to provide customers versatile contents. B2B e-commerce is also an application reported in recent research [1,8,9,13]. In these studies, the importance of catalog integration is discussed. That is, an earlier study shows that only about 20% of the categorized sites retrieved from both Yahoo! and Google cat alogs are the same, which implies that users may need to spend much effort browsing different Web cata-logs to gain the required materials [3]. Therefore, an integrated Web catalog service not only can help users gain more relevant and organized information in one catalog but also can save them much time to surf among different Web catalogs.

In the past few years, several studies have been proposed to enhance catalog inte-gration performance [1,3,9,10,12,13,15,16,19,20]. As noted in [1], catalog integration should not be a simple classification task. When some implicit source information is exploited, the integration accuracy can be highly improved. In their study, a foremost approach is designed by enhancing the Naive Bayes classifier with implicit source in-formation [1]. Recently, other state-of-the-art studies employ Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (e.g. [3,12,15,19]) and the Maximum Entropy model (e.g. [16]) to enhance the accuracy performance of Web catalog integration. Their results show that the accuracy improvements can be highly achieved.

However, these studies only consider a flattened catalog structure. Moreover, they do not comprehensively study the hierarchical relationships between the categories and subcategories existing in the destination catalog. We are motivated to conduct research on hierarchical catalog integration because early studies have shown that exploiting a hierarchical structure in classification can bring better ad vantages [2,4,14]. In [16], it is also shown that the source hierarchical information can improve the accuracy. However, the study focuses on a flattened structure for catalog integration and does not discuss the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure of the destination catalog.
In this paper, we propose an enhanced catalog integration (ECI) approach with the conceptual relationships extracted from the hierarchical thesaurus in the source cata-log to improve the integration performance. We further apply such an ECI approach to a flattened catalog structure (ECI-F) and a hierarchical catalog structure (ECI-H) and examine the consistent accuracy improvement of catalog integration. For the flattened categories, since the documents of lower level categories are merged upward to the second-level categories as the task definition in [1], the SVM classifier distinguishes a second-level category from all other second-lev el categories. For the hierarchical cat-egories, the SVM classifier is learned to first distinguish the top-level categories, and then distinguish the second-level categories from other categories within the same top level. The accuracy of both the flattened and hierarchical integration structures is mea-sured by considering only the second-level accuracy where the documents of the lower level categories are merged upward to the second-level ones.
 We have conducted several experiments with real-world catalogs from Yahoo! and Google. We have also discussed the accuracy improvements of the ECI-F and ECI-H approaches respectively over the flattened structure and the hierarchical structure. The results show that the improvements of the ECI approach compared with original SVM are very noticeable, and the accuracy is consistently improved in every category on the basis of both the flattened structure and the hierarchical structure. The accuracy improvement of the flattened structure is boosted over 11% on average, and the accuracy improvement of the hierarchical structure is boosted over 16% on average.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly states the problem de-finitions, assumptions, and limitations. Section 3 reviews the related studies of catalog integration. Section 4 describes the details of the ECI strategy and depicts our integra-tion approach. Section 5 pr esents the experimental results and discusses the influence factors. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. As the formal definitions in [1], we assume that there are two catalogs participating in the integration process. One is the source catalog S with a set of m categories S 1 , S , ..., S m . The other is the destination catalog D with a set of n categories D 1 , D 2 , ..., D n . The integration process is performed by merging each document d in S into a correspondent category in D . In addition, we assume that the catalogs are homogeneous and overlapped with some common documents. This means that the catalogs are not orthogonal, so the implicit source information can be exploited. Our real-world data sets also support this overlapping assumption, and a flattened scheme and a hierarchical scheme are employed in catalog integration.

In the flattened integration scheme, we follow the integration model used in [1] in which the category hierarchies are flattened. Fig. 1 illustrates the process of a flattened integration scheme in which the documents under the second level are merged upward to the second level. Each classifier then di stinguishes a second-level category from all other second-level categories. Although th is cannot model many real-world cases in which catalogs are hierarchical, the flat catalog assumption is still helpful in investigat-ing the effectiveness of the implicit source information in catalog integration.
In the hierarchical integration scheme, the top-level structure is reserved to help cat-alog integration. Fig. 2 depicts th e process of a hierarchical integration scheme. To compare the hierarchical scheme with the flattened scheme, the documents under the second level are merged upward to the second level. Then, the classifier first distin-guishes the top-level categories, and then distinguishes the second-level categories from other categories within the same top level. The hierarchical integration scheme is thus much closer to the real-world catalog integration cases.

To classify source documents, the classifiers ar e trained first with the training doc-uments coming from the destination catal og. Whether a training document is treated as a positive document or a negative document is subject to its subordinate relation-ship to each destination category. For flattened categories, the negative documents are the documents from all the other second-level categories including the categories un-der other top levels. In the hierarchical integration scheme, the negative documents are the documents from other second-level categori es of the same top level. Since the SVM classifier is a  X  X ne-against-rest X  classifie r, the diverse negative examples between the flattened scheme and the hierarchical scheme may thus result in different training models. In 2001, an enhanced Naive Bayes approach (ENB) was first proposed to improve the integration accuracy by expl oiting implicit info rmation from the source catalog [1]. In their experiments with real-world catalogs, ENB can achieve more than 14% accuracy improvement on average. Their promising results show that exploiting implicit source information indeed benefits the accuracy for automated catalog integration. However, most of the later catalog integration approaches outperform ENB in accuracy perfor-mance. Their studies begin the following research on this problem.

In 2003, Sarawagi et al. proposed a cross-training (CT) technique for SVM classi-fiers, termed SVM-CT, to improve the integration accuracy by exploiting the native cat-egory information of semi-labeled documents [12]. In the integration process of SVM-CT, two semi-labeled document sets are crossly trained as the training samples to model the two classifiers for both the source catal og and the destination catalog. The exper-imental results show that SVM-CT can achieve more significant improvements than NB classifiers in most cases and improves the SVM classifier in nearly half cases. Al-though the CT technique achieves the improvements for SVM classifiers, their results also reveal that SVM-CT may be unstable in real-world catalog integration.

In 2003, Tsay et al. proposed two techniques to improve the accuracy of classifiers [15]. The first technique is called probabilistic enhancement (PE) that uses category information to enhance probabilistic classifiers such as NB classifiers. The second tech-nique is called topic restriction (TR) that can be applied to general classifiers such as SVM, which is termed as SVM-TR here. Besides, they tried to combine NB and SVM with different dynamic settings to further improve the integration accuracy. The experi-mental results of real Web catalogs show th at both techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of the NB and SVM classifiers on an average of over 10%. Although both techniques are promising to improve integration accuracy, however, the TR enhance-ment for SVM can only achieve less than 0.2% improvement.

In 2004, Zhang and Lee proposed two approaches to improve the accuracy: the clus-ter shrinkage (CS-TSVM) approach [19] and the co-bootstrapping approach [20]. The main idea behind CS-TSVM is to shrink all objects in a documents category to the clus-ter center. Although CS-TSVM overall outperforms ENB in macro and micro F-scores in the experiments, the proposed shrinkage process may faultily shrink the negative objects because it just shrink all objects. The co-bootstrapping approach employs the boosting technique, because it can find the optimal combination of heterogeneous weak hypotheses automatically without manually adjusting feature weights. In contrast, other machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, are required to adjust relative combination weights. Although the co-bootstrapping algorithm can optimize the combination of het-erogeneous weak hypotheses automatically, the results show that the improvements are overall lower than CS-TSVM. Moreover, co-bootstrapping is discouraged by its poor efficiency.

In 2005, Chen et al. studied the effectivenes s of SVM classifiers in catalog inte-gration by using other embedded auxiliary catalog information [3]. They proposed an iterative SVM-based approach (SVM-IA) to consistently improve the integration per-formance. The results show that SVM-IA has a prominent accuracy performance, and the performance is more stable than SVM-CT. However, the accuracy improvement of SVM-IA is constrained by the auxiliary information after several iterations, and thus no obvious breakthrough is achieved.

In 2005, Wu et al. first extracted the h ierarchical information from the source cat-alog and employed the Maximum Entropy model to improve the accuracy of catalog integration [16]. Their results show that the accuracy improvement is very promising and is consistently better than ENB. Although this study indicates that the hierarchical information from the source catalog is helpful to improve the integration accuracy, it has not been further proved for a hierarchical catalog.

The surveyed past studies only consider the flattened structure. Although the perfor-mance improvements are significant, the integration effectiveness based on a hierarchi-cal structure has not been addressed. Therefore, the integration performance for both a flattened structure and a hierarchical structure needs to be further studied. In our study, SVM classifiers are used with linear kernel functions [17], f : X  X  R n  X  R , to find a hyperplane that can separate the positive examples, f ( x )  X  +1 , from the negative examples, f ( x )  X  X  X  1 . The linear function is in the form of f ( x )= ( w, x )+ b = n i =1 w i x i + b where ( w, b )  X  R n  X  R . The linear SVM is trained to find the optimal values of w and b such that || w || is minimized. These trained SVM are employed in our enhanced catalog integration (ECI) approach which boosts their performance in catalog integration. In the following, we describe the ECI approach and the enhanced process of a flattened (ECI-F) scheme and the hierarchical (ECI-H) scheme. 4.1 Hierarchical Label Information To improve the integration accuracy, a weighting formula is designed to extract the semantic concepts existing in the source catalog. In Equation 1, the weight of each thesaurus is exponentially decreased according to the increased levels to represent the semantic concept extracted from the source labels. Equation 1 calculates the feature weight of each document, where L i is the relevant label weight assigned as 1 / 2 i with an i -level depth, and f x is the occurrence ratio of feature x in the document. The label weights are exponentially decreased to minimize the influence of the labels which ex-press very general concepts about the documents. Other functions can be used, such as 1 /i 2 , to achieve similar results.
 Table 1 shows the weights of different-level labels, where L 0 is the document level, L 1 is one level upper, and so on to L n for n levels upper. A threshold  X  is used to ac-commodate the weights of the source thesauri to fit in with the destination catalog. In the experiments, different values of  X  for the source catalogs were examined. The ex-perimental results suggest that a small value for  X  is preferable to avoid overweighting the label information. With such a thesaurus weighting scheme, the conceptual relation-ships of the hierarchical source categories can be transformed and added into the test documents.

To build the enhanced classifiers for destination categories, the same enhancement on hierarchical label information is also applied to t he destination catalog to strengthen the discriminative power of the classifiers. Likewise, the weights of the features and native category label information in the destination catalog are calculated in accordance with Equation 1. In this paper, the setting of  X  =0 . 05 to the destination catalog is only reported for the sake of space saving. Similar results can be obtained as in the source catalog.
 4.2 The ECI-F and ECI-H Integration Schemes The ECI approach is to extract the conceptual relationships between the hierarchical Web thesaurus from the source catalog. In the source catalog, the source hierarchical thesaurus are added into the test documents with different label weights calculated by the weighting formula. In ECI, the destination catalog is processed differently according to the integration type: flattened or hierarchical. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 separately illustrate the use of a source hierarchy with the enhanced integration process of the ECI-F scheme for flattened catalog integration and the ECI-H scheme for hierarchical catalog integration.
In Fig. 3, the test documents with the source hierarchical thesaurus information are directly integrated into the second-level categories. In Fig. 4, the test documents with the source hierarchical thesaurus information are fir st integrated into the top-level cat-egories and then are integrated into the second-level categories. In the hierarchical structure, the ECI-H scheme further removes the features occurring in the top-level categories to avoid misleading integration in the second-level categories. Since some documents may appear in more than one category in the destination catalog, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 further show that the document A can be integrated into more than one category.
The proposed ECI approach is employed for both the flattened structure and the hier-archical structure as described in Fig. 5. In the source catalog, the hierarchical thesaurus information is added to the test documents with different label weights accumulated up-ward from their current categories to the top-lev el category. In the destination catalog, the test documents are integrated into the destination categories according to both the ECI-F and ECI-H integration schemes. The integration process is finished when all the test documents from their source categories are integrated into the designated destina-tion categories. We have conducted experiments with real-world catalogs from Yahoo! and Google to study the performance of ECI-F and the ECI-H schemes with SVM light [6,7]. The ex-perimental results show that the ECI approach consistently improves SVM in all cases, and effectively boosts the integration accuracy of both flattened and hierarchical struc-tures. The following subsections describe the data sets and the experimental results. 5.1 Data Sets In the experiment, five categories from Yahoo! and Google were extracted. Table 2 shows these categories and the number of the extracted documents after ignoring the documents that could not be retrieved and removing the documents with error mes-sages. As in [1,12], the documents appearing in only one category were used as the destination catalog D , and the common documents were used as the source catalog S . If the number of the documents of a certain category is less than 10, the category would be merged upward to the top-level cate gory in a hierarchical structure or be ignored in a flattened structure.

Since some documents may appear in more than one category of the same catalog, the number of test documents may slightly vary in Yahoo! and Google. In the experi-ment, we measured the accuracy by the following equation.
 In the preprocessing, we used the stopword list in [5] to remove the stopwords. 5.2 Experimental Results and Discussion In the experiments, a threshold  X  is set to accommodate the weights of the source the-sauri to fit in with the destination catalog. In order to optimize the value of  X  , different  X  values are tested to gain the best accuracy improvement. Table 3 and Table 4 show the integration results of a flattened scheme and an ECI-F with different  X  values, in which the ECI-F achieves the best averaged accuracy when  X  = 0.15 in both Yahoo!-to-Google and Google-to-Yahoo! cases. Table 5 and Table 6 show the integration results of a hier-archical scheme and an ECI-H with different  X  values, in which the ECI-H achieves the best averaged accuracy when  X  = 0.20 in both Yahoo!-to-Google and Google-to-Yahoo! cases. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 separately depict the best averaged performance of the flattened, ECI-F, hierarchical, and ECI-H schemes for the catalog integration from Yahoo! to Google and the catalog integration from Google to Yahoo!. In both Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the best averaged accuracy of ECI-F is achieved when  X  = 0.15, and the best averaged accuracy of ECI-H is achieved when  X  = 0.20. According to the results, the best av-eraged accuracy of the ECI-F and ECI-H is both over 94% for the catalog integration from Yahoo! to Google and the catalog integration from Google to Yahoo!. Moreover, the accuracy improvement of a flattened structure is boosted over 11% on average, and the accuracy improvement of a hierarchical structure is boosted over 16% on average.
The results show that the integration accuracy with the ECI scheme is much better than the original integration scheme. Ev en though the test documents are only with the label information, that is, the value of  X  = 1, the integration accuracy is still better than the original catalog integration schemes. The result indicates that using the ECI scheme to extract the source label information and the conceptual relationships from the hier-archical thesaurus strongly affects the integration accuracy because most of the labels are mainly the positive training features in the category classifiers. Besides that, the classifiers are further enhanced with the native category label information of  X  = 0.05, and thus the ECI scheme can greatly boosts the accuracy of Web catalog integration. Catalog integration is an important issue in current digital content management and e-commerce applications. In this paper, we have addressed the problem of integrating documents from a source catalog into a destina tion catalog. This paper also reports our studies on the effects of an enhanced catalog integration to boost the integration accu-racy. By exploiting the hierarchical relationships between categories and subcategories, the improvement of integration accuracy is very promising. The ECI scheme has been employed in both a flattened structure and a hierarchical structure, and the accuracy per-formance is greatly improved. It shows that our ECI approach consistently boosts the SVM classifiers in catalog integration, and the improvement of a hierarchical structure is more obvious than a flattened one.

This study is still on the first stage to apply an enhanced catalog integration to both a flattened structure and a hierarchical structure. There are still some issues left for further discussion. For example, a systematical mechanism to finding a better kernel function is a more difficult problem but can investigate the power of SVM. Besides that, other advanced classifiers (e.g. Maximum Entropy model) still need to be further studied and employed in hi erarchical catalog integration. To conclude, we believe that the accuracy of catalog integration can be further improved with appropriate assistance of more effective auxiliary information and classifiers.
