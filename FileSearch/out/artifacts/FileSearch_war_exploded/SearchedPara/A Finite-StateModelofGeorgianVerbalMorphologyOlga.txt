 Geor gian morphology is lar gely synthetic, with comple x verb forms that can often express the mean-ing of a whole sentence. Descriptions of Geor gian verbal morphology emphasize the lar ge number of inflectional cate gories; the lar ge number of elements that a verb form can contain; the inter -dependencies in the occurrence of various elements; and the lar ge number of regular , semi-re gular , and irre gular pat-terns of formation of verb inflections (cf. He witt 1995). All of these factors mak e computational modeling of Geor gian morphology a rather daunting task.

In this paper , we propose a computational model for parsing and generation of a subset of Geor gian verbs that relies on a templatic, word-based analysis of the verbal system rather than assuming compo-sitional rules for combining indi vidual morphemes. We argue that such a model is viable, extensible, and capable of capturing the generalizations inherent in the Geor gian verbal system at various levels of reg-ularity . To our kno wledge, this is the only computa-tional model of the Geor gian verb currently in acti ve development and available to the non-Geor gian aca-demic community 2 . The Geor gian verb forms are made up of several kinds of morphological elements that recur in dif-ferent formations. These elements can be formally identified in a fairly straightforw ard fashion; how-ever, their function and distrib ution defy a simple compositional analysis but instead are determined by the lar ger morphosyntactic and semantic conte xts in which the verbs appear (usually tense, aspect, and mood) and the lexical properties of the verbs them-selv es. 2.1 Verb Structur e Geor gian verbs are often divided into four conju-gation classes, based mostly on valenc y (cf. Har -ris 1981). In this brief report, we will concentrate on transiti ve verbs, although our model can accom-modate all four conjug ation types. Verbs inflect in tense/mood/aspect (TAM) paradigms (simplified here as tenses). There are a total of 10 acti vely used tenses in Modern Geor gian, grouped into TAM se-ries as in Table 1. Kno wing the series and tense of a verb form is essential for being able to conjug ate it.
The structure of the verb can be described using the follo wing (simplified) template. (Pre verb)-(agreement1)-(v ersion)-root -(thematic suf fix)-(tense)-(agreement)
The functions of some of the elements are dis-cussed belo w. As an illustration, note the formation of the verb xat X  va  X  X aint X  in Table 1. 2.2 Lexical and Semi-Regular Patter ns The comple xity of the distrib ution of morphologi-cal elements in Geor gian is illustrated by pre verbs, thematic suf fix es, and tense endings. The pre verbs (a closed class of about 8) indicate perfecti ve aspect and lexical deri vations from roots, similar to verb prefix es in Sla vic or German. The association of a verb with a particular pre verb is lexical and must be memorized. A pre verb appears on forms from the Future subgroup of series I, and on all forms of se-ries II and III in transiti ve verbs. Table 2 demon-strates some of the lexically-dependent morpholog-ical elements, including several dif ferent pre verbs (ro w  X  X uture X ).

Similarly , thematic suf fix es form a closed class and are lexically associated with verb roots. The y function as stem formants and distinguish inflec-tional classes. In transiti ve verbs, thematic suf fix es appear in all series I forms. Their beha vior in other series dif fers by indi vidual suf fix: in series II, most suf fix es disappear , though some seem to lea ve par -tial  X  X races X  (ro ws  X  X resent X  and  X  X erfect X  in Table 2).

The next source of semi-re gular patterns comes from the inflectional endings in the indi vidual tenses and the corresponding changes in some verb roots (ro w  X  X orist X  in Table 2).

Finally , another verb form rele vant for learners is the masdar , or verbal noun. The masdar may or may not include the pre verb and/or some variation of the thematic suf fix (last row in Table 2). 2.3 Regular Patter ns Verb agreement in Geor gian is a completely regu-lar yet not entirely compositional phenomenon. A verb can mark agreement with both the subject and the object via a combination of prefixal and suf fixal agreement mark ers, as in Table 3.

The distrib ution and order of attachment of agree-ment affix es has been the subject of much discus-sion in theoretical morphological literature. To sim-plify matters for the computational model, we as-sume here that the prefixal and suf fixal mark ers at-tach to the verb stem at the same time, as a sort of circumfix, and indicate the combined subject and object properties of a paradigm cell.

Despite the amount of lexical variation, tense for -mation in some instances is also quite regular . So, the Imperfect and First Subjuncti ve tenses are regu-larly formed from the Present. Similarly , the Condi-tional and Future Subjuncti ve are formed from the Future. And for most (though not all) transiti ve verbs, the Future is formed from the Present via the addition of a pre verb .

Additionally , the number of possible combina-tions of inflectional endings and other irre gularities is also finite, and some choices tend to predict other choices in the paradigm of a given verb . Geor gian verbs can be classified according to several example paradigms, or inflectional (le xical) classes, similar to the distinctions made in Standard European lan-guages; the major dif ference is that the number of classes is much greater in Geor gian. For instance, Melikishvili (2001) distinguishes over 60 classes, of which 17 are transiti ve. While the exact number of inflectional classes is still in question, the general example-based approach seems the only one viable for Geor gian. 3.1 Ov erview Finite-state netw orks are currently one of the most popular methods in computational morphol-ogy . Man y approaches are implemented as two-w ay finite-state transducers (FST) in which each arc cor -responds to a mapping of two elements, for exam-ple a phoneme and its phonetic realization or a mor -pheme and its meaning. As a result, FST morpholo-gies often assume morpheme-le vel compositional-ity. As demonstrated in the pre vious section, such assumptions do not serv e well to describe the ver-bal morphology of Geor gian. Instead, it can be de-scribed as a series of patterns at various levels of regularity . Ho we ver, compositionality is not a neces-sary assumption: finite-state models are well-suited for representing mappings from strings of meaning elements to strings of form elements without neces-sarily pairing them one-to-one.

Our model was implemented using the xfst pro-gram included in (Beesle y and Karttunen 2003). The core of the model consists of several levels of finite-state transducer (FST) netw orks such that the result of compiling a lower -le vel netw ork serv es as input to a higher -le vel netw ork. The levels correspond to the division of templatic patterns into completely lexical (Le vel 1) and semi-re gular (Le vel 2). Le vel 3 con-tains completely regular patterns that apply to the results of both Le vel 1 and Le vel 2. The regular -expression patterns at each level are essentially con-straints on the templatic structure of verb forms at various levels of generality . The FST model can be used both for the generation of verbal inflections and for recognition of complete forms.

The input to the model is a set of hand-written regular expressions (written as FST patterns) which identify the lexically specific information for a rep-resentati ve of each verb class, as well as the more regular rules of tense formation. In addition to divid-ing verb formation patterns into lexical and regular , our model also pro vides a mechanism for specifying def aults and overrides in inflectional mark ers. Man y of the tense-formation patterns mentioned abo ve can be described as def aults with some lexical excep-tions. In order to minimize the amount of manual entry , we specify the exceptional features at the first level and use the later levels to apply def ault rules in all other cases. 3.2 Le vel 1: The Lexicon The first level of the FST model contains lexically specific information stored as several complete word forms for each verb . In addition to the information that is always lexical (such as the root and pre verb), this netw ork also contains forms which are excep-tional. For the most regular verbs, these are: Present, Future, Aorist 2SgSubj, Aorist 3SgSubj, and Per -fect.

The inflected forms are represented as two-le vel finite-state arcs, with the verb stem and morphosyn-tactic properties on the upper side, and the inflected word on the lower side.

The forms at Le vel 1 contain a place holder  X +Agr1 X  for the prefixal agreement mark er, which is replaced by the appropriate mark er in the later levels (necessary because the prefixal agreement is between the pre verb and the root). 3.3 Le vel 2: Semi-r egular Patter ns The purpose of Le vel 2 is to compile inflectional forms that are dependent on other forms (introduced in Le vel 1), and to pro vide def ault inflections for reg-ular tense formation patterns.

An example of the first case is the Conditional tense, formed predictably from the Future tense. The FST algorithm is as follo ws:  X   X   X   X 
An example of the second case is the Present 3PlSubj suf fix, which is -en for most transiti ve verbs, but -ian for a few others (see Fig. 1). Xfst pro vides a simplified feature unification mechanism called flag diacritics . Using these flags, we specify exceptional forms in Le vel 1, so that def ault inflections do not apply to them in Le vel 2.

The patterns defined at Le vel 2 are compiled into a single netw ork, which serv es as input to Le vel 3. 3.4 Le vel 3: Regular Patter ns The purpose of Le vel 3 is to affix regular inflection: object and non-3rd person subject agreement. As described in section 2, agreement in Geor gian is ex-pressed via a combination of a pre-stem affix and a suf fix, which are best thought of as attaching si-multaneously and working in tandem to express both subject and object agreement. Thus the compilation of Le vel 3 consists of several steps, each of which corresponds to a paradigm cell.

The operation of the model is partially illustrated on forms of the verbs  X  X aint X  and  X  X pen X  in Figure 1. 3.5 Treatment of Lexical Classes The input to Le vel 1 contains a representati ve for each lexical class, supplied with a diacritic feature indicating the class number . Other verbs that belong to those classes could, in principle, be inputted along with the class number , and the FST model could substitute the appropriate roots in the process of compiling the netw orks. Ho we ver, there are several challenges to this straightforw ard implementation. Verbs belonging to the same class may have dif-ferent pre verbs, thus complicating the substitution. For man y verbs, tense formation involv es stem alter -nations such as syncope or vowel epenthesis, again complicating straightforw ard substitution. Supple-tion is also quite common in Geor gian, requiring completely dif ferent stems for dif ferent tenses.
As a result, even for a verb whose lexical class is kno wn, several pieces of information must be sup-plied to infer the complete inflectional paradigm. The FST substitution mechanisms are fairly re-stricted, and so the compilation of new verbs is done in Java. The scripts mak e non-e xample verbs look lik e example verbs in Le vel 1 of the FST netw ork by creating the necessary inflected forms, but the hu-man input to the scripts need only include the infor -mation necessary to identify the lexical class of the verb . At the initial stages of modeling, we have concen-trated on regular transiti ve verbs and frequent irre g-ular verbs. The model currently contains several verbs from each of the 17 transiti ve verb classes mentioned in (Melikishvili 2001), and a gro wing number of frequent irre gular verbs from dif ferent conjug ation classes. Re gular unaccusati ve, uner ga-tive, and indirect verbs will be added in the near fu-ture, with the goal of pro viding full inflections for 200 most frequent Geor gian verbs.

The model serv es as the basis for an online learner X  s reference for Geor gian conjug ations (Gure-vich 2005), which is the only such reference cur -rently available.

A dra wback of most finite-state models is their in-ability to generalize to novel items the way a human could. Ho we ver, the output of our finite-state model could potentially be used to generate training sets for connectionist or statistical models.
