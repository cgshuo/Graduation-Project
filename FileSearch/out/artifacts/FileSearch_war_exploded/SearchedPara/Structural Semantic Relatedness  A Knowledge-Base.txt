 Name ambiguity problem is common on the Web. For example, the name  X  X ichael Jordan X  represents more than ten persons in the Google search results. Some of them are shown below: 
The name ambiguity has raised serious prob-lems in many relevant areas, such as web person search, data integration, link analysis and know-ledge base population. For example, in response to a person query, search engine returns a long, flat list of results containing web pages about several namesakes. The u sers are then forced either to refine their query by adding terms, or to browse through the search results to find the per-son they are seeking. Besides, an ever-increasing number of question answering and information extraction systems are coming to rely on data from multi-sources, where name ambiguity will lead to wrong answers and poor results. For ex-ample, in order to extract the birth date of the Berkeley professor Michael Jordan , a system may return the birth date of his popular name-sakes, e.g., the basketball player Michael Jordan . 
So there is an urgent demand for efficient, high-quality named entity disambiguation me-thods. Currently, the common methods for named entity disambiguation include name ob-servation clustering (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and entity linking with knowledge base (McNa-mee and Dang, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the method of name observation clustering. Giv-en a set of observations O = {o 1 , o 2 , ..., o n } of the target name to be disambiguated, a named entity disambiguation system should group them into a sulting cluster corresponding to one specific enti-ty. For example, consider the following four ob-servations of Michael Jordan : A named entity disambiguation system should group the 1 st and 4 th Michael Jordan observations into one cluster for they both refer to the Berke-ley professor Michael Jordan , meanwhile group the other two Michael Jordan into another clus-ter as they refer to another person, the Basketball Player Michael Jordan . 
To a human, named entity disambiguation is usually not a difficult task as he can make deci-sions depending on not only contextual clues, but also the prior background knowledge. For exam-ple, as shown in Figure 1, with the background knowledge that both Learning and Graphical models are the topics related to Machine learning , while Machine learning is the sub domain of Computer science , a human can easily determine that the two Michael Jordan in the 1 st and 4 th ob-servations represent the same person. In the same way, a human can also easily identify that the two Michael Jordan in the 2 nd and 3 rd observa-tions represent the same person. 
The development of systems which could rep-licate the human disambiguation ability, however, is not a trivial task because it is difficult to cap-ture and leverage the semantic knowledge as humankind. Conventionally, the named entity disambiguation methods measure the similarity between name observations using the bag of words (BOW) model (Bagga and Baldwin (1998); Mann and Yarowsky (2006); Fleischman and Hovy (2004); Pedersen et al. (2005)), where a name observation is represented as a feature vec-tor consisting of the contextual terms. This mod-el measures similarity based on only the co-occurrence statistics of terms, without consider-ing all the semantic relations like social related-ness between named entities, associative related-ness between concepts, and lexical relatedness (e.g., acronyms, synonyms) between key terms. 
Fortunately, in recent years, due to the evolu-tion of Web (e.g., the Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web ) and many research efforts for the construc-tion of knowledge bases, there is an increasing availability of large-scale knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia and WordNet . These large-scale knowledge sources create new opportuni-ties for knowledge-based named entity disam-biguation methods as they contain rich semantic knowledge. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the link structure of Wikipedia contains rich se-mantic relations between concepts. And we be-lieve that the disambiguation performance can be greatly improved by designing algorithms which can exploit these knowledge sources at best. 
The problem of these knowledge sources is that they are heterogeneous (e.g., they contain different types of semantic relations and different types of concepts) and most of the semantic knowledge within them is embedded in complex structures, such as graphs and networks. For ex-ample, as shown in Figure 2, the semantic rela-tion between Graphical Model and Computer Science is embedded in the link structure of the Wikipedia. In recent years, some research has investigated to exploit some specific semantic knowledge, such as the social connection be-tween named entities in the Web (Kalashnikov et al. (2008), Wan et al. (2005) and Lu et al. (2007)), the ontology connection in DBLP (Has-sell et al., 2006) and the semantic relations in Wikipedia (Cucerzan (2007), Han and Zhao (2009)). These knowledge-based methods, how-ever, usually are specialized to the knowledge sources they used, so they often have the know-ledge coverage problem. Furthermore, these me-thods can only exploit the semantic knowledge to a limited extent because they cannot take the structural semantic knowledge into consideration. 
To overcome the deficiencies of previous me-thods, this paper proposes a knowledge-based method, called Structural Semantic Relatedness ( SSR ), which can enhance the named entity dis-ambiguation by capturing and leveraging the structural semantic knowledge from multiple knowledge sources. The key point of our method is a reliable semantic relatedness measure be-tween concepts (including WordNet concepts, NEs and Wikipedia concepts), called Structural Semantic Relatedness , which can capture both the explicit semantic relations between concepts and the implicit seman tic knowledge embedded in graphs and networks. In particular, we first extract the semantic relations between two con-cepts from a variety of knowledge sources and represent them using a graph-based model, se-mantic-graph . Then based on the principle that  X  X wo concepts are semantic related if they are both semantic related to the neighbor concepts of each other X , we construct our Structural Seman-tic Relatedness measure. In the end, we leverage the structural semantic relatedness measure for named entity disambiguation and evaluate the performance on the standard WePS data sets. The experimental results show that our SSR me-thod can significantly outperform the traditional methods. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes how to construct the structural seman-tic relatedness measure. Next in Section 3 we describe how to leverage the captured knowledge for named entity disambiguation. Experimental results are demonstrated in Sections 4. Section 5 briefly reviews the related work. Section 6 con-cludes this paper and discusses the future work. In this section, we demonstrate the structural se-mantic relatedness measure, which can capture the structural semantic knowledge in multiple knowledge sources. Totally, there are two prob-lems we need to address: tic relations between concepts, since there are many types of semantic relations and they may exist as different patterns (the semantic know-ledge may exist as explicit semantic relations or be embedded in complex structures). tic relations between concepts in our semantic relatedness measure. 
To address the above two problems, in follow-ing we first introduce how to extract the semantic relations from multiple knowledge sources; then we represent the extracted semantic relations us-ing the semantic-graph model; finally we build our structural semantic relatedness measure. 2.1 Knowledge Sources We extract three types of semantic relations (se-mantic relatedness between Wikipedia concepts, lexical relatedness between WordNet concepts and social relatedness between NEs) correspon-dingly from three knowledge sources: Wikipedia, WordNet and NE Co-occurrence Corpus. lopedia, its English version includes more than 3,000,000 concepts and new articles are added quickly and up-to-date. Wikipedia contains rich semantic knowledge in the form of hyperlinks between Wikipedia articles, such as Polysemy (disambiguation pages), Synonym (redirect pages) and Associative relation (hyperlinks between Wikipedia articles). In this paper, we extract the semantic relatedness sr between Wikipedia con-cepts using the method described in Milne and Witten(2008): where a and b are the two concepts of interest, A and B are the sets of all the concepts that are re-Wikipedia. For demonstration, we show the se-mantic relatedness between four selected con-cepts in Table 1. Machine learning 0.58 0.00 MVP 0.00 0.45 lexical knowledge source includes over 110,000 WordNet concepts (word senses about English words). Various lexical relations are recorded between WordNet concepts, such as hyponyms , holonym and synonym . The lexical relatedness lr between two WordNet concepts are measured using the Lin (1998) X  X  WordNet semantic simi-larity measure. Table 2 shows some examples of the lexical relatedness. university 0.67 0.10 research 0.54 0.39 documents for capturing the social relatedness between named entities. According to the fuzzy set theory (Baeza-Yates et al., 1999), the degree of named entities co-occurrence in a corpus is a measure of the relatedne ss between them. For example, in Google search results, the  X  X hicago Bulls X  co-occurs with  X  X BA X  in more than 7,900,000 web pages, while only co-occurs with  X  X MNLP X  in less than 1,000 web pages. So the co-occurrence statistics can be used to measure the social relatedness between named entities. In this paper, given a NE Co-occurrence Corpus D , the social relatedness scr between two named entities ne 1 and ne 2 is measured using the Google Similarity Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007): where D 1 and D 2 are the document sets corres-pondingly containing ne 1 and ne 2 . An example of social relatedness is shown in Table 3, which is computed using the Web corpus through Google. EMNLP 0.61 0.00 Chicago Bulls 0.19 0.55 2.2 The Semantic-Graph Model In this section we present a graph-based repre-sentation, called semantic-graph , to model the extracted semantic relations as a graph within which the semantic relations are interconnected and transitive. Concretely, the semantic-graph is defined as follows: A semantic-graph is a weighted graph G = (V, 
E) , where each node represents a distinct con-cept; and each edge between a pair of nodes represents the semantic relation between the two concepts corresponding to these nodes, with the edge weight indicating the strength of the semantic relation. 
For demonstration, Figure 3 shows a semantic-graph which models the semantic knowledge extracted from Wikipedia for the Michael Jordan observations in Section 1. 
Given a set of name observations, the con-struction of semantic-graph takes two steps: con-cept extraction and concept connection. In the following we respectively describe each step. tract all the concepts in the contexts of name ob-servations and represent them as the nodes in the semantic-graph. We first gather all the N-grams (up to 8 words) and identify whether they corres-pond to semantically meaningful concepts: if a N-gram is contained in the WordNet, we identify it as a WordNet concept, and use its primary word sense as its semantic meaning; to find whether a N-gram is a named entity, we match it to the named entity list extracted using the open-Calais API3, which contains more than 30 types of named entities, such as Person, Organization and Award; to find whether a N-gram is a Wiki-pedia concept, we match it to the Wikipedia anc-hor dictionary, then find its corresponding Wiki-pedia concept using th e method described in ( Medelyan et al, 2008 ) . After concept identifica-tion, we filter out all the N-grams which do not correspond to the semantic meaningful concepts, such as the N-grams  X  learning in  X  and  X  wins NBA MVP  X . The retained N-grams are identified as concepts, corresponding with their semantic meanings (a concept may have multiple semantic meaning explanation, e.g., the  X  MVP  X  has three semantic meaning, as  X  most valuable player, MVP  X  in WordNet, as the  X  Most Valuable Play-er  X  in Wikipedia and as a named entity of Award type). represent the semantic relations as the edges be-tween nodes. That is, for each pair of extracted concepts, we identify whether there are semantic relations between them: 1) If there is only one semantic relation between them, we connect these two concepts with an edge, where the edge weight is the strength of the semantic relation; 2) If there is more than one semantic relations be-tween them, we choose the most reliable seman-tic relation, i.e., we c hoose the semantic relation in the knowledge sources according to the order of WordNet, Wikipedia and NE Co-concurrence corpus (Suchanek et al., 2007). For example, if both Wikipedia and WordNet provide the seman-tic relation between MVP and NBA , we choose the semantic relation provided by WordNet. 2.3 The Structural Semantic Relatedness In this section, we describe how to capture the semantic relations betw een the concepts in se-mantic-graph using a semantic relatedness meas-ure. Totally, the semantic knowledge between concepts is modeled in two forms: edges model the direct semantic relations be-tween concepts. We call this form of semantic knowledge as explicit semantic knowledge . cept for the edges, the structure of the semantic-graph also models the semantic knowledge of concepts. For example, the neighbors of a con-cept represent all the conc epts which are explicit-ly semantic-related to this concept; and the paths between two concepts re present all the explicit and implicit semantic relations between them. We call this form of semantic knowledge as structural semantic knowledge , or implicit se-mantic knowledge . 
Therefore, in order to deduce a reliable seman-tic relatedness measure, we must take both the edges and the structure of semantic-graph into consideration. Under the semantic-graph model, the measurement of semantic relatedness be-tween concepts equals to quantifying the similar-ity between nodes in a weighted graph. To simpl-ify the description, we assign each node in se-mantic-graph an integer index from 1 to | V | and use this index to represent the node, then we can write the adjacency matrix of the semantic-graph G as A , where A[i,j] or A ij is the edge weight be-tween node i and node j . 
The problem of quantifying the relatedness be-tween nodes in a graph is not a new problem, e.g., the structural equivalence and structural similar-ity (the SimRank in Jeh and Widom (2002) and the similarity measure in Leicht et al. (2006)). However, these similarity measure s are not suit-able for our task, because a ll of them assume that the edges are uniform so that they cannot take edge weight into consideration. 
In order to take both the graph structure and the edge weight into account, we design the structural semantic relatedness measure by ex-tending the measure introduced in Leicht et al. (2006). The fundamental principle behind our measure is  X  X  node u is semantically related to another node v if its immediate neighbors are semantically related to v  X . This definition is natu-ral, for example, as shown in Figure 3, the con-cept Basketball and its neighbors NBA and Chi-cago Bulls are all semantically related to MVP . This de fi nition is recursive, and the starting point we choose is the semantic relatedness in the edge. Thus our structural semantic relatedness has two components: the neighbor term of the previous recursive phase which captures the graph struc-ture and the semantic relatedness which captures the edge information. Thus, the recursive form of the structural semantic relatedness S ij between the node i and the node j can be written as: where  X  and  X  control the relative importance of the two components and 
N i ={j | A ij &gt; 0} is the set of the immediate neighbors of node i ; In order to solve this formula, we introduce the following two notations: T : The relatedness transition matrix, where 
T[i,j]=A ij /d i , indicating the transition rate of re-latedness from node j to its neighbor i . 
S : The structural semantic relatedness matrix, where S[i,j]=S ij . Now we can turn our first form of structural se-mantic relatedness into the matrix form: By solving this equation, we can get: where I is the identity matrix. Since  X  is a pa-rameter which only contributes an overall scale factor to the relatedness value, we can ignore it and get the final form of the structural semantic relatedness as: Because the S is asymmetric, the finally related-ness between node i and node j is the average of S and S ji . The meaning of  X  : The last question of our structural semantic relatedness measure is how to set the free parameter  X  . To understand the meaning of  X  , let us expand the similarity as a power series thus: 
Noting that the [ T k ] ij element is the relatedness transition rate from node i to node j with path length k , we can view the  X  as a penalty factor for the transition path length: by setting the  X  with a value within (0, 1), a longer graph path will contribute less to the final relatedness value. The optimal value of  X  is 0.6 through a learning process shown in Section 4. For demonstration, Table 4 shows some structural semantic related-ness values of the Semantic-graph in Figure 3 ( CS represents computer science and GM represents Graphical model ). From Table 4, we can see that the structural semantic relatedness can successfully capture the semantic knowledge embedded in the structure of semantic-graph, such as the implicit semantic relation between Researcher and Learning . In this section we describe how to leverage the semantic knowledge captured in the structural semantic relatedness measure for named entity disambiguation. Because the key problem of named entity disambiguation is to measure the similarity between name observations, we inte-grate the structural semantic relatedness in the similarity measure, so that it can better reflect the actual similarity betw een name observations. 
Concretely, our named entity disambiguation system works as follows: 1) Measuring the simi-larity between name observations; 2) Grouping name observations using the clustering algorithm. In the following we describe each step in detail. 3.1 Measuring the Similarity between Name Intuitively, if two observations of the target name represent the same entity, it is highly possible that the concepts in their contexts are closely re-lated, i.e., the named entities in their contexts are socially related and the Wikipedia concepts in their contexts are semantically related. In con-trast, if two name observations represent differ-ent entities, the concepts within their contexts will not be closely related. Therefore we can measure the similarity between two name obser-vations by summarizing all the semantic related-ness between the concepts in their contexts. 
To measure the similarity between name ob-servations, we represent each name observation as a weighted vector of concepts (including named entities, Wikipedia concepts and Word-Net concepts), where the concepts are extracted using the same method described in Section 2.2, so they are just the same concepts within the se-mantic-graph. Using the same concept index as the semantic-graph, a name observation o i is then represented as the k th concept X  X  weight in observation o i , com-puted using the standard TFIDF weight model, where the DF is computed using the Google Web1T 5-gram corpus 4 . Given the concept vec-tor representation of two name observations o i and o j , their similarity is computed as: which is the weighted average of all the structur-al semantic relatedness between the concepts in the contexts of the two name observations. 3.2 Grouping Name Observations through Given the computed similarities, name observa-tions are disambiguated by grouping them ac-cording to their represented entities. In this paper, we group name observations using the hierar-chical agglomerative clustering(HAC) algorithm, which is widely used in prior disambiguation research and evaluation task (WePS1 and WePS2). The HAC produce clusters in a bottom-up way as follows: Initially, each name observa-tion is an individual cluster; then we iteratively merge the two clusters with the largest similarity value to form a new cluster until this similarity value is smaller than a preset merging threshold or all the observations reside in one common cluster. The merging threshold can be deter-mined through cross-validation. We employ the single-link method to compute the similarity be-tween two clusters, which has been applied wide-ly in prior research (Bagga and Baldwin (1998); Mann and Yarowsky (2003)). To assess the performance of our method and compare it with traditional methods, we conduct a series of experiments. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed SSR method on the task of personal name disambiguation, which is the most common type of named entity disambiguation. In the following, we first explain the general expe-rimental settings in Section 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3; then evaluate and discuss the performance of our me-thod in Section 4.4. 4.1 Disambiguation Data Sets We adopted the standard data sets used in the First Web People Search Clustering Task ( WePS1 ) (Artiles et al., 2007) and the Second Web People Search Clustering Task ( WePS2 ) (Artiles et al., 2009). The three data sets we used are WePS1_training data set, WePS1_test data set, and WePS2_test data set. Each of the three data sets consists of a set of ambiguous personal names (totally 109 personal names); and for each name, we need to disambiguate its observations in the web pages of the top N (100 for WePS1 and 150 for WePS2 ) Yahoo! search results. 
The experiment made the standard  X  X ne per-son per document X  assumption, which is widely used in the participated systems in WePS1 and WePS2, i.e., all the observations of the same name in a document are assumed to represent the same entity. Based on this assumption, the fea-tures within the entire web page are used to dis-ambiguate personal names. 4.2 Knowledge Sources There were three knowledge sources we used for our experiments: the WordNet 3.0; the Sep. 9, 2007 English version of Wikipedia; and the Web pages of each ambiguous name in WePS datasets as the NE Co-occurrence Corpus. 4.3 Evaluation Criteria We adopted the measures used in WePS1 to eva-luate the performance of name disambiguation. These measures are: 
Purity ( Pur ): measures the homogeneity of name observations in the same cluster ; 
Inverse purity ( Inv_Pur ): measures the com-pleteness of a cluster ; 
F-Measure ( F ): the harmonic mean of purity and inverse purity . 
The detailed definitions of these measures can be found in Amigo, et al. (2008). We use F-measure as the primary measure just liking WePS1 and WePS2. 4.4 Experimental Results We compared our method with four baselines: (1) BOW: The first one is the traditional Bag of Words model ( BOW ) based methods: hierarchic-al agglomerative clustering (HAC) over term vector similarity, where the features including single words and NEs, and all the features are weighted using TFIDF. This baseline is also the state-of-art method in WePS1 and WePS2. (2) SocialNetwork: The second one is the social network based methods, which is the same as the method described in Malin et al. (2005): HAC over the similarity obtained through random walk over the social network built from the web pages of the top N search results. (3) SSR-NoKnowledge: The third one is used as a base-line for evaluating the efficiency of semantic knowledge: HAC over the similarity computed on semantic-graph with no knowledge integrated, i.e., the similarity is computed as: (4) SSR-NoStructure : The fourth one is used as a baseline for evaluating the efficiency of the semantic knowledge embedded in complex struc-tures: HAC over the similarity computed by only integrating the explicit semantic relations, i.e., the similarity is computed as: 4.4.1 Overall Performance We conducted several experiments on all the three WePS data sets: the four baselines, the pro-posed SSR method and the proposed SSR me-thod with only one special type knowledge added, respectively SSR-NE , SSR-WordNet and SSR-Wikipedia . All the optimal merging thresholds used in HAC were selected by applying leave-one-out cross validation. The overall perfor-mance is shown in Table 5. 
From the performance results in Table 5, we can see that: 1) The semantic knowledge can greatly im-prove the disambiguation performance: com-pared with the BOW and the SocialNetwork baselines, SSR respectively gets 8.7% and 14.7% improvement on average on the three data sets. 2) By leveraging the semantic knowledge from multiple knowledge sources, we can obtain a better named entity disambiguation perfor-mance: compared with the SSR-NE  X  X  0% im-provement, the SSR-WordNet  X  X  2.3% improve-ment and the SSR-Wikipedia  X  X  3.7% improve-ment, the SSR gets 6.3% improvement over the SSR-NoKnowledge baseline, which is larger than all the SSR methods with only one type of se-mantic knowledge integrated. 3) The exploitation of the structural seman-tic knowledge can further improve the disambig-uation performance: compared with SSR-NoStructure , our SSR method achieves 4.3% im-provement. 4.4.2 Optimizing Parameters There is only one parameter  X  needed to be con-figured, which is the penalty factor for the rela-tedness transition path length in the structural semantic relatedness measure. Usually a smaller  X  will make the structural semantic knowledge contribute less in the resulting relatedness value. Figure 4 plots the performance of our method corresponding to the special  X  settings. As shown in Figure 4, the SSR method is not very sensitive to the  X  and can achieve its best aver-age performance when the value of  X  is 0.6 . 4.4.3 Detailed Analysis To better understand the reasons why our SSR method works well and how the exploitation of structural semantic knowledge can improve per-formance, we analyze the results in detail. The Exploitation of Semantic Knowledge. The primary advantage of our method is the exploita-tion of semantic knowledge. Our method exploits the semantic knowledge in two directions: Knowledge Sources. Using the semantic-graph model, our method can integrate the semantic knowledge extracted from multiple knowledge sources, while most traditional knowledge-based methods are usually specialized to one type of knowledge. By integrating multiple semantic knowledge sources, our method can improve the semantic knowledge coverage. embedded in complex structures. Using the struc-tural semantic relatedness measure, our method can exploit the implicit semantic knowledge em-bedded in complex structures; while traditional knowledge-based methods usually lack this abili-ty. The Rich Meaningful Features. One another advantage of our method is the rich meaningful features, which is brought by the multiple seman-tic knowledge sources. With more meaningful features, our method can better describe the name observations with less information loss. Furthermore, unlike the traditional N-gram fea-tures, the features enriched by semantic know-ledge sources are all semantically meaningful units themselves, so little noisy features will be added. The effect of rich meaningful features can also be shown in Table 5: by adding these fea-tures, the SSR-NoKnowledge respectively achieves 2.3% and 9.7% improvement over the BOW and the SocialNetwork baseline. In this section, we briefly review the related work. Totally, the traditional named entity dis-ambiguation methods can be classified into two categories: the shallow methods and the know-ledge-based methods. Most of previous named entity disambiguation researches adopt the shallow methods, which are mostly the natural extension of the bag of words ( BOW ) model. Bagga and Baldwin (1998) represented a name as a vector of its contextual words, then two names were predicted to be the same entity if their cosine similarity is above a threshold. Mann and Yarowsky (2003) and Niu et al. (2004) extended the vector representation with extracted biographic facts. Pedersen et al. (2005) employed significant bigrams to represent a name observation. Chen and Martin (2007) ex-plored a range of syntactic and semantic features. In recent years some research has investigated employing knowledge sources to enhance the named entity disambiguation. Bunescu and Pasca (2006) disambiguated the names using the cate-gory information in Wikipedia. Cucerzan (2007) disambiguated the names by combining the BOW model with the Wikipedia category information. Han and Zhao (2009) leveraged the Wikipedia semantic knowledge for computing the similarity between name observations. Bekkerman and McCallum (2005) disambi guated names based on the link structure of the Web pages between a set of socially related persons. Kalashnikov et al. (2008) and Lu et al. (2007) used the co-occurrence statistics between named entities in the Web. The social network was also exploited for named entity disambiguation, where similari-ty is computed through random walking, such as the work introduced in Malin (2005), Malin and Airoldi (2005), Yang et al.(2006) and Minkov et al. (2006). Hassell et al. (2006) used the relation-ships from DBLP to disambiguate names in re-search domain. In this paper we demonstrate how to enhance the named entity disambiguation by capturing and exploiting the semantic knowledge existed in multiple knowledge sources. In particular, we propose a semantic relatedness measure, Struc-tural Semantic Relatedness , which can capture both the explicit semantic relations and the im-plicit structural semantic knowledge. The expe-rimental results on the WePS data sets demon-strate the efficiency of the proposed method. For future work, we want to develop a framework which can uniformly model the semantic know-ledge and the contextual clues for named entity disambiguation.
