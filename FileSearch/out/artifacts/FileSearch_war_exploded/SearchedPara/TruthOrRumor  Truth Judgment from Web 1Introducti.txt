 Some truth judgment methods have been proposed [1]. A difficulty in truth judgment is the lack of knowledge, especially for the truth judgment on open-field claims. knowledge from web for truth judgment. Web-based truth judgment brings following technical challenges. completely different comments in different sites. For example, floods may be said on some blogs in 2012 (the end of the world), while CNN did not report it. a month ago. A concert had changed the time, but we still arrive at the old time. er recognize the different meanings we speak. practice. On the other hand, they ignore the currency of information and copying rela-ment system for open field has been proposed. 
To support practical truth judgment, we develop TruthOrRumer, a web-based truth judgment system. Our system has following features. (1). In contrast of crawling web pages, we use search engine to obtain sufficient re-of search engine, our system could judge claims in open fields. sources. Thus, the accuracy of our system keeps on increasing with more usages. (3). The reasons for truth judgment are shown in our system. With this feature, us-ers could explore the background and related information for the truth judgment. This makes the judgment results more trustable. (4). We provide a single graphical interface. Even a preliminary user could use the system easily. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the system over-demonstrations are discussed in Section 4. The conclusions are drawn in Section 5. The organization of the system is shown in Figure 1. Then we describe these modules are follows.  X  Input Interface Module: This module collects users X  input.  X  Formation of Antisense Sentence: This module the system finds words such as verbs, adjectives, etc and matches thesaurus we established corresponding antonyms. As the result, the antisense statement of the input statement is generated. that the system uses the results of our analysis to combine the search terms.  X  Knowledge Base: To improve efficiency and increase accuracy, we use a know-ledge base in the system. Based on the knowledge base, the relevant contents are ob-tained. We stored knowledge prior that we have to admit. When users use the system, the speed and accuracy of speech. draw the conclusion. The details of this part will be discussed in Section 3.1.  X  Result Showing Interface: This module shows the judgment results to the users. module, users could review the websites that support or oppose the statement to make their own decisions. 3.1 Search Results Analysis numbers will draw wrong conclusions. Additionally, if some web sites copy each other, takes both the reliability and the copy between data sources into consideration.
We use a weighted voting strategy for truth judgment. To reduce the affects of re-the content of the web pages, irrelevant pages are filtered. The votes are from remain-currency factor. The computation of these parameters will be discussed in Section 3.2 from history judgment records in period. 3.2 Reliability Computation We compute the reliability of the web page from two aspects. The first is its accuracy in history record and the second is the copying relationship.
