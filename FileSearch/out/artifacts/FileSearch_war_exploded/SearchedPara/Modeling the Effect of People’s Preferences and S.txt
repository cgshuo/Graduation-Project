 Recommender systems within social networks face three dis-tinct challenges: suggesting what to consume/adopt, what to share and who to share it with. For all three cases, my and others X  research work shows that people X  X  decisions to adopt and share depend not only on their preferences for items, but also on social forces such as influence, conformity and identity management. Modeling the combined effects of people X  X  preferences and social forces can lead to socially-aware recommender algorithms and interfaces as well more accurate models of information diffusion.

I take a bottom-up approach to understanding how items are shared or adopted in a social network. First, I conduct behavioral experiments that give insights about, and allow to model the processes by which people decide to share or adopt items. Second, I use data from multiple social net-working websites to validate and extend these models and develop tractable algorithms to predict people X  X  decisions on items.

This paper presents preliminary models for adoption and sharing along with future directions towards more accurate models. Results of my current work indicate that people consider their own preferences for items more than the recip-ients X  when sharing and share only highly liked items. When adopting, people X  X  preferences towards items matter, but so do annotations that accompany recommendations based on social influences; I show how their relative effects can be modeled as a mixture distribution.

People curate online social networks to discover, consume and share items such as URLs (Twitter), music (Last.fm), movies (Flixster), books (Goodreads) pictures (Flickr), prod-ucts (Etsy) and even code (Github). Many of these websites have millions of users and typically use recommender sys-tems to help users sift through vast amounts of content.
However, while recommender models have been proposed that account for homophily within social networks [17, 9], how social forces such as influence, conformity or manage-ment of interpersonal relationships affect adoption and shar-ing in these networks is less understood. Studying the fac-tors that affect people X  X  decision to adopt or share items can lead to recommendation algorithms and interfaces that bet-ter support user goals, for example, suggesting who to share an item with, or displaying effective social annotations for an item that helps users in evaluating it.

Further, understanding the combined effect of people X  X  preferences and social forces on their decisions would also lead to more accurate models of information diffusion within social networks. Buoyed by the abundance of data due to online networks, recent years have seen studies of diffusion which track topics, analyze the underlying network struc-ture, or study the spread of items in social networks such as Twitter, Digg, Flickr and Flixster. The models that ex-plain how these items are adopted and shared, however, are inspired from other settings such as the spread of diseases, interaction of particles [5], or the copying of behavior within a mob [6], and are inadequate to explain the observed adop-tion behavior in social media [4].

Current models are inadequate, in large part, because they fail to recognize that adopting and sharing items are two dis-tinct, deliberate, socially-embedded actions that also depend on people X  X  preferences for items. Unlike diseased individ-uals or mob actors, people in an online social network can voluntarily decide what activities or items to share and to whom. For instance, what gets shared to whom depends on factors such as a sharer X  X  propensity to share, relations be-tween the sharer and the recipient including tie strength, and people X  X  motivations for sharing such as the need to express oneself, provide information, demonstrate expertise or help others [14]. System interfaces also matter; my past research has shown how Liking a movie on Facebook, an activity that gets shared automatically has a different connotation and usage among people than private actions such as rating a movie [11]. As another example showing the distinction between adoption and sharing, a recent study of web traffic found little correlation between number of shares for a URL and whether people saw its contents fully. http://blog.chartbeat.com/2013/10/28/understanding-traffic-sources-part-3-social-traffic/ [Accessed May 2014]
These observations suggest a new perspective for design-ing recommender systems and modeling diffusion in social networks, which takes into account people X  X  preferences and social forces around sharing and adopting items. A key chal-lenge in this work is to model the processes by which people make decisions for sharing and adoption. While observed activities like liking and sharing expose the results of peo-ple X  X  decisions, they conceal the processes by which people arrive at their decision for an item.

To better understand these processes, I will employ a multi-method approach. I will use behavioral experiments to develop a qualitative understanding and build individual-level process models of how people think about, adopt and share items. In addition, I plan to analyze large-scale data from online social networks to validate and extend the above models, compare them across domains and simulate item diffusion through social networks.
My work marries research on recommendation systems, studying social influences in networks, and information dif-fusion towards understanding adoption and sharing of items in social networks. User modeling work from the recom-mender systems literature helps in modeling the preference of users towards different items. Theories and empirical studies of influence in social networks provide a guiding ba-sis for including social factors in process models for sharing and adoption.
 Recent works on recommendation in social networks incor-porate intuitive social signals (such as people connected to each other are likely to be similar) into their recommenda-tion models [9, 17, 15]. Alternatively, users X  preference can also be learned from just their social neighbors X  data [7, 11]. The gains of using social information, however, are often small (except for cold-start users) and vary with different networks [1, 13].

A possible reason is that the impact of social factors is complex; it varies with people, item domains and the rela-tionship between the sharer and the receiver [12]. For exam-ple, exposure to additional information such as the number of people who have adopted an item [12] or its predicted rating for a person [2] influences how people make decisions about items. Thus, developing a deeper understanding of how theories of social influences from sociology and social psychology impact people X  X  decisions about item recommen-dations can be useful.

However, most of the work on understanding influence in social networks concerns imitation actions, such as when people tweet the same URL on Twitter after a followee X  X  tweet mentioning it. One of the problems with measuring influence this way is that it is hard to know whether the imitation was because of influence or homophily ( X  X mitator X  discovered the URL independently), or which followee was the influencer in case of multiple followee X  X  tweets with the same URL.

Developing fine-grained measures of influence will help in correctly estimating influence due to social neighbors. For example, Tang et al. measure group conformity of a user by incorporating pairwise similarities in adoption with users and aggregating it over all users in a group [16]. In addition, behavioral experiments where we can control the exposure to an item will help in correctly identifying influence effects. While recommender models present techniques for predict-ing which items will be adopted or shared, research on infor-mation diffusion presents generative models for how items are adopted or shared [8, 4]. Two broad classes of dif-fusion models have emerged: threshold and dynamic cas-cade. Threshold models [6] assume that each person has a threshold for adopting an item which is met or not based on his social neighbors who have already adopted an item. In the simplest and most popular version of the model (Linear Threshold model), the effect of social neighbors is modeled as the total number of neighbors who has adopted an item.
Dynamic cascade models, on the other hand, assume a push-based transmission between people, based on work in interacting particle systems. After adopting an item, an in-dividual transmits the item to his social connections based on the probability of transmission to each of his connec-tions [5]. In the simplest cascade model called Independent Cascade, these probabilities of transmission are independent of each other and each adopter makes only one attempt to transmit the item to a neighbor.

Many extensions of these two basic models have been pro-posed. Still, diffusion models suffer from two limitations. First, they assume that adopted items automatically become candidates for sharing which would be true for involuntarily shared items such as diseases or computer viruses, but not for consciously shared items in social networks. Another limitation of these models is that they are item-agnostic. That is, given a social network, success or failure of the dif-fusion process between any two individuals is independent of the item being diffused. This means that they cannot account for effects due to people X  X  preferences for items, as recommender systems are well-suited to do.
 Combining learnings from both communities X  X reference learn-ing techniques from recommender systems and generative process models from diffusion X  X rovides a promising research direction [10]. In particular, analyzing micro-level dynamics of adoption and sharing, as opposed to population-level dy-namics in social networks, can help in answering questions such as when is a user more likely to adopt or share a partic-ular item, and which users are more likely to be influenced by it? I next describe my progress on these questions.
The main thrust of my thesis is to identify the factors that impact people X  X  sharing and adopting decisions, esti-mate their relative impact, and use this knowledge to model people X  X  decision processes around items. Discriminative versions of such process models are used in predicting shar-ing or adoption activity, while generative versions of process models become useful in building diffusion models as pro-posed in Section 4.3.
My first study on modeling how additional social informa-tion affects people X  X  likelihood of trying recommended items provides an example methodology that uses social annota-tions to trigger and measure social influence [12]. Many websites explain their recommendations with social infor-mation, such as  X  X mit likes it X  or  X 10 of your friends like it X . I conducted an experiment with 237 participants, where par-ticipants were shown musical artist recommendations along with social annotations and asked to rate their likelihood of trying them out.

The results showed that the effect of annotations that em-body social influence (using names of close friends) exceeds that of annotations that work through social proof or con-formity (using raw numbers of people). Still, an analysis of ratings and people X  X  responses revealed that people X  X  own preferences and attitudes toward the recommended artists based on artist information such as name, genre, and album covers exerted a large influence on their decision-making. I formalized these notions through a generative mixture model of rating that combines a user X  X  own expectation of liking an item (as an exponential distribution) with additional social information (as a gaussian distribution). The relative effect of these distributions was moderated by a parameter that represents each user X  X  susceptibility to social information.
Apart from adoption, the other building block of diffusion at the micro-level is the process of sharing items to one X  X  social connections. To model how people X  X  preferences affect which items they share, I conducted a paired study in which participants rate and share movies to their partners from a set of movies shown to them. The set of available movies for a pair is selected from a mix of computed recommendations for each user, so that users have a chance to recommend items that are likely to align with their own preferences as well as their partner X  X .

Results from the study indicate that a person X  X  own rat-ing is the dominant factor for choosing which items to share. Users tend to share movies that they liked themselves and only sometimes consider recipients X  interests. Nevertheless, we find that shared movies are rated comparably by recip-ients to algorithmically recommended movies, which shows that users are able to capture some of the recipients X  pref-erences. These two seemingly contrarian results suggest a probable process model for selecting an item to share: peo-ple share items from a collection that they know about and likely have a strong feeling for, but they personalize their choice of the item based on the recipient. Experiment data also shows that users have different rates of sharing, sug-gesting that this model would need to account for people X  X  sharing propensity too.

Finally, I show that machine learning models that use the sender X  X  and recipient X  X  preferences can (noisily) predict which specific items are shared. A classifier using past movie Likes of the sender and recipient, and differences in people X  X  sharing propensity can predict shared items with more than 70% precision. To adapt these process models for large-scale online data, I plan to collect data through public APIs of popular social networks. I will analyze data from a broad range of online activities such as consuming content (books, music), sell-Domain Friends Adopt Action Share Action Last.fm Undirected Listen to song Favorite Goodreads Undirected Add to shelf Review, rate Etsy Directed Add to list Favorite Github Directed Contribute code Favorite Table 1: Properties of the datasets that I propose to study. Plausible adopt and share actions are deter-mined based on an observation of user activity and the specific design of system interfaces. ing products, writing code and sharing links. I will collect some of these data myself (Last.fm, Goodreads, Etsy and Github), others are already available (Flickr, Flixster, Digg and Twitter). Each of these datasets contains timestamped data about people X  X  Likes or Favorites, their friend connec-tions, and (if available) their exposure to different items.
Table 1 shows a qualitative comparison of some of these datasets. I have specified plausible adopt and share actions for these data based on observation of user activity and de-sign of the system interfaces (for example, which activities get shared to others). Note how I have chosen Favorite ac-tion on some domains as a share action, even though the standard interpretation of the term may consider it closer to adoption. The reason is that in these domains, Favorite actions of followees or friends are highlighted in the feed, while other actions are not; thus giving them a share-like connotation [11].
Reasonable proxies for exposure to social information and sharing will help me verify the process models proposed in my earlier work. This would require estimating factors such as an individual X  X  susceptibility for adoption (baseline prob-ability of adopting items), preferences for items, and social influence effects between any pair of connected people. Us-ing the speed at which a person X  X  preferences tend to come to resemble their neighbors X  will give useful estimates of sus-ceptibility, first overall (combining all neighbors) and then per-individual. Preferences of people for items can be readily learned through collaborative filtering using past adoptions.
Proxying influence effects due to exposure to social in-formation is harder using offline datasets that provide only preference information. Past work on modeling influence ef-fects of social neighbors have used all the neighbors [3], the first one or the last one who adopt an item as a proxy for exposure. To account for influence at a finer level, I will use tie strength and preference similarity measures to assign individual neighbors with weighted scores of influence for an individual. Instead of using raw number of neighbors, social exposure could also be estimated similarly as a tie-strength weighted sum of exposure due to each of the neighbors who adopted an item.

It may not be possible to accurately account for influ-ence effects in the data, but reasonable proxies will provide bounds for the amount of influence in each dataset. I will evaluate proposed models of influence by comparing their performance on predicting whether a user will adopt an item or not, in a typical machine learning train-test framework.
Process models for how people share and adopt items can also be combined to yield new diffusion models which incor-porate sharing and adopting as two separate decisions. Here I discuss a candidate diffusion model and propose ways to evaluate it.
 in discrete steps, each of which consists of a share step and a adoption step. In the beginning, each person has some pref-erences for items. At each step, some people choose items to share and others choose which items to adopt. People decide whether to share a specific item or not based on their process model for sharing. Similarly, adoption decisions for items are based on their process model for adoption. Note an important difference from previous diffusion models: un-der this model, all adopted items may not be candidates for sharing, and similarly, all shared items may not be adopted.
The main question, then, is how to operationalize process models for adoption and sharing. In most diffusion models, sharing and adoption parameters are set uniformly [8] or learnt from population-level data [3]. The process models that I will build based on observed behavior of individuals and dyads will offer a data-driven and explainable approach to estimate these parameters.

Based on the results in Section 3.1, the process model for adoption posits that people adopt items because of the combined effect of social influences and their preferences. The probability of adoption for an item by a person can be computed using the methods I described earlier to estimate the effect of preferences and social influences, weighted by a person X  X  estimated susceptibility to social influences. Then, at each adopt step, a person decides to adopt or not based on this computed probability. A similar share step can be constructed by considering the relative impact of senders X  and recipients X  preferences.

Although I focus on how people interact with items from their social neighbors, not all adoption events are based on explicit in-network sharing. Thus, the process models should also allow for spontaneous adoption of items, which consti-tutes much of the  X  X ark matter X  of adoptions that are not explained by traditional diffusion models [4]. This could be accounted for by allowing adoption for items which are not explicitly shared and using item-item recommendation al-gorithms that help estimate compatibility with preferences. That is, when compatibility with own preference is high, people may choose to adopt an item that matches their pref-erences even when it is not shared to them.
 ways. First, I will simulate the diffusion of items using my model and test how resultant spread of items across the social network compares with that found in the real-world datasets listed in Section 4.1. My earlier work on comparing assortativity or clustering of preference in social networks will provide useful metrics to compare simulated and real distribution of items in the social network [13].

Second, I will use the model to predict people X  X  actions on sharing and adoption. Starting from a given timestamp in a dataset, I will investigate how well the model can pre-dict people X  X  specific shares and adoptions and compare it to prior diffusion models and recommendation algorithms proposed for social networks.
Proposed work connects and extends research on social influences, preference modeling and information diffusion and presents a concise mathematical framework for mod-eling sharing and adopting decisions, which can be used for recommendation tasks within a social network as well as for understanding how information (ideas, products etc.) spreads in social networks.

As a contribution to the research community, I will re-lease the datasets and code used in my research for aca-demic use, and hope that they will start off further inquiries into learning about people X  X  decisions around items in so-cial networks. Finally, through my multi-methods research paradigm, I hope to demonstrate how iterating between data mining and behavioral exploration can be a viable method-ology for modeling online user behavior.
