 In this article, we briefly summarize the motivation, content and structure of the CNIKM X 09 workshop.
 H.2.8 [ DatabaseManagement ]: Database Applications X  data mining ; H.3.3 [ InformationStorageandRetrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Experimentation, Measurement, Performance Complex Networks, Data Management, Information Retrieval, Knowledge Discovery.
We are in a connected age: real-world entities often inter-connect with each other through explicit or implicit relation-ships to form a complex network, such as technological net-works , social networks, and information networks. They ex-hibit interesting statistical characteristics like  X  X mall-world X  [17] and  X  X cale-free X  [2].

The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of research on various complex networks. How can we anal-yse, manage and mine information in large-scale complex networks effectively and efficiently? This gives researchers in database, information retrieval and knowledge manage-ment great challenges as well as opportunities. In line with CIKM X  X  tradition of promoting interdisciplinary research, this workshop aims to bring together researchers across both computer science and the emerging network science to foster discussion and exchange ideas. Although these two scientific disciplines spea kquite different languages, they certainly can benefit a lot from each other by sharing their concepts, models, techniques, and tools, etc.

There will be one keynote talk and three technical paper sessions. Furthermore, all participants are encouraged to bring posters to the workshop to present their late breaking research results and discuss with others. Our invited speaker is Prof. Jure Leskovec of Stanford University. In his keynote talk [9], he will present their re-cent striking finding that large networks have very different clustering structure from well-studied small networks and graphs well-embeddable in a low-dimensional manifold. In networks of millions of nodes, tight communities exist at only very small scales (up to around 100 nodes), while at large scales networks becomes expander like. The prevalence of such a core-periphery structure in large networks suggests broader implications for future research in this area.
The Call for Papers (CFP) resulted in the submission of 19 papers from 12 countries. The Program Committee (PC) finally accepted 9 full papers and 3 short papers that were grouped into three subject areas (sessions).
Wu et al. applied community structure analysis to mas-sive telecom call graphs for customer relationship manage-ment [18]. Duan et al. addressed the difficult problem of community structure analysis on networks that are directed, weighted, and dynamic [5]. Lu et al. studied how variations in the size and other characteristics of personal networks affect global networ kproperties [12]. Kwon et al. analysed the interesting patterns of information diffusion in the social networ kof bloggers [8].
Chan et al. introduced a fast method to compute node closeness or betweenness centralities approximately in large networks that exhibit strong community structures [3]. dos Santos et al. proposed a clustering based approach to dis-covering potential collaborations in a social networ kof re-searcher staff [4]. Ma et al. proposed a classification based approach to identifying trust relationships among users of an online product review website [13]. Lu and Zhou showed the significant role of wea kties in lin kprediction for weighted networks [11].
Tanta-ngai et al. proposed an approach to collaborative tracking of documents based on self-organising peer-to-peer networks [16]. Bakker et al. investigated how neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering algorithms wor kin decentralised peer-to-peer networks where only partial knowledge is avail-able [1]. Spiegel et al. demonstrated how collaborative filter-ing and content-based filtering can be combined seamlessly through a unified networ kmodel [15]. Schering et al. de-scribed a novel application of complex networks in mobile tourist assistance, e.g., route recommendation [14].
Throughout this workshop, we see two noticeable trends in this fast-growing research area: one is the emphasis of investigating real networks data; the other is the confluence of different kinds of networks [7].

Fore sure, the theory of complex networks will find more and more successful applications in information and knowl-edge management. We believe that this workshop can not only promote the personal  X  X ub X  and  X  X uthority X  scores [6] of every participant, but also accelerate the  X  X ensification X  and  X  X iameter-shrinking X  processes [10] for the network of relevant researchers.
We would like to thank our PC members for doing a great reviewing job in a short period of time. We are also grateful to CIKM-2009 organisers for their support and help. [1] A. Bakker, E. Ogston, and M. van Steen.
