 1. Introduction fuels has led to a significant reduction of this resource worldwide.
Another problem that has arisen from this excessive use of fossil fuels is the large amount of atmospheric pollutants that are continuously released into the environment. These are the primary reasons why power production utilities have to focus their atten-tion on more optimal ways to use resources ( Kaplan, 2008 ). blems being dealt with in power system operation and planning ( Grainger and Stevenson, 1994 ; Travers et al., 1954 ; Wood and
Wollenberg, 1996 ). The purpose of ED is to schedule the outputs of all available generation units in the power system in order to minimize fuel costs while also satisfying all units and system equality and inequality constraints.
 of atmospheric pollutants on the environment, the more concern-ing greenhouse effect, as well as the environmental regulations have led to numerous requests that have forced utilities to modify their design or operational strategies. Therefore this study is concerned with minimizing fuel costs as well as minimizing the emission of gaseous pollutants. Combined economic-environ-mental power dispatch considers both optimization problems simultaneously, resulting in what is known as a multi-objective optimization problem ( Abido, 2003 ; Abido, 2009 ; Basu, 2008 ; King et al., 1995 ; Yare and Venayagamoorthy, 2010 ).

The combined economic-environmental dispatch problem is multidimensional, non-linear, non-convex and highly constrained.
It involves multiple and sometimes conflicting optimization cri-teria for which no unique optimal solution can be determined with respect to all criteria. These are the main reasons why the use of various heuristic algorithms, which deal with the problem, gain on popularity in the last two decades. Many methods are developed based on heuristic algorithms due to the fact that these algorithms are highly proven tool for function optimization. The main advan-tage of those methods over the conventional methods lies in their ability to deal with the problem using only the objective function.
Recent survey of the literature reveals large application of various heuristic algorithms, showing great success in finding almost global optimal solution for the combined economic-environmental dispatch problem ( Basu, 2011 ; Bhattacharya and Chattopadhyay, 2011 ; Lu et al., 2011 ; Neyestani et al., 2010 ; Sivasubramani and Swarup, 2011 ; Subbaraj et al., 2009 ; Wang and Singh, 2009 ).
In ( Basu, 2008 ) the author offers a solution for the dynamic combined-economic-environmental dispatch of thermal power system using elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (known as NSGA-II). This solution is compared with the solution obtained as a result of a relatively simple implementation of the weighted sum method using real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA). The latter method is known for its simplicity when one deals with multi-objective optimization problems. The results show slightly improved minimum achieved by NSGA-II over the weighted sum method. Similar application of genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed by Abido ( Abido, 2003 ) where the author uses novel implementation of the non-dominate genetic algorithm (NSGA) to solve static economic-environmental dispatch problem applied on a thermal power system. A fuzzy-based mechanism is employed to extract the best compromise solution over the trade-off curve.
The application of fuzzy set theory is also extended over wider range in power systems problems. In ( Ruey-Hsun and Jian-Hao, 2007 ) authors use various membership functions to take into account the uncertainties due to the prediction of: speed of wind, solar radiation, load prediction, etc. Similar approach was also proposed in reference ( Attaviriyanupap et al., 2004 ), where authors use fuzzy sets to take into account uncertainties due to: demand and reserves required in each market, prices cleared in each market, and the probability by which reserves are called upon in actual operation. The factors that affect the feasibility and optimality of the solutions to the economic dispatch problem, using fuzzy sets, are examined in ( Han et al., 2001 ).
In this paper a multi-objective optimization method for sol-ving the dynamic combined economic-environmental power dis-patch is proposed. The solution is based on the weighted sum method ( Deb, 2001 ). This method transforms the multi-objective optimization problem into single-objective optimization problem using weights. In general the method uses external penalty functions to deal with the constraint violations. The penalty functions are responsible to some extent for the distortion on the objective functions ( Deb, 2001 ), especially during the early generations. In order to achieve better properties for the weighted sum method a modified dynamic normalization is suggested. The improvement is made regarding penalty function integration. In order to calculate the constraint violations a penalization method based on membership functions is introduced. The method is integrated within a genetic algorithm and applied on various thermal and hydro-thermal power systems. The results are analyzed and the achieved optimal solutions are compared with other solutions obtained by different techniques described in the reviewed literature. 2. Combined economic-environmental power dispatch
The economic-environmental power dispatch problem can be stated as finding the thermal unit generation and corresponding water release from each reservoir throughout all planning time intervals, so as to minimize the total cost of fuel and pollutants emission while satisfying load balance, thermal, and hydraulic constraints. The objectives and constraints considered in the formulation of the combined economic emission power dispatch problem are addressed in this section. 2.1. Fuel cost function
The fuel cost for each thermal generating unit in the system is usually determined by a second order function of the active power generation. During opening of each admission valve in a steam turbine an event known as drawing effect is occurring ( Kumar and Naresh, 2007 ; Walters and Sheble, 1993 ). This rippling effect is modeled as sinusoidal function of the active power generation. Thus, the fuel cost function is written as non-linear and non-smooth function ( Abido, 2003 ; Basu, 2005 ) as follows:
FC  X  P where a i ($/h), b i (US$/MWh), c i ($/MW 2 h), d i ($/h) and e are constants which are unique for each generating unit, P power output of the i th thermal unit, P min G output of the i th thermal unit, and t m is the duration of the time interval in hours. It is usual practice that the scheduling time period is 24 h divided on 24 time intervals each lasting one hour with constant load demands. Within this paper two different scheduling periods were used, depending on the analyzed test power system.

The thermal unit cost is represented by Eq. (1). The total fuel cost from all thermal units in the system during the scheduled time period is determined as follows: F  X  where P G i , t is the power output of the i th thermal unit at time interval t , T is the number of considered time intervals under study, and I is the number of thermal units. 2.2. Emission function
The total emission of atmospheric pollutants, such as sulphur oxides (SO X ) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ), caused by thermal units can be modeled together and described by one function ( Abido, 2003 ; Basu, 2005 , 2008 , 2010 ) as follows:
FE  X  P thermal unit. The member 10 2 in the equation above is used only in the case when metric units are used for the input para-meters ( Basu, 2010 ).

The total emission of atmospheric pollutants from all thermal units in the system during the scheduled time period is deter-mined as follows: F  X  2.3. Constraints 2.3.1. Power balance constraint
The power balance equations constraint suggests that the sum of output powers from all generating units must be equal to the total load demand plus the power losses in the system at each time interval, and it is expressed as follows: P hydro generating unit connected with reservoir j at time interval
Beta coefficients ( Basu, 2005 , 2008 ) were used to calculate the power losses for the analyzed test systems. Two different math-ematical models were considered for the hydro generating units.
Model 1: The water discharge from each plant is determined as a second order function from the generated power output ( Basu, 2005 ), therefore the water availability constraint is described as follows: function of hydro generation unit j , and W H j is pre-specified volume of water available for generation by the j th hydro generation unit. This model uses only the water availability constraint, Eq. (6), and the corresponding power generator capa-city constraints when calculating the hydro power output, P
Model 2: This model describes a hydraulic system network ( Basu, 2010 ; Yuan et al., 2008 ), where reservoirs are hydraulically connected with natural or artificial water channels. The hydro generator power output is a function of the water discharge through the turbine and the volume of stored water in the reservoir ( Basu, 2010 ; Lakshminarasimman and Subramanian, 2008 ; Yuan and Yuan, 2006 ) as follows: time interval t and X j , t is the volume of water discharge from the j th reservoir during time interval t .
 determined ( Basu, 2010 ) as follows: where I j , t is the natural water inflow volume in the j th reservoir at time interval t , N UP is the number of upstream reservoirs, t water transport delay from reservoir l to j , X l ,  X  t t discharge from the l th upstream reservoir at time t t lj is the water spillage of the l th upstream reservoir at time t t expressed as follows: where V min j and V max j are the minimum and maximum water volumes for the j th reservoir, respectively and X min j and X the minimum and maximum water discharge volumes from the j th reservoir, respectively.
 follows: j th reservoir, respectively. 2.3.2. Generator capacity constraints where P min G outputs for the i th thermal unit, respectively and P min the minimum and maximum power outputs for the j th hydro unit, respectively.

The power produced by each thermal unit is bounded by its ramping response rate limits as follows ( Simopoulos et al., 2007 ): where MI i and MD i are the maximum increase and maximum decrease in the output of the i th thermal unit over one time interval respectively. 2.4. Objective functions
Functions F C and F E , represented by Eqs. (2) and (4), are the objective functions, i.e. the functions to be minimized. Aggregat-ing the objectives and constraints, the economic-environmental power dispatch optimization problem can be mathematically formulated as a nonlinear, constrained, multi-objective optimiza-tion problem as follows:
Minimize  X  F C  X  x  X  , F E  X  x  X  X  16  X  subject to: g  X  x  X  X  0  X  17  X  h  X  x  X  r 0  X  18  X  where g ( x ) and h ( x ) are the equality and inequality problem constraints, respectively, and x is a decision vector that represents possible solution. The form of the solution is given latter on in the paper with Eq. (39). 3. Problem solution 3.1. Multi objective optimization-weighted sum method
The weighted sum method, as the name suggests, transforms a set of objectives into a single objective by pre-multiplying each objective with user-supplied weight. The weight of an objective is usually chosen in proportion to the objective X  X  relative importance to the problem. It is likely that each objective function takes different orders of magnitude as in the combined economic-environmental power dispatch. Therefore, setting up an appropri-ate weight factor depends on the scaling of each objective function ( Deb, 2001 ). It is the usual practice to choose weights such that their sum is equal to one. The combined economic-environmental power dispatch problem can be formulated as follows:
Minimize f  X  wF C  X  X  1 w  X  s F E  X  19  X  where s is the normalization factor which can be essential, simply because each objective function may take different range of values, and w is the weighting factor which defines the change of pressure over each objective function. In this paper the normalization factor is determined as the ratio between the maximum fuel cost and maximum emission as follows:  X 
The weighting factor, w , can take any number between 0 and 1. When w is set to 0.5 equal weight is given to both objective functions, thus giving them equal chances to be minimized. A set of different values for w leads to a set of different solutions which are known as Pareto optimal solutions.

The definition of the fitness function does not stop with the con-straint objective function shown with Eq. (19). Due to the possible violation in constraints, penalty functions are employed. Therefore, the constrained objective function presented with Eq. (19) is upgraded with an external penalty term and transformed into an unconstrained fitness function as follows: F  X  f  X  f pen  X  21  X  where: f d m is the penalty parameter, VIOL m is the constraint violation and N is the number of constraints involved. The purpose of the penalty parameter, d m , is to scale the value of the constraint violation to a value that matches the objective fu nction value. In fact the objective functionsandtheconstraintscanbeconsideredasseparateobjec-tives ( Mezura-Montes and Coello, 2008 ; Woldesenbetetal.,2009 ). As shown with Eq. (21) the constra int violations are add in to the fitness function as separate objective function. The constraints objective function is described with Eq. (22).

Similar usage of weighted sum method is shown in ( Alcala  X  et al., 2005 ). The authors proposed a usage of fuzzy sets in order to define fuzzy goals for the tackled objectives in a real coded GA with aggregation of the objective functions. 3.2. Dynamic normalization
The purpose of the penalty function is to give adequate pres-sure to the fitness function in order to deal with the constraint violations successfully. It is usual for one to apply a static normal-ization of the penalty functions when the unconstrained fitness function from Eq. (21) is to be minimized. The penalty parameter d m is used as normalization factor for each of the constraints involved. Instead of separate penalty parameter for each con-straint, herein only one penalty parameter, d s , was used. It is clear that the penalty function pressure is proportional to the penalty parameter.

The inclusion of the penalty function distorts the objective function ( Deb, 2001 ). Therefore, choosing the right parameter is from significant importance. For small values of penalty para-be near the constraint optimum. On the other side, if a large d used, the optimum of F ( x ) is closer to the true constraint optimum, but the distortion may be so severe that F ( x ) may have artificial local optimal solutions.

In ( Joines and Houck, 1994 ) a dynamic normalization method for the penalty parameter is proposed. The method uses stepwise increase of the penalty term, i.e. the penalty parameter increases as the number of generation grows. The tuning of three user defined constants is required. In this study, a modified dynamic normalization method is proposed. The purpose of this method is to mitigate severe distortion of the objective functions caused by the penalty term. To accomplish this, a  X  X  X ressure distribution X  X  parameter is introduced within the static penalty parameter as follows: d  X  p d d s  X  23  X 
The parameter, p d , is function of the number of generation and it follows the  X  X  X ressure distribution function X  X  presented on Fig. 1 .
The penalty parameter was calculated as follows: d  X 
The parameters gen ands max gen from Fig. 1 are the number of generation and the maximum number of generation defined in the GA, and k is user defined parameter. This parameter defines the generation from which the penalty pressure will be fully applied (in this study it was set to 0.60). When the dynamic penalty parameter is applied, the fitness function from Eq. (21) is written as follows: F  X  f  X  d d
During the early generation, when the possible solutions are still away from optimal solutions, there is relatively large prob-ability that the pressure from the penalty function will lead the search towards local optimum. To avoid this phenomena the distribution function is set to start from near zero values and grow slowly, especially in the early generation, such that exten-sive distortion of the objective functions will be mitigated. This allows the generated offspring to be more focused on the mini-mization/maximization of the objective functions. As the number of generation grows, the pressure from the penalty functions is growing as well, allowing the algorithm to deal with the con-straints avoiding severe distortion of the objective functions. 3.3. Membership function penalization
A constraint optimization problem is triple X , f , f , where X is a free search space, f is a real valued objective function X , which has to be minimized, f is a formula (Boolean function on X ).
A solution of a constrained optimization problem is x A X with f ( x )  X  true and an optimal f -value ( Corne et al., 1999 ).
The common opinion about evolutionary algorithms is that they are good optimizers, although they cannot handle constraints well. This opinion is based on the observation that the variation operators, mutation and reproduction, are  X  X  X lind X  X  to constraints ( Michalewicz, 1995 , 1996 ). In other words, if the parents satisfy certain constraints, the offspring obtained by mutation and/or recombination might violate them. In the past several options have been proposed to overcome this problem. Among all constraint handling methods, penalizing infeasible individuals/chromosomes is the simplest and the most extended one ( Mezura-Montes, 2009 ;
Mezura-Montes and Coello Coello, 2011 ; Michalewicz, 1995 ). First of all, if it is applied to all constraints then minimizing the total penalty is the only thing to be done. In other words, it transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained opti-mization problem as shown with Eq. (21).

In order to estimate the constraint violations, in this study, an exterior penalty method was proposed. The method uses mem-bership functions in order to evaluate the constraint violations.
Because not all constraints take the same order of magnitude, this method is also used as tool for normalization of all constraint violations to values between 0 and 1. Therefore, no need for further adjustment is required. This is perfectly in compliance with the single normalization parameter, d d , used for aggregating of the penalty term in the fitness function (Eq. (25)). and system equality and inequality constraints in an efficient manner. For each of the constraints which are not initially included in the initial population such as power balance (5), water availability constraint (6), water balance at each time interval (9), water balance at the end of the time period (12) and ramping response rate (15) a unique membership function was employed ( Gjorgiev, 2010 ) as follows: section are the variable boundaries, referred as internal con-straints. They are included directly in the algorithm procedure, starting from the initial population which is generated randomly within these boundaries, continuing through reproduction pro-cess where all other new variables are introduced within the boundaries. 3.3.1. Membership function for the power balance constraint generation from all generating units, P S at each time interval t must be equal to the sum of load demand, P L , and power system loses, P loss at the same time interval. Because there is probability that these values will differ from each other, the difference in percent D P L is calculated. A membership function m ~ P as shown on Fig. 2 is used. The membership value of 1 is assigned when D P and smaller than 1 when D P L is greater than 0. The membership function is expressed as follows: where:
Z P is the shape parameter, and P S t is the sum of all generated powers at time interval t .

The overall violation of the power balance constraint is determined as VIOL P  X  P T i  X  1  X  1 m ~ P 3.3.2. Membership function for the water balance at each time interval constraint
The water balance at each time interval constraint requires that the water volume, V , in each reservoir j must be within the reservoir limits at each time interval t . Because the probability that these values will differ from each other, the difference in percent, D V V , is calculated. A membership function m ~ on Fig. 3 is used. The membership value of 1 is assigned when
Eq. (9) is satisfied and value smaller than 1 in any other case. The membership function is expressed as follows: ~
V where: D V 0 1
L 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 D V  X  is the shape parameter.

The overall violation of the water balance at each time interval constraint is determined as VIOL V  X  P J j  X  1 P T t  X  1  X  1 3.3.3. Membership function for the water balance at the end of the time period constraint
The water balance at the end of the time period constraint requires that the volume of water, V 9 T , at each reservoir j at the end of the time period ( t  X  T ) is equal to the predetermined water volume, V end , for the reservoir. Because the probability that these values will differ from each other, the difference in percent, D V is calculated. A membership function m ~ W (similar in shape to the one shown on Fig. 2 ) is used. The membership value of 1 is assigned when D V W  X  0 and smaller than 1 when D V W is greater than 0. The membership function is expressed as follows: where: D V W is the shape parameter.

The overall violation of the water balance at the end of the time period constraint is determined as VIOL W  X  P J j  X  1 3.3.4. Membership function of water availability constraint
The water availability constraint requires that the spent water volume from each hydro unit, j , at the end of the time period ( t  X  T ) is equal to the predetermined water volume, W H the reservoir. This means that all available water for each hydro unit is spent. Because the probability that these values will differ from each other, the difference in percent, D W H , is calculated. A membership function m ~ R (similar in shape to the one shown on Fig. 2 ) is used. The membership value of 1 is assigned when D W H  X  0 and smaller than 1 when D W H is greater than 0. The membership function is expressed as follows: where: WH is the shape parameter.

The overall violation of the water balance at the end of the time period constraint is determined as VIOL WH  X  P J j  X  1 3.3.5. Membership function for the ramping response rate constraint
The ramping response rate constraint requires that the change of the generated power of each thermal unit i during each time interval t is within the predetermined limits for the unit. Because the probability that these values will differ from each other, the difference in percent, D R , is calculated. A membership func-tion m ~ R (similar in shape to the one shown on Fig. 3 ) is used. The membership value of 1 is assigned when Eq. (15) is satisfied and value smaller than 1 in any other case. The membership function is expressed as follows:  X  where:
D R  X 
D R  X   X  is the shape parameter.

The overall violation of the ramping response rate constraint is determined as VIOL R  X  P I i  X  1 P T t  X  1  X  1 m ~ R
As can be observed from Fig. 2 , the shape parameter defines the curve shape. Decrease of the shape parameter results with smoother shape of the curve. During the tests obtained regard-ing the efficiency of the proposed penalization method, it was observed that small values for the shape parameters characterize with faster and smoother convergence. Therefore, it is recom-mended that the shape parameters for all membership functions are kept low (e.g. Z s  X  0.001). It was also observed that the additional decrease of the shape parameter will just make the convergence process slower.

As it can be seen from above, two general shapes of member-ship functions are used, the one from Fig. 2 applies to all equality constraint, while the one from Fig. 3 applies to all inequality constraints. The set of constraints that defines the penalty term depends on the hydraulic model of the power system and the requirements regarding thermal units. Therefore, different set of membership function was used for each of the test systems analyzed in the paper. 3.4. Genetic algorithm application
The GA is an evolutionary searching technique based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. The GA is an attractive alternative to other optimization approaches because of its robustness. The GA is searching for better solutions by letting the fitter individuals to take over the population using a combi-nation of stochastic process ( Chaturvedi et al., 2009 ; Michalewicz, 1996 ). Like any other optimization algorithm it begins by defining the optimization variables, the cost function, and the cost, and ends by testing for convergence. In between, however, this algorithm is quite different, i.e. it uses specific GA operators.
The main GA operators are initial population, selection, crossover and mutation. 3.4.1. Initial population
The GA begins with an initial population of N p chromosomes being defined. All variables from each chromosome in the initial population are randomly determined using a uniform probability distribution, covering the entire search space uniformly. The initial population is expressed as follows: POP  X  X  C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , ... , C k , ... , C N p  X  38  X 
Each chromosome C k from the initial population is repre-sented by a matrix of ( I  X  J ) T random values ( Ruey-Hsun and Jian-Hao, 2007 ) as follows: C k  X  units; the number of columns, T , is equal to the number of time intervals. 3.4.2. Selection
C k . In order to select chromosomes as future parents the tourna-ment selection procedure was used. The idea behind the tourna-ment selection is simple. Two or more chromosomes are randomly selected, after which their fitness is compared and then the chromosome with the best fitness is chosen and placed in the mating pool. The procedure continues until the mating pool is filled.
The number of individuals chosen for the tournaments is known as tournament size. High tournament size results with high selection pressure, because wicker individuals have smaller chances to win a tournament. A study made by Goldberg and Deb (1991) showed that the tournament selection operator has better or equivalent convergence and computational time complexity properties when compared to any other selection operator proposed in the literature. 3.4.3. Crossover
The crossover operator is used for the creation of one or more offspring from the parents selected during the selection process.
Some variables are chosen from each parent and then swapped with each other ( Kanc  X  ev et al., 2011 ). The most common form of crossover involves one point, two points and uniform crossover and multi-point crossover. Within this paper a multi-point cross-over was used. This type of crossover allows the user to choose the number of variables per chromosome that will be exchanged. The problem with standard crossover methods when used in real
GA is that no new information is introduced i.e. each variable that was randomly initiated in the initial population is propagated to the next generation, only in different combinations. These approaches totally rely on mutation to introduce new genetic material ( Haupt and Haupt, 2004 ). To avoid this problem a blending of the swapped variables was applied, which is com-monly known as blend crossover (BLX-a ) proposed by Eshelman and Schaffer (1993) . It has been reported that BLX-0.5 ( a  X  0.5) performs better than BLX operators which are using any other a value ( Deb, 2001 ). 3.4.4. Mutation
Most of the optimized functions often have many local minima and the GA can be caught in one of them. To avoid this problem the
GA is forced to explore other areas of the cost surface by introdu-cing changes, or mutations, for some of the variables ( Michalewicz, 1996 ). The number of performed mutation is determined by choice and is often not more than a couple of percent of the number of variables in the population ( Volkanovski et al., 2008 ). The muta-tion procedure used in this study is described in the following two steps:
Step 1 : Each chromosome is processed separately, and the number of mutations per chromosome is determined as follows:
N m , c  X  m r  X  I  X  J  X  T  X  40  X  where m r is the mutation rate and ( I  X  J ) T is number of variables per chromosome. Subsequently, random numbers are chosen to select the rows and columns of the variables to be mutated.
Step 2 (non-uniform mutation ( Michalewicz, 1996 )): The new value  X  v new i  X  of the variable v i , after mutation is performed during the i th generation, is calculated as: v  X  f  X  v  X  X  and where b m is a positive constant chosen arbitrarily and t is number randomly generated with equal probability to be zero or one. In this study b m was set to 2.
 The function D ( gen , y ) returns a value in the range [0, y ].
Therefore the operator gives a value v i A  X  v min i , v max probability of returning a value close to v i increases as the algo-rithm is advancing. This encourages uniform search in the initial stages when the number of generations ( gen ) is small and local search in later stages. 3.4.5. Replacement An elitist type of replacement strategy is used in this paper.
The strategy is based on a comparison among the offspring and their parent chromosomes. Each pair of parent chromosomes is responsible for creation of two offspring chromosomes when the crossover and the mutation operator are applied. The parents and the offspring chromosomes are placed in a subgroup containing four chromosomes. Thereafter, a comparison is made among the chromosomes in the subgroup. Only the best two survive while the other two are deleted. The procedure is continuing until all subgroups are processed. The chromosomes that survive are representing the population of the new generation. These chro-mosomes will later enter the tournaments to compete for place in the mating pool.

The purpose of the described GA is to solve Eq. (25), which comprises the improvements on the weighted sum method described above.

 systems, test system-I ( Basu, 2008 ), test system-II ( Basu, 2005 ), and test system-III ( Basu, 2010 ). Each of these power systems has different properties, which makes them interesting for analysis. 4.1. Test system-I power system, comprising ten thermal generating units and no hydro generating units. This relieves the algorithm from the hydraulic constraints. The only external constraints left are the power balance constraint and ramping response rate constraint for which membership functions described with Eqs. (26) and (35) were used, respectively. The power system losses were considered using the Beta matrix given in ( Basu, 2008 ). The scheduling time period is 24 h equally divided on 24 intervals each lasting one hour with constant load demands within that hour.
 sion for test system-I obtained from the combined economic-environmental dispatch using the proposed method. This solution is known as best compromise solution, obtained when w  X  0.5.
A comparison was made among the best compromise solution obtained from the proposed method and the solutions obtained by the real-coded GA (RCGA) and non-dominate sorting GA-II (NSGA-II) algorithms applied in ( Basu, 2008 ). The results of this comparison are shown in Table 3 . It can be easily concluded that the proposed method has resulted with better best compromise solution for both cost and emission.

Fig. 4 illustrates the Pareto front for a set of 21 optimal solutions obtained with the proposed algorithm for test system-I. This set of solutions was calculated by multiple runs of the algorithm, increasing w from 0 to 1 with step of 0.05. For a comparison, the
Pareto fronts obtained by RCGA and NSGA-II in ( Basu, 2008 )are also shown in Fig. 4 . It is evident that the proposed algorithm obtained better solutions compared to the solutions obtained by RCGA and NSGA-II for test system-I.

In order to inspect the quality of the obtained solutions we investigated the variations of the objective function values for ten independent runs of the algorithm for test system-I. The weight-ing factor, w , was set to 0.5. The cost and the emission were calculated for each of the obtained best compromise solutions and illustrated in Fig. 5 . The results show small range of variations for the cost and emission objectives. 4.2. Test system-II
This power system, presented in ( Basu, 2005 ), is a hydrother-mal power system, comprising two hydro generating units and four thermal generating units. Both hydro units are independent from each other. The generated power from these units is limited with the predetermined volume of water. Therefore, hydraulic
Model 1 described above was used. The power balance constraint and the water availability constraint were considered as external constraints, for which membership functions described with
Eqs. (26) and (33), respectively, were used. The power system losses were considered using Beta matrix given in ( Basu, 2005 ). In the original input data the ramping response rate limits were not considered. The scheduling time period is 32 h equally divided on four subintervals each lasting eight hours with constant load demands within that subinterval.

Table 4 shows the hourly generation schedule, cost and emis-sion for test system-II obtained from the combined economic-environmental dispatch using the proposed method. This is the best compromise solution obtained for w  X  0.5. A comparison was made between the best compromise solution obtained from the proposed method and the solutions obtained by the simulated annealing-based goal-attainment (SABGA) method used in ( Basu, 2005 ) and the improved genetic algorithm (IGA) with multiplier updating (MU) method used in ( Chao-Lung, 2007 ). This compar-ison is shown in Table 5 . It can be easily concluded that the proposed method resulted with better best compromise solution for both, cost and emission.
 Emission (lb)
Fig. 6 illustrates the Pareto front for a set of 21 opti-mal solutions obtained with the proposed algorithm for test system-II. This set of solutions was calculated by multiple runs of the algorithm, increasing w from 0 to 1 with step of 0.05. For comparison the Pareto fronts obtained by IGAMU ( Chao-Lung, 2007 ) is also shown in Fig. 6 . It is evident that proposed algorithm obtained better solutions than the solutions obtained by IGAMU for test system-II.

In order to inspect the quality of the obtained solutions we investigated the variations of the objective function values for ten independent runs of the algorithm for test system-II. The weight-ing factor, w , was set to 0.5. The cost and the emission were calculated for each of the obtained best compromise solutions and illustrated in Fig. 7 . The results show small range of variations for the cost and emission objectives. 4.3. Test system-III
The power system presented in ( Basu, 2010 ) is a hydrothermal power system, comprising three thermal generating units and a cascade system of four hydro generating units. Hydraulic Model 2 has been used to describe the cascade of upstream reservoirs in this system. In this analysis, except power balance constraint also the water balance at each time interval constraint and the water balance at the end of the time period constraint were considered as external constraints. Therefore, the membersh ip functions, described with Eqs. (26), (28), (31), were used. The ramping response rate of the thermal units and the power losses were not considered in the original description of the system ( Basu, 2010 ). The scheduling time period is 24 h equally divided on 24 intervals each lasting one hour with constant load demands within the corresponding hour.

Table 6 shows the hourly generation schedule, cost and emission for test system-III obtained from the combined eco-nomic-environmental dispatch using the proposed method. The solution represents the best compromise solution obtained for w  X  0.5. Table 7 shows the water discharges from each reservoir at each hour, for the solution shown in Table 6 . A comparison was made among the obtained best compromise solution from the proposed method and the algorithms used in ( Basu, 2010 ). This comparison is shown in Table 8 . It can be seen that a relatively large difference exists among the obtained results. Especially, the difference is significant when comparing the obtained costs. from all reservoirs at each time. The calculation shows that all water spends by the hydro units obtained by proposed method are equal to 1166.79 ( 10 4 m 3 )comparedto1,158.04( 10 4 m 3 ) obtained by NSGA-II presented in ( Basu, 2010 ). However, the generated energy by the hydro units obtained by the proposed method is equal to 10,263.50 (MWh) compared to 9,613.56 (MWh) obtained by NSGA-II. If we take a look to the graphical representation of the water discharges obtained with NSGA-II it can be observed that the water is randomly discharged. These findings lead us to the conclusion that the water discharge from the reservoirs it is not optimized by the NSGA-II. Therefore, it can be concluded that this is a solutions that belongs to a local minimum. For additional verification, a simple sensitivity analysis which was performed, showed that if the number of generations is decreased significantly, the obtained results are very similar to the one presented in ( Basu, 2010 ). Similar findings can be observed for the multi-objective differential evolution (MODE).

Fig. 8 illustrates the Pareto front for a set of 41 optimal solutions obtained with the proposed algorithm. This set of solutions was calculated by multiple runs of the algorithm, increasing w from 0 to 1 with step of 0.025. For comparison the Pareto fronts obtained by NSGA-II and MODE in ( Basu, 2010 ) are shown also in Fig. 8 .Itis evident that proposed algorithm obtained better solutions than the solutions obtained by NSGA-II and MODE for test system-III.
In order to inspect the quality of the obtained solutions we investigated the variations of the objective function values for ten independent runs of the algorithm for test system-III. The weight-ing factor, w , was set to 0.5. The cost and the emission were calculated for each of the obtained best compromise solutions and illustrated in Fig. 9 . The best, average and worst obtained costs were 8.4404E  X  04, 8.4483E  X  04 and 8.4535E  X  04 ($) respectively while the best, average and worst obtained emissions were Emission (ton) 14.6012, 14.6443 and 14.6932 (ton) respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 9 , the generated solutions from each trial show small range of variations for the cost and emission objectives.

Fig. 10 illustrates the values of the objective functions, cost and emission, for the best solution through the generations. It is apparent that the values of both objective functions are migrating towards artificial local optima during the first 600 generations. This is expected, since the applied pressure from the penalty function is very low in the first generations. When the penalty term grows the values of the objective functions grow as well, resulting with solutions associated with less constraint violations. This is the case until some point, after which the objective func-tions converge towards global optimal values while completely dealing with the constraint violations. 5. Conclusion
In this paper a multi-objective optimization based solution for the combined economic-environmental power dispatch problem was presented and examined. The multi-objective optimization problem was transformed in to single objective using the weighted sum method. In order to mitigate severe distortion of the objective functions caused by the penalty term, a new, modified dynamic normalization has been proposed. A penalty method which exploits membership functions has been presented in order to calculate the penalty term. Classical genetic algorithm has been used as an optimization tool.

The proposed method was applied on different representative thermal and hydrothermal power systems, frequently used in the literature on the subject as benchmark case studies. The obtained results have been compared with results gained from different methods for multi-objective optimization. In all comparison cases the results obtained with the proposed method have achieved better solutions. It is easy to conclude that the presented results highlight the merit of the proposed approach. Hence, an effective method is provided to solve the combined economic-environ-mental dispatch problem and it can be extended for applications in large-scale hydrothermal power systems, with no limit to the number of constraints. Since GA has strong parallelization cap-abilities, the presented method can be applied on a real-scale power system, using cluster computer. This application could result with real-time solutions for the combined economic-environmental dispatch.
