 Distinguishing between high-and low-quality documents is an important skill for humans, and a challenging task for machines. The majority of previous research on the subject has focused on low-level measures of quality, such as spelling, vocabulary and grammar. However, in many real-world situations, it is necessary to employ deeper criteria, which look at the content of the document and the structure of argumentation. One example where such criteria are essential is decision-making in the intelligence commu-nity. This is also a domain where computational methods can play an important role. In a typi-cal situation, an intelligence officer faced with an important decision receives reports from a team of analysts on a specific topic of interest. Each decision may involve several areas of interest, resulting in several collections of reports. Addi-tionally, the officer may be engaged in many de-cision processes within a small window of time. Given the nature of the task, it is vital that the limited time be used effectively, i.e., that the highest-quality information be handled first. Our project aims to provide a system that will assist intelligence officers in the decision making process by quickly and accurately ranking re-ports according to the most important criteria for the task.

In this paper, as a first step in the project, we focus on content-related criteria. In particu-lar, we chose to start with the aspect of  X  X over-age X . Coverage is perhaps the most important element in a time-sensitive scenario, where an intelligence officer may need to choose among several reports while ensuring no relevant and important topics are overlooked. Much of the work on automatic assessment of document quality has focused on student essays (e.g., Larkey 1998; Shermis and Burstein 2002; Burstein et al. 2004), for the purpose of grad-ing or assisting the writers (e.g., ESL students). This research looks primarily at issues of gram-mar, lexical selection, etc. For the purpose of judging the quality of intelligence reports, these aspects are relatively peripheral, and relevant mostly through their effect on the overall read-ability of the document. The criteria judged most important for determining the quality of an intelligence report (see Sec. 2.1) are more complex and deal with a deeper level of repre-sentation.

In this work, we chose to start with crite-ria related to content choice. For this task, we propose that the most closely related prior research is that on automatic summarization, specifically multi-document extractive summa-rization. Extractive summarization works along the following lines (Goldstein et al., 2000): (1) analyze the input document(s) for important themes; (2) select the best sentences to include in the summary, taking into account the sum-marization aspects (coverage, relevance, redun-dancy) and generation aspects (grammaticality, sentence flow, etc.). Since we are interested in content choice, we focus on the summarization aspects, starting with coverage. Effective ways of representing content and ensuring coverage are the subject of ongoing research in the field (e.g., Gillick et al. 2009, Haghighi and Vander-wende 2009). In our work, we draw on ele-ments from this research. However, they must be adapted to our task of quality assessment and must take into account the specific characteris-tics of our domain of intelligence reports. More detail is provided in Sec. 3.1. 2.1 The ARDA Challenge Workshop Given the nature of our domain, real-world data and gold standard evaluations are difficult to ob-tain. We were fortunate to gain access to the reports and evaluations from the ARDA work-shop (Morse et al., 2004), which was conducted by NIST in 2004. The workshop was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing the effec-tiveness of information retrieval systems. Dur-ing the workshop, seven intelligence analysts were each asked to use one of several IR sys-tems to obtain information about eight different scenarios and write a report about each. This resulted in 56 individual reports.

The same seven analysts were then asked to judge each of the 56 reports (including their own) on several criteria on a scale of 0 (worst) to 5 (best). These criteria, listed in Table 1, were chosen by the researchers as desirable in a  X  X igh-quality X  intelligence report. From an NLP perspective they can be divided into three broad categories: content selection, structure, and readability. The written reports, along with their associated human quality judgments, form the dataset used in our experiments. As men-tioned, this work focuses on coverage. When as-sessing coverage, it is only meaningful to com-pare reports on the same scenario. Therefore, we regard our dataset as 8 collections (Scenario A to Scenario H), each containing 7 reports. 3.1 Methodology In the ARDA workshop, the analysts were tasked to extract and present the information which was relevant to the query subject. This can be viewed as a summarization task. In fact, a high quality report shares many of the charac-teristics of a good document summary. In par-ticular, it seeks to cover as much of the impor-tant information as possible, while avoiding re-dundancy and irrelevant information.

When seeking to assess these qualities, we can treat the analysts X  reports as output from (human) summarization systems, and employ methods from automatic summarization to eval-uate how well they did.

One challenge to our analysis is that we do not have access to the information sources used by the analysts. This limitation is inherent to the domain, and will necessarily impact the as-sessment of coverage, since we have no means of determining whether an analyst has included all the relevant information to which she, in partic-ular, had access. We can only assess coverage with respect to what was included in the other analysts X  reports. For our task, however, this is sufficient, since our purpose is to identify, for the person who must choose among them, the report which is most comprehensive in its cover-age, or indicate a subset of reports which cover all topics discussed in the collection as a whole 1 .
As a first step in modeling relevant concepts we employ a word-gram representation, and use frequency as a measure of relevance. Exam-ination of high-quality human summaries has shown that frequency is an important factor (Nenkova et al., 2006), and word-gram repre-sentations are employed in many summariza-tion systems (e.g., Radev et al. 2004, Gillick and Favre 2009). Following Gillick and Favre (2009), we use a bigram representation of concepts 2 . For each document collection D , we calculate the av-erage prevalence of every bigram concept in the collection: Where r labels a report in the collection, and Count r ( c ) is the number of times the concept c appears in report r .

This scoring function gives higher weight to concepts which many reports mentioned many times. These are, presumably, the terms consid-ered important to the subject of interest. We ignore concepts (bigrams) composed entirely of stop words. To model the coverage of a report, we calculate a weighted sum of the concepts it mentions (multiple mentions do not increase this score), using the prevalence score as the weight, as shown in Equation 2.

CoverScore ( r  X  D ) = X Here, Concepts ( r ) is the set of concepts ap-pearing at least once in report r . The system produces a ranking of the reports in order of their coverage score (where highest is considered best). 3.2 Evaluation As a gold standard, we use the average of the scores given to each report by the human judges 3 . Since we are interested in ranking re-ports by coverage, we convert the scores from the original numerical scale to a ranked list. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms (and of the individual judges) using Kendall X  X  Tau to measure concordance with the gold stan-dard. Kendall X  X  Tau coefficient (  X  k ) is com-monly used (e.g., Jijkoun and Hofmann 2009) to compare rankings, and looks at the number of pairs of ranked items that agree or disagree with the ordering in the gold standard. Let T = { ( a i ,a j ) : a i  X  g a j } denote the set of pairs ordered in the gold standard ( a i precedes a j ). Let R = { ( a l ,a m ) : a l  X  r a m } denote the set of pairs ordered by a ranking algorithm. C = T  X  R is the set of concordant pairs, i.e., pairs ordered the same way in the gold standard and in the ranking, and D = T  X  R is the set of discordant pairs. Kendall X  X  rank correlation coefficient  X  k is defined as follows:
The value of  X  k ranges from -1 (reversed rank-ing) to 1 (perfect agreement), with 0 being equivalent to a random ranking (50% agree-ment). As a simple baseline system, we rank the reports according to their length in words, which asserts that a longer document has  X  X ore cov-erage X . For comparison, we also examine agree-ment between individual human judges and the gold standard. In each scenario, we calculate the average agreement (Tau value) between an individual judge and the gold standard, and also look at the highest and lowest Tau value from among the individual judges. 3.3 Results Figure 1 presents the results of our ranking ex-periments on each of the eight scenarios.
 Human Performance There is a relatively wide range of performance among the human judges. This is indicative of the cognitive com-plexity of the notion of coverage. We can see that some human judges are better than oth-ers at assessing this quality (as represented by the gold standard). It is interesting to note that there was not a single individual judge who was worst or best across all cases. A system that out-performs some individual human judge on this task can be considered successful, and one that surpasses the average individual agreement even more so.
 Baseline The experiments bear out the intu-ition that led to our choice of baseline. The num-ber of words in a document is significantly corre-lated with its gold-standard coverage rank. This simple baseline is surprisingly effective, outper-forming the worst human judge in seven out of eight scenarios, and doing better than the aver-age individual in two of them.
 System Performance Our concept-based ranking system exhibits very strong perfor-mance 4 . It is as good or better than the baseline in all scenarios. It outperforms the worst individual human judge in seven of the eight cases, and does better than the average individual agreement in four. This is in spite of the fact that the system had no access to the sources of information available to the writers (and judges) of the reports.

When calculating the overall agreement with the gold-standard over all the scenarios, our concept-based system came in second, outper-forming all but one of the human judges. The word-count baseline was in the last place, close behind a human judge. A unigram-based sys-tem (which was our first attempt at modeling concepts) tied for third place with two human judges. 3.4 Discussion and Future Work We have presented a system for assessing the relative quality of intelligence reports with re-gard to their coverage. Our method makes use of ideas from the summarization literature de-signed to capture the notion of content units and relevance. Our system is as accurate as individ-ual human judges for this concept.

The bigram representation we employ is only a rough approximation of actual concepts or themes. We are in the process of obtaining more documents in the domain, which will allow the use of more complex models and more sophis-ticated representations. In particular, we are considering clusters of terms and probabilistic topic models such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003). However, the limitations of our domain, primar-ily the small amount of relatively short docu-ments, may restrict their applicability, and ad-vocate instead the use of semantic knowledge and resources.

This work represents a first step in the com-plex task of assessing the quality of intelligence reports. In this paper we focused on coverage -perhaps the most important aspect in determin-ing which single report to read among several. There are many other important factors in as-sessing quality, as described in Section 2.1. We will address these in future stages of the quality assessment project.
