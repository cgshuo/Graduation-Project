 This report is a summary of the workshop on Data Mining Standards, Services and Platfo rms, which was held at the KDD 2005 in Chicago on August 21, 2005. The workshop included several presentations on the appli cation of data mining standards in various systems and platform s, as well as presentations on recent changes to the PMML standard, an opening panel discussion and a concluding round-table forum.
 KDD 2005, DM-SSP, Workshop, PMML, JSR-73, OLE DB for Data Mining, XML for Analysis The fifth workshop on Data Mini ng Standards, Services and Platforms was held as part of KDD 2005, the eleventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. Since the first KDD conference, the use of data mining techniques has grown signifi cantly, driven by applications in many fields, from astronom y and medical diagnostics to internet and business applicati ons. Along with increased usage has come a need for standards that allow data mining models to be stored, shared and implemented in a consistent way. This workshop started as a forum for promulgating the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) da ta mining standard and over the years has helped to drive acceptance of this standard by the data mining community [1]. More recently, it has also been a forum for other data mining standa rds, including Java and service oriented approaches. This 2005 wo rkshop was attended, as usual, by key software vendors in the industry. But it also saw the best representation of non-vendor organizations looking to apply these standards to their enterprises. The on-line proceedings can be found at: The workshop opened with a panel discussion on the future of data mining standards, services and platforms. Moderated by Dave Selinger from OverStock.co m, the panel consisted of several authors who submitted papers for this year X  X  workshop along with workshop chair Kurt Thearling from Capital One. It was clear from this discussion that acceptance of data mining standards is evident, from numerous vendors who support the PMML standard and use it to st ore models and exchange them with other applications. As a re sult, more customers of these products are taking advantage of these standard approaches by making them part of their opera tional processes. For example, Capital One is making PMML support a key vendor selection criterion as it allows this financia l services company the ability to store and share models within thei r environment, and the ability to explain their internal processe s to government regulators. One consensus was that the standards th at allow data mining models to be instantiated in a consistent manner would allow greater use of data mining techniques and applications. Representatives from several vendors presented talks on how they and their customers are using data mining standards. I work for MicroStrategy, a business intelligence company that helps organizations turn their data into actionable knowledge for improve their performance and profitability. We have adopted the PMML standard so that data mining models from other vendors can be used to provide predic tive forecasts in additional the historical perspective usually provided by BI applications. While organizations have usually scored records  X  X ff-line X  in a batch processing approach, today there are more options available including scoring in the databa se and scoring the business intelligence  X  X uery-and-reporting X  application. These new approaches take advantage of st andards so the scoring can be done in real-time  X  X n the fly X  and without requiring data mining knowledge or tools to use and apply data mining models. ZhaoHui Tang from Microsoft presented the new data mining features that will become availa ble when Microsoft X  X  SQL Server 2005 database is released later th is year. This product will include nearly a dozen data mining algorithms and proprietary OLE DB for Data Mining extensions to SQ L that allow data mining models to be created and applied. Mi crosoft also supports the XML for Analysis standard and, by using this service oriented standard, SQL Server 2005 data mining features can be accessed by XML for Analysis consumers. Two vendors presented talks on de ploying and managing models after they X  X e been created. Tom Khabaza discussed the  X  X redictive Enterprise, X  wher e organizations make use of predictive analytics whenever they can be used in decision making situations. These models therefore represent a valuable asset to an organization, one that needs to be managed and protected like any other asset. SPSS provides a Predictive Enterprise Repository for just this purpose. This product includes version control, scheduling and auditing of predictive models. Wayne Thompson and David Du ling from SAS discussed how their product can help integr ate the model development environment with the production infrastructure of an organization. SAS supports a number of ways to represent the various aspects of the data mining development e nvironment in formats that are interoperable with production sy stems. While it often takes literally months to successful deploy some models from development to production, SAS s upports the generation of code, in the form of C, Java, PMML a nd SQL, that can greatly improve an organizations ability to leverage predictive analytics. Not surprisingly, several talks focused on the use and future direction of PMML. Stefan Raspl showed how IBM uses PMML to store models and also visua lize these models in a number of ways. From neural networks to decision trees, these visualization techniques allow for better understa nding of the model behavior. IBM includes additional data that , while not required for scoring the model, allows for better unde rstanding of the data used to create the model, including histogr ams, charts and graphs of predictive variables. Since PMML 3.0 was announced at KDD 2004 and released two months later, the Data Mini ng Group industry consortium that controls the standard has been working on the next release, PMML 3.1. Svetlana Levita n from SPSS discussed the recent changes in PMML, includi ng improvements in missing confidence and missing value handling for Tree models, and various improvements to cluster models, transformations, data dictionary and the mining schema. Bob Grossman presented a new propos al that is being considered for PMML 3.1. This new model ty pe is an event based approach for change detection applications . The need for this model has been driven by business that need to detect changes in dozens, hundreds and even thoughts of differe nt variables, whether they be continuous or discrete in nature. The workshop concluded with a round table discussion on the future of PMML. This discussi on covered a wide variety of topics, including:  X  The need for PMML to be responsive to the needs of  X  The need for a PMML Reference Test or Stability Kit that  X  Include supplement info that would be useful for tracking  X  Exception handling for calculation errors (like divide by  X  Support for transformations that are beyond PMML X  X  
By far, the most resounding co mment was for  X  X MML to get serious! X  Producers need ways to verify their PMML models conform to the standard, and consumers need the confidence to know that models deployed to one environment generate the same results as in the model creation environment. As PMML becomes richer in its support of predictive analytics and the data mining process, organizations need the confidence that interoperability between vendors is reliable and trustworthy. [1] R.
