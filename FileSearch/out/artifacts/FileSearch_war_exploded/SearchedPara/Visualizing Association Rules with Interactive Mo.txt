 Asso ciation rules are amongst the most imp ortant patterns that can b e discovered using data mining. Their automatic discovery is supp orted by most, if not all, data mining soft-ware to ols. Moreo ver, many techniques have b een devised to lter the most interesting (in many senses) rules from the complete set of discovered rules, such that the users are not swamp ed by results.
 However, asso ciation rules are actually hard to understand; even more so if one only lo oks at the most interesting rules. For example, rather strong correlations b etween attributes are not always obvious from the discovered rules. Similarl y, a deep er explanation of related asso ciation rules ma ybe missing from the rule set.
 In this pap er we sho who w Mosaic plots and, esp ecially, their variant called Double Decker plots, can b e used to visualize asso ciation rules. These plots visualize the contingency table that yields the asso ciation rule as well as the other p otential rules in that table, whether they meet the thresholds or not. This gives a deep er understanding on the nature of the correlation b etween the left-hand side of the rule and the right-hand side.
 Moreo ver, we sho whowanin teractive use of these plots helps the user to understand the relationshi p b etween re-lated asso ciation rules.

 I.3.6 [ Computer Graphics ]: Metho dology and Techniques; I.3.8 [ Computer Graphics ]: Applications Asso ciation Rules, (multi-dimensi ona l) Contingency Tables, Mosaic Plots, Multiv ariate Categorical Data, Visualization Asso ciation rules are a prime example of patterns discovered with data mining. Since their intro duction in [1] much re-search has b een published that covers almost all asp ects of asso ciation rules and their (e X cient) discovery. Moreo ver, the frequent set approac hto wards asso ciation rule discov-ery has proven its worth in the many related typ es of pat-terns that have b een studied in the literature. Perhaps even more imp ortant, asso ciation rule discovery algorithms can b e found in most, if not all, data mining to ols and there are pap ers proving their use in practical application s such as cross-selling [4].
 Despite these successes, there are also some problems with asso ciation rule mining. The rst is that one often gets far more results than can b e handled comfortably b yh umans. This is a well-known problem and has received ample at-tention in the literature. For example, in [2] a scheme is prop osed that allows the users to quickly discover the most interesting rules for a wide variet yofin terestingness' mea-sures. In [3] a technique for pruning and summarizing rules is intro duced to present the most interesting results to the user.
 The second problem, which is orthogonal to the rst, is that asso ciation rules are actually hard to understand! The rea-son is that a single asso ciation rule describ es only one cell in a (multivariate) contingency table. The other cells in this contingency table give infomation necessary for a thorough understanding of that rule. It is exactly for this reason that 2 testing is used in [3] and supp orted in [2] as a wa yto lter for the most useful rules. To illustrate this, we use a slightly extended example from [3]. The data is given in Table 1.
 With a, reasonable, supp ort lev el of 25%, the rule permission and/or a fee.
 KDD 2000, Boston, MA USA  X  ACM 2000 1 -58113 -233 -6/00/0 8 ...$5.00 do es sho w up, while do es not. Whereas this second rule w ould suggest the corre-lation b et w een jobs and lo ans that a 2 test of indep endence indicates. This, of course, happ ens b ecause of the xing of a supp ort v alue. Almost an yv alue for the supp ort (lik e 25% in the example) is sensible and can b e explained from some meta information, but xing it op ens the w a y to problems as the one describ ed ab o v e.
 A related conceptual problem o ccurs if t w o rules ha v e the same consequence. That is, w e disco v er t w o rules of the form X 1 ! Y and X 2 ! Y . A t this stage w e are un-able to decide, whether w eha v e found t w o di eren t groups, whic h b oth imply Y , or whether w e deal with more or less the same group of p eople. This problem will not necessar-ily b e solv ed b y regarding further asso ciation rules, since it is p ossible that b oth rules describ e for a large part the same p opulation while that do es not b ecome apparen t from additional asso ciation rules b ecause of to o little supp ort. Consider e.g. the rules Job = yes ! L o an = appr ove d and Own-house = yes ! L o an = appr ove d whic h sho wupifthe supp ort lev el is at 25%. Ho w ev er, the "explanatory" rule Own-house = yes &amp; Job = yes ! L o an = appr ove d do esn't. Clearly , suc h problems b ecome w orse if a large subset of the disco v ered rule-set is suppressed for a rst viewing b y the user. That do es not mean that ltering for in teresting rules is a bad idea, or that a data mining system should presen t all rules, includin g rules that don't mak e the thresholds but could help the user to understand other rules. Rather, it means that a data mining system should lter for the most inter esting rules and give the user to ols to understand these rules.
 In this pap er, w e fo cus on to ols to understand asso ciation rules. More particularly ,w e presen t inter active Mosaic plots asaw a y to visualize asso ciation rules. Mosaic plots, in tro-duced in [5] are a graphical analogue of con tingency tables. View ed statically , these plots allo w the user to see the so-lutions to the problems sk etc hed ab o v e. The in teractiv e asp ect allo ws the user to see the relationships in rulesets lik e f X ! Y; X ^ Z ! Y g for instance. The adv an tage of in teractiv e Mosaic plots [6] o v er con tingency tables is t w ofold. Firstly , Mosaic plots are more easily comprehen-sible than their underlying con tingency table, esp ecially if the attributes ha v e more than t w o categories. Secondly ,be-cause the in teractiv e dimension is far more in tuitiv e for Mo-saic plots than for con tingency tables.
 W e are not the rst to visualize asso ciation rules. Ho w ev er, our goal is di eren t from other approac hes. F or example, b oth SGI's MineSet and SAS's En terpriseMiner allo w the user to visualize the complete rule set as a matrix and indi-cate the con dence and/or supp ort suc h that the user ma y pic k out in teresting ones visually . In [2] is indicated ho w the in teresting rules can b e visualized within the space of all as-so ciation rules with a v ariet y of notions of in terestingness. Our go al in visualizing asso ciation rules is to help the user to understand the underlying structur e of asso ciation rules by visualizing the c ontingenc y tables that give rise to the rules. The remainder of this pap er is organized as follo ws. Sec-tion 2 de nes the imp ortan t concepts, viz asso ciation rules, con tingency tables, and Mosaic plots. In Sections 3 to 6 it is sho wn ho w the Mosaic plots help in understanding asso-ciation rules. Single rules are considered in Section 3, the in terestingness of a rule in Section 4, t w o rules that share their righ t-hand side in Section 5, and sequen tial structures in Section 6. Our conclusions are form ulated in the nal section. In this pap er w e assume that our database consists of one ta-ble r , with sc hema R = f A 1 ; ::: ;A p g in whic h eac h A 1 ;::: ;p is a categorical attribute. That is, eac h attribute A j has a domain D j with just a few v alues.
 Asso ciation rules in r are expressions of the form: in whic h X and Y are selections with disjoin t attribute sets and s and c denote the supp ort (also called the c over ) and the c on denc e of the rule. That is, b oth X and Y are con-junctions of attribute-v alue pairs, X = f A x A A i; j , A x T o de ne the parameters s and c , denote b y ( X ) the sub-set of r that satis es the selection condition X , i.e., ( X )=
X ( r ). The supp ort of X , denoted b y s ( X ) is then the rel-ativ e size of ( X ), i.e., s ( X )= j ( X ) j = j r j . Then, for the general rule giv en ab o v e, w eha v e: 1. s ( X ^ Y )= s and 2. s ( X ^ Y ) =s ( X )= c .
 In other w ords, if X o ccurs in a tuple, with probabili t y c , Y also o ccurs in that tuple, and X and Y co-o ccur in a fraction s of the en tire database. The asso ciation rule mining problem is to nd all asso cia-tion rules whose con dence and supp ort exceed some user-sp eci ed minimal thresholds for con dence ( minconf ) and supp ort ( minsup ). Algorithms for this problem ha v e b een describ ed at n umerous places and do not concern us in this pap er. W e use the notation X ! Y to indicate a rule with con dence c and supp ort s that exceed the minimal thresh-olds minconf and minsup .
 Note, except where stated di eren tly , the righ t-hand-side Y of our asso ciation rule will consist of one attribute-v alue pair only . The reason for this is rstly that this is ho w asso ciation rules are often used, the user w an ts to nd out ho w the other attributes relate to some tar get attribute. Secondly , b ecause it simpli es our discussion.
 A con tingency table o v er r is basically a table of c ounts ,in whic h eac h coun t denotes ho w often a giv en com bination of attribute v alues o ccurs in r . The simplest case is a t w o-w a y table, in whic ht w o attributes are set against eac h other as in table 2: Job = y es 200 100 Job=no 80 120 T able 2: Con tingency table for Loan Data with t w o attributes.
 The con tingency table has a cell for eac h com bination of attribute v alues of the participating attributes. Moreo v er, as stated ab o v e, the con ten t of that cell is the coun tofho w often that com bination o ccurs in r . In other w ords, if w e use v A useful asp ect of this expression is that the v -v alues can b e seen as the "logical addresses" of the cells, whereas j ( v ) j is the con ten t of the cell with address v . The actual la y out of the table is a completely di eren t matter, one that do esn't concern us in this pap er.
 Mosaic plots [5] w ere in tro duced as a graphical analogon of m ultiv ariate con tingency tables. As the name suggest, eac h cell of a table is visualized b y a tile (or bin) in the plot. By default the tile's size is directly prop ortional to the n um ber of cases in the cell. Large tiles therefore represen t cells with (relativ ely) high coun ts.
 In other w ords, the tiles in a Mosaic plot con v ey the same information as the cells in a con tingency table. The di er-ence is that Mosaic plots represen t the (relativ e) coun tb y the area of the tile, rather than b yan um berascon tingency tables do. As an aside, note that in Manet (the visualizati on to ol w e use in [9], [7]) these n um b ers are readily a v ailable . The relation with con tingency plots immediately giv es: for the set of tiles in the Mosaic plot. Clearly , this is un-dersp eci ed as there is only one constrain t on the heigh t (denoted b y t:h ) and the width (denoted b y t:w ) of eac h tile t (with "address" t:v ). Moreo v er, with suc h a sp eci cation the tiles can b e all o v er the place. These p oin ts are resolv ed b y the construction algorithm for Mosaic plots, whic h is in-formally as follo ws.
 Mosaic plots are constructed hierarc hicall y , including the attributes one at a time in the user-sp eci ed order; sa y ,b y the list [ A m plot, whic h consists of one tile (the complete windo w) that represen ts the complete database; M 0 = f ( ; h; w ) g in whic h h and w are the heigh t and the width of the windo w and denotes the empt y tuple, i.e., ( )= r .
 Assume that w eha v e constructed the plot for the rst i attributes, i.e., [ A m f ( v ; h; w ) j v 2 D m A i +1 , eac h tile t 2 M i is split in subtiles, one for eac hv alue val 2 D i +1 , denote b y v val the tuple ( v m and let val denote the tuple ( val ). Then eac h tile t 2 M is split in to a set of subtiles, with addresses f t:v val j val 2 D Moreo v er, the sizes of the sub-tiles should b e prop ortional to the n um b er of cases that fall in that sp eci c in tersection of attribute v alues. The easiest w a ytoac hiev e this is b y splitting the width or the heigh t of the paren t tile t . This observ ation giv es us t w o p ossibili ties. Either w e al-ternate b et w een heigh t-splitti ng and width-splitti ng, or w e alw a ys split the width (or the heigh t). The rst option giv es Mosaic plots, while the second option giv es Double De cker plots. F or the momen t, w e concen trate on Mosaic plots. W e use a b o olean v ariable d (for direction). If it is true, w e split the width, otherwise w e split the heigh t. That is, for t 2 M and val 2 D i +1 the subtile is giv en b y: With this pro cedure understo o d, the pro cedure to include A Where the call Repla ce ( M i ;t; Subtiles ) replaces the tile t in M i b y the tiles in Subtiles in the plot.
 Since, as w e men tioned, splitting alternates b et w een width and heigh t splitting, the sp eci cation is nished b y: Mosaic ( M; [ H j T ] ;d )= Mosaic ( Mosaic ( M; H; d ) ; [ T ] ; : d ) The resulting mosaic plot giv es a graphical estimation of the join t distribution of its attributes, see gure 1. Note that mosaic plots are not limited to binary attributes only . High-Figure 1: Examples for a two dimensional (left) and a thr e e dimensional (right) Mosaicplot of the L o an Data given in tables 1 and 2. ligh ting as sho wn in gure 2 can b e used to link data from di eren t views. F or example, if an extra attribute is sho wn in a barc hart next to the mosaic plot w e can select one of its v alues, and automatically highligh t parts of the tiles in the mosaic plot. These highligh ted parts are dra wn as if a further attribute is added to the displa y and can therefore extend from left to righ t in a tile or from b ottom to top. Highligh ti ng is esp ecially imp ortan t for the visualizati on of asso ciation rules. One w a y to visualize an asso ciation rule X ! Y is to com-bine all attributes in v olv ed in the left-hand-side selection X as explanatory variables and to dra w them within one mo-saicplot and to visualize the r esp onse Y b y highlightin g the corresp onding categories in a barc hart.
 More formally , consider the asso ciation rule X ! Y with X = f A x v g . This asso ciation rule tells us something ab out the cells ( v x tiv e) coun ts in the appropriate con tingency tables. T o visualize this rule, w e rst construct the Mosaic plot Mosaic ( M; [ A x 1 ;:: : ;A x k ] ;true ) and then w e highligh t A v y within that plot.
 The rule itself is visualized b y one single cell, i.e., the high-ligh ted part of tile ( v x actually sho ws us more: 1. it sho ws us all selections ~ X based on the attributes 2. it sho ws us all selections ~ X based on the attributes 3. nally ,b y high-ligh tin g di eren t resp onse v alues A Figure 2: Two-dimensional Mosaicplot of attributes A attribute, A y . The c ate gory A y = y 2 has b e en sele cte d; highlighting shows up in the mosaic as a thir d dimen-sion.
 T o see ho w these asp ects help us to understand our asso-ciation rule b etter, consider gure 2. It sho ws an o v erview of all p ossible asso ciation rules in v olving three attributes A x 11 ^ A x 2 = x 22 ) giv es an example for a rule with v ery high con dence (the highlightin g almost lls this bin en tirely), the supp ort, ho w ev er, is relativ ely small (the bin itself, and therefore the amoun t of highligh ti ng, is not v ery large). The rst bin in the b ottom ro w, ( A x resen ts the rule with the highest supp ort (this bin con tains the largest amoun t of highlighting ), y et the con dence of the corresp onding rule is rather lo w (highligh tin g lls this bin to only one fth, appro ximately).
 In order to b e able to compare the prop ortions of highlight-ing heigh ts more easily ,w e will use Double Dec k er plots from no w on. Recall from the previous section, these are the plots in whic hw e only split the width of a tile. High-ligh ting, ho w ev er, still splits the bins v ertically .Th us the conditional probabili ties P ( A y = v y j A x are represen ted b y the prop ortion of highlighting heigh ts in eac h tile of the mosaic plot for attributes A x The exact com bination a bin represen ts can b e read from Figure 3: (L ab el le d) Double De cker Plot of the mosaic in g. 2. the lab els b elo w (see gure 3). Eac hro w corresp onds to one attribute, eac h gra y shade represen ts one v alue of this at-tribute. In binary data the white rectangles stand for \0"s, the blac ks for \1"s. The rst bin in g. 3 therefore is the com bination of X 1 = x 11 and X 2 = x 21 . The second bin con tains all transactions, where X 1 = x 11 and at the same time X 2 = x 22 , and so on.
 In the follo wing w ew an t to giv e sev eral examples from one data set, the SAS Asso c Data, an example data set from the SAS En terprise Miner. Here, 1001 transactions ha v e b een recorded consisting of sev en items eac h (out of a total of 20 items). This is a rather tin y dataset to apply asso ciation rules. Ho w ev er, the results sho ws sev eral prop erties, whic h are c haracteristic for results from rule mining.
 Example SAS Asso c Data Using a standar d metho d for nding asso ciation rules, the fol lowing two rules ar ep art of the r esult set T o understand the quality of these rules, we c onstruct the Double De cker plots of b oth rules. These ar e shown in g-ur es4an5.
 The rst rule, heineken &amp; c oke &amp; chicken ! sar dines, pr oves to b e a very str ong rule -no other c ombination of the at-tributes involve d shows a similar c on denc e. Viewing a plot like g. 4 we c an b e sur e, that ther e is \something" in it.
Figur e 5 on the other hand exp oses the se c ond rule to b e Figure 4: Example of a \go o d" asso ciation rule: the bin heineken &amp; c oke &amp; chicken is l le d almost entir ely with highlighting, while none of the other bins is l le d to mor e than a thir d. r ather we ak. F our c ombinations of the attributes show sim-ilar c on denc e s, one is even higher. In fact, the plot shows that c orne db e ef has a distinct ne gative e e ct on the sales of heineken. This me ans, that this rule is not able to c atch the message of the data. The Double-De cke r plot shows that other rules in the r esult set ar ene c essary, if not mor e im-p ortant, to understand the sales of heineken. Mor e over, we c an simply se e these rules without r eferring b ack to the r esult set. With a minimum c on denc e of slightly less than 70% we se e the fol lowing four rules in g. 5: not c orne db e ef &amp; not avo c ado &amp; not artichoke ! heineken not c orne db e ef &amp; not avo c ado &amp; artichoke ! heineken not c orne db e ef &amp; avo c ado &amp; artichoke ! heineken Just lik e asso ciation rules, Mosaic plots (or Double Dec k er plots) are not restricted to binary data. They w ork just as Figure 5: Example of a \b ad" asso ciation rule. F our c ombinations of c orne db e ef, artichoke and avo c ado show high pr op ortions of highlighting. One of them is even a b etter rule (b oth in c on denc e and supp ort) than avo c ado&amp;c orne db e ef &amp; artichoke ! heineken. w ell with other kinds of categorical attributes. Similarl y , visualizi ng asso ciation rules is not restricted to rules with a single attribute-v alue pair as righ t-hand side.
 Consider the general rule, X ! Y , with X = f A x v v the righ t-hand side, i.e., Mosaic ( W ; [ A x appropriate cell in the righ t-hand side plot, i.e., the cell ( v p ortions in the left-hand side plot. The problems with the rule avo c ado &amp; c orne db e ef &amp; ar-tichoke ! heineken in our previous example signi es that this rule is not v ery in teresting. As stated b efore, there are n umerous tec hniques to lter for in teresting results in one sense or another. It is not our in ten tion to add to this b o dy of literature, but to sho w that one can often simply see the in terestingness of a rule in its plot.
 One suc hin terestingness measure is based on the d ifferences o f c on dences do c for the rule X ! Y and : X ! Y : The pro duct doc ( X ! Y ) doc ( Y ! X ) is appro ximately 2 -distributed and coincides with the statistic prop osed in [8]. The do c measure can b e seen directly in a Double-Dec k er plot, as the follo wing sk etc h sho ws: Example SAS Asso c Data Figur e 6 shows an example of the fol lowing six asso ciation rules: heineken ! c orne db e ef 0.12 0.21 -0.45 cr acker ! heineken 0.37 0.75 +0.34 The rst two rules show r ather str ong docs -yet, the dif-fer enc es ar e in the \wr ong" dir e ction, i.e. the c on denc eof : X ! Y is a lot higher than X ! Y . The two midd le rules almost do not show any doc at al l. This indic ates r ather we ak rules. The last two rules have again str ong docs , now in the \right" dir e ction. T ode cide on the quality of these two rules we c an c onc entr ate on supp ort and c on denc e. Another measure of in terestingness of a rule is b y using a 2 test for the con tingency table of X and Y . If this test sho ws that X and Y are probably not indep enden t, the rule is deemed in teresting. In the In tro duction, w e men tioned that the 2 test indicates that the attributes job and l oan in our example are correlated. A simple insp ection of the Mosaic plot suggests that indeed something is going on see gure 1. If w eha v et w o asso ciation rules that share the same righ t-hand side, sa y X 1 ! Y and X 2 ! Y ,itisv ery w ell p ossible that b oth rules describ e for a large part the same p opulation. This has already b een illustrated in the in tro duction. Note that this can only happ en if X 1 and X 2 do not select for di eren tv alues for the same attribute.
 In this section, w e sho who w Mosaic plots can b e used to disco v er suc h underlying structure. This is done, b y con-structing three plots, one for eac hof X 1 ! Y and X 2 ! Y and one for their "in tersection", i.e., X 1 ^ X 2 ! Y . Example SAS Asso c Data Consider the fol lowing two rules: Figur e 7 shows in the upp er r ow the two Double-De cker plots of these rules and in the b ottom r ow their interse ction. What is imme diately cle ar fr om this last plot -esp e cial ly fr om its lab elb ar -is that a very lar ge pr op ortion of the so da-buyers ar e also cr acker-buyers. In fact, by insp e cting Figure 7: Interse ction of two 2-item asso ciation rules. the numb ers, one se es that 91% of the p e ople that b ought so da also b ought cr ackers. In other wor ds, a brief insp e c-tion shows that these two rules ar e far fr om indep ende nt. Whether this me ans that only the rule crac k er ! heinek en should b e use d, or the p air f crac k er ! heinek en , so da ! heinek en g or even the triple of rules f crac k er ! heinek en , so da ! heinek en , crac k er &amp; so da ! heinek en g (wher e the last one, visibly, has a very high c on denc e) dep ends on the sp e ci c applic atio n. It should b e cle ar, however, that know l-e dge of this de ep er structur eis ne c essary for such a de cision. A nother example is given by the two rules: Figur e 8 shows Double De cker plots of these rules as wel l as of their interse ction. Her e, it is imme diately cle ar that p art of the p opulation that buys steak, corned b eef, a v o cado, and p epp er is very smal l inde e d (0.5%). This me ans, that we have found two di er ent gr oups of apple buyers -those, who buy apples, after they have b ought ste ak and c orne db e ef, and those, who buy apples to gether with avo c ado and p epp ers. A sp ecial case of in tersecting rules, are rules of the follo wing form: Figure 8: Interse ction of two 3-item asso ciation rules.
 The supp ort is reduced with eac h item w e add to the left-hand side of rules. What do w e gain from that? Our in terest is t w ofold: And, ab o v e all, w ew an ttokno w and understand the under-lying structure b et w een the attributes.
 Since w e are dealing with a sp ecial case of in tersecting rules, w e can use a similar tec hnique to visually explore them. F or this, w e can order the left-hand side items according to their app earance in the sequence and start with a Double Dec k er plot regarding only X 1 ! Y (see gure 9, left most plot). After that, w e add the second item, X 2 , to the displa y and lo ok at the e ect. In the displa y , the e ect of adding X all other com binations has b een gra y ed out, so that w ema y fo cus on the \in teresting" part of the plot. The tile of X split in t w o, namely X 1 ^ X 2 and X 1 ^: X 2 . The supp ort of the resulting rule X 1 ^ X 2 ! Y is still relativ ely high and, as w e had hop ed, the split giv es us more con dence. Splitting a second time in to the com binations X 1 ^ X 2 X 3 and X 1 ^ X 2 ^: X 3 giv es a di eren t result (cf. g. 9, righ tmost plot). Here, the supp ort shrinks drastically and at the same time ev en the con dence is lo w ered.
 As y ou migh t guess, Double-Dec k ers of sequences pro vide us with a lot more information. F or this let us ha v e a lo ok on a more complex example.
 Example SAS Asso cs Data L et us c onsider the rules fr om table 3. Figur e 10 shows a Figure 10: Summary of al l the right hand sides of the rules liste dab ove. summary of al l the left hand sides. Insp e cting them mor e closely r aises sever al questions: F or answers to these questions -and to a lot mor e, we did not even think of asking -have a lo ok at gur e 11. Her e, al l Double De cker plots c orr esp ondin g to the rules of the table ar e shown.
 Plots numb er 2 and 4 show similar b ehaviour: rules wher e b oth items have b e en b ought to gether show the highest c on -denc e, while al l other rules show r elatively low c on denc es. Plot numb er 3 lo oks mor e suspiciou s: her e, two c ombina-tions have high c on denc e s (ab ove 60%): olives &amp; heineken ! b ourb on 65.52 13.29 not olives &amp; not heineken ! b ourb on 60.90 13.09 A ny left hand side, which includes the same items, wil l show the same b ehaviour. This b e c omes very obvious in plot no. 6. This plot has exactly two c ombinations with very high c on-denc e( 80 %). Plot no. 5 shows two gr oups of c ombina-tions with r el. high c on denc es . The imp ortant fe atur e her e itself is very smal l. That me ans, that we, again, de al with two disjoint gr oups of b ourb on buyers: the b ourb on &amp; olives &amp;c oke buyers and the b ourb on &amp; olives &amp; heineken buy-ers. Asso ciation rules are not alw a ys simple to understand. On the one hand b ecause result sets are often large. On the other hand b ecause the rule itself requires explanation . F or the former problem, man y tec hniques ha v e b een prop osed that lter the (in some, w ell-de ned sense) most in teresting rules from the rule set. The latter problem has receiv ed far less atten tion.
 In this pap er w eha v e illustrated ho w Mosaic plots and, esp e-cially , their v arian t called Double Dec k er plots can b e used to visualize asso ciation rules. These plots visualize the con tin-gency tables that are resp onsible for the rules. By pro viding the con text of the rule in suc h a plot, the user can b etter assess its qualit y .
 Moreo v er, w eha v e sho wn ho w the Mosaic plots can b e used to understand the relationship b et w een asso ciation rules. In particular, w eha v e sho wn examples for rule sets with a com-mon righ t-hand side.
