 In 2012, Sogou, a major Chinese web search engine released a large-scale query log containing 43.5M user interactions, includ-ing submitted queries and clicked web page search results. This query log offers a deep sample of queries over a two day period from 30th December 2011 to 1st January 2012. In August 2013, we identified 1.4M predominantly Chinese language unique search result URLs that were clicked at least three times in this query log. We crawled the HTML content of these URLs to construct the sup-plementary SOGOU-2012-CRAWL dataset, which we release in this work. A real large-scale query log with accompanying crawl such as this offers several opportunities for reproducible informa-tion retrieval (IR) research, including query classification, intent modelling and indexing strategy. In this paper we first detail the query log and crawl dataset construction and characteristics. Fol-lowing this, to demonstrate potential applications we use the crawl to indicatively analyse various time-based patterns in web content and search behaviour. In particular, we study the distribution of language-independent date expressions in the crawled web con-tent. Based on this, we propose a simple approach for modelling the past/present/future temporal intent of queries based on the date the query was submitted by the user, and the dates appearing in the clicked search results. We observe several prominent temporal patterns which may lead to novel time-aware IR approaches.
A great deal of research in information retrieval (IR) is based on analysing the past behaviour of real IR system users. Such user interaction is captured in a query log which comprises a rich time-stamped record of past user actions such as query input, re-sult clicks and result page navigation. From the lowest-level in-teractions, higher-level task-oriented aspects such as information seeking sessions, topic focus, intent and implicit relevance can be observed, studied and modelled.

Unfortunately, despite their research value, few query logs are available for researchers outside industrial labs due to privacy con-cerns and commercial sensitivity. Indeed, the most recent large-scale English-language query logs are AOL [9] and MSN 2006 [3]. More recent query logs are available for learning to rank tasks -however their queries and result domains/URLs have been mapped to arbitrary tokens to ensure privacy, thereby making content-based analysis impossible.

In recent years, Sogou 1 , a major Chinese portal and web search engine, has made several large-scale Chinese web search engine query logs openly available for research. While this means that some analysis inevitably requires Chinese language skills, many findings are likely to be generalisable to IR systems in other lan-guages since they are based on language-independent behavioural, temporal and textual statistical distributions.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no sufficiently large nor recent query log with accompanying result crawl openly available. A query log without result crawl impedes deeper content analy-sis of search results for tasks such as query classification, intent modelling and indexing strategies. Hence, in this work we present a supplementary result crawl dataset to augment the Sogou 2012 query log with the full HTML content of clicked result URLs  X  thereby offering many opportunities for novel research.

The Sogou 2012 query log contains 43.5M low-level interactions (e.g., queries submitted, results clicked with their ranking, and re-sult page inspection depth) from 0:05am 30th December 2011 to 4:58pm 1st January 2012. Accordingly, the query log offers con-siderable depth into search activity over a relatively short period, as opposed to a small sample of search activity over a longer pe-riod as is more common in previous datasets. The query log only contains search results clicked -so analysis of non-clicked results cannot be performed. The dataset we prepared and present in this paper, named SOGOU-2012-CRAWL, is a crawl of 1.4M search results clicked in this Sogou query log. We detail the construction and release of this dataset in Section 2.
 To indicatively demonstrate the potential of SOGOU-2012-CRAWL for IR research, we study some of its language-independent content and query-biased temporal dimensions. In par-ticular, we consider the following questions: (i) to what extent do web pages contain dates? (ii) how are the dates distributed in those web pages? (iii) can the temporal intent of a query (or similarly, its topic ) be determined based on the dates contained in clicked, and therefore assumed implicitly relevant web pages? In this section we detail the construction of the SOGOU-2012-CRAWL dataset. We have made this supplementary crawl dataset available to download as a 15Gb archive of HTML page snap-http://www.sogou.com shots 2 . The Sogou 2012 query log itself must be downloaded di-rectly from the Sogou labs website 3 .

Because of the long-tail popularity distribution of result clicks, there is a very large number of results clicked only once or twice in the query log. From a practical perspective, since our crawler was based geographically in Europe we found that network speed, reli-ability and time outs to servers located inside China posed several crawling technical difficulties. To alleviate these issues by reducing the number of web pages we needed to download, we only crawled search result URLs that were clicked three or more times by users (for any given search query). Accordingly, we identified 1.41M unique search results for crawling.

In August 2013, we successfully crawled 1.22M of the URLs (87% success rate) to form the SOGOU-2012-CRAWL dataset. Al-though not always the case, we have to assume the URLs have not changed since the the result click as the vast majority of the doc-uments are not in the Internet Archive 4 for the result click date. This assumption will undoubtedly be invalid for news sites which change daily  X  so temporally sensitive analysis (such as that we perform in the following sections) must be conducted with care.
Several data cleaning stages were employed to prepare the final crawl dataset for release. Many result URLs were unable to be crawled because the server was uncontactable (e.g., server offline), an error page was returned (e.g., 401, 404, 500 HTTP errors), or had a robots.txt entry that excluded crawling. In these cases, the result URL still appear in the crawl dataset but with content of  X  X no-tavailable] X  to signify a crawling issue.

Several character set encodings are commonly used in China  X  in particular UTF8, GBK and GB2312. In many cases, the character set reported by HTTP headers or HTML head tags, and the actual content encoding were mismatched. We used various techniques to detect this, and encode the final crawl dataset consistently in UTF8. To demonstrate the potential value of the SOGOU-2012-CRAWL dataset, we perform preliminary analysis of its temporal characteristics. First we extract and analyse the dates present in re-sult pages in the crawl as a whole  X  that is, without considering the related query times. More interestingly, in Section 4 we consider the temporal information provided by the crawl and the query log together. With that in mind, we further study how the dates present in clicked result URLs correspond with the real-time of the search queries, in order to model query-biased temporal search intents.
In this section, we present existing work related to temporal anal-ysis of information seeking and web content in IR. When a query is posed to a system provides an implicit temporal clue, since it of-fers a signal of the user X  X  current interest in a particular query topic. Likewise, temporal clues such as dates and times contained in rele-vant content also provide an anchor in time for that relevance. Past work has mostly examined these elements independently.

The popularity of many queries is subject to periodic tempo-ral trends [1], as well as event-driven temporal activity arising from one-off events. Explicit temporal expressions are included in up to 1.5-2% of web queries [8], such as  X  world cup 2012  X  and  X  nyc weekend events  X . [10] consider these temporal expres-sions in a relevance model. Further, [7] do the same for query top-http://www.stewh.com/sogou-2012-crawl http://www.sogou.com/labs -note that this site is available in En-glish and Chinese language versions. http://www.archive.org Figure 1: Frequency distribution (from 2000-01-01 to 2013-12-31) of dates contained in 1.22M search result pages crawled from Sogou 2012 result click URLs. Plotted with a log 10 y-axis frequency scale. ics which implicitly express a temporal expression (e.g.,  X  brazil world cup  X ). [2] integrate temporal expressions in documents into a time-aware probabilistic retrieval model. [6] identify and classify temporal information needs based on the relevant document timestamp distribution to improve retrieval. [5] studied how 150M web pages changed over 11 weeks. They found longer documents tended to have more frequent and exten-sive changes made to them, and for web pages that change regu-larly, they do so consistently over time. Acknowledging web page content is often dynamic, [4] incorporate content dynamics into a relevance model to improve navigational query effectiveness.
For temporal analysis, we must first extract temporal expres-sions (in this case, date expressions) appearing in the crawled re-sult pages. Dates can be expressed in many cultural short-and long-forms. In written Chinese language, dates are typically in big-Endian Chinese year/month/day date formats, e.g. YYYY-MM-DD , YYYY.MM.DD and YYYY  X  MM  X  DD  X  .

From the complete crawl dataset, we extracted 5.41M dates be-tween 2000-01-01 to 2014-12-31, inclusive, from a total of 313,211 web pages. All temporal analysis presented in this paper is based on these extracted dates  X  and in the next section, the queries that were used to find the pages containing those dates. For the pur-pose of this work, we relied on simple temporal expression extrac-tion based on regular expressions. Future work will employ full multi-lingual and diverse temporal expression tagging, such as that provided by HeidelTime [11], to improve coverage and accuracy.
Overall, 25.7% of the crawled result web pages contain at least one date, with an average of 17.27 (  X  59.7) and median of 5 dates per page. Note the wide dispersion in the number of dates in each web page  X  the majority of documents contain a few dates, while a smaller amount have a very large number of dates. Web pages with a single date are likely to be timestamped content, such as a news article or blog post. Likewise, documents with several dates may be continually revised information, such as blog posts with comments, or similarly threaded discussion boards.

The frequency distribution of all the extracted dates over time is presented in Figure 1. Evident is the rising frequency of dates up to the end of 2011  X  the period of time covered by the query log. Fol-lowing this, the frequency of dates declines quickly, although some of this volume may be attributed to the delayed crawling. Occa-sional spikes likely represent major upcoming predictable events being discussed (e.g., major sporting events, public holidays etc.).
In the next step of temporal analysis we characterise the distri-bution of dates occurring in each individual web page in the crawl. To that end, in this section we propose a classifier for 4 common document date distribution classes we have observed: Single , In Window , Episodic or Random . Each of these classes is conceptu-ally defined as follows: Single -web page contains a single date expression.
 In Window -web page contains multiple date references, with &gt; 80% of dates occurring within an n day period ( n = 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 , 28 days). An 80% (rather than 100%) threshold permits more robust tolerance to outlying dates (for instance, a  X  today  X  date on a page containing mainly past timestamped discussion).
 Episodic -web page has significant trends in date distribution, with 1 or more defined bursts.
 Random -web page contains multiple dates, but with no immedi-ate apparent temporal pattern.
We use a classifier to label each web page containing dates with one of the above temporal classes. To that end, we first define ts the time series of dates present in the document d in the our crawl. ts d is modelled as vector of length 5,475 (i.e., for the 365 days  X  15 years, between 2000-01-01 and 2014-12-31). Consequently, the i th index of the ts d vector refers to number of dates in the document on the day 2000-01-01, plus i days.

We use a decision tree (shown in Figure 2) incorporating various heuristics to determine the class of each page, based entirely on fea-tures extracted from ts d . Auto-correlation is the cross-correlation of the signal with a lagged version of itself (1 day in this case). It is effective for measuring temporal uniformity, and co-ordinated bursts of dates [6]. Single and In Window (1 day window) classes are in essence the same, except that the In Window class applies to pages which have multiple instances of the same date.
In Table 1, we present the results of classifying 313,211 web pages containing at least one date. Almost 16% of these pages have a discernible pattern comprising multiple dates contained within them. Single and In Window classes account for almost all doc-uments, with results presented in Table 2 showing a windows of 1-3 days are most common for those pages. As such, we find that for the almost 50% of search result web pages containing non-randomly distributed dates, the majority contain either a sin-gle date, or several dates contained in a short period of days. Table 1: Date distribution classification results for the 313,211 search result pages containing dates.
 Table 2: Classification window sizes for the 47,831 search result pages containing multiple dates in a window of 28 or less days.
In many cases, users search for topics or similiarly, events, an-chored in the past, present or future with respect to the present time [6, 7]. We seek to identify these intents by examining the dates present in the search results of clicked (and therefore, assumed rel-evant) search results. Rather than classifying the distribution of dates present in a single document, in this section we study the dis-tribution of dates contained in the assumed relevant documents for a topic (that is, clicked search results)  X  with respect to the real-time of the query (which we refer to as q  X  ).

The Sogou 2012 query log contains 42.17M search result clicks in total. 3.11M (7.4%) of these are for documents which were clas-sified as Single/In Window/Episodic in the previous section (i.e., have a non-random date distribution) 5 .

Considering each query q and the day it was used as unique (i.e., q will be counted twice if it appears on two separate days), there are 10.1M queries in the dataset. 1.1M queries (10.9%) have one or more clicked search result which contains at least one date.
We define the query-biased temporal intent (or, q intent ,  X  of the average difference (  X  , in days) between q  X  and dates appear-ing in clicked documents (weighted by their click proportion).
This means q intent ,  X  may be negative (i.e., an intent in the past ), positive (i.e., an intent in the future ), or zero (i.e., an intent now/today ). Note that q intent ,  X  may also be undefined in the case that there are no dates present in any of its clicked documents. q intent ,  X  is formalised as follows. For each query q i time q t (we specify time by day, e.g., 2011-12-30), we compute q Where D q is the set of all document results d i (including dupli-cates) clicked for q i , i.e., D q = { d 1 , d 2 ... d i } . dates ( d of dates  X  i (including duplicates) present in d i , i.e., dates ( d {  X  1 ,  X  2 ...  X  i } . Finally,  X  ( x , y ) is the total days between two dates.
In Figure 3, we show the q intent ,  X  distribution of 1.1M queries with clicked search results which contain dates in Sogou 2012. A distinctive distribution of past, present and future query-biased tem-poral intents is evident. Most notably, there is a search tendency centred around  X  today  X  dates (that is, the time of the query inter-action, i.e., 30th December 2011 to 1st January 2012), with very recent past and upcoming future dates also common. The steady decline in queries with far mid-to long-term past and future in-tents is also apparent. There are notably more search intents for past topics, with the majority of intents going back the past 1,000 days. In comparison, the majority of future intents goes forward 500 days. Outliers are likely notable past/future events, for exam-ple the 2012 London Olympics. These event topics attract lots of different queries and have many dates mentioned in search results referring to published event schedules.
In this paper we present a major new dataset  X  a supplementary crawl of the web search results clicked in the open, large-scale and predominantly Chinese language Sogou 2012 query log. We name this dataset SOGOU-2012-CRAWL, and release it to the research community for future work.

While there are several query logs openly available for repro-ducible research, to the best of our knowledge, there is no recent large-scale query log accompanied by the content of clicked search results. As a result, this dataset opens up several new opportunities for information retrieval research challenges such as query classifi-cation, intent modelling and indexing strategy.

To characterise the crawl, and demonstrate its value for language-independent IR research, we indicatively analysed vari-ous time-based patterns in web content and search behaviour. We first studied the distribution of language-independent date expres-sions in the crawled web content. Further, we propose a simple approach for modelling the past/present/future temporal intent of queries based on the date the query was submitted by the user, and the dates appearing in the clicked search result pages. Based on this model we observe several notable query-biased temporal in-tent patterns. In particular, we note that users X  temporal interests are mainly concentrated on information related to now . However, we find there are a large number of interests which extend into the future, and likewise, up to 1,000 days into the past (shown in Fig-ure 3). This asymmetric double long-tail distribution may offer opportunities for detecting and supporting time-aware information needs, so we leave further analysis and modelling to future work.
