 1. Introduction
The operation of power networks has undergone considerable change in recent times. Several factors have influenced this change. For example, the interest in saving energy, the use of cheaper and more universal measuring devices, the growing demand from consumers for improved quality of the power supply, or even the appearance of new tools for monitoring power networks. New technologies are constantly appearing in all fields of science and engineering, including electrical engineering and power systems. Specifically, there are many elements in power distribution networks that could be automated and coordinated, such as tap changers in power transformers or tap changers in bank capacitors. The present paper deals with new computational optimization algorithms which allow a better operation of the system, achieving a better voltage profile and reduced power losses. The general problem of voltage control and optimization of power flow occurs because of the need to act on the voltage at the network nodes to ensure that it remains within acceptable limits. One of the main elements allowing this adjustment is the under load tap changer (ULTC), which can adjust the voltage ratio in discrete steps. Taking into account the combinatorial nature of this problem, different methodologies based on artificial intelli-gence have been applied. Some authors have proposed the use of techniques such as dynamic programming ( Lu and Hsu, 1995) to control tap changers and capacitor banks in substations for 24-hour-planning. This aims to improve the efficiency of the algorithm by limiting the search space in the vicinity of an analytical solution calculated using the hourly load forecasting. This technique has even been extended to small networks with radial capacitor banks at the heads of the lines ( Ruey-Hsun and Chen-Kuo, 2001 ). Fuzzy logic techniques have also been used ( Liu et al., 2002 ). Other authors have used neural network techniques for voltage and power regulation in radially operated networks during one-day periods, making use of the tap changers of transformers and capacitor banks ( Saric et al., 1997). Other techniques such as genetic algorithms ( Haida and Akimoto, 1991) have also been implemented for voltage optimization. On the other hand, the typical problem of voltage and reactive power compensation (known as the Volt/Var problem) has been widely studied in power networks ( Begovic et al., 2004 ).
 Moreover, the variation of voltage at the system nodes due to
ULTCs could involve a change in the power flow through the system lines, which must be minimized in order to avoid the power losses that occur due to the Joule effect. In this way, optimal operation of ULTCs allows voltage and power flow to be under control. Thus, this problem can be treated from a multi-objective perspective ( Augugliaro et al., 2004 ). The traditional way of dealing with multi-objective optimization problems consists of introducing weights in a simple aggregating function (weighted sum), where weights reflect the relative significance of the different objectives. However, the main drawback of this linear combination is the difficulty to establish accurate values for the weights, especially when the objectives to be considered have different scales or represent different magnitudes. An interesting, and possibly the best way of overcoming this drawback is the use of Pareto optimization ( Deb, 2001 ), which is a method that includes multiple criteria without using weights. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the control of an automated power distribution network under normal operation using Pareto-optimization, where the objectives to minimize are: a voltage deviation index that gives information about the voltage profile in the network ( Montoya et al., 2006 ), and the power loss of electrical lines due to the Joule effect. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Voltage regulation in electrical power networks
Currently, voltage regulation in traditional power substations for HV/MV (high/medium voltage) or MV/MV transformers is performed by under load tap changers (ULTC), whose input variables are essentially the voltage and current values measured at the outlet of the secondary circuit of the transformer, while regulation in the MV/LV (medium/low voltage) is carried out manually using vacuum tap changers. In an automated network, this process can be approached from a different, more holistic perspective that takes into account other elements in the network. A typical power network consists of:
N power substations with HV/MV transformers of a nominal power S Ni ;
N ULTCs for N transformers in the substations. In our test cases, 21 positions ( 10% to +10% with a step size of 1%) have been used; N LV nodes with MV/LV transformers to service the LV network; N L power lines connecting different nodes; N C capacitor banks, synchronous compensators, etc.
 For a given load scheme in the system, the objectives to minimize are:
Voltage deviation index, which indicates the deviation of the nodal voltages from their nominal value; power losses in the network.
 While the reduction of power losses is clearly a goal in terms of cost savings, the optimization of voltages, and more specifically their adjustment to a flat profile, have not received sufficient consideration from either system operators or national legislation. For instance, the Spanish Royal Decree on the Regulation of the
Distribution and Transmission of Electricity ( R.D. 1955/2000 ) only stipulates that the maximum variation in voltage supplied to end consumers must be within 7 7% of the supply voltage declared.
The cost associated with the quality of service (operation of electrical and electronic systems, product quality, disturbances in the system, etc.) has not been clearly and appropriately estimated to date. It is also important to remark that the two objectives are contradictory, i.e. lower voltage deviation implies higher losses in the network and vice versa. This is dealt with in greater detail below. 2.2. Problem formulation
As commented above, the main problem is to find the optimum of two objectives subject to certain constraints (max-imum deviation of 7 7% with respect to the nominal voltage at system nodes). The first objective is modelled using the voltage deviation index (VDI), which determines the difference between the voltage in nodes with respect to the nominal voltage. The following equation describes how VDI is calculated: VDI  X  where VDI is the voltage deviation index, V i is the voltage at node i , V
Ni is the nominal voltage at node i ; and N T is the number of network nodes. From the power systems perspective, unit quantities are used, i.e. V Ni =1 and V i will always be close to one.
The second objective to minimize is the power loss ( P loss ) in the power system, which is associated with the well-known Joule effect in power lines and power transformers. Both lines and transformers have an inherent resistive component, which causes warming when current flows through them. In this work a simplistic assumption is used, which obviates the power losses associated with insulators of the different equipment (lines, capacitors, etc.). These losses are much lower than those produced by the Joule effect and can therefore be neglected. Under these assumptions, the power loss of the system is displayed as
P  X  where P loss is the power loss in watts, R i is the resistance in ohms of element i (either line or transformer), and I is the current in amperes.

Bearing in mind that the optimization process consists of the simultaneous minimization of the voltage deviation index ( VDI ) and power losses, multi-objective optimization techniques should be applied. In this case, the solutions are evaluated according to
Pareto-dominance relationships, where the result of the algorithm is not a single solution, but rather several non-dominated solutions as an approximation to the (unknown) Pareto-optimal front ( Goldberg, 1989 ; Deb, 2001). Thus, solution s is said to dominate another solution s 0 when it is better in at least one objective, and not worse in the others (i.e. s has a lower value of
VDI/P loss than s 0 and its value of P loss /VDI is not higher than that of s 0 ). Two solutions are called indifferent if neither one dominates the other (i.e. s has a lower value of VDI/P loss but higher P loss /VDI than s 0 ). It should be pointed out that when engineering tasks involve multiple criteria of similar importance, there may be solutions that are equivalent (indifferent) considering all criteria, in which case the set of non-dominated solutions will contain many indifferent solutions. Thus, this strategy gives a diversity of solutions to be chosen by a high-level decision-maker, who will undertake the appropriate actions depending on the circum-stances of the moment and/or future interests. The constraints of the problem are the statutory limits on voltage ( 7 7% of the nominal voltage), and the operational limits of network elements (maximum and minimum power, maximum and minimum limits of taps in ULTCs, etc.). In this problem, the control variables are the positions of the tap changers in a HV/MV meshed network, which are modelled using integer variables. This method of coding variables allows an unequivocal correspondence with the real taps, thus avoiding obtaining unfeasible solutions and therefore limiting the search space. This point is important because as the network size grows, the search space becomes extremely large, but using this strategy the search is narrowed with respect to other coding methods (binary, real, etc.). 2.3. Multi-objective meta-heuristics implemented to solve the problem
Although the main research interest in this field has been the development of population-based multi-objective algorithms, non-population-based methods have also been successfully applied. A well-known multi-objective meta-heuristic is the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES) ( Knowles and Corne, 1999), which uses a single solution during the optimization process and is therefore often known as (1+1)-PAES. Perhaps the main visible difference with respect to genetic algorithms lies in the fact that PAES is not a population-based technique, i.e. it uses a single individual which evolves iteration after iteration. The basic method chosen to solve this multi-objective problem is PAES, which has the following characteristics:
It uses a single solution during the search process which evolves according to a mutation operator.
 It uses the Pareto-dominance concept in the selection process.
It uses a grid-based technique to store the non-dominated solutions (ND) found during the search.
 It works with a small number of parameters.

The computational requirements are lower than population-based algorithms.

Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of PAES. In this implementation, the decision variables will be the position of the ULTCs of the network. The single solution used in the optimization process is coded using a vector N of integer values, which contains information relating to the N ULTC transformers of the network. The solution is randomly initialized at the beginning of the algorithm and evolves using the mutation operator, which allows the search space to be explored effectively, generating feasible solutions thanks to the use of integer coding. In particular, the mutation operator consists of varying the value of a percentage of ULTC transformers. Thus, in each iteration the current solution (parent) generates a new solution (child), which is then evaluated by applying a Newton-Raphson load flow method ( Go  X  mez-Expo  X  sito et al., 2008 ), returning the values of VDI and P loss . The algorithm then selects the best parent and child according to Pareto-dominance relations. This means that if the child is better in at least one objective and not worse in the others, the current solution (parent) is replaced by the child, which is also compared with those solutions included in the external archive of non-dominated solutions, in order to decide whether or not it should be included. If the parent dominates the child, the parent solution continues evolving in the next iteration. The two solutions may be indifferent, i.e. neither one dominates the other, in which case PAES will only accept the child solution if it is not dominated by any other solution located in the external set of non-dominated solutions. Furthermore, if the child solution is found to dominate any solution in the external archive, it is included there.
Hybridization of algorithms in the multi-objective context is nowadays an open research area which refers to combining aspects of two or more optimization techniques into a single algorithm in order to take advantage of their particular characteristics. Knowles (2002) proposed that PAES could be extended in two different ways. One of these suggested variants is based on using Simulated Annealing ( Kirkpatrick et al., 1983 ), and the other one on Tabu Search ( Glover and Laguna, 1997 ). To date, neither of these hybrid versions of PAES has been implemented in a real optimization problem. Thus, the aim of this work is to implement the extensions of PAES proposed by Knowles (2002) , i.e. Annealing-PAES (aPAES) and Tabu-PAES (tPAES) to solve the voltage regulation problem described above. Additionally, Annealing-Tabu-PAES (atPAES), which combines both meta-heuristics, has also been implemented. Simulated annealing, tabu search, and their hybridization have been studied in the past in other multi-objective optimization problems ( Ban  X  os et al., 2007 ). All the algorithms have been implemented on MATLAB using a power systems toolbox offered by Cornell University ( Zimmerman et al., 2007 ). 2.4. Test networks
Two standard networks have been used in the experimental analysis: IEEE57 and RTS (Reliable Test System) to analyze the performance of the proposed methods. The ULTCs used in both problems all have 21 steps ranging from 10% to +10% with step increments of 1%. IEEE57 system consists of the following elements (see Fig. 2 ): 7 generating units, four of which are power plants while the other three are synchronous generators. The maximum and minimum active and reactive power of the generators have been arbitrarily chosen, but within a range that guarantees stability of the system (when it is solved using non-linear methods).
A transmission and distribution network consisting of 63 lines that interconnect 57 nodes. The initial active (MW) and reactive power (MVAr) at each node for the IEEE57 network is shown in Table 1 . There are 17 power transformers with regulation taps. Therefore, there exist a total of 21 17 =3.00419 10 22 possible configurations.

Two voltage levels, 132 and 33 kV, are considered. The voltage will be controlled using the tap changers of transfor-mers, although the synchronous condensers (or any other element that can provide reactive power) could also perform this task.

The RTS system consists of the following elements: 33 generation nodes grouping 99 generating units, of which 96 are electric utilities and the remaining 3 are synchronous generators. The maximum and minimum active and reactive power of the generators have been chosen according to those previously proposed by other authors ( Grigg et al., 1999).
The transmission and distribution network consists of 104 lines that interconnect 73 nodes. Table 2 displays the initial active/reactive power at each node. There are 16 power transformers with regulation taps. Therefore, there exist a total of 21 16 =1.43059 10 21 possible configurations.
Two voltage levels (138, 230 kV) are considered. The voltage will be controlled using the tap changers of the transformers, although the synchronous condensers (or any other element that can provide reactive power) could also perform this task. 2.5. Performance measures
The quality of the sets for non-dominated solutions is evaluated using two metrics: set coverage, and hypervolume. Both are based on ideas taken from the metrics proposed by Zitzler and Thiele (1999). Both metrics are described below:
Set coverage (SC). Given two subsets of non-dominated solutions, S and S 0 , function SC maps the ordered pair ( S , S 0 )to a value z within the interval [0,1]. The value z represents the percentage of solutions of S 0 dominated by at least one solution of S . The value SC( S , S 0 )=1 means that all solutions in S 0 are dominated by any solution of S. It should be noted that SC is not a symmetric metric, i.e. SC( S , S 0 )= z does not imply that SC( S 0 , S )=1 z .

Hypervolume (HVM). Let S =( s 1 , s 2 , y , s n ) be a set of non-dominated solutions (ND). The function HVM(S) returns the area of the objective space (bounded by a reference point, s ref ) dominated by at least one of the members of S , where index, and the maximum power loss. 3. Results and discussion
When applying heuristic methods to optimization problems it is advisable to perform a sensitivity analysis, i.e. to determine to what extent the output of the model depends upon the inputs. These sensitivity analyses require a certain number of executions of each algorithm in order to obtain robust conclusions. Thus, it is important to note that while in single-objective optimization it is straightforward to determine the median value of several runs, in
Pareto-based multi-objective optimization it is not possible because it obtains not one single solution, but rather several non-dominated solutions. Therefore, in this study twenty-five runs of each parametric configuration are performed, and the one which has the median value in terms of set coverage (SC) and hypervolume (HVM) metrics is selected, thus reducing the randomness due to the use of different initial solutions.
Therefore, the first empirical study performed aims to determine the performance of the four implementations (PAES, aPAES, tPAES, atPAES) using two different parameters. The first one is the number of iterations of the algorithm ( n i ), which has been set to 5.000, 10.000 and 20.000. These values imply that the algorithms process only a small portion of the search space. The second one is the mutation rate ( m r ), which has been analyzed with values {5%, 10%, 20%}. The mutation rate represents the percentage of transformers of the network that are modified in each iteration. Table 3 summarizes the six different parameter configurations used in all twenty-five runs of each algorithm in each network.

Let us start by applying PAES to the test network IEEE57. All the non-dominated fronts obtained by each method in IEEE57 using different numbers of iterations ( n i ) and mutation rates ( m r ) VDI have been analyzed. Fig. 3 shows the graphical representation of the fronts of non-dominated solutions obtained using different parametric configurations. It can be observed that all the methods are very close, and it is very difficult to determine graphically which is the best non-dominated front. However, this graph shows that all the solutions obtained have a VDI within the range [0.02, 0.07].

If these fronts of non-dominated solutions are analyzed in terms of set coverage and hypervolume metrics, it is possible to obtain numerical conclusions about their performance. Thus, Table 4 shows the results obtained by PAES in IEEE57, where each value located in row i , column j indicates the set coverage between both runs (SC( i , j )). For instance, the value 0.723 in row Set
G , column Set D means that 72.3% of the solutions of Set D are dominated by at least one solution of Set G . Finally, column HVM represents the relative hypervolume that each run obtains taking as reference the higher hypervolume. Therefore, it can be observed that Set I is the best configuration in terms of set coverage, while Set C is the best configuration in terms of hypervolume. This difference in results occurs because Set C obtains more good extreme solutions in terms of P loss than the other methods. Another interesting conclusion is that using large mutation rates ( m r =20%) often leads to good non-dominated fronts in terms of hypervolume, since the higher the mutation, the higher the dispersion of the solutions.

Similar analyses have been performed with the other hybrid approaches, and the results denote that the runs using 20.000 iterations outperform, in terms of set coverage, those using 5.000 and 10.000, while the mutation rate has a lower impact on the quality of the non-dominated fronts.

Fig. 4 shows the non-dominated fronts obtained by the best parametric configurations of PAES, aPAES, tPAES, and atPAES. Once again the non-dominated fronts are very close, and so it is necessary to analyze the numerical results obtained by each method using the metrics described above. Table 5 shows that tPAES obtains the best results in terms of set coverage and hypervolume. It is noteworthy that atPAES outperforms aPAES, which demonstrates that including tabu search in aPAES (hybridizing both methods) outperforms the results obtained by aPAES.

Once the results obtained in IEEE57 have been analyzed, the same study is performed in RTS network. The sensitivity analysis performed on each method has found that the runs using 20.000 iterations again outperform those using 5.000 and 10.000 iterations, while in all cases a mutation rate of 10% and 20% obtains the best results. Fig. 5 shows that all the non-dominated fronts are very close together, and therefore numerical results are used to determine the best performance in terms of the metrics described above. As displayed in Table 6 , tPAES obtains the best results in terms of set coverage, while PAES is the best in hypervolume. tPAES obtains the second best solution in terms of hypervolume, which reinforces the previous conclusions about the good performance of tPAES. It is well-known that tabu search often obtains good results in discrete search spaces. In this particular application, the good performance of tabu search can be justified thanks to the advantages of using the tabu list, which limits the search by avoiding positions previously explored, i.e. it avoids setting the ULTCs in those step positions associated with poor solutions in terms of Pareto-dominance. VDI
As shown in Figs. 3 X 5 , the main advantage of using Pareto-optimization in the decision making process lies in the possibility of deciding among configurations with low values of VDI and high values of P loss or vice versa, according to the particular characteristics of the system (user requirements, safety, regula-tions, etc.). Furthermore, the multi-objective approaches here presented are able to obtain solutions of similar quality to single-objective approaches. In particular, Montoya et al. (2006) implemented a single-objective genetic algorithm to minimize the voltage deviation index (VDI). The best results obtained by that genetic algorithm in IEEE57 and RTS networks were VDI=0,0508 and VDI=0.0121, respectively. As can be seen in
Figs. 3 X 5 , some of the non-dominated solutions found by multi-objective approaches obtain better values of VDI than the single-objective genetic algorithm.

Finally, Fig. 6 displays a radial graph sh owing the runtimes of each method using each parametric configuration in RTS network. The mutation rate has a lower impact on the results, while, as supposed, the runtime increases in the same o rder as the number iterations of the algorithm, oscillating between 1.725 and 14.868 s. The basic algorithm (PAES) is the fastest in all cases, while the highest runtimes correspond to atPAES, since in each iteration the algorithm applies simulated annealing and tabu search. The results obtained in IEEE57 network are similar, as the runtimes are mainly affected by the number of iterations, while the network topology has a lower impact.
As described above, the larger the number of iterations, the higher the quality of the non-dominated fr ont and the runtime. However, as the power distribution system works in a dynamic environment, in some cases it could be more suitable to reduce the population time in order to obtain responses in lower runtimes at the cost of slightly decreasing the quality of the solutions.

This paper addresses the optimization problem consisting of adjusting ULTC transformers in order to regulate nodal voltages in power distribution networks and simultaneously minimize power losses. The problem is of great in terest for power distribution companies because this strategy allows them to act on the main elements of the network to determ ine the optimal voltage profile with the aim of correcting possible deviations from nominal values and to reduce inefficiencies. At the same time power losses can also be minimized. It is also of clear interest for end users, as it allows energy to be delivered in the best possible conditions, thereby ensuring the proper operation of electrical and electronic devices. Several algorithms have been implemented and tested on two standard meshed test networks, IEEE57 and RTS. Tap changer settings are the state variables of the problem and their correct adjustment allows the two objectives described above to be achieved. The Pareto-based multi-objective algorithms here imple-mented have the advantage of including multiple criteria without the need of introducing weights in a simple aggregating function. With this aim, a well-known Pareto-based evolutionary strategy has been applied to this problem, as have three hybridizations of this strategy with other meta-heuristics, such as simulated annealing and tabu search. The results obtained have demonstrated the good performance of these algorithms when testing networks of medium-realistic size. These solutions were found in a matter of seconds on a personal computer, which indicates that these methods could even be used in real-time environments, especially if parallel processing is used. As regards future extensions of this work, the possibility of controlling the capacitor banks can be considered, as well as the possibility of adding additional objectives such as minimizing the number of times that the tap changers vary their position. Furthermore, it is important to consider the lifetime of the under load tap changers, and it would therefore be suitable to establish mechanisms to avoid excessive variability in these changers.
