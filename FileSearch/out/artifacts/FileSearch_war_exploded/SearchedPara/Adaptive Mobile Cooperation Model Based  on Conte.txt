 Along with the rapid development of mobile computing technology, the people de-mands it not only providing services in anytime and anywhere, but also the capability for supporting mobile users to cooperate each other. Therefore, the inherent characters of mobile environment are facing greatly challenge. How to sufficiently make use of the dynamic resources and effectively support the adaptive mobile cooperation is a hot spot adaptive sensing cooperation information among mobile cooperators. So, a novel model X  CA-AMCM model was proposed in this paper, based on the existed work. 
In this paper, the first section summarizes the theoretic research; the second section gives some definitions and theorems; the third section describes CA-AMCM model; summary of the whole paper. 2.1 Mobile Cooperation [1-4]. In industry, IBM and Microsoft mainly transform the traditional CSCW application to the enterprise level application in mobile computing; CMU, Brunel and Cambridge focus on the cooperative manipulation and data transfer of video and audio in wireless network in application leve l. There are less the formal theory model of mobile cooperation. Although some academicians proposed the cooperation model, theory model. For this, a novel model, CA-AMCM, was proposed. 2.2 Context Awareness extents, how to realize the context awareness is mentioned in literature. In this paper, CA-AMCM mainly focuses on how to efficiently express and use the context infor-mation through context awareness in mobile computing, to support adaptive mobile cooperation. mobile cooperation environments. So some related theorem and definitions was given. = X  = ^" {( , ) | group context at , 1, 2, , } M is the group member context, is the group task,  X  is set of all relations within the group, T is time sequence. Then M , and Theorems. Prove: Generally, the context depicting mobile cooperation is the subset of context in compounded each member context. From above, it is obviously. adopted. For provided more valuable and explicit semantic meaning, high-level con-text obtained through aggregating the primary context. And deductive context ob-ables the application to adapt the dynamic environment change. From above, the model  X  CA-AMCM, is described as follow: executed by group member,  X  is a set of environment state,  X  is a set of cooperation rules. At Present, the model was used in mobile embedded cooperation platform (MECP) system. MECP system adopted mobile agent technology and mixed architecture of CS and mobile peer-to-peer to support group member cooperative work as follow fig 1. 
In our platform, we mainly adopt logic sensor to capture context information, and save the information in mobile database. Another hand, we create some knowledge information product, deduct and save continuously. As a new and important research embranchment of mobile computing, mobile coop-eration can provide user more use function. Another hand, context-awareness can make best use of the characteristic of d ynamical environment and realize adaptation. In this paper, we proposed a model CA-AMCM based on context-awareness, and farther validate the models.
