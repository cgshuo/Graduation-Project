 In this paper, we present a novel multi-webpage summarization algorithm. It adds the graph based ranking algorithm into the framework of Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) method, to not only capture the main topic of the web pages but also eliminate the redundancy existing in the sentences of the summary result. The experiment result indicates that the new approach has the better performance than the previous methods. H.3.1 [ Content Analysis and Indexing ] X  Abstracting methods General Terms: Algorithms, Performance, Experimentation Keywords: Multi-document Summarization, Graph Based Ranking Algorithm, Maximum Marginal Relevance Web search engines find and rank documents based on maximizing relevance to the user X  X  query, yet these systems still require users to read the hundreds of closely-ranked documents to locate the relevant sections of text for their information seeking goals. For this problem, an integration of IR and query oriented summarization would be helpful in a true IR or topic-detection context. However, the functionality challenges on the summarization system are great, because many of the i nput documents are likely to repeat much the same information, while differing in certain parts, since they are the retrieval results under the same query. This make the multi-webpage summarization task has a significant difference from single-document summarization: anti-redundancy methods are needed because the degree of re dundancy as previously mentioned is significantly higher in a group of topically related articles that in an individual article as each article tends to describe. Therefore, a g ood summarization tool should contain the key shared relevant information among all the documents only once, plus other information unique to some of the individual documents that are directly relevant to the user's query [5]. To achieve this goal, we propose a new method, which combine the two previous methods, graph based ranking algorithm and Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm, to not only consider the similarities between user X  X  query and main topic of the documents, but also minimize the possible redundancy existing in the summary result. Graph based ranking algorithm [1][2] computes sentence importance by the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph We made the test data by randomly choosing two data sets on [6]. http://lada.si.umich.edu:8080/clair/nie1/nie.cgi?CID=2005122623 4457. The query for our approach and MMR method is the search query  X  X ee Google Microsoft China X  plus the first 11 words in the three articles, totally 37 words. After eliminating the redundancy, we have 18 different query words. The second data in http://lada.si.umich.edu:8080/clair/nie1/nie.cgi?CID=2005122623 4447 includes 4 articles. The query is the first 11 words in the three articles, totally 34 words. After eliminating the redundant words, we have 29 different query words. Figure 1 Summary result of the three approaches, 2% original article length. (a:b) means the b th sentence in the a th article. In Figure 1, in the result of the graph based ranking algorithm, the second sentence (2:6) has the redundant meaning with the first sentence (1:6), which is  X  X o to trial next month X . In the MMR result, the two sentences selected by the algorithm are all from article 1, and the information from other articles is missed, hence the topic described by the summary is not so completed. In our result, the two sentences selected do not have much redundancy, and represent the topic of two articles simultaneously. We also made a simple comparison with a published system, NewsInEssence [6]. The result In Figure 2 indicates that our approach collects information from more diverse web pages. For example, the sentence (3:2) not only gives a detail explanation for sentence (1:1), but also provides new information as  X  X oogle is a rival of Microsoft and there is some behind-the-scenes rancor between the companies X . In Figure 3, we can see that our approach selects two first sentences from two articles respectively. Usually the first sentence in an article is the most important one, and many web search engine X  X  snapshot for the return hits are the first sentences of the pages. Therefore, the results indicate that our approach has better chance of selecting main topic sentences.
