 Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are undergoing rapid progress and inspiring nu-merous applications more and more. However, challenges and difficulties still exist: sensor nodes are prone to failure because of lack of power, physical damage etc; (3) since the information generated by a single node is usually incomplete or inaccurate, and the applications need collaborative communication and computation among tolerant [3]. agent based architecture (EEMA), which is based on clustering algorithm and multi-agent system. By reducing unnecessary or redundant messages as well as error mes-sages, EEMA achieves good energy efficiency and network performance. simulation results for the multi-agent architecture. In section 5, we conclude the paper with a summary of the main ideas and directions for future work. employs a hierarchical clustering, and the nodes organize themselves into clusters and information from sensors and pass them to the base station. In this way it does realize a large reduction in energy consumption. which groups nodes as clusters, builds a routing tree among distributed CHs and only lets the root node of the rooting tree communicate with the base station. ECDG uses a two architectures achieve data fusion to some degree, the data is not further processed, for example, by way of data classification, data filtering and error message detection. work, which means the energy efficiency and reliability of WSNs cannot be satisfied. This section introduces the main construction of multi-agent architecture. As shown in Figure 1, the multi-agent architecture is divided into three phase: classification phase, with the sensor nodes and disseminates the messages in the first phase. Then, the error at aggregation phase, the filter agent focuses on filtering the duplicate messages. 3.1 Classification Agent The classification agent is responsible for message acquisition and classification. The CH has to be powerful enough to receive each incoming message to determine whether the message should be processed or forwarded. We divide the messages into nodes in the same cluster; (3) Transmitted from other CHs in different clusters. directly, because these messages from other clusters are usually important and already again. But for the first two types of messages, which are generated by the nodes in the the cluster head, and are authenticated there. Disseminated by the classification agent, dundancy for the error and duplication of data by exploiting probabilistic techniques. 3.2 Error Agent agent involves two components: judgment and authentication. Based on the facts that sensors which share the wireless medium have similar messages to send at almost the same time, because they all generate messages in response to external events. introduce the error frequency to judge the type of messages and find the real reasons that cause the errors. 3.2.1 Judgment Component repealed or have been repealed. The nodes contain an information table structured as are not considered to be cred ible and never be used again and vice versa. Rather, its amount of error messages that the node has sent. When it exceeds a certain value, we are sure that the node has failed. We set the BoolStatus value as true, and update the BlackList Simultaneously. It means that its messages are not credible and all the messages from this node will be BlackList are sent to authentication component. 3.2.2 Authentication Component named MsgLog , to store the latest messages records, which reserve the information of judge whether those messages are authentic or not. messages and new messages. In either case, the agent waits for a certain threshold of time to obtain sufficient information to distinguish the messages. In the wireless sen-cated to be erroneous. The authenticatio n component would drop these messages and record the sensor node ID to the BlackList . 1. Get new Messagex; ter Agent; 3. Get messages to DQ during a time period; 4. xCount  X  0 //Initialize the counter of Messages for i=1 to DQ.Length{ If ( Message x .content simulates to BufferMessage[i].content and Message x .ID  X  BufferMessage[i].ID ) Then xCount ++; } If xCount &gt;0 then Message x is new message; Add to MsgLog and transmit it. Else Message x is doubted as error message; Add to BlackList and update frequency; 5. End 3.3 Filter Agent cuses on filtering proportional redundancy messages to minimize communications overhead and reduce collision as well as on dealing with the amount of message and data aggregation. Actually, neither all sensing nodes need to report, nor all messages are needed to be sent. Therefore, we just need to send sufficient amount of messages sages amount. H base station. P is about i H ) P ( dance with the probability and statistics, the C i at least sends  X  guaranteeing at least one message arrives at the base station successfully. After send-mechanism, we can prune many excessive messages and reduce the communication messages, and also provide a way to suppress redundant retransmissions. network simulation incorporating ECDG. We choose a 100m*100m network, where Network X  X  lifetime means the network lose the ability to fulfill its mandate. The EEMA X  X  lifetime is about 1.2 times longer than ECDG X  X  lifetime and about 1.4 times than LEACH X  X  lifetime. This indicates that EEMA can achieve much higher nodes , thereby reducing the risk that some nodes may die too early. Figure.3 shows that our EEMA can reduce more error messages than LEACH and ECDG, which is messages. Efficient and Multi-Agent based architecture (EEMA), which not only can reduce the amount of messages, but also improve the reliability of WSN. The simulation shows, with EEMA architecture, WSN can perform much better than LEACH and ECDG in terms of energy-efficiency and reliability.
