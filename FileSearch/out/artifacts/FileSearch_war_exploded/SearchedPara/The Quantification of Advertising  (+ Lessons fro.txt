 As electronic communication, media and commerce increasingly permeate every aspect of modern life, real-time personalization of consumer experience through data-mining becomes practical. Effective classification, pred iction and change modeling of consumer interests, behavior s and purchasing habits using machine learning and statistical methods drives efficiency, insights and consumer relevan ce that were never before possible. The internet has brought on a rapid evolution in advertising. Everything about behavior on the internet can be quantified and responses to behavior can occur in real time. This dynamic interaction with the user has created opportunities to better understand the way in which individuals move from awareness of a product to considering a purchase, through to intent and ultimately a sale for the marketer. When a marketer can answer the question  X  X id those TV ad s cause consumers to switch shampoo brands? X  they can model behavior change and adjust marketing strategies accordingly. Underpinning this shift in how the world X  X  trillion dollar unprecedented scale, creating new challenges for software that must interpret this stream and make real time decisions tens, even hundreds of thousands of times every second. I will explore advances in modeling media consumption, advertising response and the r eal-time evaluation of media opportunities through reference to Quantcast, a business launched in September 2006 which today interprets in excess of 10 billion new digital media cons umption records every day. We will examine the challenges of applying machine learning to non-search advertising and in doi ng so explore the creation of business environments  X  organiza tion, infrastructure, tools, processes (and costs considerati ons)  X  in which scientists can quickly develop new petabyte scale algorithmic approaches, migrate them rapidly to real-t ime production and deliver fully customized experiences for mark eters, publishers and consumers alike.

Launched in 2006, today Quantcast routinely processes hundreds of terabytes of data each day, applying a range of machine learning techniques to support the media buying and selling requirements of its varied customer base  X  millions of individual websites, over 70% of the largest media companies in the US and hundreds of the world X  X  largest marketers. Prior to Quantcast, he co-founded Searchspace the leading provider of terrorist financ ing detection and anti-money laundering software for the world X  s financial services industry. Before Searchspace, he was a Research Fellow in the Computer Science Department at Univer sity College London working on data mining algorithms and software architecture. He has designed and built numer ous large scale analytical software solutions based on data mining in high volume transactional environments, including financial market surveillance (e.g. London Stoc k Exchange, NYSE), insurance risk management, detecting fraud in online loyalty programs, and anti-money laundering and terro rist financing detection for many of the world X  X  largest banks (e.g. JP Morgan Chase, Barclays, UBS, Wells Fargo).
