 Example 1. SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X ) [PLACE n MOUNTAIN]
Sentence: Tom plans to climb the Kilimanjaro in the summer vacation. (ACTOR: Tom, HUMAN) (OBJECT: Kilimanjaro) SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X ) in this sentence is [PLACE n MOUNTAIN]. Example 2. SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X ) [FOOD n DRINK]
Sentence: Mary likes drinking Kilimanjaro. (ACTOR: Mary, HUMAN) (OBJECT: Kilimanjaro) Therefore, SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X ) in this sentence is [FOOD n DRINK]. Example 3. SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X ) [PRODUCT n SOFTWARE]
Sentence: Data is stored in Kilimanjaro. (ACTOR: data, ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTs) (OBJECT: Kilimanjaro) be stored . Therefore, SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X ) in this sentence is [PRODUCT n SOFTWARE]. Example 4. SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X )
Sentence: Both Mary and Tom usually buy Kilimanjaro, because they like Kilimanjaro. (ACTOR: Mary, Tom, and they, HUMAN) (OBJECT: Kilimanjaro) HUMAN can buy . Therefore, SEMANTIC ( X  X  Kilimanjaro  X  X ) could be [FOOD n DRINK] or [PRODUCT n SOFTWARE]. n DRINK].

 4. Algorithm of disambiguation by field association scheme 4.1. Field constraint knowledge Definition 3. Field constraint If SEMANTIC( x ) is not singleton, then the field constraint knowledge is defined as follows: For c in SEMANTIC( x ), CONSTRAINT( x , c ) is defined by a set of fields f that restrict c . Table 5 shows CONSTRANIT( x , c ) for x = X  X  X ilimanjaro X  X  and c in SEMANTIC( x ). of { h Food / Coffee i } and { h IT / Software i } respectively. 4.2. Algorithm of disambiguation by field association schemes (1) Let d be a document with a sequence of sentences S 1 , ... ,S (2) D ( h , i , k ) represents the document with a subsequence of sentences S (3) Let L w be the length of the window, which is represented as ( k h + 1). in CONSTRAINT( x , c ) for c in SEMANTIC( x ).
 cussed in the following formal algorithm, together with examples. [ Disambiguation Algorithm ]
Input : Document d including sentences S 1 , ... ,S h , ... ,S Output : SEMANTIC_CODE is c if c for x can be disambiguated. Otherwise
SEMANTIC_CODE becomes empty (denoted by 0). [ Method :] ( Step 1 ){ Initialization } ( Step 2 ){ Increment of L w } ( Step 3 ){ Determination of subdocuments for L w } ( Step 4 ){ Determination of subdocument for target word x } ( Step 5 ){ Disambiguated Semantic of the target word }
Example 5. As shown in Table 4 , consider the target word x =  X  X  X ilimanjaro X  X . SEMANTIC( x )={ c n MOUNTAIN], c 2 = [FOOD n DRINK], and c 3 = [PRODUCT n SOFTWARE]. In this example, f 1 = h Trip/Africa i , f 2 = h Sports/Mountain Climbing i , f 3 = h Photo/Nature i , f 4 = h Food/Coffee i , f 5 = h IT/Computer i .

As shown in Table 6 ,  X  X  X hirsty( f 4 , 4) X  X  means field f
MAX = 2, the maximum number of n = 8, and i =7. ( Step 1 )
L w is initialized by 0.
 SUB_DOC is initialized by the empty set.

Go to Step 2. ( Step 2 )
L w is increased by 1. Since L w 6 MAX (=2) and L w 6 n (=8), go to Step 3. ( Step 3 )
Extract subdocument D ( 7, 7, 7 ), for h = 7 and k = 7 such that L
Since D (7, 7, 7) has no field association terms, go to Step 2. ( Step 2 )
L w is increased by 2. Since L w 6 MAX (=2) and L w 6 n (=8), go to Step 3. ( Step 3 )
For L w =( k h + 1) = 2, there are two subdocuments as follows: (a) Since D (7, 7, 6) that has no field association terms, not append the subdocument. (b) Since D (7, 7, 8) that has a field association term  X  X  coffee  X  X  associating with f ( Step 4 ) Only subdocument D (7, 7, 8) is in SUB_DOC.

Maximum WEIGHT( D ( h , i , k ), f ) becomes WEIGHT( D (7, 7, 8), f go to Step 5. ( Step 5 )
For f 4 , SEMANTIC_CODE is determined as c 2 = [FOOD n DRINK] by using the fact that CONSTRAINT( Kilimanjaro , h Food/Coffee i ) includes field f
Set [FOOD n DRINK] to SEMANTIC_CODE and terminate the algorithm.
The whole process shows how the target word x =  X  X  X ilimanjaro X  X  of S proposed scheme.

Suppose that there is no sentence S 8 in Table 6 . Results from S
By using the same algorithm, two subdocuments D (2, 7, 7) and D (1, 7, 7) are in SUB_DOC until L subdocuments, is the maximum WEIGHT( D ( h , i , k ), f ) belonging to f f ) 0.57 and WEIGHT( D (1, 7, 7), f 2 ) 1.14). By using CONSTRAINT( x , c [FOOD n DRINK].

Part of the experimental words in English can be found in Appendix B . always appear, we append the new case structures to the current work. In the experiments, test documents including ambiguous words were collected from the Internet. The English documents used are mainly from the following sites: Wikipedia ( http://wikipedia.org ), New York times ( http://www.nytimes.com ), Chinadaily ( http://www.chinadaily.com.cn ), etc.
 The Chinese documents are mainly from the following sites: Sina ( http://www.sina.com ), Sohu ( http://www.sohu.com ), Sogou corpus ( http://www.sogou.com/labs/dl/tce.html ), and other. Each semantic sense of a target word is tested in at least 20 contexts in various documents. The accuracy of experimental results is defined as: Accuracy = a / b Where a is the number of words disambiguated correctly and b is total number of words. in Tables 7a and 7b .

 Table 10 presents the results of McNemar X  X  Test for context ambiguities. In conclusion, the field association scheme can perform better than the case frame method. To discuss the accuracy for different field, Fig. 4 shows values of accuracy in some typical fields. because these fields include more typical terms, distinct from other fields. 5.2.
