 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems can provide information rich environment to healthcare professionals[1]. Especially, a dischar g e s u mmary is a clinical note de-ab u ndant medical history. However, convertin g u nstr u ct u red information into a str u c-t u ral form req u ires elaborative works. Nowadays the active implementation of lan-gu a g e processin g techniq u es in medical domain shows a lot of promisin g res u lts [2]. marization or a vis u alization of clinical narratives. the clinical event extraction. This task is based on a vis u alization model proposed by [3]. The vis u alization model (V-Model) needs detection of description bo u ndaries symptoms and medical si g ns, dia g nostic tests, and medications. and many researches u se the UMLS (Unified Medical Lan gu a g e System) as a re-thesa u r u s has a limitation in terms of the processin g performance. Clinicians u se jar-ca u se of a thesa u r u s can  X  t cover all expressions in everyday expressions. The second with a companion animal in the UMLS. the clinical event extraction by levera g in g both the Wikipedia as an additional thesa u -medical dictionary for Korean lan gu a g e, native technical terms are translated via the Wikipedia as if an En g lish-Korean medical dictionary is employed. t u res and they are combined in conditional random fields (CRF) which can freely compose arbitrary feat u res [4].

Res u lts of o u r experiment are lowed in Section 5 and 6. clinical concepts. an application, s u ch as medical problems, clinical actions, and/or res u lts [6, 7, 8]. For into a certain semantic type sim u ltaneo u sly. thesa u r u ses have been u sed to import domain knowled g e s u ch as UMLS, SNOMED-CT, MeSH [12,13,14]. proposed novel feat u res improvin g the performance of their models.

On the other hand, two feat u res of the Wi-and Korean Wikipedia which are u sed as a technical term translator. entities which were related to states of t u mors in liver CT reports, and Jan g et al pro-an UMLS feat u re and cl u e words to be u sed in hidden Markov model. They applied the idea to extract patient  X  s symptoms, clinical therapies, and performances. controlled vocab u lary to redeem the limitation of u sin g the standard thesa u r u s only. 3.1 Clinical Event Extraction O u r research is based on the concept of the V-Model, which identifies descriptions re-wider bo u ndary. For example, a symptom can be a word or a phrase s u ch as  X  X zotemia  X  or  X  X rerenal azotemia  X  , or wider bo u ndary like  X  X rerenal azotemia  X  X  X  ( occ u rred )  X  . operation and treatment ta g s were mer g ed beca u se these ta g s had semantic similarity ca u sin g an ambi gu ity problem, and the operation ta g rarely appeared in o u r corp u s. u tilized as a piece of evidence of the semantic classification. The thesa u r u ses are the words for certain semantic types. For the p u rpose of combinin g information which is implemented with MALLET [17]. the token is in the middle or at the end of a bo u ndary. For example, two tokens,  X  X  u - X  X ephritis/I-Dx  X  . EMR system of a University Hospital in Korea with Instit u tional Review Board ap-proved. A P OS ta gg in g and an abbreviation resol u tion are performed for the prepro-cessin g . The CRF is trained with g eneral, dictionary, and context u al feat u res. sented in section 3.3. 3.2 Preprocessing exec u te it separately, o u r preprocessor tokenizes words by whitespace first, and toke-nizes a token into s u b-tokens by the g ro u p of letters in the second step (e. g .,  X  X xyme-tholone  X  X   X  to  X  X xymetholone  X  and  X   X  X   X  . X   X  X   X  means administration of a medica-seq u ence. standardized clinical thesa u r u s. Medical abbreviations have been listed u p in the refe-renced Wikipedia pa g e. When a token in o u r clinical text corresponds with an entry in the list, the matched entry is u sed as the f u ll name of the abbreviated word. 3.3 Feature Extraction Semantic feat u res are s u bdivided as dictionary and context u al feat u res. General feature entity extraction researches with the CRF.  X  described above. We observed that nei g hbor words were effective to identify clini-cal events. To decide the size of N, the size was eval u ated from 1 to 4, therefore, a bi g ram showed the best performance.  X 
Korean P OS ta g s are different from En g lish ta g s,  X  X _ X  is attached to En g lish P OS feat u res and  X  X _ X  is attached to Korean P OS feat u res.  X 
Phrase pattern: We have observed that most clinical events were fo u nd in no u n or adjective phrases of En g lish from o u r texts. With the P OS information of each to-ken, this feat u re is exploited when a P OS ta g seq u ence is matched by a re gu lar ex-pression  X  X J*NN+ X .  X 
Capitalized: This feat u re indicates whether the first letter is u pper case alphabet in a token.  X 
Entirely capitalized: This feat u re indicates whether a token consists of all u pper-case alphabets.  X 
Time expression: This feat u re indicates whether a token is matched to a word list or re gu lar expressions of time expressions, e. g .,  X '?19[0-9]{2}\d?|'?20[0-9]{2}\d?|'? [0-9][0-9]\d? X .  X

Therefore, twelve correspond-partment) X ,  X   X  X  X  (visit a hospital) X ,  X   X  X  X  (o u r hospital) X . Semantic feature feat u res. O u r task-related semantic types are cate g orized and listed u p from semantic type tree in the UMLS. The proposed feat u res have been cate g orized into two g ro u ps, cl u e words. We call the feat u re on the UMLS as EF1, the feat u re on the Wikipedia as EF2, and the feat u re on o u r controlled vocab u lary as EF3.  X 
Semantic type in UMLS (EF1): The UMLS is the inte g rated concept system link-types which are derived from member thesa u r u ses. It means that each term has one calc u lated likelihoods of semantic types per each term and selected the most likely semantic type as a representative one for each term. UMLS by o u r man u al review.  X  Category in Wikipedia (EF2): Wikipedia cate g ories are levera g ed inthe semantic network amon g entries. The semantic networkis hierarchically str u ct u red and semantic types in the UMLS. Beca u se a cate g ory have one or more parents in set.Theyare presented in Table 3. extraction of this feat u re. Havin g g iven Korean medical dictionary showin g low recall in o u r preliminary experiment, we eval u ated o u r system witho u t Korean medical vo-cab u lary. Instead, the Wikipedia is u tilized by providin g a link between pa g es in both the pa g e link, Korean clinical te rm is translated into En g lish and the translated term is applied as a dictionary feat u re.  X 
Clue word (EF3): Classifyin g terms in a sentence may be req u ired a consideration of the correlation how the nei g hbor words appear. Amon g nei g hbors, we observed hi g hly deterministic nei g hbor words and patterns d u rin g data review, and they are pattern, related semantic type)in the vocab u lary. For example, in a sentence  X   X  X  X   X  P d 30 m g  X   X  X  X  (Increased P d to 30 m g before dischar g e) X ,readers can infer this feat u re contains 13entries. res u lts and performance for each feat u re are described in section 4.2. 4.1 Experimental Setup rhe u matolo g y and nephrolo g y and the texts were from an EMR system in a u niversity hospital in Korea.

Korean and En g lish tokens from o u r corp u s. 4.3 Error Analysis We observed false positive errors which occ u rred when a semantic type in the UMLS covers m u ltiple concepts and mismatches with o u r act u al ta gg in g , for instance,  X  X or-mone replacement X  is a concept in a semantic type,  X  X herape u tic or P reventive proce-d u re X , and o u r annotation assi g ned the term as a Medication ta g . However, the seman-tic type (Therape u tic or P reventive proced u re) dominated the Treatment ta g by proba-instances as o u r system achieved the lowest performance for the Tx ta g . improvement when we consider the c u rrent stat u s of similar tasks on Korean clinical tions are not only a word b u t also an expression therefore it is req u ired more sophisti-Korean clinical texts, o u r performance is similar or hi g her. Jan g et al reported 71% of recall for the extraction of problems, therapies, and res u lts from a pro g ression section in 300 texts. Oh et al reported 69% of F-meas u re for their extraction of t u mor related entities from 100 CT reports of liver cancer patients. incl u din g more Korean tokens are reported the hi g hest F-meas u re with the Wikipedia links in the Wikipedia positively affects the performance as if o u r system employs an En g lish-Korean dictionary. correct semantic classification. context u al information, and translatin g via a link between Wikipedia pa g es.
