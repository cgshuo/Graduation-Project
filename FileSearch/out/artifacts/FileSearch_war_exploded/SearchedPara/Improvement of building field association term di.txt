 1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been a tremendous growth of online text information related to digital libraries, medical diagnostic systems, remote education, news sources and electronic commerce. There is a great need to search and organize huge amounts of information in text documents ( Salton, 1989; Hearst &amp; Plaunt, 1993; Callan, 1994; Salton, Allan, &amp; Singhal, 1996; Fukumoto &amp; Suzuki, 1996; Jiang &amp; Zhai, 2004; Kyoung, Young-In, Sang-Bum, &amp; Hae-Chang, 2006 ).

An Information Retrieval (IR) process can be modeled as establishing relationships between user queries and the documents in a collection. It is important to retrieve relevant texts without investigating entire doc-uments especially when documents are large ( Salton, Allan, &amp; Buckley, 1993 ). User overload can be reduced and retrieval effectiveness enhanced by retrieving text passages instead of full documents whenever the query 1997; Melucii, 1998; Dumais, Banko, Brill, &amp; Ng, 2002; Sangkon, Shishibori, Sumitomo, &amp; Aoe, 2002 ).
Field Association ( FA ) terms are a limited set of discriminating terms that can specify document fields. For example, term  X  X  X ome run X  X  can indicate the document field &lt;Baseball&gt;. The basic concept underlying FA terms involves choosing a limited set of terms that brings the best matches to a given document. Techniques based on FA term s can recognize fields without considering the whole text ( Tsuji, Nigazawa, Okada, &amp; Aoe, 1999; Fuketa, Lee, Tsuji, Okada, &amp; Aoe, 2000 ). Furthermore, document fields can be decided efficiently if there are many relevant FA terms .

The main challenge in FA terms lie in its extraction and building of a comprehensive FA term dictionary. The it caused misleading redundant words to be registered because the quality of the resulting FA terms depends on the static classified documents by hand. Therefore, Atlam, Elmarhomy, Fuketa, Morita, and Aoe (2006) clas-sified documents by using search engine to append FA terms candidates to FA terms dictionary dynamically.
But there were irrelevant selected FA terms in that dictionary because that approach extracted FA terms from the whole documents. This paper describes improvement of the earlier FA terms dictionary by extracting FA terms using a passage technique rather than extracting them from the whole documents. The new approach is based on Salton X  X  passage techniques ( Salton et al., 1993 ) to extract FA terms from passages.
Section 2 introduces a field tree, FA term scopes and the drawback of an earlier approach. Section 3 explains how FA terms candidates automatically extracted by using Salton X  X  passage technique. Section 4 con-tains word collection data and discusses the effectiveness of the new approach. Section 5 presents a conclusion and indicates possible future work. 2. Field association terms 2.1.

 quency, respectively. The normalized frequency will be discussed in Section 2.3 . 2.2. FA term scopes FA terms to document fields ( Atlam, Morita, Fuketa, &amp; Aoe, 2002; Atlam, Fuketa, Morita, &amp; Aoe, 2003; Atlam, Elmarhomy, Morita, Fuketa, &amp; Aoe, 2004; Fuketa et al., 2000 ) as follows:
Definition 1 (1) Perfect FA terms are associated with one terminal field (e.g.  X  X  X itching X  X  is associated with one terminal (2) Semi-perfect FA terms are associated with more than one terminal field in one super-field (e.g.  X  X  X oubles X  X  (4) Multiple FA terms are associated with more than one terminal field of more than one super-fields (e.g. (5) Non-specific FA terms do not specify terminal field or super-fields and also include stop words (e.g. arti-2.3. The determination algorithm of FA terms
This subsection explains the traditional algorithm that automatically determines the candidates for FA ized term frequency is used instead of term frequency in each field as follows: ization ( w ,&lt; T &gt;)) can be defined as in the following formula (1) : The normalized frequency defines how much a specific word is concentrated in a specific field. tion ( w ,&lt; C &gt;)) of the FA term w in the field &lt; C &gt; is defined as in the following formula (2) :
Let FADIC be the FA terms dictionary. The following algorithm builds the FADIC dictionary according to five scopes: FA Terms Determination Algorithm: FABUILD

If the value of the accumulated concentration ratio does not exceed the threshold a , w is these sub-fields are not terminal fields, the process enters the next stage of Multiple FA terms . ( Step 4 ) Multiple FA terms mining (Step 1) Perfect FA terms and (Step 2) Semi-perfect FA terms. Then, many medium fields and terminal (end of algorithm).

 in &lt; S / C &gt; = &lt;root/Sports&gt;.
 threshold a , as indicated in the following: calculation : Concentration  X   X  doubles  X  ;&lt; Tennis &gt;  X  X  93 344 0 : 27 &lt; a  X  X  0 : 90  X 
Concentration  X   X  doubles  X  ;&lt; Badminton &gt;  X  X  105 344
Concentration  X   X  doubles  X  ;&lt; Table Tennis &gt;  X  X  142 Therefore, (Step 2) in the algorithm is executed and the process of determining w as Semi-perfect or Medium FA terms in &lt;root/Sports&gt; is performed.
 As the number m of children fields in the field &lt;Sports&gt; is 19, the formula (4) is calculates as follows: where w =  X  X  X ouble X  X , &lt; C 1 &gt; = &lt;Tennis&gt;, &lt; C ball&gt; and &lt; C 5 &gt; = &lt;Sumo&gt;.

Among these children fields in the field &lt;Sports&gt;, the fields whose frequency is higher than the average of these three children fields is
As the accumulated concentration ratio (0.98) of these three children fields exceeds the threshold value is appended to the FADIC dictionary.
 fields in &lt;root&gt; is 14, the calculation is done as follows:
The children fields whose normalized frequencies are higher than this average value (34.1) are &lt;Sports&gt;, &lt;Hobby &amp; Entertainment&gt; and &lt;Politics&gt;. They have the following concentration ratios:
Concentration  X   X  victory defeat  X  ;&lt; Sports &gt;  X  X  213
Concentration  X   X  victory defeat  X  ;&lt; Hobby Entertainment &gt;  X  X 
Concentration  X   X  victory defeat  X  ;&lt; Politics &gt;  X  X 
The accumulated value of these three fields (0.98 (=0.45 + 0.34 + 0.19)) exceeds the threshold a , but all of why  X  X  X ictory &amp; defeat X  X  cannot be a Semi-perfect FA term . When (Step 1) and (Step 2) are performed again &amp; defeat X  X  is appended to the FADIC dictionary. 2.4. Drawbacks of the earlier approaches The main challenge in FA terms lie in its extraction and building of a comprehensive FA terms dictionary.
The traditional methods ( Tsuji et al., 1999; Fuketa et al., 2000 ) relied on manual extraction of document corpus, but it caused misleading redundant words to be registered because the quality of the resulting FA terms depends on the static classified documents by hand. Therefore, Atlam et al. (2006) classified documents by using search engine to append FA term candidates to FA terms dictionary. Atlam X  X  method extracts FA terms automatically as follows: ( Step a ) Normalized term frequencies are determined for the whole documents. ( Step b )FA term scopes are determined by using normalized frequency information. ( Step c )FA terms are automatically appended in an existing FA terms dictionary.

Fig. 2 shows an example of document paragraphs denoted by p and p method ( Atlam et al., 2006 ). In ( Step a ), normalized term frequencies are determined for FA term candidates shown in Table 1 .In( Step b ), FA term scopes are determined by using Concentration ratio and static approach. These FA terms are appended dynamically to the existing FA terms dictionary in ( Step c ).
Table 1 shows an example for some extracted terms with their normalized frequencies by using the earlier method.
  X  X  trading  X  X  from the whole documents. These FA terms are appended to the existing dictionary as they have high normalized frequencies compared with the total number of extracted FA terms in the whole text. But are relevant and restricted to the field &lt;Baseball&gt;, but these FA terms were not extracted by the earlier approach because they have low frequency compared with the total number of extracted FA terms in the whole text.

Thus the earlier approach has two drawbacks: (I) Irrelevant selection of FA terms which are not restricted to the specific field. (II) Non-selection of FA terms which are restricted to the specific field.

Therefore, the next section describes a new approach to resolve these disadvantages of earlier method by using passage retrieval. 3. Improvement of FA terms extraction by using passage retrieval 3.1. Outline of the presented method
Fig. 3 shows the outline of the presented approach for retrieval documents. Atlam X  X  method extracted FA term candidates from a large collection of documents by using a WWW search engine. To retrieve document reference keywords for a www search engine. In the new approach, document paragraphs are retrieved by using passage technique. Normalized term frequencies are collected form that relevant document passages.
FA term scopes are determined by using Concentration ratio. New FA term candidates are appended to the dictionary of FA terms.

The advantage of the new approach is to extract more relevant FA terms as the passage retrieval substan-tially furnishes output better than using the whole documents. 3.2. Passage retrieval technique This section introduces Salton X  X  passage retrieval technique ( Salton et al., 1993 ).

Salton X  X  passage retrieval technique is capable of retrieving relevant texts with a high degree of accuracy in response of a user X  X  query. This technique extracts text paragraphs that are relevant to the user queries. Let Sim  X  d i d j  X  X  ficient between 0 and 1 that depend on the proportion and the weight of matching terms w document texts d i and d j .

In this paper, Salton X  X  method is defined as the following function SALTON( d ) that produces a set of pas-sages for the input query document d .

The function SALTON( d ): ( Step a ): Choose as an anchor d , or the text of a document known to be relevant to user X  X  information need. ( Step b ): Use this base document d as a query that displays the output documents in decreasing order of the ( Step c ): Consider the top 100 retrieved documents and discard any retrieved document that does not exhibit ( Step d ): Break up the remaining retrieved documents into text paragraphs and construct a term vector for ( Step e ): Discard any text paragraphs whose global query similarity with the query text is smaller than the ( Step f ): Of the remaining text paragraphs corresponding to a particular retrieved document, choose that text ( Step g ): Replace the whole document text on the output list by the corresponding text paragraphs. The out-
Fig. 4 shows an example of Slaton X  X  approach and how to replace the whole document text on the output list by the corresponding text paragraphs. The text of a typical query article ([195], Vaughn) is shown in
Fig. 4 a. This article consists of a single text paragraph. A typical article retrieved among the top 100 is [1350] entitled  X  X  X aughn joining Canseco X  X . The article consists of three paragraphs (labeled [1350.p], [1350.p 0 ], etc.). The text and vector similarities as well as the maximum sentence similarities between query and document paragraphs are shown in Fig. 4 b. In this case, two paragraphs have a higher global query similarity than the full documents (paragraph [1350.p] and [1350.p not contain any sentence with the required sentence similarity with the query. Hence, paragraphs p carded, and paragraph p is used for the retrieval purposes in this case. The text paragraph [1350.p], entitled,  X  X  X aughn and McGriff hit 144 homers last year X  X  is shown in Fig. 4 c. Fig. 4 shows that the retrieved text par-agraph [1350.p] is correspondingly closely related to the query article [195]. 3.3. Examples of new approach using Salton X  X  technique
The new approach in this paper combines Atlam X  X  and Salton X  X  methods by applying Atlam X  X  approach on the passages determined by Salton X  X  instead of using whole documents. For example, Fig. 2 shows a sample of extracted passage p from whole documents after using Salton X  X  technique. In the other side some irrelevant extracted from the whole documents. Moreover, after applying Atlam X  X  method on the extracted passage p pared with the total frequencies and these terms extracted as FA terms shown in Table 2 . Therefore, FA terms by the earlier approach.

Thus, the new approach can append more relevant FA terms to the existence dictionary built by the earlier method.
 Table 2 shows an example for some extracted FA terms with their frequencies by using passage technique.
From Table 2 we notice that some relevant FA terms are extracted by using the new technique which was not extracted by the earlier approach as they have low frequency. 3.4. The presented algorithm using passage techniques A new algorithm of appending FA terms automatically can be summarized as follows:
Method : ( Step 1 ): Determine a set of reference keywords REFKEY(&lt; F &gt;) (perfect FA terms) from the dictionary ( Step 2 ): For REFKEY(&lt; F &gt;), determine a set D of retrieved documents by using a WWW search Engine. ( Step 3 ): For each document d in D , determine a set P of relevant passages from the function SALTON( d ). ( Step 4 ): All relevant passages p in P are appended into the classified documents for &lt; F &gt;. (Step 5 ): Determine the extended dictionary FADIC by calling the algorithm FABUILD for the field tree with
Steps 2 and 3 determine a document d in D by using a WWW search engine. In this example, suppose that the sample described in Fig. 2 is a document d in D .In Step 4, supposed that passages for d in Fig. 4 are obtained by the function SALTON( d ). These passages become the new classified documents for &lt; F &gt;. The algorithm FABUILD called in Step5 can determine the following FA terms .
 (44)) as show in Table 2 . Calculate the Concentration ratio for these terms from Table 2 as follows:
Concentration  X   X  pitching  X  ;&lt; Baseball &gt;  X  X  43 47 Concentration  X   X  lineup  X  ;&lt; Baseball &gt;  X  X  39 42 0 : 928 &gt; a  X  X  0 : 90  X 
Concentration  X   X  home runs  X  ;&lt; Baseball &gt;  X  X  44 48 so, these terms are consider as FA terms in Field &lt;Baseball&gt;.
 if these FA terms are not registered.

In conclusion, by applying Atlam X  X  approach on the passages determined by passage techniques many rel-evant FA terms can be add to the earlier dictionary as shown in Table 2 . 4. The experimental evaluation 4.1. The experimental data
In the experimental evaluation, about 14.52MB document data have been collected by using Google search engine. This collection corpus contains 16,400 text files of 850 classified fields related to various topics as
Input : (a) A field &lt; F &gt;. Output : The extended FA term dictionary FADIC .
 from fields are used for the experimental evaluation. Concentration ratio is 0.5 X 0.9 to determine FA term candidates. 4.2. The accuracy evaluation Precision and Recall used to evaluate the new approach ( Salton &amp; McGill, 1983 ) is defined:
Suppose that x = Number of relevant FA terms extracted automatically by using the new approach, y = Total Number of FA terms extracted automatically by using the new approach, z = Total Number of relevant FA terms extracted manually.
 Therefore, 4.3. Experimental simulation results This section shows the effectiveness of using document passages for extracting FA terms .
Fig. 5 shows that the number of extracted FA terms increases using new approach leading to increase in relevant FA terms related to the field. Moreover, the number of extracted FA terms increases as concentration ratios decrease. When the concentration ratio is high, FA terms are extracted accurately, but when the ratio is low, FA terms are not accurately determined.

From Fig. 5 , it is clear that the number of relevant FA terms increases as the number of extracted FA terms increases too. Moreover, FA terms becomes accurate with the increases of the concentration ratio therefore concentration ratio 0.9 is the most effective.
 By the earlier approach, Table 3 shows the total number of FA terms dictionary with Perfect , Semi-perfect ,
Medium and Multiple FA terms are : 16,761 (44%). By the new approach, the total number of FA terms dic-tionary having same scopes are 25,869 (68%) from selected 38,372 FA term candidates.
 From Table 3 it clear that by using new approach about 9108 (24%) more FA terms are adding to the earlier FA term dictionary and around 12,503 (32%) irrelevant FA terms are deleted.

Fig. 6 shows that using Salton X  X  approach excludes many irrelevant candidates and P is about 13% higher than P using whole documents. Precision increases with the increases of the concentration ratio and Concen-tration ratio 0.9 is the most effective.

In the same manner, Fig. 7 shows R using Salton X  X  passage technique is about 4% higher than R using the whole documents, because many relevant FA terms are appended after using Salton X  X  passage technique.
In conclusion, the new approach using extract FA terms performing better in P and R than the earlier approach. 5. Conclusion in that document fields. An earlier approach has been created automatically FA terms dictionary from the whole documents including some irrelevant FA terms . This paper has described improvement of an earlier
FA terms dictionary by extracting FA terms using Salton X  X  passage technique rather than extracting them from the whole documents. The advantage of the new approach is discriminating more relevant FA terms as the passage retrieval techniques substantially furnish output better than the whole documents. The proposed approach has been evaluated for 38,372 articles from the large tagged corpus. According to experimental results, it turns out that by using the new approach about 24% more relevant FA terms are appending to the earlier FA term dictionary and around 32% irrelevant FA terms are deleted. Moreover, precision and recall are achieves 98% and 94% respectively by using new approach.

Future work could focus on document summarization based on the approach obtained from the proposed method and FA terms information could be applied.
