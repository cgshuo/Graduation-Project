 Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are devices that enable a subject to communicate without uti-lizing the peripheral nervous system, i.e., without any ove rt movement requiring volitional motor control. The primary goal of research on BCIs is to enable bas ic communication for subjects unable to communicate by normal means due to neuro-degenerative di seases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In non-invasive BCIs, this is usually appr oached by measuring the electric field of the brain by EEG, and detecting changes intentionally induc ed by the subject (cf. [1] for a general introduction to BCIs). The most commonly used experimental paradigm in this context is motor imagery (MI) [2]. In MI subjects are asked to haptically imag ine movements of certain limbs, e.g., the left or the right hand. MI is known to be accompanied by a de crease in bandpower (usually most prominent in the  X  -band, i.e., roughly at 8-13 Hz) in that part of the motor cort ex representing the specific limb [3]. These bandpower changes, termed event rel ated (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS), can be detected and subsequently used for inferring the subj ect X  X  intention. This approach to BCIs has been demonstrated to be very effective in healthy subjec ts, with only little subject training time required to achieve classification accuracies close to 100% in two-class paradigms [4 X 6]. Further-more, satisfactory classification results have been report ed with subjects in early to middle stages of ALS [7]. However, all subjects diagnosed with ALS and capa ble of operating a BCI still had residual motor control that enabled them to communicate wit hout the use of a BCI. Until now, no communication has been established with a completely locke d-in subject, i.e., a subject without any residual motor control. Establishing communication with a completely locked-in subject arguably constitutes the most important challenge in research on BCI s. Unfortunately, reasons for the failure of establishing com munication with completely locked-in sub-jects remain unknown. While cognitive deficits in completely locked-in patients can at present not be ruled out as the cause of this failure, another possible ex planation is abnormal brain activity ob-served in patients in late stages of ALS [8]. Our own observat ions indicate that intentionally induced bandpower changes in the electric field of the brain might be r educed in subjects in late stages of ALS. To explore the plausibility of this explanation for the failure of current BCIs in completely locked-in subjects, it is necessary to devise feature extra ction algorithms that do not rely on mea-sures of bandpower. In this context, one promising approach is to employ connectivity measures between different brain regions. It is well known from fMRI-studies that brain activity during MI is not confined to primary motor areas, but rather includes a dis tributed network including pre-motor, parietal and frontal regions of the brain [9]. Furthermore, synchronization between different brain regions is known to be an essential feature of cognitive proc essing in general [10]. Subsequently, it can be expected that different cognitive tasks, such as MI of different limbs, are associated with dif-ferent connectivity patterns between brain regions. These connectivity patterns should be detectable from EEG recordings, and thus offer a new type of feature spac e for inferring a subject X  X  intention. Since measures of connectivity are, at least in principle, i ndependent of bandpower changes, this might offer a new approach to establishing communication wi th completely locked-in subjects. In recent years, several measures of connectivity have been developed for analyzing EEG recordings (cf. [11] for a good introduction and a comparison of several algorithms). However, very few studies exist that analyze connectivity patterns as revealed by EEG during MI [12, 13]. Furthermore, these studies focus on differences in connectivity patterns betw een MI and motor execution, which is not of primary interest for research on BCIs. In the context of no n-invasive BCIs, connectivity measures have been most notably explored in [14] and [15]. However, th ese studies only consider frequency bands and small subsets of electrodes known to be relevant fo r bandpower features, and do not take into account possible volume conduction effects. This migh t lead to misinterpreting bandpower changes as changes in connectivity. Consequently, a better understanding of connectivity patterns during MI of different limbs as measured by EEG is required to guide the design of new feature extraction algorithms for BCIs. Specifically, it is importa nt to properly address possible volume conduction effects, not confine the analysis to a small subse t of electrodes, and consider a broad range of frequency bands.
 In this work, these issues are addressed by combining connec tivity analysis during MI of the left and right hand in four healthy subjects with Beamforming met hods [6]. Since it is well known that MI includes primary motor cortex [3], this area is chosen as t he starting point of the connectivity analysis. Spatial filters are designed that selectively ext ract those components of the EEG originating in the left and right motor cortex. Then, the concept of Trans fer Entropy [16] is used to estimate class-conditional  X  X nformation flow X  from all 128 employed recording sites into the left and right obtained for each frequency band that depict by how much each area of the brain is influencing the left/right motor cortex during MI of the left/right hand. In terestingly, the most pronounced changes in connectivity patterns are not observed in MI of the left vs . the right hand, but rather in rest vs. MI of either hand. Furthermore, these pattern changes are most pronounced in frequency bands not usually associated with MI. i.e., in the  X  -band above 35 Hz. These results suggest that in order to fully exploit the capabilities of connectivity measures for BCIs, and establish communication with completely locked-in subjects, it might be advisable t o consider  X  -band oscillations and adapt experimental paradigms as to maximally vary cognitive dema nds between conditions. 2.1 Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Connectivity Analysis In analyzing interrelations between time-series data it is important to distinguish symmetric from asymmetric measures. Consider Fig. 1, depicting two graphs of three random processes s representing three EEG sources. The goal of symmetric conne ctivity analysis (Fig. 1.a) is to esti-mate some instantaneous measure of similarity between rand om processes, i.e., assigning weights to the undirected edges between the nodes of the graph in Fig. 1.a. Amplitude coupling and phase synchronization fall into this category, which are the meas ures employed in [14] and [15] for feature extraction in BCIs. However, interrelations between EEG so urces originating in different regions of Figure 1: Illustration of symmetric-vs. asymmetric connec tivity analysis for three EEG sources within the brain. the brain can be expected to be asymmetric, with certain brai n regions exerting stronger influence on other regions than vice versa. For this reason, asymmetric c onnectivity measures potentially provide more information on cognitive processes than symmetric mea sures.
 Considering asymmetric relations between random processe s requires a definition of how the influ-ence of one process on another process is to be measured, i.e. , a quantitative definition of causal influence. The commonly adopted definition of causality in ti me-series analysis is that s s if observing s s . This implies that cause precedes effect, i.e., that the gra ph in Fig. 1.b may only contain directed arrows pointing forward in time. Note that there is some ambi guity in this definition of causality, since it does not specify a metric for reduction of the predic tion error of s Granger causality (cf. [11]), reduction of the variance of t he prediction error is chosen as a metric, essentially limiting Granger causality to linear systems. It should be noted, however, that any other metric is equally valid. Finally, note that for reasons of si mplicity the graph in Fig. 1.b only contains directed edges from nodes at time t to nodes at time t + 1 . In general, directed arrows from nodes at times t, . . . , t  X  k to nodes at time t +1 may be considered, with k the order of the random processes generating s [ t + 1] .
 To assess Granger causality between bivariate time-series data a linear autoregressive model is fit to the data, which is then used to compute a 2x2 transfer matrix i n the frequency domain (cf. [11]). The off-diagonal elements of the transfer matrix then provide a measure of the asymmetric interaction between the observed time-series. Extensions of Granger ca usality to multivariate time-series data, termed directed transfer function (DTF) and partial direct ed coherence (PDC), have been developed (cf. [11] and the references therein). However, in this work a related but different measure for asym-metric interrelations between time-series is utilized. Th e concept of Transfer Entropy (TE) [16] de-fines the causal influence of s precisely, let s TE is then defined as with k the order of the random processes and H (  X  ) the Shannon entropy. TE can thus be understood as the reduction in uncertainty about the random process s k samples of the random process s as a reduction in the uncertainty of a process due to observin g another process, but employ different metrics to measure reduction in uncertainty. While TE is a mea sure that applies to any type of random processes, it is difficult to compute in practice. Hen ce, in this study only Gaussian processes are considered, i.e., it is assumed that s then be computed as with R to Granger causality and related measures, TE for Gaussian p rocesses possesses several advantages. It is easy to compute from a numerical perspective, since it d oes not require fitting a multivariate autoregressive model including (implicit) inversion of la rge matrices. Furthermore, for continuous processes it is invariant under coordinate transformation s [17]. Importantly, this entails invariance with regard to scaling of the random processes.
 Computing TE for Gaussian processes requires estimation of the (cross-)covariance matrices sources during an experimental paradigm with N trials of T samples each. In order to compute T k ( s 1 [ t ]  X  s 2 [ t + 1]) s cesses that give rise to the observation matrix S are identical for each of the N repetitions of the experimental paradigm. For each instant in time, TE can then be evaluated by computing the sample (cross-)covariance matrices required in (2) across trials . Note that evaluating (2) requires specifica-tion of k . In general, k should be chosen as large as possible in order to maximize inf ormation on the random processes contained in the (cross-)covariance m atrices. However, choosing k too large leads to rank deficient matrices with a determinant of zero. H ere, for each observation matrix S the highest possible k is chosen such that none of the matrices in (2) is rank deficien t. 2.2 The Problem of Volume Conduction in EEG Connectivity Ana lysis The goal of connectivity analysis in EEG recordings is to est imate connectivity patterns between different regions of the brain. Unfortunately, EEG recordi ngs do not offer direct access to EEG sources. Instead, each EEG electrode measures a linear and i nstantaneous superposition of EEG sources within the brain [18]. This poses a problem for symme tric connectivity measures, since these assess instantaneous coupling between electrodes [1 8]. Asymmetric connectivity measures such as TE, on the other hand, are not based on instantaneous c oupling, but rather consider prediction errors. It is not obvious that instantaneous volume conduct ion also poses a problem for this type of measures. Unfortunately, the following example demonstra tes that volume conduction also leads to incorrect connectivity estimates in asymmetric connectiv ity analysis based on TE.
 Example 1 (Volume Conduction Effects in Connectivity Analy sis based on Transfer Entropy) Consider the EEG signals x consist of a linear superposition of three EEG sources s brain (Fig. 2.a). Let x [ t ] = ( x simplicity, assume that A = (1 0 1 ; 0 1 1 ) , i.e., that the first source only projects to the first strength, and the third source projects to both electrodes w ith unit strength. Furthermore, assume that i.e., that all sources have zero mean, unit variance, are mut ually independent, and s uncorrelated in time. Only s (Fig. 2.b). In this setting, it would be desirable to obtain z ero TE between both electrodes, since there is no interaction between the sources giving rise to th e EEG. However, some rather tedious algebraic manipulations reveal that in this case Note that (4) is zero if and only if  X  = 0 , i.e., if s the two electrodes is estimated to be greater than zero solel y due to volume conduction effects from source s projection of the third source to both electrodes. 2.3 Attenuation of Volume Conduction Effects via Beamformi ng localization on the obtained EEG data, and apply connectivi ty measures on estimated current density to evaluate whether there exists a causal link between two sp ecific points within the brain. However, testing pairwise causal links between more than just a few po ints within the brain is computationally intractable. Accordingly, attenuation of volume conducti on effects via source localization is not feasible if a complete connectivity pattern considering th e whole brain is desired. Here, a different approach is pursued. It is well known that primary motor cort ex is central to MI as measured by EEG [3]. Accordingly, it is assumed that any brain region inv olved in MI displays some connectivity to the primary motor cortex. This (admittedly rather strong ) assumption enables a complete analysis of the connectivity patterns during MI covering the whole br ain in the following way. First, two spatial filters, commonly known as Beamformers, are designe d that selectively extract EEG sources originating within the right and left motor cortex, respect ively [6]. In brief, this can be accomplished by solving the optimization problem with R spatial filters can be obtained that optimally attenuate the variance of all EEG sources not originating within the left/right motor cortex. The desired spatial filt ers are obtained as the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue probl em R detailed presentation).
 With EEG sources originating within the left and right motor cortex extracted, TE from all EEG electrodes into the left and right motor cortex can be comput ed. In this way, volume conduction effects from all sources within the brain into the left/righ t motor cortex can be optimally attenuated. However, volume conduction effects from the left/right mot or cortex to any of the EEG electrodes still poses a problem. Accordingly, it has to be verified if an y positive TE from an EEG electrode into the left/right motor cortex could be caused by bandpowe r changes within the left/right motor cortex. Positive TE from any electrode into the left/right m otor cortex can only be considered as a genuine causal link if it is not accompanied by a bandpower ch ange in the respective motor cortex. To investigate connectivity patterns during MI the followi ng experimental paradigm was employed. Subjects sat in a dimly lit and shielded room, approximately two meters in front of a silver screen. Each trial started with a centrally displayed fixation cross . After three seconds, the fixation cross was overlaid with a centrally placed arrow pointing to the left o r right. This instructed subjects to begin MI of the left or right hand, respectively. Subjects were exp licitly instructed to perform haptic MI, but the exact choice of the type of imaginary hand movement wa s left unspecified. After a further seven seconds the arrow was removed, indicating the end of th e trial and start of the next trial. 150 trials per class were carried out by each subjects in randomi zed order. During the experiment, EEG was recorded at 128 electrodes placed according to the exten ded 10-20 system with electrode Cz as reference. EEG data was re-referenced to common average ref erence offline. Four healthy subjects participated in the experiment, all of which were male and ri ght handed with an age of 27  X  2 . 5 years. For each subject, electrode locations were recorded with an ultrasound tracking system. No artifact correction was employed and no trials were rejecte d.
 For each subject, model-based covariance matrices R cortex were computed as described in [6]. The EEG covariance matrix R subject using all available data, and the two desired Beamfo rmers, extracting EEG sources from the left and right motor cortex, were computed by solving (5). Th e EEG sources extracted from the left/right motor cortex as well as the unfiltered data record ed at each electrode were then bandpass-filtered with sixth-order Butterworth filters in five frequen cy bands ranging from 5 to 55 Hz in steps of 10 Hz. Then, TE was computed from all EEG electrodes into th e left/right motor cortex at each sample point as described in Section 2.1. Furthermore, for e ach subject class-conditional bandpower changes (ERD/ERS) of sources extracted from the left/right motor cortex were computed in order to identify frequency bands with common modulations in band power and TE. Two subjects showed significant modulations of bandpower in all five frequency ba nds. These were excluded from further analysis, since any observed positive TEs could have been co nfounded by volume conduction. The resulting topographies of mean TE between conditions of the two remaining subjects are shown in Fig. 3. Here, the first two columns show mean TE from all elec trodes into the left/right motor cortex during MI of either hand (3.5-10s) minus mean TE durin g baseline (0.5-3s) in each of the five frequency bands. The last two columns show mean differen ces in TE into the left/right motor cortex between MI of the left and right hand (both conditions also baseline corrected). Note that the topographies in Fig. 3 have been normalized to the maximu m difference across conditions to emphasize differences between conditions. Interestingly , no distinct differences in TE are observed between MI of the left and right hand. Instead, strongest dif ferences in TE are observed in rest rest increases with higher frequencies, and is most pronoun ced in the  X  -band from 45-55 Hz (last row, left two columns). Topographically, strongest differ ences are observed in frontal, pre-central, and post-central areas. Observed changes in TE are statisti cally significant with significance level  X  = 0 . 01 at all electrodes in Fig. 3 marked with red crosses (statisti cal significance was tested non-parametrically and individually for each subject, Beamfor mer, and condition by one thousand times randomly permuting the EEG data of each recorded trial in tim e and testing the null-hypothesis that changes in TE at least as large as those in Fig.3 are observed w ithout any temporal structure being present in the data). Due to computational resources only a s mall subset of electrodes was tested for significance. The observed changes in TE display opposit e modulations in comparison to mean bandpower changes observed in left/right motor cortex rela tive to baseline (Fig. 4, only significant (  X  = 0 . 01 ) bandpower changes relative to baseline (0-3s) plotted). H ere, strongest modulation of bandpower is found in the  X  -(  X  10 Hz) and  X  -band (  X  25 Hz). Frequencies above 35 Hz show very little modulation, indicating that the observed differenc es in TE at high frequencies in Fig. 3 are not due to volume conduction but genuine causal links. In this study, Beamforming and TE were employed to investiga te the topographies of  X  X nforma-tion flow X  into the left and right motor cortex during MI as mea sured by EEG. To the best of the author X  X  knowledge, this is the first study investigating as ymmetric connectivity patterns between brain regions during MI of different limbs considering a bro ad frequency range, a large number of recordings sites, and properly taking into account volume c onduction effects. However, it should be pointed out that there are several issues that warrant fur ther investigation. First, the presented results are obtained from only two subjects, since two subje cts had to be excluded due to possible volume conduction effects. Future studies with more subjec ts are required to validate the obtained results. Also, no outflow from primary motor cortex and no TE b etween brain regions not including primary motor cortex have been considered. Finally, the met hodology presented in this study can not be applied in a straight-forward manner to single-trial data, and is thus only of limited use for actual feature extraction in BCIs.
 Never the less, the obtained results indicate that bandpowe r changes in motor cortex and connectiv-ity between motor cortex and other regions of the brain are pr ocesses that occupy distinct spectral bands and are modulated by different cognitive tasks. In con junction with the observation of no distinct changes in connectivity patterns between MI of dif ferent limbs, this indicates that in [14] and [15] bandpower changes might have been misinterpreted a s connectivity changes. This is further supported by the fact that these studies focused on frequenc y bands displaying significant modula-tion of bandpower (8-30 Hz) and did not control for volume con duction effects. In conclusion, the pronounced modulation of connectivity between MI of either hand vs. rest in the  X  -band observed in this study underlines the importance of also considering hi gh frequency bands in EEG connectivity analysis. Furthermore, since the  X  -band is thought to be crucial for dynamic functional connec tivity between brain regions [10], future studies on connectivity patterns in BCIs should consider exper-imental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands in order to activate different networks within the brain across conditions.
