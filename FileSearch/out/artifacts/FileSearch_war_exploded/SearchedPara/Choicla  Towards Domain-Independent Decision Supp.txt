 Group recommendation technologies have been successfully applied in domains such as interactive television, music, and tourist destinations. Existing technologies are focusing on specific domains and do not offer the possibility of support-ing different kinds of decision scenarios. The Choicla group decision support environment advances the state of the art by supporting decision scenarios in a domain-independent fashion. In this paper we give an overview of the Choicla environment and report the results of a first user study which focused on system usability.

Decisions in everyday life often come up in groups, for ex-ample, a decision about the destination for the next holidays or a decision about which restaurant to choose for a dinner. The quality of a group decision can be negatively influenced by various factors. For example, knowledge about the pref-erences of other users in early phases of a decision process can lead to sub-optimal decision outcomes [9]. Anchoring effects [5] cause decisions which are biased by the voting of the first preference-articulating person. Furthermore, the non-inclusion of explanations can lead a lower level of trust in recommendations [2]. The outcome of a decision can also be influenced by the fact that single persons have to take a decision in place of persons who are not available for a meeting. In many cases, decision processes are not open in the sense that it is impossible to easily integrate new deci-sion alternatives or change the individual preferences within the scope of a decision process -both aspects can lead to low-quality decision outcomes [10]. Finally, after taking a decision, the criteria for the decision often remain unclear since there is no explanation of the outcome.
 There exist a couple of online tools which support different types of decision scenarios. Dotmocracy 1 is a method for collecting and visualizing the preferences of a large group of users. It is related to the idea of participatory decision mak-ing  X  it X  X  major outcome is a graph type visualization of the group-immanent preferences. Doodle 2 focuses on the aspect of coordinating appointments. Similarly, VERN [14] is a tool that supports the identification of meeting times based on the idea of unconstrained democracy where individuals are enabled to freely propose alternative dates themselves. Compared to Choicla 3 these tools are not able to customize their decision processes depending on the application do-main and are also focused on specific tasks. Furthermore, no concepts are provided which help to improve the overall quality of group decisions, for example, in terms of integrat-ing explanations, recommendations for groups, and consis-tency management for user preferences.
 One major goal of the Choicla environment is to facilitate group decision making and improve the overall quality of de-cision outcomes. The idea of this environment is to support definitions of different types of decision tasks in a domain-independent fashion while taking into account the above mentioned risk factors. In order to achieve this goal, Choicla builds upon group recommendation algorithms [8] which are used for determining alternative solutions for the partici-pants of a group decision process. A typical scenario for the application of Choicla technologies is the decision about which restaurant to select for a dinner or -in a scientific com-munity -a decision regarding the selection of the destination of next year X  X  conference. Other objectives of Choicla are (1) to increase fairness within long term decisions and (2) to support decisions related to complex products or services. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide insights to (1) the Choicla modelling process where participants can design decision tasks from scratch and (2) the intelligent management of already cre-dotmocracy.org. doodle.com. www.choicla.com. ated decision apps. In the Section 3 we report the results of a first empirical study conducted with the goal of estimating the current status of Choicla in terms of usability. We then discuss future work (Section 4) and thereafter conclude the paper (Section 5).
Because decision scenarios differ, a variety of parameters is needed to specify all relevant properties of a decision task. We will now discuss basic parameters (features) which can be configured (modelled) by the creator of a decision task. In this context we refer to the example features depicted in Figure 1.
Decision scenarios can differ from each other in terms of their process design. Some decision scenarios rely on a pres-elected decision heuristic that defines the criteria for taking the decision, for example, a group decides to use majority voting for deciding about the next restaurant visit. The design of decision tasks (the underlying process) can be in-terpreted as a configuration problem (see [12]). The major advantage of this approach is that making the process de-sign of decision tasks configurable introduces the flexibility that is needed due to the heterogeneity of decision problems. This way we are able to build a software product line that is flexible with regard to the implementation (generation) of problem-specific decision applications.
 Management of Decision Alternatives. There are dif-ferent possibilities to support the management of decision alternatives within the scope of a decision task. First , only the creator of a decision task is allowed to add alternatives  X  this could be the case if a person is interested to know the opinions of his/her friends about a certain set of al-ternatives (e.g., alternative candidates for the next family car). Another related scenario are so-called  X  X icro-Polls X  where the creator is only interested in knowing the prefer-ence distribution of a larger group of users. Second , in some scenarios it should be possible that all decision makers can add alternatives  X  a typical example of such a scenario is the group-based decision regarding a holiday destination or a hotel [6]. In this context, each user should be allowed to add relevant alternatives. An example scenario of the third case (only external users can add alternatives) is the sup-port of group-based personnel decisions  X  in this context it should be possible that persons apply for a certain position (the application itself is interpreted as the addition of a new alternative to the decision task). Another related example is the selection of the next conference location where pro-posers submit their material.
 Preference Visibility. The visibility of individual prefer-ences of the other participants involved in a decision pro-cess can have an impact on decision quality (see [3] and [6]). There exist decision scenarios where all participants should exactly know who entered a rating. If, for exam-ple, a date for a business meeting is the decision task it is essential to find a date where all managers can attend the meeting and therefore it is important to know the individual preferences of the participants in that case. But there are decision scenarios where full preference visibility can lead to disadvantages for some participants but some kind of trans-parency of the preferences is helpful to achieve a reasonable decision. In such cases a summary of all given preferences regarding an alternative is a way to support decision makers (participants). A summary prevents all participants from statistical inferences but still can help participants who are unsure about which rating to select.
 Explanations. Explanations can play an important role in decision tasks since they are able to increase the trust of users in the outcome of a decision process [2]. When design-ing a decision task in Choicla , explanations can be selected as a feature of the decision process. In the current version of Choicla , explanations are supported by simply allowing the creator of the decision process to include textual argu-mentations as to why a certain decision alternative has been selected as  X  X he final decision X .
 Recommendation Support. In the context of group de-cision tasks an essential aspect is the aggregation function (recommendation heuristic). Aggregation functions can help to foster consensus in a group decision process. Furthermore, user studies show that these functions also help to increase the degree of the perceived decision quality (see, for exam-ple [3]). Preferences of individual users can be aggregated in many different ways and there exists no standard heuristic which fits for every decision scenario. To support groups of users in different scenarios, the selection of recommendation heuristics is a necessary feature which has to be configured by the creator of a decision task. Due to space limitations we only describe selected aggregation heuristics below. For an overview of basic aggregation heuristics, such as Major-ity Vote (MAJ) , Average Vote (AVV) , Least Misery (LMIS) , and Most Pleasure (MPLS) which are also already available in the Choicla environment we refer to Masthoff [8]. Group Distance (GD) (see Formula 1) returns the value d as group recommendation which causes the lowest overall change of the individual user preferences. For example, the GD d value for s = North &amp; South (see Table 1) in Dec. Sit. 1 4 is 5 (or, alternatively 4).
 An example of a meta-aggregation function included in Choi-cla is Ensemble Voting. Ensemble Voting (see Formula 2) determines the majority of the results of the individual vot-ing strategies H = { MAJ, AVV, LMIS, MPLS, GD } . For example, the ensemble-based majority voting for North &amp; South in Dec. Sit. 1 is 5.
 To achieve fairness among all group members in long term scenarios (e.g., recurring decision tasks), we developed a modified version of the Group Distance algorithm (see For-mula 4), where all past decisions influence the actual rec-ommendation. A user-weighting w ( u ) is used to ensure that users whose individual ratings often differ from related de-cisions (represented by distance ( u )), are privileged.
Dec. Sit. n denotes a specific decision situation in recur-ring decision tasks. Dec.
 Sit. 1 Dec.
 Sit. 2 Dec.
 Sit. 3 Table 1: User-specific ratings with regard to the available decision alternatives (restaurants) in re-curring decision situations. The group recom-mendation is marked bold in the corresponding decision situation.
 If we look at the example in Table 1 we notice that in Dec. Sit. 3 the group recommendation is Trattoria although the individual aggregation heuristics [8] would calculate a dif-ferent group recommendation. Dec. Sit. 1 and 2 are re-sponsible for a user-weighting in Dec. Sit. 3 which leads to this recommendation. The used weights of the participants calculated by Formula 3 in Dec. Sit. 3 are the following: Martin: 1, Dave: 6, George: 2, and Ben: 3. Dave has the highest weight in Dec. Sit. 3 . This approach allows to achieve fairness among the group members in long term deci-sions -further related aspects will be discussed in Section 4.
After the creation process has been finished the creator of the decision task sees a corresponding decision app di-rectly on his home screen. Such an app also shows up on the home screen of the invited participants after an invita-tion has been accepted by a user. There is a tab DecisionApp Store where publicly available decision apps can be searched and installed on the personal Home Screen . With this, fre-quent decision tasks such as scheduling decision tasks do not have to be created from scratch every time. The de-cision process can be triggered right after the download of a decision app. The mentioned reuse has the potential to reduce the entry barrier for using Choicla and to make the interaction straightforward  X  especially for people who want to start a decision process quickly. Another tab Create De-cisionApp allows a user to design a completely new decision app from scratch.
 Due to the fact that many decision tasks occur regularly  X  for example, a group of friends watches a movie in the cinema once a month  X  a concept is needed to manage a potentially large number of decision tasks. To keep the decision tasks manageable, every decision app consists of a variable num-ber of instances. This mechanism offers the possibility of an exact documentation of all past decisions and is also a basis for supporting recurring decision tasks -related aspects will be discussed in Section 4.

In order to evaluate the Choicla group decision environ-ment, we conducted a first small-scale user study. In this study we made the software accessible to ten persons out-side our university who were not aware of the fact that the system has been developed at our university. Each of these participants defined a decision task with the support of the Choicla environment and then made accessible the decision task to a group of other persons. The average number of persons participating in a decision scenario was around 5. The overall number of users who interacted with Choicla within the scope of our study was N=48 (38% female, 62% male). Within the scope this empirical study we could gain a first evidence that users consider the current version of the system applicable and can imagine to apply Choicla func-tionalities in various domains. For an in-depth discussion of this user study we refer to [13].
Our future work will focus on the analysis of further ap-plication domains for the Choicla technologies. Our vision is to make the design (implementation) of group decision tasks as simple as possible. The resulting decision task should be easy to handle for users and make group decisions in gen-eral more efficient. We will also focus on the analysis of decision phenomena within the scope of group decision pro-cesses. Phenomena such as decoy effects [4] and anchoring effects [5] are well known for single-user cases but are not investigated in group-based decision scenarios.
 In scenarios where all possible decision alternatives are not available from the beginning the possibility of adding new decision alternatives is imperative, but can also induce bi-ases. The assimilating effect describes the fact that individ-uals are motivated to reduce psychological incongruity or discrepancy that is very likely to arise if new information is added to a present perception [11]. As discussed in [7] this effect is intensified if there is a high group cohesion, because the fear of exclusion from the group is higher. To reduce this effect, a special way of preference visibility can be included in future versions of Choicla . Such a mechanism could, for example, provide only insights to the preferences of other users for those participants who completed the individual rating of alternatives. A research question in this context is if such mechanisms can increase the willingness of partici-pants to articulate their real preferences.
 Another research direction is the support of long term de-cisions [1] (see Section 2). Fairness is an important issue in this context -the degree of perceived fairness influences the willingness of group members to accept compromises in the resolution of conflicts of opinions and also their trust in other group members [7].
 The investigation in which way recommendations need to be structured to achieve consensus more quickly within a group of users is another issue for future work. In this context we will also focus on the development of further group recom-mendation heuristics to achieve a high level of fairness. Finally, one of our major goals is also to make the Choicla datasets available to the research community in an ano-nymized fashion for experimentation purposes.
In this paper we gave a short introduction to Choicla which supports the flexible design and execution of differ-ent types of group decision tasks. Compared to existing group decision support approaches, Choicla provides an end user modelling environment which supports an easy devel-opment and execution of group decision tasks. We also dis-cussed further research directions which can help to extend the available functionality of the Choicla environment. [1] D. Ariely and D. Zakay. A timely account of the role [2] A.
