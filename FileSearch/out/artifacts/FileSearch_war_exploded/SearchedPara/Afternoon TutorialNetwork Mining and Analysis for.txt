 The recent blossom of social network and communication services in both public and corporate settings have generat-ed a staggering amount of network data of all kinds. Unlike the bio-networks and the chemical compound graph data of-ten used in traditional network mining and analysis, the new network data grown out of the social applications are charac-terized by their rich attributes, high heterogeneity, enormous sizes and complex patterns of various semantic meanings, al-l of which have posed significant research challenges to the graph/network mining community. In this tutorial, we aim to examine some recent advances in network mining and analysis for social applications, covering a diverse collection of methodologies and applications from the perspectives of event, relationship, collaboration, and network pattern . We would present the problem settings, the challenges, the re-cent research advances and some future directions for each perspective. Topics include but are not limited to correla-tion mining, iceberg finding, anomaly detection, relationship discovery, information flow, task routing, and pattern min-ing.
 This tutorial will be self-contained and is accessible to all data mining researchers, students and practitioners who are interested in network mining and analysis.
 No special prerequisite knowledge is needed to attend this tutorial.
