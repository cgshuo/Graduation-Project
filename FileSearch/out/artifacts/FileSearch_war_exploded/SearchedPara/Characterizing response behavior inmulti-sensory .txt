 A natural scene contains several multi-modal sensory cues t o the true underlying values of its physical properties. There is substantial evidence tha t the brain deals with the sensory information from multiple modalities simultaneously, to f orm a coherent and unified percept of the world and to guide action. A major focus of multi-senso ry perceptual studies has been in exploring the synergistic as well as modulatory interact ions between individual sensory cues. The perceptual consequences of these interactions ca n be effectively explored in cases where the cues are in conflict with each other, resulting in po tentially illusory percepts such as the  X  X entriloquism effect X  [1].
 A well-tested hypothesis with regards to multi-sensory cue interaction is that the individual sensory estimates are combined in a linear fashion, weighte d by their relative reliabilities. Most studies that expound this linear approach assume that s ensory noise in the different modalities are independent of each other, and that the senso ry likelihoods can be well ap-proximated by Gaussian distributions. Under these assumpt ions, the maximum-likelihood estimator of the underlying physical variable is an affine co mbination of the sensory esti-mates weighted in proportion to their precisions. This line ar model predicts that the vari-ance of the posterior distribution is always lower than that of individual cues. However, data from several psychophysical studies contradict this p rediction, necessitating non-linear computational strategies to deal with the inputs.
 Recent studies [2; 3; 4; 5] have proposed a particular form of mixture model to address response behavior in situations with a large conflict betwee n sensory stimuli. Conflicts arise when corresponding cues suggest very different estim ates of an underlying variable. The basic intuition behind these models is that large stimul us disparities might be a conse-quence of the stimuli having resulted from multiple underly ing causal factors. We evaluate the different formulations in their ability to model experi mental data [6] that exhibit very interesting non-linear response behavior under conflictin g stimulus conditions. The formu-lations differ in how perceptual estimates are derived from sensory data. We demonstrate some inadequacies of the current models and propose an alter native formulation that em-ploys heavy-tailed sensory likelihoods. The proposed mode l not only achieves better fits to non-linear response behavior in the experimental data but a lso makes several quantitatively testable predictions. In this section, we present an overview of a recently propose d mixture model approach [3] to dealing with conflicting sensory inputs. We describe two a pproaches to inference under this model X  causal averaging and causal selection X  and anal yze the model predictions on our simulation of an auditory localization task [6].
 The environmental variables of interest are the spatial loc ations of an auditory and visual stimulus, denoted by s a and s v respectively. Information about the stimuli is provided by noisy sensory cues x a and x v . The model evaluates sensory cues under two discrete hypoth e-ses ( C = { 1 , 2 } ) regarding the causal structure underlying the generation of the stimuli. The hypotheses are that the two stimuli could arise from the same ( C = 1 ) or different ( C = 2 ) causal events. This mixture model instantiates a simple ide a: if there is a common cause, cues are combined; otherwise they are segregated. The model is characterized by (i) the stimulus positions and (iii) the prior over hypotheses P ( C ) . 2.1 Generating sensory data The standard model assumes Gaussian sensory likelihoods an d prior distributions. The true auditory and visual stimulus positions are assumed to b e the same for C = 1 , i.e., s a = s v = s drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution: s  X  X  (0 ,  X  2 p ) where  X  p is standard deviation of the distribution. The noisy sensor y evidence x a is a sample from a Similarly for the visual evidence: x v  X  X  ( x v ; s v = s,  X  2 v ) .
 When there are C = 2 underlying causes, they are drawn independently from the ze ro-mean x posterior distribution: When the hypotheses are discrete C = { 1 , 2 } , the normalization constant P ( x v , x a ) = P ( x v , x a | C = 1) P ( C = 1) + P ( x v , x a | C = 2)(1  X  P ( C = 1)) .
 Given this particular causal generative model, the conditi onal likelihoods in Equation 1 are R as: P ( x v , x a | s v , s a , C ) = P ( x v | s v ) P ( x a | s a ) . 2.2 Inference methods 2.2.1 Causal averaging The conditional posterior over stimulus variables is calcu lated for each hypothesis as over both hypotheses weighted by the posterior distributio n over C (Equation 1). Such a model averaging approach to causal inference is specified by the following id entity: Here, P ( C = 1 | x v , x a ) =  X  c is the posterior mixing proportion and (1  X   X  c ) = P ( C = 2 | x v , x a ) . 2.2.2 Causal selection An alternative approach is to calculate an approximate post erior distribution by first select-ing the hypothesis C  X  that maximizes the posterior distribution P ( C | x v , x a ) . Under this model selection approach, subsequent inference is based on the selected hyp othesis alone. Then the posterior distribution over stimulus location is a pproximated as follows: 2.3 Evaluating the models on experimental data Here, we evaluate the causal averaging and selection models on an auditory localization task [6] where visual and auditory stimuli were presented at varying spatial and temporal disparities. In addition to reporting the location of the au ditory target, subjects were also asked to report on whether they perceived the two stimuli to b e perceptually unified. The variables examined were the bias and variance of the subject s X  estimates for each stimulus condition. The data exhibit very interesting non-linear re sponse behavior (solid lines in Figures 1A and 1D).
 or right of fixation. Although the real experiment varied the fixation location from trial to trial, it was found to have no effect on subsequent analyses a nd data were collapsed across all fixation locations. Hence, we assume the fixation point to be at the center of space ( 0  X  ). The visual stimuli were assumed to be temporally coincide nt with the auditory stimuli Sensory evidence x a and x v were corrupted by Gaussian noise as described earlier. Each stimulus combination { s a , s v } was presented with equal probability 2000 times. The spatial axis ranged from  X  25  X  to 25  X  and was divided into 1  X  width bins. On each trial, the model computes a posterior probability distribution over s timulus locations conditioned on the noisy cues x a and x v according to one of Equations 3 or 6. It then estimates visual and auditory locations  X  s a and  X  s v as the peak of the posterior distribution (maximum aposteriori estimate):  X  s a = argmax s We have simulated estimators using other criteria, such as m inimizing the squared error of the estimates (i.e, expected value of the posterior distr ibution). The results were very similar using the different estimators. Percent bias is giv en by:  X  s a  X  s a s was computed using squared error loss to quantify the amount by which model estimates differed from the behavioral data. For analysis, the trials were dichotomized into unity and non-unity trials based on the perception of spatial unity. A trial was classified as unity if the posterior probability P ( C = 1 | x v , x a ) was greater than some threshold  X  and non-unity otherwise.
 The simulation results (i.e., the estimates  X  s a and  X  s v ) were averaged across trials in each category. The parameters of the model are: 1) the stimulus lo cation variance  X  2 p , 2 X 3) the observation variances  X  2 a and  X  2 v , 4) the prior mixture proportion  X  = P ( C =1) , and 5) the unity perception threshold  X  . The parameter values were estimated to fit the experimental data and are provided in the figure captions. 2.4 Simulation results for the Gaussian model Figure 1 presents predictions made by both the theoretical m odels. The behavioral data [6] (solid lines in all plots) range from spatial disparitie s  X  15  X  to 15  X  ; error bars represent standard errors across 5 subjects. Model predictions (dash ed lines) extend to a wider range of  X  25  X  to 25  X  . Some of the predicted trends are similar to the behavioral d ata. Regard-less of stimulus disparity, whenever visual and auditory st imuli were perceived as unity, the predicted response bias was very high (dashed gray; Figu re 1A). This means that the auditory location was perceived to be very near to the visual stimulus. When the stimuli appeared to not be unified, the auditory location was biased a way from the visual stimu-lus  X  increasingly so as disparity decreased (dashed black; Figure 1A). Figure 1: Simulation results -Gaussian sensory likelihoods: In this, and all subsequent figures, However, both the models exhibit one or more significant diff erences from the experimen-tal observations. The predicted curves for unity trials (da shed gray; Figures 1B,C) are all concave, whereas they were actually observed to be convex (s olid gray lines). On non-unity trials too, the predicted response variabilities (dashed b lack lines) are an inadequate fit to the real data (solid black lines).
 An additional test for the appropriateness of the models is t he predictions they make with regards to the distribution of localisation errors. An anal ysis of the behavioral data de-rived from the spatially coincident stimulus conditions ( s v  X  s a = 0 ) revealed a distinct pattern (Figure 1D). On unity trials, localization error wa s 0  X  implying that the responses were clustered around the auditory target. On non-unity tri als, the errors were bi-modally distributed and failed the test for normality [6]. Causal se lection predicts a qualitatively similar distribution of errors (Figure 1F), suggesting tha t it may be the most appropriate inference strategy under the given task and model assumptio ns. 3.1 Heavy-tailed likelihood formulation of Gaussian and uniform distributions. This mixture create s a likelihood function with heavy tails. 3.2 Simulation results with heavy-tailed sensory likeliho ods Figure 2 presents predictions made by the theoretical model s based on heavy-tailed likeli-hoods. Both models now provide a much better fit to bias and var iance, compared to their Figure 2: Simulation results -heavy-tailed likelihoods: (A) Localization biases in the data, plotted Gaussian counterparts. The heavy-tailed causal averaging model (Figure 2B) makes rea-sonable predictions with regards to variability. However, both the amount and the trend of predicted biases for non-unity trials (dotted line; 2A) do n ot match observations. Here too, the best-fitting model is causal selection (dashed line; Figures 2A,C). The localiza-tion error distribution (Figure 2F) very closely matches th e true observations (Figure 2D) in how the unity responses are uni-modally distributed about t he target location s a , and non-unity responses are bi-modally distributed either side of t he target. Visually, this is a better prediction of the true distribution of errors, compared to t he prediction made by the Gaus-sian causal selection model (Figure 1F); we are unable to mak e a quantitative comparison for want of access to the raw data.
 Compared with the results in Figure 1, our models make very di fferent bias and variance predictions for spatial disparities not tested. This is dis cussed in detail in Section 4. The heavy-tailed likelihood model has two more free parameters ( r p and mixing proportion  X  ; Equation 7) than the Gaussian, which is essentially a subset of the heavy-tailed mixture when  X  = 1 . Although the Gaussian model may be preferred for its comput ational sim-plicity, it is a demonstrably poor fit to the data and the heavy -tailed model is a worthwhile improvement. 3.3 Analyzing the likelihood models Existence of the heavy tails in the likelihood function seem s to be a critical feature that supports the non-linear behavior in the data. We substantia te this suggestion using Figure 3, and attempt to give some intuition behind the qualitative differences in variability and bias between Figures 1 and 2. The discussion below focuses on 3 disparity conditions. The chosen since the Gaussian and heavy-tailed models tend to di ffer most in their predictions at these disparities.
 Let us first consider the unity case. In general, most of the sa mples on unity trials are from the region of space where both the auditory and visual li kelihoods overlap. When true disparity | s v  X  s a | = 0 , it means that the two likelihoods overlap maximally (Figur es 3Aii and 3Cii). Hence regardless of the form of the likelihoo d, variability on unity trials at | s v  X  s a | = 0 should be roughly between  X  v and  X  a . This can be verified in Figures 1C, 2C. Figure 3: Analyzing the likelihood models: Results from the causal selection models. In all plots, Now one of the biggest differences between the likelihood mo dels is what happens to this variability as | s v  X  s a | increases. In the case of the Gaussian, the amount of overlap be-tween the two likelihoods decreases (Figures 3Ai,3Aiii). C onsequently, the samples are from a somewhat smaller region in space and hence the variabi lity also decreases. This corresponds to the concave curves predicted by the Gaussian model (Figures 1C; dashed gray). Whereas for the heavy-tailed likelihood, the overla pping regions roughly increase with increasing disparity, due to the long tails (Figures 3C i,3Ciii). This is reflected in the gradually increasing variability on unity trials correspo nding to the better matching convex curves predicted by the heavy-tailed model (Figure 2C).
 On the non-unity trials, most of the samples are from non-ove rlapping regions of space. Here, the biggest difference between the likelihood models is that in the Gaussian case, after this trend in simulation results presented in [2; 4]. This is because as disparity increases, the degree of overlap between two likelihoods decreases and var iability approaches  X  a (Figures 3Bi,3Biii). However, the behavior in the real data suggests that variability continues to be a constant. With heavy-tailed likelihoods, the tails of the t wo likelihoods continue to overlap even as disparity increases; hence the variability is rough ly constant (Figures 3Di,3Diii). Quantitative predictions X  X ariance and bias: Our heavy-tailed causal selection model makes two predictions with regards to variability and bias f or stimulus conditions not yet tested. One prediction is that on non-unity trials, as spati al disparity s v  X  s a increases, the localisation variability continues to remain constant at roughly a value equivalent to the standard deviation of the auditory likelihood (Figure 2 C; black dashed plot). However, response percent bias approaches zero (Figure 2A; black das hed plot), indicating that when spatial disparity is very high and the stimuli are perceived as being independent, auditory localisation response is consistent with auditory dominan ce.
 A second prediction is that percent bias gradually decrease s with increasing disparity on unity trials as well. This suggests that even when highly dis parate stimuli are perceived as being unified, perception may be dominated by the auditory cu es. Our results also predict that the variability in this case continues to increase very gradually with increasing disparity This accords with intuition, since for very large dispariti es, the number of trials in which the the stimuli are perceived as being unified will be very small.
 Qualitative prediction X  X istribution of localization err ors: Our model also makes a qualitative prediction concerning the distribution of loc alisation errors for incongruent ( s v  X  s a 6 = 0 ) stimulus conditions. In both Figures 4A and B, localizatio n error on unity trials is equivalent to the stimulu disparity s v  X  s a = 10  X  , indicating that even at this high disparity, responses are cluttered closer to the visual stimulus locat ion. On non-unity trials, the error is about 5  X  here; responses are more broadly distributed and the bias is highly reduced. The Gaussian and heavy-tailed predictions differ in how qui ckly the error distributions go to zero. Figure 4: Model predictions: (A,B) Localization error distributions predited by the Gau ssian and Specificity to experimental task: In the experimental task we have examined here [6], subjects were subjects were asked to first indicate the perce ived location of sound on each trial and then to report their judgement of unity. The requir ement to explicitly make a unity judgement may incur an experimental bias towards the causal selection model.
 To explore the potential influence of task instructions on su bjects X  inference strategy, we tested our models on a simulation of a different audio-visua l spatial localisation task [3]. Here, subjects were asked to report on both visual and audito ry stimulus locations and were not explicitly instructed to make unity judgements. The aut hors employed model averaging to explain the results [3] and the data were found to have a ver y high likelihood under their model. However, they do not analyse variability in the subje cts X  responses and this aspect of behavior as a function of spatial disparity is not readily ob vious in their published data. We evaluated both our heavy-tailed causal averaging as well as causal selection models on a simulation of this experiment. The two models make very dif ferent predictions. Causal averaging predicts that response variability will monoton ically increase with increasing dis-parity, while selection predicts a less straightforward tr end (Figure 4C). Both models predict a similar amount of response bias and that it will decrease wi th increasing disparity (Figure 4C). This particular prediction is confirmed by the response bias in their behavioral data plot made available in [3]. Considering the paradigmatic differ ences between the two studies ([6] and [3]) and the wide range in bias, applying both infere nce methods and likelihood models on this data could be very informative.
 Adaptation of the prior: One interesting aspect of inference under this generative m odel is that as the value of  X  = P ( C = 1) increases, the variability also increases for both unity an d non-unity trials across all disparities. However, the resp onse bias remains unchanged. Given this correlation between response variability and the prio r over hypotheses, our approach may be used to understand whether and how subjects X  priors ch ange during the course of an experimental session. Considering that the best value ac ross all trials for this prior is quite small (  X   X  0 . 2 ), we hypothesize that this value will be quite high at the sta rt of an experiment, and gradually reduce. This hypothesis leads to a prediction that variability decreases during an experimental session. In this paper, we ventured to understand the computational m echanisms underlying sensory cue interactions that give rise to a particular pattern of no n-linear response behavior [6], using a mixture of two different models that could have gener ated the sensory data. We proposed that the form of the sensory likelihood is a critica l feature that drives non-linear behavior, especially at large stimulus disparities. In par ticular, a heavy-tailed likelihood function more accurately fits subjects X  bias and variance in a cue combination task. Heavy-tailed distributions have been used previously in mo deling cue interactions [7; 8]. In this paper, we went further by comparing the ability of hea vy-tailed and Gaussian like-lihood models to describe behavior. Qualitative fits of summ arised statistics such as bias and variance are insufficient to make any strong claims about human perceptual processes; nevertheless, this work provides some insight into the pote ntial functional role of sensory noise.
 Another significant contribution in this paper is the critic al evaluation of model selection versus averaging approaches to inference. These two infere nce methods may predict differ-ent variances in their estimates, as a function of stimulus c onflict. As suggested in Section 4, having these different models at hand allows one to examin e how task instructions affect subject behavior.
 We noted in Section 3.2 that the heavy-tailed model is more co mplex than the Gaussian model. Although we have not included any complexity penalty , this formulation was sup-ported by two aspects: (i) it was relatively insensitive to p arameter settings, providing a better fit to the data than the Gaussian model for a wide range o f parameter values; (ii) optimizing the fit of the Gaussian model required implausibl e values for parameters  X  a ,  X  v (Fig 1B), whereas parameters for the heavy-tailed model acc orded well with published data. One downside about our results is that even though the model b ias for unity trials captures the slightly increasing trend as disparity decreases, it is not as large as in the behavioral data (close to 100% ) or as that predicted by the Gaussian models. This does not se em to be a consequence of the parameter values chosen. One interpreta tion provided by [6] of the large bias in the data is that a perceptual decision (unity or non-u nity) determines a sensorimotor action (localization response). Then one response strateg y might be to ignore the posterior prediction of higher bias, the strategy is not Bayes-optima l. Yet another potential limitation of our approach is that the only form of noise we consider is se nsory; we do not yet take into account any motor component that may drive target local ization.
 Currently, we have access to only an estimate of the average v ariance in subjects X  auditory target location estimates. On the computational side, one i nteresting avenue for future work would be to evaluate the model averaging and selection hypot hesis based on a likelihood model derived directly from the raw data. On the experimenta l side, one of the major in-adequacies of most experimental paradigms is that the only ( approximate) measure of a subject X  X  perceptual uncertainty involves measuring the r esponse variability across a large number of trials. An alternative paradigm that allows measu rement of the perceptual un-certainty on a single trial could provide important constra ints on computational models of the perceptual phenomena. At the neural level, a key step ent ails exploring biologically plausible neural implementations of the mixture model appr oach.
