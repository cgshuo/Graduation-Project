 Table is one of the commonest modes for presenting information. It is widely used in magazine articles. Thus, automatically identifying tables from documents is important information summarization, and data mining. 
Unfortunately, table can be expressed in different kinds of formats. Specifically, it may have format information, for example  X &lt;TABLE&gt; X ,  X &lt;TR&gt; X , etc in HTML. We call this kind of table as formatted table. On the other hand, a table may have no such table data can be expressed in a row, column, or mixed mode. plain text. We propose to conduct table extraction by combining machine learning and document structure extracted. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the related approach and Section 6 gives our experimental results. We make conclusions in section 7. Table detection is an important area in data mining. Many research efforts have been from web page and only a little work addressed the table detection from plain text. 1. Table Detection from Plain Text Several research works have been made on table detection from plain text. 
For example, Pinto et al propose an a pproach using Conditional Random Fields learning. The CRFs based method outperforms the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) based method (a classical method for sequence learning) [5]. 
Klein has constructed commercial document analysis systems for detecting table 
Comparing with the above methods, two features make our method different: (1) we combine machine learning and document structure to detect unformatted table from plain text; (2) we focus on table detection from Chinese documents. 2. Table Detection from Web Page Considerable research work has been placed on the table detection from web page. On Therefore, table detection on web page significantly differs from that on plain text. 
For example, Wang et al propose a table extraction model. They have defined optimal algorithm to detect ta ble [9]. See also [1][2][8]. According to the format of table, we divide tables into two categories: formatted table have such format. Therefore, the problem of unformatted table detection seems more complex and more difficult to deal with. 
Figure 1 shows an example of unformatted table. Line 1 is the table title. Lines lied header row. The table can be grouped into four columns. recognition, we mean a process of recognizing unformatted table rows from the plain text. In unformatted table identification, we identify an unformatted table by making use of the document structure and the results of table row recognition. differentiate unformatted table and table. We perform the unformatted table detection in three passes: Document structure extraction, unformatted table row recognition, and unformatted table identification. the document map tree in Microsoft Office Word. However, in most cases, documents structure by a hierarchical clusteri ng approach. (See [10] for details.) 
In unformatted table row recognition, we use a classification based method to find unformatted table rows. Specifically, we define features for Chinese plain text in the classification model. We employ a Bayesian classification to perform the detection of the unformatted table rows. identifying the unformatted table. 
Finally, the output is detected unformatted tables and unformatted table rows within them. We consider one implementation of the proposed approach. We employ a unified been investigated previously on plain text and thus are the main focus of our work. 5.1 Document St ructure Extraction schema of the document structure. table title. The document structure is organized in a tree. 5.2 Unformatted Table Row Recognition In this paper, the problem of determining whether or not a text line is an unformatted table row is viewed as that of classification. We manually annotate unformatted table task. The features mainly include three categories. Space Symbol Features: The features represent the percentage of space or tab symbol in the current line. The values range from 0 to 1. Text Length Feature: This feature represents the length of the current line. Segment Number Features: The number of segments in a line is an important indicator of table in Chinese document. 
The features above are also defined for the previous line and the next line. 5.3 Document Structure Based Unformatted Table Identification unformatted table. We propose an algorithm that can be described in three processing steps: annotation, modification and refinement, and induction. 6.1 Experimental Setup 1. Data set and evaluation measures We tried to collect data from a Stock Exchange. Totally, 108 annual enterprise reports were gathered. These reports are converted into a XML based format so as to 1706 unformatted tables and 13162 unformatted table rows were annotated. F1-measure. 2. Baseline methods For table row recognition, we defined a baseline method as follows. If a line contains more than one separator such as space and tab, then identify the line as table row. 
For table identification, we defined a baseline method as follow. If successive lines are recognized as table rows, then identify these lines as a table. 6.2 Table Detection from Plain Text that we evaluated in our experiments. 
In Bayesian classification method, we used classification model to decide whether or not a line is an unformatted table row, and then viewed the continuous unformatted method in section 5 to perform the detection of table row and table. 
We see that our methods can achieve high performances in the two tasks. For both significantly outperform the baselines. model. Using the classification method and document structure, we have been able to approach can significantly outperform the baseline methods.
