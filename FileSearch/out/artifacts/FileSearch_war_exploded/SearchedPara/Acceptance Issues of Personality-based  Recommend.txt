 To understand users X  acceptance of the emerging trend of personality-based recommenders (P BR), we evaluated an existing PBR using the technology acceptance model (TAM). We also compare it with a baseline rating-based recommender in a within-subject user study. Our results show that while the personality-based recommender is perceived to be only slightly more accurate than the rating-based one, it is mu ch easier to use. The side-by-side comparison also reveals that users significantly favor the personality-based recommender and have a significantly higher intention to use such a system again. Therefore, we believe that if users accepted rating-based recommenders, they are most likely to accept personality-based recomme nders and personality-based recommenders have a high like lihood to be widely adopted despite the fact that rating-based recommenders are now the industry norm. We further point out some preliminary guidelines on how to design personality-based recommender systems.

Understanding what impact users X  acceptance to such new technologies is critical to enable service providers to achieve the maximu m benefits. Jones and Pu [8] conducted an experiment to compare two popular music recommender websites, Pandora and Last.fm, to understand such issues. The study not only discovered users X  preference between these two systems, but also revealed insights on the user adoption process. Analyzing both the objective and subjective variables, they showed that a simple interface design, little initial effort requirement, and good recommendation quality (e.g. accuracy, novelty and enjoyability) are the most influential factors that contribute to users X  adoption of music recommenders. Recently, inspired by findings in psychology, personality-based recommender systems are increasingly attracting the attention of researchers and industry practitioners [5, 9, 10]. Research has shown that personality is an enduring and primary factor that determines human behaviors [2] and that there are significant connections between personality a nd people X  X  tastes and interests [5, 9]. It is reasonable to believe that personality-based recommenders could provi de more personalized information/services, since they understand the customers better from the psychological perspective. As this is still an emerging trend, little research and user validation work have been done on this topic. However, the exis ting studies have shown that personality-based recommenders could be more effective and applicable to a broader range of applications. In our previous work, we demonstrated that personality quiz-based recommender systems have the potential to be alternative to commonly used rating-based sy stems [11]. However, we questioned to what extent users would like to use the new personality-based recommender technology, and which design and algorithm aspects would influence users X  acceptance. The contribution of this paper is to utilize a well-studied intention model, the technology acceptance model (TAM) [4], to explore potential user acceptance issu es of personality-based recommender systems, especially those based on personality quizzes. An empirical user study was conducted, comparing a personality-based recommender with a rating-based recommender in terms of the acceptance constructs in the TAM. The results validate the fact that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are two significant factors affecting users X  acceptance to the personality-based recommender systems. Furthermore, the study pointed out some preliminary res earch directions on design issues. Despite there being other aspects that affect users X  acceptance, such as interface display [3], we focused on the initial preference elicitation processes and recomme ndation approaches which are the two key innovations of personality-based recommender systems.
