The 13th International Conference on Natural Language and Information Systems (NLDB 2008) took place at the University ofWestminster,London,UnitedKingdom,24 X 27June2008.TheNLDB2008conferencereceived68submissions.Threetypesof contributions were accepted: full papers, short papers and posters. At the conference, we had 19 papers, eight short papers and 12 posters presented. The selection of the papers was the result of a rigorous reviewing process where 90% of the submitted papers have been reviewed by four reviewers and only 10% by three reviewers. The final acceptance rate has been 29.4%.
The final program included papers addressing the important role natural language can play in today X  X  information society and technologies. Particularly, we classified the papers according to the thematic areas of Natural Language Processing and Understanding , Conceptual Modelling and Ontologies , Information Retrieval, Query and Query Answering , Document Processing and Text Mining , Software (Requirements) Engineering and Specification .

For this special issue, we had thus invited five of the 19 papers that were presented at the conference based on the fol-lowing criteria: Scores and comments from the first review round.
 Overall impression during the presentation at the conference (including comments from the audience).
 Recommendation by the Editor-in-Chief for Europe.
 Our own additional scrutinised review of the candidate papers.

After this procedure, we had decided that there were indeed five candidates of such quality that will be able to pass the second review round. We invited the authors of these five papers to submit an extended version to meet the DKE guidelines and started the second round of review. We have obviously communicated to the authors our agreement with the editor, namely that their submissions would be published if and only if they pass the second review round. All five papers did pass the second review round, as anticipated, given the criteria of the invitation process. Thus, after two rounds of reviews and an additional one from the guest editors, we have selected these five papers.

In particular, the special issue unfolds once more the multi-facetted role natural language plays in some very important aspects in computing and information systems, in particular, such as the new Web generations, Information Retrieval, Que-rying and Query Answering, Advanced Databases, Knowledge Discovery. The papers in this special issue also highlight some of the still open issues and challenges in coping with natural language as a means of information and meaning carrier. The paper entitled Combining Ontological Profiles with Context in Information Retrieval , authored by Geir Solskinnsbakk and Jon Atle Gulla , introduces the concept of ontological profiles as a more powerful semantic representation of a domain than an ontology on its own and, therefore, retrieval of documents. It links concepts with vectors of related terms from a domain vocabulary and their use in collections of documents, together with weights showing the strength of these relations in a par-ticular context (crucial for semantic search, input of weights and strength of relations is text mining and not a linguistic ontology).
 The paper entitled Computing Intensional Answers to Questions  X  An Inductive Logic Programming Approach , authored by Philipp Cimiano, Sebastian Rudolph and Helena Hartfiel , addresses the contribution of natural language in improving query re-sults and answers. The authors claim to go beyond a mere listing of facts as a query result and move towards producing additional descriptions of the query results referred to as intensional answers. They also argue that intensional answers can enhance a user X  X  understanding of the answer itself but also of the underlying knowledge base.

The paper entitled Structure of Morphologically Expanded Queries: A Genetic Algorithm Approach , authored by Lourdes Ara-ujo, Hugo Zaragoza, Jose R. P X rez-Ag X era and Joaqu X n P X rez-Iguesias , addresses the query reformulation or expansion process by abandoning the currently dominating assumption of query term independence in modern Information Retrieval techniques and ranking functions. Heuristic optimisation algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, are claimed to be more appropriate for querying within the context of query reformulation or expansion, where the appropriate selection of a subset of search terms among a list of candidate terms is of paramount importance.

Minock addresses another major challenge in the potential role natural language plays as interface to databases. The paper seeks a way to unblock the uptake of Natural Language Interfaces (NLI) to databases in that it makes NLIs a more attractive option by reducing the time and expertise necessary to build them.
 to the problem of extracting the characteristics of offenders from the crime or offence style and profile is presented by the paper entitled A Language Modelling Approach to Linking Criminal Styles with Offender Characteristics , authored by Richard
Bache, Fabio Crestani, David Canter and Donna Youngs . This approach could circumscribe the potential, and still unknown, offenders of a crime scene.
 the late editor-in-chief for Europe, Prof. Dr. Reind van de Riet, as well as Prof. Dr. Peter Chen, general editor-in-chief of this journal, for their encouragement and warm support to make this special issue happen. Special thanks go to the reviewers for their thorough comments that helped enhance the quality of the papers. Last, but not least, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers to NLDB 2008.
