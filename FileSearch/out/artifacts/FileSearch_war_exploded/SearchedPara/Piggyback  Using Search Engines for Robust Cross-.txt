 As statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) matures, NLP components are increasingly used in real-world applications. In many cases, this means that some form of cross-domain adaptation is neces-sary because there are distributional differences be-tween the labeled training set that is available and the real-world data in the application. To address this problem, we propose a new type of features for NLP data, features extracted from search en-gine results . Our motivation is that search engine results can be viewed as a substitute for the world knowledge that is required in NLP tasks, but that can only be extracted from a standard training set or pre-compiled resources to a limited extent. For example, a named entity (NE) recognizer trained on news text may tag the NE London in an out-of-domain web query like London Klondike gold rush as a location. But if we train the recognizer on features derived from search results for the sentence to be tagged, correct classification as person is possible. This is because the search results for London Klondike gold rush contain snippets in which the first name Jack precedes London ; this is a sure indicator of a last name and hence an NE of type person.

We call our approach piggyback and search result-derived features piggyback features because we pig-gyback on a search engine like Google for solving a difficult NLP task.

In this paper, we use piggyback features to ad-dress a particularly hard cross-domain problem, the application of an NER system trained on news to web queries. This problem is hard for two reasons. First, the most reliable cue for NEs in English, as in many languages, is capitalization. But queries are generally lowercase and even if uppercase char-acters are used, they are not consistent enough to be reliable features. Thus, applying NER systems trained on news to web queries requires a robust cross-domain approach.

News to queries adaptation is also hard because queries provide limited context for NEs. In news text, the first mention of a word like Ford is often a fully qualified, unambiguous name like Ford Mo-tor Corporation or Gerald Ford . In a short query like buy ford or ford pardon , there is much less con-text than in news. The lack of context and capitaliza-tion, and the noisiness of real-world web queries (to-kenization irregularities and misspellings) all make NER hard. The low annotator agreement we found for queries (Section 5) also confirms this point.
The correct identification of NEs in web queries can be crucial for providing relevant pages and ads to users. Other domains have characteristics sim-ilar to web queries, e.g., automatically transcribed speech, social communities like Twitter, and SMS. Thus, NER for short, noisy text fragments, in the absence of capitalization, is of general importance.
NER performance is to a large extent determined by the quality of the feature representation. Lexical, part-of-speech (PoS), shape and gazetteer features are standard. While the impact of different types of features is well understood for standard NER, fun-damentally different types of features can be used when leveraging search engine results. Returning to the NE London in the query London Klondike gold rush , the feature  X  X roportion of search engine results in which a first name precedes the token of interest X  is likely to be useful in NER. Since using search en-gine results for cross-domain robustness is a new ap-proach in NLP, the design of appropriate features is crucial to its success. A significant part of this paper is devoted to feature design and evaluation.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 dis-cusses related work. We describe standard NER fea-tures in Section 3. One main contribution of this paper is the large array of piggyback features that we propose in Section 4. We describe the data sets we use and our experimental setup in Sections 5 X 6. The results in Section 7 show that piggyback fea-tures significantly increase NER performance. This is the second main contribution of the paper. We dis-cuss challenges of using piggyback features  X  due to the cost of querying search engines  X  and present our conclusions and future work in Section 8. Barr et al. (2008) found that capitalization of NEs in web queries is inconsistent and not a reliable cue for NER. Guo et al. (2009) exploit query logs for NER in queries. This is also promising, but the context in search results is richer and potentially more infor-mative than that of other queries in logs.

The insight that search results provide useful ad-ditional context for natural language expressions is not new. Perhaps the oldest and best known applica-tion is pseudo-relevance feedback which uses words and phrases from search results for query expansion (Rocchio, 1971; Xu and Croft, 1996). Search counts or search results have also been used for sentiment analysis (Turney, 2002), for transliteration (Grefen-stette et al., 2004), candidate selection in machine translation (Lapata and Keller, 2005), text similar-ity measurements (Sahami and Heilman, 2006), in-correct parse tree filtering (Yates et al., 2006), and paraphrase evaluation (Fujita and Sato, 2008). The specific NER application we address is most similar to the work of Farkas et al. (2007), but they mainly used frequency statistics as opposed to what we view as the main strength of search results: the ability to get additional contextually similar uses of the token that is to be classified.
 Lawson et al. (2010), Finin et al. (2010), and Yetisgen-Yildiz et al. (2010) investigate how to best use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for NER. We use AMT as a tool, but it is not our focus.

NLP settings where training and test sets are from different domains have received considerable atten-tion in recent years. These settings are difficult be-cause many machine learning approaches assume that source and target are drawn from the same dis-tribution; this is not the case if they are from differ-ent domains. Systems applied out of domain typi-cally incur severe losses in accuracy; e.g., Poibeau and Kosseim (2000) showed that newswire-trained NER systems perform poorly when applied to email data (a drop of F chine learning has made substantial progress in un-derstanding how cross-domain features can be used in effective ways (Ben-David et al., 2010). The de-velopment of such features however is to a large ex-tent an empirical problem. From this perspective, one of the most successful approaches to adaptation for NER is based on generating shared feature rep-resentations between source and target domains, via unsupervised methods (Ando, 2004; Turian et al., 2010). Turian et al. (2010) show that adapting from CoNLL to MUC-7 (Chinchor, 1998) data (thus be-tween different newswire sources), the best unsuper-vised feature (Brown clusters) improves F to .79. Our approach fits within this line of work in that it empirically investigates features with good cross-domain generalization properties. The main contribution of this paper is the design and evalu-ation of a novel family of features extracted from the largest and most up-to-date repository of world knowledge, the web.
 Another source of world knowledge for NER is Wikipedia: Kazama and Torisawa (2007) show that pseudocategories extracted from Wikipedia help for in-domain NER. Cucerzan (2007) uses Wikipedia and web search frequencies to improve NE disam-biguation, including simple web search frequencies for compound entities. As is standard in supervised NER, we train an NE tagger on a dataset where each token is represented as a feature vector. In this and the following section we present the features used in our study divided in groups. We will refer to the target token  X  the to-ken we define the feature vector for  X  as w neighbor is w provides a summary of all features.

Feature group BASE. The first class of fea-tures, BASE, is standard in NER. The binary fea-ture WORD ( k , i ) (line 1) is 1 iff w i , the i th word in the dictionary, occurs at position k with respect to w ing set. The analogous feature for part of speech, POS ( k , t ) (line 2), is 1 iff w k has been tagged with PoS t , as determined by TnT tagger (Brants, 2000). We also encode surface properties of the word with simple regular expressions, e.g., x-ray is encoded as x-x and 9/11 as d/dd ( SHAPE , line 3). For these fea-tures, k  X  X  X  1 , 0 , 1 } . Finally, we encode prefixes and suffixes, up to three characters long, for w 4).

Feature group GAZ. Gazetteer features (lines 5 &amp; 6) are an efficient and effective way of building world knowledge into an NER model. A gazetteer is simply a list of phrases that belong to a par-ticular semantic category. We use gazetteers from (i) GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002): countries, first/last names, trigger words; (ii) WordNet: the 46 lexicographical labels (food, location, person etc.); and (iii) Fortune 500: company names. The two gazetteer features are the binary features GAZ -( k , i ) and GAZ -I iff w word in a phrase of length l that the gazetteer lists as belonging to category i where k  X  X  X  1 , 0 , 1 } . Feature groups URL, LEX, BOW, and MISC are piggyback features. We produce these by segment-ing the input text into overlapping trigrams w w is submitted as a query to the search engine. For all experiments we used the publicly accessible a search result for the query consisting of, in most cases, 10 snippets , 2 each of which contains 0, 1 or more hits of the search term w features for the vector representation of w the snippets. We again refer to the target token and its neighbors (i.e., the search string) as w w ORG, or O) and the previous word and the next word serve as context that the search engine can exploit to provide snippets in which w category as in the input text. O is the tag of a token that is neither LOC, ORG nor PER.

In the definition of the features, we refer to the word in the snippet that matches w the match is determined based on edit distance. The word immediately to the left (resp. right) of s snippet is called s
For non-binary features, we first calculate real values and then binarize them into 10 quantile bins.
Feature group URL. This group exploits NE information in URLs. The feature URL -SUBPART (line 7) is the fraction of URLs in the search re-sult containing w matches, we set the feature to 0 if length( w
For URL -MI (line 8), each URL in the search re-sult is split on special characters into parts (e.g., do-main and subdomains). We refer to the set of all parts in the search result as URL-parts. The value of MI the training set as the mutual information (MI) be-tween (i) w of a URL in the search result. MI is defined as fol-lows: MI ( p, PER ) = X For example, for the URL-part p =  X  X taff X  (e.g., in bigcorp.com/staff.htm ), P ( staff ) is the proportion of search results that contain a URL with the part  X  X taff X , P ( PER ) is the proportion of search results where the search token w and P ( staff,PER ) is the proportion of search results where w the search engine has part  X  X taff X .

The value of the feature URL -MI is the average difference between the MI of PER and the other named entities. The feature is calculated in the same way for LOC, ORG, and O.

Our initial experiments that used binary features for URL parts were not successful. We then de-signed URL -MI to integrate all URL information specific to an NE class into one measurement in a way that gives higher weight to strong features and lower weight to weak features. The inner sum on line 8 is the sum of the three differences MI ( PER )  X  MI ( O ) , MI ( PER )  X  MI ( ORG ) , and MI ( PER )  X  MI ( LOC ) . Each of the three summands indicates the relative advantage a URL part p gives to PER vs O (or ORG and LOC). By averaging over all URL parts, one then obtains an assessment of the overall strength of evidence (in terms of MI) for the NE class in question.

Feature group LEX. These features assess how appropriate the words occurring in w texts in the search result are for an NE class.
For NEIGHBOR (line 9), we calculate for each word v in the British National Corpus (BNC) the count NE-BNC ( v, k ) , the number of times it oc-curs at position k with respect to an NE; and OTHER-BNC ( v, k ) , the number of times it occurs at position k with respect to a non-NE. We instan-tiate the feature for k =  X  1 (left neighbor) and k = 1 (right neighbor). The value of NEIGHBOR ( k ) is defined as the average log ratio of NE-BNC ( v, k ) and OTHER-BNC ( v, k ) , averaged over the set k -neighbors, the set of words that occur at position k with respect to s
In the experiments reported in this paper, we use a PoS-tagged version of the BNC, a balanced cor-pus of 100M words of British English, as a model of word distribution in general contexts and in NE contexts that is not specific to either target or source domain. In the BNC, NEs are tagged with just one PoS-tag, but there is no differentiation into subcat-egories. Note that the search engine could be used again for this purpose; for practical reasons we pre-ferred a static resource for this first study where many design variants were explored.

The feature LEX -MI interprets words occurring before or after s The parameter d indicates the  X  X irection X  of the fea-ture: before or after. MI the search results of the training set as the MI be-tween (i) w s to the right ( d = 1 ) of s of 2 words. The value of LEX -MI (PER,d) is then the average difference between the MI of PER and the other NEs. The definition for LEX -MI (PER,d) is given on line 10. The feature is calculated in the same way for LOC, ORG, and O.

Feature group BOW. The features LEX -MI con-sider a small window for cooccurrence information and distinguish left and right context. For BOW fea-tures, we use a larger window and ignore direction. Our aim is to build a bag-of-words representation of the contexts of w
MI of the training set as the MI between (i) w PER and (ii) v occurring anywhere in the search re-sult. The value of BOW -MI (PER) is the average dif-ference between the MI of PER and the other NEs (line 11). The average is computed over all words v  X  bow-words that occur in a particular search re-sult. The feature is calculated in the same way for LOC, ORG, and O.

Feature group MISC. We collect the remaining piggyback features in the group MISC.
 12&amp;13) compute the fraction of occurrences of w in the search result with capitalization of only the first letter and all letters, respectively. We exclude titles: capitalization in titles is not a consistent clue for NE status.

The SPECIAL feature (line 14) returns 1 iff any character of w
NEs are often surrounded by special characters in web pages, e.g., Janis Joplin -Summertime . The SPECIAL -TITLE feature (line 15) captures this by counting the occurrences of numbers and special characters in s
The TITLE -WORD feature (line 16) computes the fraction of occurrences of w search result.

The NOMINAL -POS feature (line 17) calculates the proportion of nominal PoS tags (NN, NNS, NP, NPS) of s a PoS tagging of the snippets using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).

The basic idea behind the CONTEXT ( k ) feature (line 18) is that the occurrence of words of certain shapes and with certain parts of speech makes it ei-ther more or less likely that w (the word preceding s for words that are adjectives, indefinites, posses-sive pronouns or numerals (partly based on tagging, partly based on a manually compiled list of words). For k = 1 (the word following s that contain numbers and special characters. This feature is complementary to the feature group LEX in that it is based on shape and PoS and does not estimate different parameters for each word.
The feature PHRASE -HIT (  X  1 ) (line 19) calculates the proportion of occurrences of w sult where the left neighbor in the snippet is equal to the word preceding w k =  X  1 : s  X  1 = w  X  1 . PHRASE -HIT ( 1 ) is the equivalent for the right neighbor. This feature helps identify phrases  X  search strings containing NEs are more likely to occur as a phrase in search results.
The ACRONYM feature (line 20) computes the proportion of the initials of w w ample, the abbreviation GM is likely to occur when searching for general motors dealers .

The binary feature EMPTY (line 21) returns 1 iff the search result is empty. This feature enables the classifier to distinguish true zero values (e.g., for the feature ALLCAPS ) from values that are zero because the search engine found no hits. In our experiments, we train an NER classifier on an in-domain data set and test it on two different out-of-domain data sets. We describe these data sets in LOC 4.1 4.1 1.9 11.9 10.6 ORG 4.9 3.7 3.2 8.2 8.3 PER 5.4 6.4 3.8 5.3 5.4 O 85.6 85.8 91.1 74.6 75.7 this section and the NER classifier and the details of the training regime in the next section, Section 6.
As training data for all models evaluated we used the CoNLL 2003 English NER dataset, a corpus of approximately 300,000 tokens of Reuters news from 1992 annotated with person, location, organi-zation and miscellaneous NE labels (Sang and Meul-der, 2003). As out-of-domain newswire evaluation NIST 1999 IEER named entity corpus, a dataset of 50,000 tokens of New York Times (NYT) and Asso-with person, location, organization, cardinal, dura-tion, measure, and date labels. CoNLL and IEER are professionally edited and, in particular, properly capitalized news corpora. As capitalization is ab-sent from queries we lowercased both CoNLL and IEER. We also reannotated the lowercased datasets with PoS categories using the retrained TnT PoS tag-ger (Brants, 2000) to avoid using non-plausible PoS information. Notice that this step is necessary as otherwise virtually no NNP/NNPS categories would be predicted on the query data because the lower-case NEs of web queries never occur in properly capitalized news; this causes an NER tagger trained on standard PoS to underpredict NEs (1 X 3% positive rate).

The 2005 KDD Cup is a query topic categoriza-We use a random subset of 2000 queries as a source of web queries. By means of simple regular ex-pressions we excluded from sampling queries that looked like urls or emails (  X  15%) as they are easy to identify and do not provide a significant chal-lenge. We also excluded queries shorter than 10 characters (4%) and longer than 50 characters (2%) to provide annotators with enough context, but not an overly complex task. The annotation procedure was carried out using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We instructed workers to follow the CoNLL 2003 NER guidelines (augmented with several examples from queries that we annotated) and identify up to three NEs in a short text and copy and paste them into a box with associated multiple choice menu with the 4 CoNLL NE labels: LOC, MISC, ORG, and PER. Five workers annotated each query. In a first round we produced 1000 queries later used for develop-ment. We call this set KDD-D. We then expanded the guidelines with a few uncertain cases. In a sec-ond round, we generated another 1000 queries. This set will be referred to as KDD-T. Because annota-tor agreement is low on a per-token basis (  X  = . 30 for KDD-D,  X  = . 34 for KDD-T (Cohen, 1960)), we remove queries with less than 50% agreement, averaged over the tokens in the query. After this filtering, KDD-D and KDD-T contain 777 and 819 queries, respectively. Most of the rater disagreement involves the MISC NE class. This is not surprising as MISC is a sort of place-holder category that is difficult to define and identify in queries, especially by untrained AMT workers. We thus replaced MISC with the null label O. With these two changes,  X  was .54 on KDD-D and .64 on KDD-T. This is sufficient
Table 2 shows the distribution of NE types in the 5 datasets. IEER has fewer NEs than CoNLL, KDD has more. PER is about as prevalent in KDD as in CoNLL, but LOC and ORG have higher percent-ages, reflecting the fact that people search frequently for locations and commercial organizations. These differences between source domain (CoNLL) and target domains (IEER, KDD) add to the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in this case. Recall that the input features for a token w sist of standard NER features (BASE and GAZ) and features derived from the search result we obtain by running a search for w and MISC). Since the MISC NE class is not anno-tated in IEER and has low agreement on KDD in the experimental evaluation we focus on the four-class (PER, LOC, ORG, O) NER problem on all datasets. We use BIO encoding as in the original CoNLL task (Sang and Meulder, 2003).
 c9 c BASE GAZ 92.9 95.3 87.7 94.6
We use SuperSenseTagger (Ciaramita and Altun, ditional HMM trained with the perceptron algo-rithm (Collins, 2002), a discriminative model with excellent efficiency-performance trade-off (Sha and Pereira, 2003). The model is regularized by aver-aging (Freund and Schapire, 1999). For all models we used an appropriate development set for choos-ing the only hyperparameter, T , the number of train-ing iterations on the source data. T must be tuned separately for each evaluation because different tar-get domains have different overfitting patterns.
We train our NER system on an 80% sample of the CoNLL data. For our in-domain evaluation, we tune T on a 10% development sample of the CoNLL data and test on the remaining 10%. For our out-of-domain evaluation, we use the IEER and KDD test sets. Here T is tuned on the corresponding develop-ment sets. Since we do not train on IEER and KDD, these two data sets do not have training set portions. For each data set, we perform 63 runs, correspond-ing to the 2 6  X  1 = 63 different non-empty combina-tions of the 6 feature groups. We report average F generated by five-trial training and evaluation, with random permutations of the training data. We com-pute the scores using the original CoNLL phrase-based metric (Sang and Meulder, 2003). As a bench-mark we use the baseline model with gazetteer fea-tures (BASE and GAZ). The robustness of this sim-ple approach is well documented; e.g., Turian et al. (2010) show that the baseline model (gazetteer fea-tures without unsupervised features) produces an F of .778 against .788 of the best unsupervised word representation feature. Table 3 summarizes the experimental results. In each column, the best numbers within a dataset for the  X  X owercased X  runs are bolded (see below for dis-cussion of the  X  X apitalization X  runs on lines c9 and i9). For all experiments, we selected a subset of the combinations of the feature groups. This subset al-ways includes the best results and a number of other combinations where feature groups are added to or removed from the optimal combination.

Results for the CoNLL test set show that the 5 feature groups without LEX achieve optimal per-formance (line c7). Adding LEX improves perfor-mance on PER, but decreases overall performance (line c8). Removing GAZ, URL, BOW and MISC from line c7, causes small comparable decreases in performance (lines c3 X  X 6). These feature groups seem to have about the same importance in this ex-perimental setting, but leaving out BASE decreases F
The main result for CoNLL is that using piggy-back features (line c7) improves F NER system that uses only BASE and GAZ (line c1) by 4.2%. Even though the emphasis of this pa-per is on cross-domain robustness, we can see that our approach also has clear in-domain benefits.
The baseline in line c1 is the  X  X owercase X  base-line as indicated by  X  X  X . We also ran a  X  X apitalized X  baseline ( X  X  X ) on text with the original capitalization preserved and PoS-tagged in this unchanged form. Comparing lines c7 and c9, we see that piggyback features are able to recover all the performance that is lost when proper capitalization is unavailable. Lin and Wu (2009) report an F original split of the CoNLL data. Our F &gt; 92% can be explained by a combination of ran-domly partitioning the data and the fact that the four-class problem is easier than the five-class problem LOC-ORG-PER-MISC-O.

We use the t-test to compute significance on the two sets of five F that are being compared (two-tailed, p &lt; . 01 for t &gt; 3 . 36 ). 8 CoNLL scores that are significantly different from line c7 are marked with  X  .

For IEER, the system performs best for all six feature groups (line i8). Runs significantly different from i8 are marked  X  . When URL, LEX and BOW are removed from the set, performance does not de-crease, or only slightly (lines i4, i5, i6), indicating that these three feature groups are least important. In contrast, there is significant evidence for the im-portance of BASE, GAZ, and MISC: removing them decreases performance by at least 1% (lines i2, i3, i7). The large increase of ORG F not used is surprising (41.2% on line i4, best per-formance). The reason seems to be that URL fea-tures (and LEX to a lesser extent) do not generalize for ORG. Locations like Madrid in CoNLL are fre-quently tagged ORG when they refer to sports clubs like Real Madrid . This is rare in IEER and KDD. Compared to standard NER (using feature groups BASE and GAZ), our combined feature set achieves a performance that is by more than 10% higher (lines i8 vs i1). This demonstrates that piggyback features have robust cross-domain generalization properties. The comparison of lines i8 and i9 confirms that the features effectively compensate for the lack of cap-italization, and perform almost as well as (although statistically worse than) a model trained on capital-ized data.

The best run on KDD-D was the run with feature groups BASE, GAZ, URL, LEX and MISC. On line k7, we show results for this run for KDD-T and for runs that differ by one feature group (lines k2 X  X 6, when using all feature groups (line k8). Omitting BOW results in the same score for ALL (line k7). Apparently, the local LEX features already capture most useful cooccurrence information and looking at a wider window (as implemented by BOW) is of limited utility. On lines k2 X  X 6, performance gen-erally decreases on ALL and the three NE classes when dropping one of the five feature groups on line k7. One notable exception is an increase for ORG when feature group URL is dropped (line k4, 25.2%, the best performance for ORG of all runs). This is in line with our discussion of the same effect on IEER.
The key take-away from our results on KDD-T is that piggyback features are again (as for IEER) sig-nificantly better than standard feature groups BASE and GAZ. Search engine based adaptation has an ad-vantage of 9.2% compared to standard NER (lines k7 vs k1). An F enough for practical purposes. But even if additional work is necessary to boost the scores further, our model is an important step in this direction.
The low scores for KDD-T are also partially due to our processing of the AMT data. Our selection procedure is biased towards short entities whereas CoNLL guidelines favor long NEs. We can address this by forcing AMT raters to be more consistent with the CoNLL guidelines in the future.

We summarize the experimental results as fol-lows. Piggyback features consistently improve NER for non-well-edited text when used together with standard NER features. While relative improve-ment due to piggyback features increases as out-of-domain data become more different from the in-domain training set, performance declines in abso-lute terms from .930 (CoNLL) to .681 (IEER) and .438 (KDD-T). Robust cross-domain generalization is key in many NLP applications. In addition to surface and linguis-tic differences, differences in world knowledge pose a key challenge, e.g., the fact that Java refers to a location in one domain and to coffee in another. We have proposed a new way of addressing this chal-lenge. Because search engines attempt to make op-timal use of the context a word occurs in, hits shown to the user usually include other uses of the word in semantically similar snippets. These snippets can be used as a more robust and domain-independent rep-resentation of the context of the word/phrase than what is available in the input text.

Our first contribution is that we have shown that this basic idea of using search engines for robust domain-independent feature representations yields solid results for one specific NLP problem, NER. Piggyback features achieved an improvement of F of about 10% compared to a baseline that uses BASE and GAZ features. Even in-domain, we were able to get a smaller, but still noticeable improvement of 4.2% due to piggyback features. These results are also important because there are many application domains with noisy text without reliable capitaliza-tion, e.g., automatically transcribed speech, tweets, SMS, social communities and blogs.

Our second contribution is that we address a type of NER that is of particular importance: NER for web queries. The query is the main source of in-formation about the user X  X  information need. Query analysis is important on the web because under-standing the query, including the subtask of NER, is key for identifying the most relevant documents and the most relevant ads. NER for domains like Twitter and SMS has properties similar to web queries.
A third contribution of this paper is the release of an annotated dataset for web query NER. We hope that this dataset will foster more research on cross-domain generalization and domain adaptation  X  in particular for NER  X  and the difficult problem of web query understanding.
 This paper is about cross-domain generalization. However, the general idea of using search to provide rich context information to NLP systems is applica-ble to a broad array of tasks. One of the main hurdles that NLP faces is that the single context a token oc-curs in is often not sufficient for reliable decisions, be they about attachment, disambiguation or higher-order semantic interpretation. Search makes dozens of additional relevant contexts available and can thus overcome this bottleneck. In the future, we hope to be able to show that other NLP tasks can also benefit from such an enriched context representation.
Future work. We used a web search engine in the experiments presented in this paper. Latencies when using one of the three main commercial search en-gines Bing, Google and Yahoo! in our scenario range from 0.2 to 0.5 seconds per token. These execution times are prohibitive for many applications. Search engines also tend to limit the number of queries per user and IP address. To gain widespread acceptance of the piggyback idea of using search results for ro-bust NLP, we therefore must explore alternatives to search engines.

In future work, we plan to develop more efficient methods of using search results for cross-domain generalization to avoid the cost of issuing a large number of queries to search engines. Caching will be of obvious importance in this regard. Another av-enue we are pursuing is to build a specialized search system for our application in a way similar to Ca-farella and Etzioni (2005). While we need good coverage of a large variety of domains for our ap-proach to work, it is not clear how big the index of the search engine must be for good performance. Conceivably, collections much smaller than those in-dexed by major search engines (e.g., the Google 1T 5-gram corpus or ClueWeb09) might give rise to fea-tures with similar robustness properties. It is impor-tant to keep in mind, however, that one of the key factors a search engine allows us to leverage is the notion of relevance which might not be always pos-sible to model as accurately with other data.
