 Much interesting text on the web consists largely of opinion-ated or evaluative text, as opposed to directly informative text. The new field of  X  X entiment analysis X  seeks to charac-terize such aspects of natural language text, as opposed to just the bare facts. We suggest that  X  X ppraisal expression extraction X  should be viewed as a fundamental task for sen-timent analysis. We define an  X  X ppraisal expression X  to be a piece of text expressing some evaluative stance towards a particular object. The task is to find these elements and characterize the type and orientation (positive or negative) of the evaluative stance, as well as its target and possibly its source. Potential applications of these methods include new approaches to the now-traditional tasks of sentiment classifi-cation and opinion mining, as well as possibly for adversarial textual analysis and intention detection for intelligence ap-plications.

The task of  X  X entiment analysis X  is to find and characterize aspects of opinionated natural language. We define an  X  X p-praisal expression X  to be a piece of text expressing some eval-uative stance towards a particular target. By analogy to in-formation extraction, we consider representing appraisal ex-pressions as frames filled with several values for several slots. Thus, an appraisal expression comprises: Source, Attitude, and Target. We have developed a prototype system for navigating in a body of texts based on extracted appraisal expressions. Currently, the system extracts adjectival ap-praisal expressions only. To extract an appraisal expression, the system first finds adjectival appraisal groups[1](a head adjective with defined attitude type and an optional pre-ceding list of appraisal modifiers ). It then extracts the target groups by matching phrases in the lexicon to the phrases in the text and assigns the target type assigned in the lexicon.
