Finally, in Section 5 we present our conclusions. 2.1 Background on spectral clustering algorithms Given a set of data points { x i } n specific example of a spectral bipartitioning algorithm in F ig. 1. 2.2 Input data perturbation X approximate the original data can be treated using our analy sis as well [12]. define. We make the following general stochastic assumption on the error matrix W : found that the bounds are robust to relatively small amounts of correlation. on the original data even though we have access only to its app roximate version. practical characterization of the overall resource/accur acy tradeoff. 3.1 Upper bounding the mis-clustering rate bound. Let v relationship between the mis-clustering rate  X  and  X  2 := k  X  v in of  X  component of v or in We make the following assumptions on the data X and its perturbation: Our perturbation bound can now be stated as follows: tioning algorithm under the perturbation satisfies  X   X   X  2 = k  X  v all components of  X  v The proof of the proposition is provided in the Appendix.
