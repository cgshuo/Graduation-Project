Recent years have shown much progress in the field of recommender systems, including the development of innovative models and very efficient algorithms. Almost all current systems are trying to make best use of a singl e kind of data, and are designed for specific domains and applications, without explicitly addressing the heterogeneity of the existing info rmation. As an example, some systems are based on analysing user ratings, while others concentrate on understanding purchase history. Recognising this limitation, research attention has been given to finding ways for combining/integra ting/mediating user models for the purpose of providing better pers onalised services to users in many information seeking and ecommerce services. In spite of prior work, however, the issue remained one of the major challenges for recommender systems. Increasingly, users create and mana ge more and more profiles in online systems for different pur poses, such as leisure (e.g., Facebook), professional interests (e.g., LinkedIn), or specialised applications (e.g., LearnCentral for educational issues, PatientsLikeMe for health issues, et c.). Similarly, rated, tagged or bookmarked resources belong to distinct multimedia: text (e.g., Delicious, BibSonomy, Google News), image (e.g., Flickr, Picasa), audio (e.g., Last.fm, Spotify), or video (e.g., MovieLens, NetFlix, YouTube). Moreover, recommendati on algorithms may also present heterogeneity based on different types of input (e.g., explicit feedback from ratings, reviews, tags, etc. vs. implicit feedback from records of views, queries and pur chases), or based on different levels of input granularities (e.g., a user may not only rate individual songs, but also albums, artists or even a full music genre). Finally, contextual factors also increase heterogeneity in recommender systems. Location and time are key external elements that may
