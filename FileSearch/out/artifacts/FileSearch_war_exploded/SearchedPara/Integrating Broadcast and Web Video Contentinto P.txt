 Despite, or exactly because of the wealth of video content available on the Web, it is often cumbersome to obtain access to exactly the content you like. It is an active process of filtering and making choices, often requiring searches through long lists of alternatives.
Building upon the concept of personal TV channels , we demon-strate how Web video content can be seamlessly integrated with broadcast video content, thereby also providing personalized Web content.
 H3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information filtering Personalization, broadcast video content, Web video content Design
The personal TV channel concept is a content management and usage concept for personal video recorders (PVRs). The concept provides a user interface that is virtually as simple as zapping and inherently supports multiple user s. For a more elaborate exposition of this concept, we refer to [1].

Each personal TV channel provides a context that can be used to steer the search for Web video content, such as video on demand libraries or other repositories. We have automated the search pro-cess and in this way integrated Web video content in personal TV channels to provide easy access to this type of content.
We will show two demonstrators equipped with personal chan-nels, containing personalized TV as well as Web video content, and the way we interact with these channels and programs. One demon-strator has been implemented on an Android telephone and one on a tablet PC. The demonstrators provide recommendations for both types of content, based on naive Bayesian classification.
