 An axiom of every good investor is not to buy shares when the goodness of them is already into newspapers. Before, the information was circulating in some form, for example from mouth-to-mouth, closed circles, or newsletters. Nowadays the news can also occur in blogs that point to public or private communities that discuss topics that traditional media do not carry or even hide. Nowadays, standard communication media are trapped in a Cartesian or Platonic correspondence assumption. They want to tell us how things really are, how they have occurred, and how they will happen, disregarding a concrete world of problems where opportunities and threats live in real time for people. Searching and exploring the world of blogs can create an acceleration of i nnovation and a dissolution of the previous status quo. Here, the search unit is not a word, but actions, worries, opportunities, threats, etc. That is, people living and pursuing shared goals with others. Which new searching tools can help to find trends, innovations and ideas taking consciousness in the context described above? Can IR help to end with this illusion of pseudo-objectivity and manipulation of passive individuals?
