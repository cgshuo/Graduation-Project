 A growing number of corporations have created sites where customers talk to one another. What kind of interaction takes place on these sites? In this study, we interviewed eleven members of company online communities (COC). We found that while users initially come to such sites looking for product information, they often stay to socialize, and develop meaningful friendships with other members (even turning to one-another for support in times of personal traged y). We present case studies of interaction on two sites X  X or Campbell X  X  Soup, and for MINI Cooper car owners. We found that users are drawn to these sites because the product X  X  brand image attracts a group of like-minded individuals. Adjectives used to describe the brand are also used to describe site members. I.e., Campbell X  X  is trusting and down-to earth; MINI is fun-loving. Implications for website design are discussed.
 H.5.3 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interface  X  Web-based interaction. Design, Human Factors. Company online communities, online communities, brand, branding, online brand community The quote above was taken from a Web site called the MINI Owners X  Lounge, an online gathering spot for MINI Cooper owners. While the virtual serving of breakfast may not be what MINI had in mind when setting up an online community for its car owners, the electronic buffet is just one example of how members use the site to connect with one another beyond their common bond of car ownership and appreciation. Anticipated behavior  X  such as asking and answering questions about products and services  X  cer tainly is seen among users of online communities. However, members often move beyond the company X  X  initial intentions and find new or unique ways to use such sites for social and personal interactions. This study examines the behavior found among members of company online communities, including an examination of various participation levels and how the company or brand itself comes into play. Online communities have existed since the early days of the Internet in an array of formats  X  including newsgroups, chat rooms, bulletin boards and Multi-User Domains (MUDs). As computer literacy, personal computer ownership, and access to the World Wide Web increases, so do the potential audiences and uses for online communities. Familiar terms such as  X  X eb 2.0 X  and  X  X ocial media X  are closely linked with the term  X  X nline co mmunity, X  and have garnered much attention in the press. Concurrently, popular articles and books such as The Cluetrain Manifesto [20] and The Long Tail [1] have declared the death of business-as-usual in favor of more interest-based, conversational markets [20]. Likewise, businesses have identifie d this market trend. Sensing unique market opportunities, busine sses have increased their own development and promotion of on line community features that help them connect with current and potential customers  X  and permit their customers to connect and communicate with one another. Open environments such as these allow consumers to actively participate in, contribute to, comment on, and communicate through the company X  X  brand. More and more companies are implementing social and community features within their web presences. As this trend grows, the implications are still unknown and worthy of study. How will this new direction in social marketing affect companies and their customers? Because this is an under-resear ched area, we explore the following questions. Who visits th ese sites? Why are they going to them, and what are they doing after they arrive? What patterns of behavior can be identified among users, and what are the design implications of such patterns? This research examines tw o representative communities  X  Campbell X  X  Kitchen and the MINI Owners X  Lounge  X  to address these questions and investigate the manner by which companies and customers use these features to interact online. The difference between  X  X ompany X  and  X  X rand X  are, for many of us, hard to distinguish. Some mark eters and advertisers view a company or product as the brand itself [27], while others define brand as  X  X ollectively, what people say, feel and think X  about a company or product [13]. Either way, brands often are de scribed as having attributes, an identity, or a personality that cust omers connect with or otherwise find appealing. Consumers often align themselves with certain products, companies, or brands as a kind of personal statement, e.g., being a  X  X ac or PC person X  [12]. Sherry Turkle distinguishes the choice of operating system as not only a technical decision but an expression of cognitive style. [29]. Groups of people who have a called  X  X rand communities. X  One such brand community is Harley-Davidson Motorcycles X  Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.), whose group behavior has been previously studied [3]. Brand communities have been characterized by Muniz and O X  X uinn as having three fundamental elements [22] :  X  Consciousness of kind: This is the common belief that connects  X  Rituals and traditions: Brand communities often share  X  Sense of moral responsibility: Aiding in the community In 1993, Howard Rheingold defined online communities as  X  X ocial aggregations that emerge from the Net when enough people carry on those public discussions long enough, with sufficient human feeling, to form webs of personal relationships in cyberspace X  [26]. More often than not, people who form virtual communities do so because of shared interest. Beginning in the mid-1990s, companies began integrating online community platforms with their brand. Many companies began allowing customers to discuss product and service information directly from their corporate Web site. This trend has grown as brand community and online community continue to be amalgamated by corporations seeki ng to connect with customers in new ways.
 In this paper, company online communities (COC) are defined as virtual gathering spaces created and paid for by a company in which customers can communicate with one another. Often these are linked from the company X  X  corporate site and promoted through marketing campaigns. (For the purpos es of this study, COC does not include communities created by consumers without a company X  X  input or internal company online communities created for employees.) Other terms for company online communities have included: Online customer communities, brand-sponsored communities, company-sponsored online communities, managed brand communities, business communities, business-oriented online communities, and commercially based online communities. Here, the term  X  X ompany online communities X  is used in place of all the previously-mentioned term s and descriptors. To better understand how customers use company online communities, it is beneficial to c onsider the goals and motivations companies have in choosing to i nvest in and implement community features. Sometimes companies know that they would like to implement community f eatures for their brand but they do not know exactly how to do it or what features would work best. In such cases, companies often hire third-pa rty professionals specializing in online communities to help guide them in the process. In order to gain some insight into company objectives, we interviewed a community management professiona l who has helped more than 200 companies create online communities. Generally, companies look for online communities to do any number of the following:  X  Provide insight into customer thinking: Customers use COC to  X  Save money: In addition to sa ving companies expenses related  X  Generate sales: Online communities are sometimes used either  X  Generate ideas for product de velopment: Some companies  X  Increase customer loyalty and retention: Providing an online  X  Increase customer satisfaction: Another metric that companies  X  Acquire new customers: Today X  s consumers increasingly use This study does not attempt to measure the effectiveness of COC on reaching particular business goals. Rather it describes participant behavior patterns, community and brand alignment, and the resulting design implications. To study member behavior in company online communities, this paper concentrates on two communities that have well-known brands in North America. These two sites are used as case studies to represent how members interact with each other on COC; how patterns of behavior and particip ation change over time; and how design choices reflect a brand X  X  image and affect consumer behavior. Campbell X  X  Kitchen (http://www. campbellkitchen.com) provides a virtual space for customers to create profiles, write blogs, upload photos, participate in disc ussion boards, and send direct messages. The community is open to the public and is primarily focused on recipe sharing, cooking advice, and tips. The MINI Owners X  Lounge (http://miniusa.com/#/ownersLounge) allows similar interaction, and in addition, MINI drivers can find one another through an Owners Network, plan in-person events, and keep a driving journal. The Owners X  Lounge requires a MINI Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to join, so it is comprised of actual MINI owners but not potential MINI owners. The authors of this paper are MINI owners. In order to study the behavior of COC members, 14 interviews were conducted. To recruit community interviewees, we initially sent direct messages through the Campbell X  X  and MINI sites, but got no response. Next we became participant observers, setting up membership and contributing to the activities on each site. Initially participant observation was used to monitor activity on the two case study sites, with one author taking notes about discussion topics, frequency of site use by members, and community behaviors. During the second month of the study, the author completed profiles for each site and participated in the communities by responding to posts and asking members questions related to community topics of interest. After two months of observation and participation in the communities, we again contacted members directly and posted recruitment messages, this time with more success. Once several interviews were completed, we used snowball sampling to recruit additional participants [11]. Having a familiar site member endorse our study helped tremendous ly in gaining more interview subjects. Moderator and community manager interviews were set up through personal contacts. Interview guides were semi-struc tured and contained open-ended questions about COC attraction, exp ectations, participation, social activity, moderation, and brand im pressions. Each interview took approximately one hour. Two interv iews were done in person and 12 were done by telephone. All the interviews were digitally recorded for later transcription. Data then were analyzed using a grounded theory open coding process [7]. Concepts and phenomena regarding participation attitudes were labeled and categor ized, revealing the behavior patterns and design implications we report here. We interviewed five members of the Campbell X  X  Kitchen, six members of the MINI Owners X  Lounge, two COC moderators and one COC management professiona l. Of the eleven community members interviewed, seven were female and four were male. Five subjects were from the Cam pbell X  X  site (four female, one male), and six from the MINI site (three female, three male). All community members we interviewed used their respective sites frequently, from a range of two or three hours a week to two or three hours a day, with most bei ng daily contributors. All but one had been a member of their respective community for more than a year, with some having joined up to five years prior to their interview. People who were more interested and actively engaged in each of our case communities were, of course, more likely to respond to our request for an interview. Our participants are  X  X egulars, X  with a relatively con tinuous and frequent activity level on their respective sites. Campbell X  X  Kitchen participants ranged in age from mid-30s to 60s, with the majority of occupa tions being homemaker or stay-at-home mother. Members had a total number of postings ranging from 420 to 1,710. MINI Owners X  Lounge participants ranged in age from 20s to mid-50s. Occupations included student , chemist, interior designer, science teacher and architect. Members had a total number of postings ranging from 50 to 31,000. In addition to community members, two company online community moderators were interviewed as well as a COC management professional who has helped more than 200 companies create online communities. Interview transcripts from community moderators were used to identify differing codes of conduct and moderation policies fo r their respective companies. The COC management professi onal we interviewed provided clarification regarding the motivations companies have for implementing these types of features. Our observations and interviews re vealed that participants in company online communities generally fall into one of two groups  X  those who only seek and share information about products and services, and those who typically begin as information seekers, but eventually engage in a more social application of the site. Our study focuses primarily on the latter group, whose participation often leads to daily communal interaction. For these members, the sites they belong to become more than a place to discuss a particular product, brand or brand-based activity. Dedication and commitment to the COC can become quite high for those who use the s ite more for sharing their lives than for sharing product and servi ce information. In these cases, the use of the COC shifts over tim e from an information source to a social network of people brought together by their love of a particular brand. Many participants stated that the reason they come back to the site time and time again is for the people they have met there. We also found that COC participants often associate brand personality traits with their frie nds on the site, which can affect participation decision making. Lastly, we found that because brand personality is so meaningful in these sites, we offer design implications for creating COC that align more closely with brand attributes. Consumers enter company online communities for a variety of reasons. Some of them report re sponding to a marketing campaign out of curiosity. Some seek information or are looking for the answer to a specific question about a product or service. Some are looking for a public forum in which to voice their opinion about a company or its products. And some are looking to share the knowledge they have about a company, its products or some related activity. In some cases the common denominator of brand morphs into a bond that goes beyond interest in a certain product or service. In this section, we discuss in more detail how people participate in company online communities. We describe the participation continuum in company online communities in terms of the following member activities: Discovering, Lurking, Learning, Sharing, and Socializing. Our study participants point to several methods by which they find their respective COC. Some report stumbling across them while looking for related content (e.g., recipes in the case of Campbell X  X  Kitchen), while others report explicitly searching for some type of information in relation to the brand. Often community members are guided to the site through links from the corporate site or other marketing initiatives. All of our study participants state that initially they were not looking for an online community to join, but rather some other type of information. Typically they did not even know the community existed until they happened to come upon it. All of our Campbell X  X  Kitchen members said they originally came to the Web site looking for r ecipes. Campbell X  X  has a long-standing reputation for publishing recipes, both on its product labels and in cookbooks. And, in th is tradition, they now provide an online, searchable archive of company recipes  X  one factor that brings people to the site. One community member states: MINI owners often are guided to the Owners X  Lounge by their  X  X otoring advisor, X  a sales pers on who might recommend the site for online ordering and tracking or to get general information about the car. As stated earlier, the MINI Owners X  Lounge requires a VIN for entry, so it cannot be stumbled upon by the general public. Previous research describes the importance of lurkers in online communities [23]. In company-sponsored communities lurkers can make up a substantial con tingent, sometimes 90%, of the population [23]. People often visit COC to collect information about products and services or to see what X  X  going on within the community without signing in. Visitors who do not register or log in are likely still collecting important information regarding the brand, even if not explicitly contributing. Many lurkers are passive members who are not logged-in or are guests who will become members at a later time. There is no easy way for a company to measure the effect of lurking on site visitors who never register, however, being able to access information from a COC may still affect the lurker X  X  brand perception, loyalty and/or purchase. While many lurkers do not become active contributors, severa l of our participants describe lurking before becoming a memb er and contributing their own posts. For example: Many of our study participants stated that they initially signed up for a COC in order to acquire ge neral information about products, services or related-activities or to ask other members specific brand-related questions. MINI Coopers often are individually customized and specially ordere d, so new owners can use the Owners Lounge to talk with others who are also waiting on a car. Members also ask about car car e, maintenance, technical questions, and driving tips. Ca mpbell X  X  Kitchen members often ask for help with recipes, substitutions, and other cooking activities. We observed that some members looking for specific answers will drop in, get the information they n eed, and leave the site in short order. In these cases, the member s have a low engagement level with the community, and once they have the needed information, they often do not return unless they have another need or question. In other cases, however, reading or receiving helpful information from the community leads people to become more engaged with the group. Often members will then begin contributing or answering other people X  X  questions in order to be helpful in return. Peter Kollock outlines three primary motivations for contributing to online communities [16]. Anticipated reciprocity is outlined as motivation to contribute in the expectation that, at some time in the future, useful information will be returned. Increased recognition asserts that quality contributions will increase one X  X  that one X  X  actions or contributi ons will have an effect on the environment or the group as a whol e. We found that all of these motivations come into play as COC visitors move from lurking or learning to sharing. Several of our participants explain that their debut in community posting was a sharing activity. Many describe spending some time lurking and reading other posts, but that their primary motivation for joining was to share their existing knowledge with others. Often these contributions are made to help other participants or for the greater good of the community. In company online communities, sense of efficacy and increased recognition are often dominant motivators for joining the conversation. Some of our Campbell X  X  Kitchen study subjects relay their sharing practices: In addition to sharing knowledge with other people on the site, sometimes individuals want to share something with the company itself. In these cases, customers may have an opinion and they want it to be heard in a public way, so they use the COC as an avenue for openly speaking to the company and its customers. These types of contributions can be negative and positive. In the case of negative comments, indivi duals usually do not contribute much afterwards, either because they are pounced upon by brand advocates within the community or because they are satisfied that they have had an opportunity to share their thoughts on a given subject. One example of this is described by one of our Campbell X  X  participants: Occasionally sharing entails stories about a customer X  X  experience with a product. In the case of MI NI Cooper owners, these can be stories about purchasing their car, road trips, or other experiences that combine the brand with more personal anecdotes. At the Campbell X  X  Kitchen, members often relate their use of Campbell X  X  products to cooking for special dinners, e.g. holidays. In instances such as this, sharing informati on about products or brands opens the door to sharing stories about life in general. Sharing activities often can evolve from brand-based entries to more personal topics of conversation. While not every member will use a company online community as a social network, frequent pos ters often do. All of our study participants were high-volume posters and described their respective COC as a meaningful social community, not just a place for discussing product or brand information. In all cases participants reported that they did not expect to become involved in an online social network on a branded site, but their participation eventually grew into that. When socializing is the member X  X  primary activity, the brand is seen as the  X  X ommon denomin ator, X  providing a means of introduction, but not the subject of all interactions. In addition to brand-related discussion, our par ticipants talk to one another about weather, pets, work, family, vacations, and  X  X ust friendly support and encouragement. X  When asked why she would receive parenting advice on the Campbell X  s soup Web site, one subject stated,  X  X  think those are things you would talk about with your friends, with people that you value their opinion and their thoughts and their guidance. X  Another study participant descri bed the socializing activities as  X  X he same kinds of conversati ons I have with my next-door neighbor. X  Increased socializing often is directly related to increased participation and a gr eater volume of postings, i.e., those who do not post very often on a COC are unlikely to consider it a social place. Members who do post in higher volumes are generally brand advo cates and describe an explicit affinity to the brand. Fellowship is created around familiarity with the brand or product group, although often the online conversation has little to do with brand matters. The COC is considered an important social space for these members, who often check in with each other on a daily basis: Several of our participants characterize using their COCs as a  X  X hat room, X  even when it is not designed as such. And they recount instances during which othe r participants have expressed irritation at the amount of daily chatter unassociated with product information. One annoyed COC member was quoted as saying,  X  X f you don X  X  want to talk about the car, you can go away. X  To which our participant replied th at  X  X his board was about a bunch of people that are here for friends hip and here for a connection to a community. If he didn X  X  want to play by those rules, we really didn X  X  want him around. It doesn X  X  have to be all about the car. X  One of our participants claimed that 90% of his posts were friendship or casual conversati on as opposed to product-related posts. He states,  X  X e X  X e not car friends, we X  X e just friends. X  Another study participant relate s her disappointment that her COC site is not working properly: Regular members of company online communities recount some unique online rituals that have started as a result of fellowship on the site. As mentioned earlier, MINI Owners X  Lounge members often serve each other a daily virtual breakfast. This is a familiar habit for those who frequent the site often, but was construed as a possible detractor to new visitors who might not understand the tradition. One member states,  X  X  think to anyone looking in, it X  X  like we X  X e all old friends and mayb e new people are hesitant. X  In this case, being wary of breaking into an established group may be somewhat intimidating and also increase the number of brand community lurkers. Some COC members we interv iewed reported sharing very personal aspects of their lives w ith their online brand community friends, e.g. parenting issues, divorce, and health matters. One member recounts going through the death of her newborn grandson with her MINI friends. Howard Rheingold reflected in 1993,  X  X  X  X e witnessed people in the virtual community I know best build value, help each other through hard times, solve (and fail to solve) vexing interpersonal problems together. X  Although comp anies may or may not have expected to be supporting these ve ry personal relationships within their brand communities, providing a place for people to gather online can lead to  X  X eart-to-heart contact X  [26]. All of our interviewees expressed an allegiance to their respective brands. For the most part, brand affection or brand advocacy is proportionate to the activity level of COC members.  X  X ou aren X  X  going to find people that don X  X  like Campbell X  X  on the Campbell X  X  Web site, X  one of our participants noted. Negative comments about brand and products are posted on COC, as previously mentioned, but the poster ge nerally does not hang around too long. Several of our participants declared their devotion to a certain product as the introductory common bond shared by COC members. A MINI Owners X  Lounge me mber stated,  X  X he fact that we all have the same car brought us to the same place...We had a common ground, so to speak. X  Brand advocates are self-policing and do not appreciate trash-talking about their brand: The concepts of brand attributes, personality and brand image came up often in our interviews, e ither in discussions of primary attraction to the COC, engagement with the community or in describing COC members. People a pply brand personality to their assumptions about and experience with a company X  X  online community. We also found that brand attributes were used to describe the member populations on the site. The Campbell X  X  Soup Company was founded in 1869 and is recognized in North America for having a family-oriented and wholesome brand image. When discussing their initial entry into and subsequent involvement in the Campbell X  X  Kitchen, characterizations one might use to describe the brand itself. Members made comments such as: MINI Cooper cars and the MINI Cooper brand were portrayed by our interviewees as quirky, funky, cool, and fun. The MINI Owners X  Lounge and its members we re also described in these terms, primarily those relate d to humor and having fun. Participants often mentioned wanting to make each other laugh. Many of them commented about the light-heartedness of the site, and how  X  X un-loving X  the people are: As these comments imply, COC members often expect the character and spirit of the comm unity, as well as its corresponding members, to reflect the brand te nets. In the next section, we outline how to use this awarene ss to better design and construct company online communities that align with brand values. Now that we have a better unde rstanding of how customers use company-sponsored sites, we begi n to see how the design of these communities might better reflect the brand personalities that audiences connect with. Companies spend large amounts of money on marketing and branding e fforts. As they continuously seek to position their brand in the marketplace, their online communities should also reflect their established image. Relating brand attributes through design can rarely be accomplished by simply applying logos to existing applications. Companies looking to establish or improve a COC should consider how features and design will align with their brand. Company online communities are not one-size-fits-all. Celia Pearce has written of online virtual environments,  X  X nce the culture has moved down a particular path ... there's really no way to  X  X ewind X  it and start over. So companies can find themselves with both a cultural and economic disaster on their hands very quickly X  [21]. COC are no different. If a brand community emerges in a fashi on that does not meet visitor expectations for the brand, thos e visitors will likely not return. Bad first impressions are hard to recover from, and potential members are unlikely to return if the community isn X  X  what they expected. Our participants describe several negative experiences with branded online communities they are likely not to visit again: Below we discuss design implicati ons for aligning COC with brand Moderation, Code of Conduct, a nd Topic Structure. We do not specifically discuss graphic desi gn here, but that is an obvious requirement for matching brand identity with any company online presence. When making feature selections for online communities, companies need to consider what their audience will be comfortable doing online as well as what their brand image is in the marketplace. Campbell X  X  Kitchen features ar e designed primarily to support recipe sharing, archiving, and discussion. Campbell X  X  has a well-known history of publishing recipes, so recipe discussion boards fit nicely with pre-established expect ations. Other functionality on the site, such as storyboards and blogs have almost zero traffic. Similarly, the MINI Owners X  Lounge allows for discussions on all things MINI and also allows users to promote MINI clubs and events and post photos. MINI rallies (in-person gatherings) are important to many MINI owners and are often brand-supported functions. Sponsoring events such as these and using the online community to promote and connect people to these events aligns well with MINI X  X  fun brand image. MINI owners also love to look at other MINIs, so the photo gallery feature is popular. Another interesting example of a company online community is Coca-Cola X  X  3-D virtual envir onment CCMetro, which uses the www.there.com platform. This feature selection indicates the Coke brand is aligning to a more technically sophisticated audience. CCMetro also integrates with multi-channel marketing initiatives such as the My Coke Rewards loyalty program. In contrast, a brand such as Campbell X  X  likely does not ha ve a customer base that would be interested in a 3-D virtual envi ronment, nor would those features connect with their more traditional brand image. Member selection criteria for an online community can help people to find  X  X irds of a feather X  [5]. When blogging about key factors for building strong communities, Robert Ko zinets states,  X  X hat if I said the answer was exclusion? What if I said it was about building external boundaries that glorify those who are  X  X n the know X  and keep out the riffraff [17]? X  In Primal Branding, Reis and Reis describe how creating a cheaper Rolex to drive more sales would devalue the Rolex brand. Much of the brand X  X  power lies in its exclusivity [27]. When determining a COC X  X  entrance criteria, or lack of, companies should think about whether exclusivity is a key component of their brand image. The MINI Owners X  Lounge could easily have been created as a MINI Lovers site, but requiring a VIN number retains an exclusivity that reiterates the concept of being part of a special and exclusive club. One of participants reported: In addition to having a love of the vehicle itself, being a part of the MINI  X  X ult X  has additional brand value. Alternately, the Campbell X  X  brand wa s depicted by our participants as  X  X elcoming X  and  X  X eal, X  attributes that are associated with inclusiveness. Campbell X  X  Kitchen members must sign-up to join, but the information required is mini mal. They allow anyone with an e-mail address to become a member of the Campbell X  X  online community. There is little barrier to entry, which enforces the brand X  X  image of being unpretentious. All of our study participants stat ed that moderation is a necessary part of their respective online community. Within company online communities, however, determining the correct level of moderation is important not only for keeping deviant behavior from ruining members X  experience on the site, but because the amount of moderation can reflect the brand X  X  image. Companies should consider how the moderation policy and code of conduct on their site applies to brand personality. What level of freedom should community participants have in their behavior, and how does that relate to the brand? Our study found that site visitors often associate expected behavior and moderation levels to the brand characteristics. In the case of Campbell X  X , particip ants suggested that the company placed strict moderation policies on the site. They also indicated that upon signing up, they anticipated the site to have little if no imprudent content. Members descri bed the community as decidedly self-policing, stating they prefer to keep things  X  X lean. X  We also heard that  X  X ampbell X  X  monitors things really carefully X . These comments reflect the notion that Campbell X  X  is a family-oriented, wholesome brand and their community is as well. The MINI Cooper brand, on the othe r hand, seeks to strike a more irreverent tone and places a heavier emphasis on having fun.  X  X ini has done a good job with not being heavy-handed, X  one participant explained. While not being a free -for-all, the site allows more freedom within discussion areas than does Campbell X  X . In comparison, they let a little more fly. Likewise, moderator activity level and visibility within the community can also speak to the brand image. The Campbell X  X  Kitchen moderators take a very active role in the community by sharing content, participating in discussions, and responding to feedback, suggestions and comp laints. It is not unusual for Campbell X  X  Kitchen moderators, ca lled  X  X itchen Table Hosts X , to contribute to discussions and comm unicate directly with regulars. By comparison, the hands-off style of the MINI moderation policy is reflected in the relative absenteeism of the community moderator. The moderator is  X  X ilent, X  only deletes posts on occasion, and does not contribute to the members X  conversations. The MINI Owners X  Lounge community has jokingly named their hidden moderator  X  X igel, X  and sometimes refers to and taunts  X  X im X  through posts  X  although he never seems to take the bait. Dina Mayzlin defines four non-mutually exclusive company strategies for managing  X  X ocial in teractions X  (SIs).  X  X rdered from most passive to most aggressive, these are (1) Observer : The firm simply collects SI information to learn about its ecosystem; (2) Moderator : The firm fosters SIs; (3) Mediator : The firm actively manages SIs; and (4) Participant : In this most-aggressive role, the firm plays a role in the SIs [10]. In our case study sites, Campbell X  X  has implemented all four strategi es, while MINI has implemented the first two. Companies need to think about these roles and strategies as they pertain to their brand image. In Community Building on the Web, Amy Jo Kim defines Community Standards: Code of conduct in a company online community can be explicitly defined by legally binding terms and conditions, company-specific rules, member agreements and the like. Community guidelines are often defined and agreed to as part of membership. In addition to rules set by the company, community members will often establish their own group tone or code of behavior. In much the same way as mode ration, companies should understand their internal tolerances for user behavior as related to brand personality. The criteria for acceptable conduct within a company online community can obviously vary by brand. Conduct policies should be aligned with brand im age as customer behavior and etiquette expectations will often mirror the brand personality. For example, one of our participants described the Campbell X  X  Kitchen as: Campbell X  X  Kitchen members expect the people and behavior on the site to mimic the brand X  X  respectable image. On the other hand, at the Mini Owners Lounge irreverent,  X  X isqu X  X , flirty or playful posts and comments are not usual. While never lewd or obscene, the Owners X  lounge members have a d ecidedly looser internal conduct policy. In their case, both the company and the members have a higher tolerance level for what is considered acceptable behavior. Visual cues to indicate whether physical communal spaces such as restaurants and bars will be to th eir liking,  X  X s the sign flashing neon or engraved wood? Are there lots of cars parked out front? What sorts of cars? Look in the window: How are people dressed [5]? X  Using the pre-established brand personality is often the virtual equivalent of looking in the window of a company online community. Companies can help to shape the conversations taking place on their site through the topic structure. Some COCs create discussion areas that seek to keep member messages strictly on-topic while others allow more freeform discussions to take place and will set up the topic areas accordingly. The MINI Owners X  Lounge provides a somewhat open-ended section called  X  X etting to Know Fellow Owners X . Here members are allowed to post various topics unrelated to the technical and car-specific discussions posted elsewhere on the site. Some MINI participants refer to the Getting to Know Fellow Owners area as the  X  X aily chat X , and even refer to it as a chat room. Designing an area specifically for  X  X hit chat X  can help keep social conversations out of the technical forums. One of our MINI participants, who appreciated having a separate social forum, noted that another site was  X  X oo  X  X ightly-bound X  to the particular product X . Campbell X  X  Kitchen, on the other hand, limits the amount of off-topic conversations by allowing only one non-cooking related area. The title  X  X i, I X  X .. X  indicates a space for introductions, but not ongoing off-brand conversations. Keeping topic areas and titles product-related or cooking-relate d limits the tendency to have random social conversations. Whethe r or not to design an open topic area is a decision companies need to make and can be influenced by brand personality. Allowing members to talk about topics unrelated to products may be a relevant c onsideration for some brands. The results of this study outline how behavior and participation dynamics in company online communities intersect with brand personality. Using two COCs as cas e studies, we found the primary member activities are: Discovering, Lurking, Learning, Sharing, and Socializing. We discussed the pa rticipation continuum within COC and learned that many who frequent company online communities have a strong relationship with bra nd, often use COCs as a social networks, and associate brand characteristics with their community friends and the site itself. Lastly, we provide design implica tions for companies and designers to consider as they integrate co mmunity features with their online presence. We found that companies can weigh design decisions to better reflect brand image and personality. By carefully considering Feature Selection, Barriers to Entr y, Moderation, Code of Conduct, and Topic Structure, companies can better align their online communities with existing brand philosophy and consumer expectations.
