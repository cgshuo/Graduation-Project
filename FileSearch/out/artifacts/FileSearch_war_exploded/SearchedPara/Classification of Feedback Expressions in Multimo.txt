 Several authors in communication studies have pointed out that head movements are relevant to feedback phenomena (see McClave (2000) for an overview). Others have looked at the application of machine learning algorithms to annotated mul-timodal corpora. For example, Jokinen and Ragni (2007) and Jokinen et al. (2008) find that machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognise some of the functions of head movements, while Reidsma et al. (2009) show that there is a depen-dence between focus of attention and assignment of dialogue act labels. Related are also the stud-ies by Rieks op den Akker and Schulz (2008) and Murray and Renals (2008): both achieve promis-ing results in the automatic segmentation of dia-logue acts using the annotations in a large multi-modal corpus.

Work has also been done on prosody and ges-tures in the specific domain of map-task dialogues, also targeted in this paper. Sridhar et al. (2009) obtain promising results in dialogue act tagging of the Switchboard-DAMSL corpus using lexical, syntactic and prosodic cues, while Gravano and Hirschberg (2009) examine the relation between particular acoustic and prosodic turn-yielding cues and turn taking in a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues. Louwerse et al. (2006) and Louwerse et al. (2007) study the relation between eye gaze, facial expression, pauses and dialogue structure in annotated English map-task dialogues (Ander-son et al., 1991) and find correlations between the various modalities both within and across speak-ers. Finally, feedback expressions (head nods and shakes) are successfully predicted from speech, prosody and eye gaze in interaction with Embod-ied Communication Agents as well as human com-munication (Fujie et al., 2004; Morency et al., 2005; Morency et al., 2007; Morency et al., 2009).
Our work is in line with these studies, all of which focus on the relation between linguistic expressions, prosody, dialogue content and ges-tures. In this paper, we investigate how feedback expressions can be classified into different dia-logue act categories based on prosodic and ges-ture features. Our data are made up by a collec-tion of eight video-recorded map-task dialogues in Danish, which were annotated with phonetic and prosodic information. We find that prosodic fea-tures improve the classification of dialogue acts and that head gestures, where they occur, con-tribute to the semantic interpretation of feedback expressions. The results, which partly confirm those obtained on a smaller dataset in Paggio and Navarretta (2010), must be seen in light of the fact that our gesture annotation scheme comprises more fine-grained categories than most of the stud-ies mentioned earlier for both head movements and face expressions. The classification results improve, however, if similar categories such as head nods and jerks are collapsed into a more gen-eral category.

In Section 2 we describe the multimodal Dan-ish corpus. In Section 3, we describe how the prosody of feedback expressions is annotated, how their content is coded in terms of dialogue act, turn and agreement labels, and we provide inter-coder agreement measures. In Section 4 we account for the annotation of head gestures, including inter-coder agreements results. Section 5 contains a de-scription of the resulting datasets and a discussion of the results obtained in the classification experi-ments. Section 6 is the conclusion. The Danish map-task dialogues from the Dan-PASS corpus (Gr X nnum, 2006) are a collection of dialogues in which 11 speaker pairs cooper-ate on a map task. The dialogue participants are seated in different rooms and cannot see each other. They talk through headsets, and one of them is recorded with a video camera. Each pair goes through four different sets of maps, and changes roles each time, with one subject giving instruc-tions and the other following them. The material is transcribed orthographically with an indication of stress, articulatory hesitations and pauses. In addition to this, the acoustic signals are segmented into words, syllables and prosodic phrases, and an-notated with POS-tags, phonological and phonetic transcriptions, pitch and intonation contours.
Phonetic and prosodic segmentation and anno-tation were performed independently and in paral-lel by two annotators and then an agreed upon ver-sion was produced with the supervision of an ex-pert annotator, for more information see Gr X nnum (2006). The Praat tool was used (Boersma and Weenink, 2009).
 The feedback expressions we analyse here are Yes and No expressions, i.e. in Danish words like ja (yes), jo (yes in a negative context), jamen (yes but, well), nej (no), n X h (no). They can be single words or multi-word expressions.

Yes and No feedback expressions represent about 9% of the approximately 47,000 running words in the corpus. This is a rather high pro-portion compared to other corpora, both spoken and written, and a reason why we decided to use the DanPASS videos in spite of the fact that the gesture behaviour is relatively limited given the fact that the two dialogue participants cannot see each other. Furthermore, the restricted contexts in which feedback expressions occur in these di-alogues allow for a very fine-grained analysis of the relation of these expressions with prosody and gestures. Feedback behaviour, both in speech and gestures, can be observed especially in the person who is receiving the instructions (the follower ). Therefore, we decided to focus our analysis only on the follower X  X  part of the interaction. Because of time restrictions, we limited the study to four different subject pairs and two interactions per pair, for a total of about an hour of video-recorded interaction. As already mentioned, all words in DanPASS are phonetically and prosodically annotated. In the subset of the corpus considered here, 82% of the feedback expressions bear stress or tone informa-tion, and 12% are unstressed; 7% of them are marked with onset or offset hesitation, or both. For this study, we added semantic labels  X  includ-ing dialogue acts  X  and gesture annotation. Both kinds of annotation were carried out using ANVIL (Kipp, 2004). To distinguish among the various functions that feedback expressions have in the di-alogues, we selected a subset of the categories de-fined in the emerging ISO 24617-2 standard for semantic annotation of language resources. This subset comprises the categories Accept , Decline , RepeatRephrase and Answer . Moreover, all feed-back expressions were annotated with an agree-ment feature ( Agree , NonAgree ) where relevant. Finally, the two turn management categories Turn-Take and TurnElicit were also coded.

It should be noted that the same expression may be annotated with a label for each of the three se-mantic dimensions. For example, a yes can be an Answer to a question, an Agree and a TurnElicit at the same time, thus making the semantic classifi-cation very fine-grained. Table 1 shows how the various types are distributed across the 466 feed-back expressions in our data.
 3.1 Inter-coder agreement on feedback In general, dialogue act, agreement and turn anno-tations were coded by an expert annotator and the annotations were subsequently checked by a sec-ond expert annotator. However, one dialogue was coded independently and in parallel by two expert annotators to measure inter-coder agreement. A measure was derived for each annotated feature using the agreement analysis facility provided in ANVIL. Agreement between two annotation sets is calculated here in terms of Cohen X  X  kappa (Co-hen, 1960) 1 and corrected kappa (Brennan and Prediger, 1981) 2 . Anvil divides the annotations in slices and compares each slice. We used slices of 0.04 seconds. The inter-coder agreement figures obtained for the three types of annotation are given in Table 2. Table 2: Inter-coder agreement on feedback ex-pression annotation
Although researchers do not totally agree on how to measure agreement in various types of an-notated data and on how to interpret the resulting figures, see Artstein and Poesio (2008), it is usu-ally assumed that Cohen X  X  kappa figures over 60 are good while those over 75 are excellent (Fleiss, 1971). Looking at the cases of disagreement we could see that many of these are due to the fact that the annotators had forgotten to remove some of the features automatically proposed by ANVIL from the latest annotated element. All communicative head gestures in the videos were found and annotated with ANVIL using a subset of the attributes defined in the MUMIN an-notation scheme (Allwood et al., 2007). The MU-MIN scheme is a general framework for the study of gestures in interpersonal communication. In this study, we do not deal with functional classi-fication of the gestures in themselves, but rather with how gestures contribute to the semantic in-terpretations of linguistic expressions. Therefore, only a subset of the MUMIN attributes has been used, i.e. Smile, Laughter, Scowl, FaceOther for facial expressions, and Nod, Jerk, Tilt, SideTurn, Shake, Waggle, Other for head movements.

A link was also established in ANVIL between the gesture under consideration and the relevant speech sequence where appropriate. The link was then used to extract gesture information together with the relevant linguistic annotations on which to apply machine learning.

The total number of head gestures annotated is 264. Of these, 114 (43%) co-occur with feedback expressions, with Nod as by far the most frequent type (70 occurrences) followed by FaceOther as the second most frequent (16). The other tokens are distributed more or less evenly, with a few oc-currences (2-8) per type. The remaining 150 ges-tures, linked to different linguistic expressions or to no expression at all, comprise many face ex-pressions and a number of tilts. A rough prelim-inary analysis shows that their main functions are related to focusing or to different emotional atti-tudes. They will be ignored in what follows. 4.1 Measuring inter-coder agreement on The head gestures in the DanPASS data have been coded by non expert annotators (one annotator per video) and subsequently controlled by a sec-ond annotator, with the exception of one video which was annotated independently and in parallel by two annotators. The annotations of this video were then used to measure inter-coder agreement in ANVIL as it was the case for the annotations on feedback expressions. In the case of gestures we also measured agreement on gesture segmen-tation. The figures obtained are given in Table 3. feature Cohen X  X  k corrected k face segment 69.89 91.37 face annotate 71.53 94.25 head mov segment 71.21 91.75 head mov annotate 71.65 95.14 Table 3: Inter-coder agreement on head gesture annotation
These results are slightly worse than those ob-tained in previous studies using the same annota-tion scheme (Jokinen et al., 2008), but are still sat-isfactory given the high number of categories pro-vided by the scheme.

A distinction that seemed particularly difficult was that between nods and jerks: although the direction of the two movement types is different (down-up and up-down, respectively), the move-ment quality is very similar, and makes it difficult to see the direction clearly. We return to this point below, in connection with our data analysis. The multimodal data we obtained by combining the linguistic annotations from DanPASS with the gesture annotation created in ANVIL, resulted into two different groups of data, one containing all Yes and No expressions, and the other the subset of those that are accompanied by a face expression or a head movement, as shown in Table 4.

These two sets of data were used for automatic dialogue act classification, which was run in the Weka system (Witten and Frank, 2005). We exper-imented with various Weka classifiers, compris-ing Hidden Naive Bayes, SMO, ID3, LADTree and Decision Table. The best results on most of our data were obtained using Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) (Zhang et al., 2005). Therefore, here we show the results of this classifier. Ten-folds cross-validation was applied throughout.

In the first group of experiments we took into consideration all the Yes and No expressions (420 Yes and 46 No ) without, however, considering ges-ture information. The purpose was to see how prosodic information contributes to the classifica-tion of dialogue acts. We started by totally leav-ing out prosody, i.e. only the orthographic tran-scription (Yes and No expressions) was consid-ered; then we included information about stress (stressed or unstressed); in the third run we added tone attributes, and in the fourth information on hesitation. Agreement and turn attributes were used in all experiments, while Dialogue act anno-tation was only used in the training phase. The baseline for the evaluation are the results provided by Weka X  X  ZeroR classifier, which always selects the most frequent nominal class.

In Table 5 we provide results in terms of preci-sion (P), recall (R) and F-measure (F). These are calculated in Weka as weighted averages of the re-sults obtained for each class. dataset Algor P R F YesNo ZeroR 27.8 52.8 36.5 +stress HNB 47.5 54.1 47.1 +stress+tone HNB 47.8 54.3 47.4 +stress+tone+hes HNB 47.7 54.5 47.3 Table 5: Classification results with prosodic fea-tures
The results indicate that prosodic information improves the classification of dialogue acts with respect to the baseline in all four experiments with improvements of 10, 10.6, 10.9 and 10.8%, re-spectively. The best results are obtained using information on stress and tone, although the de-crease in accuracy when hesitations are introduced is not significant. The confusion matrices show that the classifier is best at identifying Accept , while it is very bad at identifying RepeatRephrase . This result if not surprising since the former type is much more frequent in the data than the latter, and since prosodic information does not correlate with RepeatRephrase in any systematic way.
The second group of experiments was con-ducted on the dataset where feedback expressions are accompanied by gestures (102 Yes and 12 No ). The purpose this time was to see whether ges-ture information improves dialogue act classifica-tion. We believe it makes sense to perform the test based on this restricted dataset, rather than the entire material, because the portion of data where gestures do accompany feedback expressions is rather small (about 20%). In a different domain, where subjects are less constrained by the techni-cal setting, we expect gestures would make for a stronger and more widespread effect.

The Precision, Recall and F-measure of the Ze-roR classifier on these data are 31.5, 56.1 and 40.4, respectively. For these experiments, however, we used as a baseline the results obtained based on stress, tone and hesitation information, the com-bination that gave the best results on the larger dataset. Together with the prosodic information, Agreement and turn attributes were included just as earlier, while the dialogue act annotation was only used in the training phase. Face expression and head movement attributes were disregarded in the baseline. We then added face expression alone, head movement alone, and finally both ges-ture types together. The results are shown in Ta-ble 6. Table 6: Classification results with head gesture features
These results indicate that adding head ges-ture information improves the classification of di-alogue acts in this reduced dataset, although the improvement is not impressive. The best results are achieved when both face expressions and head movements are taken into consideration.

The confusion matrices show that although the recognition of both Answer and None improve, it is only the None class which is recognised quite reliably. We already explained that in our annota-tion a large number of feedback utterances have an agreement or turn label without necessarily having been assigned to one of our task-related dialogue act categories. This means that head gestures help distinguishing utterances with an agreement or turn function from other kinds. Looking closer at these utterances, we can see that nods and jerks often occur together with TurnElicit , while tilts, side turns and smiles tend to occur with Agree .
An issue that worries us is the granularity of the annotation categories. To investigate this, in a third group of experiments we collapsed Nod and Jerk into a more general category: the distinc-tion had proven difficult for the annotators, and we don X  X  have many jerks in the data. The results, dis-played in Table 7, show as expected an improve-ment. The class which is recognised best is still None . In this study we have experimented with the au-tomatic classification of feedback expressions into different dialogue acts in a multimodal corpus of Table 7: Classification results with fewer head movements Danish. We have conducted three sets of experi-ments, first looking at how prosodic features con-tribute to the classification, then testing whether the use of head gesture information improved the accuracy of the classifier, finally running the clas-sification on a dataset in which the head move-ment types were slightly more general. The re-sults indicate that prosodic features improve the classification, and that in those cases where feed-back expressions are accompanied by head ges-tures, gesture information is also useful. The re-sults also show that using a more coarse-grained distinction of head movements improves classifi-cation in these data.

Slightly more than half of the head gestures in our data co-occur with other linguistic utterances than those targeted in this study. Extending our in-vestigation to those, as we plan to do, will provide us with a larger dataset and therefore presumably with even more interesting and reliable results.
The occurrence of gestures in the data stud-ied here is undoubtedly limited by the technical setup, since the two speakers do not see each other. Therefore, we want to investigate the role played by head gestures in other types of video and larger materials. Extending the analysis to larger datasets will also shed more light on whether our gesture annotation categories are too fine-grained for au-tomatic classification.
