In other words, l i is the best possible upper bound for y ilarly, the lower bound k i is defined as follows:

 We consider the following definition of probabilistic compromise: 4. A Bayesian model for on-line max and min auditing
Let q  X f i 1 ; ... ; i l g be an l -query and m  X  max f y m then the user knows that: i 2 q , and determine the probabilistic dependencies among the sensitive values in q .
Proposition 4.1. Let q  X f i 1 ; ... ; i l g # K, then, 8 i (1) then he knows that: each y i y the event space is X  X f X  y i Thus, 8 i j 2 q , the following probabilities hold: Because the user knows the relation (2) then the event space changes into with j X 0 j X  2 l 1.
 By (8), starting from (6) and (7) , the relations (3) and (4) are achieved. h it has verified one of the following cases: 1. y 1  X  8 ; y 3  X  8; 2. y 1 &lt; 8 ; y 3  X  8; 3. y 1  X  8 ; y 3 &lt; 8.

Therefore, j X 0 j X  3 and the user knows: P  X  y i that it has verified one of the following cases: 1. y 1  X  8 ; y 2  X  8 ; y 3  X  8; 2. y 1  X  8 ; y 2  X  8 ; y 3 &lt; 8; 3. y 1  X  8 ; y 2 &lt; 8 ; y 3  X  8; 4. y 1  X  8 ; y 2 &lt; 8 ; y 3 &lt; 8; 5. y 1 &lt; 8 ; y 2  X  8 ; y 3  X  8; 6. y 1 &lt; 8 ; y 2  X  8 ; y 3 &lt; 8; 7. y 1 &lt; 8 ; y 2 &lt; 8 ; y 3  X  8.

Therefore, j X 0 j X  7 and the user knows: P  X  y i

Our model is able to: 1. deny when the privacy is breached (Definition 3.3 ). See Example 4.7 ; 2. deal with  X  X  X uplicate values X  of the sensitive field in an efficient way. See Example 4.8 . In the following examples, we consider Table 1 .

Example 4.7. Let tol  X  0 : 8 be the tolerance value. If the user submits the max query q q
P  X  z the node encoding z 2 has three states because it is in a max and in a min query.
Example 4.8. Let tol  X  0 : 9 be the tolerance value. If the user submits the max query q answers to the queries, the user also knows that max f z 3 need to add the corresponding node, because the information is already captured by the model. 5. Improving the model breached under Definition 3.3 .

If, after t  X  1 queries f q 1 privacy is breached (because z 5  X  4) and the auditor has to deny the answer.
In this case, the user can ask why the auditor provides the answer when P  X  z

 user submits the max query q 2  X f 1 ; 2 g and the auditor provides the answer m query q 3  X f 2 ; 3 g then the auditor has to deny the answer because if he provides the answer m
In this case, the user can ask why the auditor provides the answer to q m &lt; 9 and z 1  X  9. Therefore, in our approach, because if m disclosed, then the answer to q 2 is denied even if, with the actual data  X  m 5.2. Dealing with user background knowledge which we recall the definition: variable X .

Computing probabilities for known sensitive data distribution
In this section, we provide a formal base to compute the probabilities a tion 5.2); improve the definition of probabilistic compromise (see Definition 5.3 ). We assume that:
T is a dataset with n records; the sensitive field Z has r distinct values  X  r 6 n  X  ; the user knows the probability distribution of Z on T , in particular he knows the CDF F if r 2 Z and r &lt; z 8 z 2 Z nf r g then r  X 1 and F Z  X  r  X  X  0. With these assumptions, the following propositions follow: Proposition 5.1. Given M 2 Z, then 8 z 2 Z such that z 6 M, the following probabilities hold: Proof. Given the following events: A  X  X  z 6 M  X  ; B  X  X  z  X  M  X  ;
C  X  X  z &lt; M  X  , By Definition 5.1 , we have: Thus, Eqs. (19) and (20) follow. h Proposition 5.2. Given m 2 Z, then 8 z 2 Z such that z P m, the following probabilities hold: Proof. Given the following events: A  X  X  z P m  X  ; B  X  X  z  X  m  X  ;
C  X  X  z &gt; m  X  , By Definition 5.1 , we have: Thus, Eqs. (21) and (22) follow. h
Proposition 5.3. Given m ; M 2 Z, then 8 z 2 Z such that m Proof. Given the following events: A  X  X  m 6 z 6 M  X  ; B  X  X  z  X  m  X  ; C  X  X  m &lt; z &lt; M  X  ;
D  X  X  z  X  M  X  , By Definition 5.1 , we have: Thus, Eqs. (23) X (25) follow. h

 because the probability to deny is very high.
