 Generating query-biased summaries can take up a large part of the response time of interactive infor mation retrieval (IIR) systems. This paper proposes to use docum ent titles as an alternative to queries in the generation of summaries. The use of document titles allows us to pre-generate summaries statically, and thus, improve the response speed of IIR systems. Our experiments suggest that title-biased summaries are a promising alternative to query-biased summaries.

Early interactive information retrieval (IIR) systems presented the first few sentences of documents in search results. This changed when the advantages of query-biased summaries were shown to be significant [5]. The query-biased summary, or QBS , became a stan-dard feature in the result presentation of search engines.
The methods of generating a QBS vary (e.g., [5, 6]). An early ap-proach [5] was based on a mixture of factors such as the frequency of occurrence of query terms, location of sentences in a document, and/or weighting of sentence words based on HTML tags. A dis-advantage of QBS is the generation-cost at query-time. The sum-mary needs to be generated for every single document presented to a searcher in response to a potentially diverse range of queries. One way to reduce such a cost is to cache the summary for fre-quently submitted queries [6]. Search engines generate the QBS in a satisfactory response time with the machine power of thousands of PCs.

This paper proposes an alternative way of using existing QBS techniques to generate a summary without the cost at query-time.
This work was supported by the MIAUCE project (Ref: IST-033715). Any opinions, findings, and conclusions described here are the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the sponsor. More specifically, we propose t o use document titles as an alter-native to queries. Since we use document titles, the summary can be pre-generated statically. When the summaries are pre-generated, presenting them to the users becomes a simple lookup in a database. We call it a title-biased summary ,or TBS in this paper. For a given document, QBS and TBS will be identical when a query is the title of the document. Therefore, the relative effectiveness of TBS to QBS can be estimated by investigating the effect of query terms in search. To justify the title-biased approach of summary generation, we made three research hypotheses as follows.
H 1 is concerned with the behaviour of existing ranking tech-niques. If H 1 is supported, a document is more likely to be pre-sented to users when query terms appear in the title. We call such a document a query-in-title (QIT) document. H 2 is concerned with the behaviour of searchers. If H 2 is supported, QIT documents are more likely to be accessed to complete search tasks. We found that this hypothesis has already been supported by the work of Clarke, et al. [2]. Their analysis shows that the presence of query terms in document titles of search results affects people X  X  preference of click-through actions. Therefore, we decided to alter our experi-ment to omit H 2 . Finally, H 3 is a summative evaluation of TBS. It should be noted that we do not expect TBS to outperform QBS. An equivalent performance of TBS will be sufficient due to the reduc-tion of resources required at query-time of retrieval.
This section presents the results of our experiments carried out to address the hypotheses H 1 and H 3 as discussed above.
H 1 addressed the behaviour of ranking techniques with regards to the QIT documents. Figure 1 shows the proportion of QIT docu-ments in the top 100 documents retrieved by search engines (Google and Yahoo) and retrieval models (TFxIDF, BM25, and PL2). We used the title of the 100 topics develope d in the HARD track 2005 and 2006 [1] as queries in this analysis. Note that the Aquaint col-lections were used for the retrieval models but not for the search engines.

As can be seen, a high proportion of the documents retrieved by search engines contain a query term in the title of search results. Figure 1: Proportion of QIT documents in the search results. The TFxIDF and BM25 models had a smaller proportion of QIT documents but it still went over 50% at the top 20 documents. PL2 [3], one of the advanced models, had a higher proportion of QIT documents than TFxIDF and BM25. We speculate that such models which are designed to incorporate field weighing (e.g., [4]) will have an a higher proportion of QIT documents, closer to the level of search engines. In summary, H 1 was well supported for the search engines, and partially supported for the retrieval models.
H 3 addressed the effectiveness of two summary generation meth-ods in supporting search tasks. To address H 3 we recruited 9 peo-ple (All were research assistants or research students in Computer Science) and asked them to evaluate the quality of search results presented with the title and summary.

Each subject was presented the description of a HARD Track topic and a randomised list of 10 documents relevant to the topics. They were asked to browse the document list first, then to select a single document that looked most promising to find relevant infor-mation, without accessing the fullte xt. By changing the number of relevant documents shown in the list, we simulated the difficulty of tasks such as P @10 = . 2 , . 4 ,and . 6 . We used the first N (2, 4, or 6) relevant documents retrieved by PL2 [3] for each topic. The non-relevant documents were selected in the same fashion. Sub-jects were informed that the document list was randomised so that the first document did not imply the most relevant.

Each subject was asked to perform the selection task for 12 top-ics randomly selected from 47 topics of the HARD Track 2005 [1] (Three topics had less than six relevant documents, thus, excluded). QBS was generated for six of 12 topics, and TBS was generated for the rest of the topics. We used a version of the summary genera-tion software developed in [7]. The title of the topic descriptions was used for QBS and title of each document was used for TBS. In the search results, the terms appeared in the title of the topic descriptions were highlighted regardless of the summary methods. Finally, the order of summary methods, topics, and baseline levels was randomised for each subject.

The results of the experiment are shown in Table 1. Every sub-jects performed the task in each block twice, and thus, the sample size was 18. We measured the probability of relevant documents selected by subjects as an accuracy, and time taken to make the selection. The standard deviation of the average is shown in the brackets. As can be seen, the accuracy was found to be higher than the baseline, suggesting that subjects were able to identify relevant Table 1: Accuracy of click-through documents and time taken for the selection (N=18) documents from the search results. The average time taken to com-plete the task suggests that they carefully examined the results to make the selection but did not vary much across the baseline lev-els.

We ran a  X  2 test to measure the correlation between the accu-racy and summarisation methods. The accuracy of TBS was found to be significantly better than QBS in P @10 = . 4 ( p = . 03 in the total ( p = . 01 ). This was unexpected. While we must take this result with care due to the sample size, a possible explanation was that the documen t title could be a good source to generate a summary when it was carefully written by the author (i.e., might not apply to some web pages). Clearly, more studies with differ-ent search tasks are needed to support H 3 . However, our results suggest that the title-bia sed summary is a promising alternative to query-biased summary in an ad-hoc search task.
This paper proposed using docum ent titles as an alternative to queries in the generation of document summaries. This allowed us to pre-generate document summaries statically, thus, the response time of a search interface can be reduced to a simple lookup on a database. Our experimental resu lts suggest that title-biased sum-maries are a promising alternative to query-biased summaries, due to the behaviour of existing retrieval systems as well as searchers X  information seeking behaviour. We plan to extend our experiments to other test collections, retrieval models, and search tasks. [1] J. Allan. Hard track overview in trec 2005 high accuracy [2] C. L. A. Clarke, E. Agichtein, S.
