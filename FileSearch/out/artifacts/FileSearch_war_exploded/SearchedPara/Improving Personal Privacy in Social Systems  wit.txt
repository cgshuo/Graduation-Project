 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The recent emergence of social systems has transformed the Web from an information pool to a platform for communication and social interac tion. As such, the issue of managing privacy of various types of user-created content in these open environments has become more of a concern. Existing social systems often define privacy either as a private/public dichotomy or in terms of a  X  X etwork of friends X  relationship, in which all  X  X riends X  are created equal and all relationships are reciprocal. We explore instead the idea of tagging people to create ego-centric groups of dynamic, non-reciprocal relationships to improve privacy management in this domain. In this paper, we introduce the principles and motivations behind people-tagging, discuss constraints that make people-tagging safe, trustable, and spam-free, describe a research implementation we have created to experiment with the concept, and provide the results of a preliminary empirical evaluation which shows the strength of the idea and indicates areas for future enhancements. H.5.3 [Information In terfaces and Presentation]: Group and Organization Interfaces  X  Web-based interaction. Design, Experimentation Social systems, people-tag ging, information sharing, privacy. Social systems are a new generation of Web 2.0 applications, characterized by their primarily user-driven content and the ability to mediate personal and social information across collectivities such as teams, communities, and organizations . The recent growth and adaptation of social system s for personal and social information management has created new opportunities for users to be producers as well as consumers of information. These applications (i.e. del.icio.us 1 , Facebook 2 ) not only allow their users to create personal information spaces that are easily accessible from anywhere on the Web, but also give them the tools to share their personal artifacts with others and take advantage of others' shared artifacts. However, personal artifacts managed by social tools may span a wide range of types, from ones X  contact information and interests to his/her social network, bookmarks, photos, and scholarly work, and not everything is to be shared with everyone. Recent research in the area of knowledge management has recognized the need to improve people's ability to control who sees what from the information they dispose in their online personal spaces [1]. Nevertheless, the topic of personal privacy (how people manage privacy of their information with respect to other individuals, as opposed to large organizations [6]) is not fully explored in the research literature. From a user X  X  point of view, the primary concern in managing information sharing is the ability to define the particular audience for each piece of artifact or personal attribute, generally in terms of a group of others who one Traditionally, group definition for access control has been based on organizational roles [10] or equivalent (i.e. task [12]). These schemes rely on the existence of a central administrator to define and manage groups, assign access rights to each, and maintain access control lists on objects. No such administration exists in social systems, and even if the user himself was to take on the role of the administrator, the act of specifying who should have access to what under what condition would quickly become a burden, to the point of sharing either everything or nothing at all. Alternatively, in social systems access control is often defined either as a private/public dichotomy or in terms of a  X  X etwork of http://del.icio.us http://www.facebook.com friends X  relationship, in which all  X  X riends X  are created equal and all relationships are reciprocal. But, proper management of personal privacy requires that the potential audience for user X  X  artifacts or attributes be defined in user X  X  own terms, based on a variety of kinds of relationships, some of which might be one-sided. The purpose of this work is to explore if people-tagging could be a viable approach for enabling users to define egocentric groups of friends or collaborators, to which they can grant or deny access to vari ous pieces of information in their personal space. We descri be the general idea and the motivation behind people-tagging, and introduce OpnTag , social utility we developed to experiment with the concept. Finally, we present the results of a preliminary empirical evaluation of the approach, which shows the strength of the idea and indicates areas for future improvements. One of the challenges in categorizing target audiences for various personal artifacts in social systems is supporting the subtle and nuanced ways in which our patterns of trust change over time and the ways in which this interacts with our transactional approach to information sharing and exchange. For users of social tools, sharing information is about establishing and maintaining a dynamic sharing relationship. As such, they need flexible and lightweight mechanisms for categorizing thei r network in terms of their (often changing) relationships with others. We believe that the same folksonomic organization model that works for information categorization can be adapted for organizing relationships, and that the tagging model has certain characteristics that make it a suitable candidate for facilitating relationship management for selective information sharing:  X  Many tags (and thus relationships) can be associated with each person  X  The choice of tags is entirely in the control of the tagger  X  The act of tagging is simple, intuitive and well-adapted to granular relationships, and  X  The collections created by co incidental tagging (i.e. all people tagged with the same word) form natural categories. These characteristics make people-tagging a possible approach for relationship management. Our idea is to treat each tagged category of people as a relationship group that can be used as an access contro l feature. We also suggest that the visibility of these people-tag groups should be controlled, i.e. one should be able to designate who should be able to see the people s/he has tagged as "friend", thus making it reasonably safe to  X  X pinion-tag X  others. Tagging people can be used for both signaling assessment of others (i.e. tagging someone as  X  X ifted X ) and signaling relationships (i.e. tagging someone as  X  X olleague X ). Each tagger might assign multiple tags to the same taggee, and multiple taggers can tag a taggee with the same tag, but only one instance of each tag for each taggee is allowed. We also differentiate between one X  X  Incoming and outgoing tags: incoming tags are those assigned to the user, while outgoing tags are those the user has assigned to others. The use of social tagging for information classification and annotation has been the topic of much recent research. However, the concept of tagging people (as opposed to tagging web resources) has received relatively little attention in comparison, with the two most notable exceptions being Fringe Contacts project from IBM [2, 3], and Tagalag 3 . In Fringe, social tagging of people is used to support contact management and augmenting employee profiles in an enterprise directory. The application puts same emphasis on tagging self as well as others, which enables employees to place themselves and their fellow employees in a folksonomy of skills, interests and projects. Since the application is targeted to the enterprise environment where tags are traceable to people X  X  identity, only public tags are supported. Tagalag is another project which uses people-tagging for the purpose of self-promotion and finding others with similar interests. Tagalag enables users to tag others based on their email address and can be integrated with web based email systems. Prior research has also indicated that users use people-tagging to define and socially manage communities. A recent study [4] showed that us ers frequently tagged people for the benefit of others, shared links with tag-based groups of people, and used tags to construct ad hoc mailing lists. Marlow et al [8] report on a survey of social tagging systems and specify six user incentives for tagging content , including future retrieval, contribution and sharing, attracting attention, play and competition, self presentation, and opinion expression. From this perspective, our work adds to the tagging literature by introducing an incentive for tagging people and exploring users X  perceptions of it. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider tagging people for relationship management and by extension, for privacy management. Also, private or restrictedly shared people tags have not previously been addressed in the literature. From a theoretical point of view, Palen and Dourish [9] have clarified the difference between the problem of personal information privacy a nd that of access control, by arguing that personal privacy is a continuous process of negotiating boundaries of disclosure, identity, and time, rather than a definitive entitlement. They observe that people in social systems may act simultaneously in different http://www.tagalag.com spaces: as individuals, as memb ers of a family, members of some occupational group, etc. In each of these affiliations, they may choose to disclose different information to different audiences. Therefore we distinguish privacy management, as the user-centered expression of these constraints on information sharing from access control, which is the means by which the system(s) enable and enforce these choices. Palen and Dourish then expose the unsuitability of existing access control models for privacy management since the conventional separation of one X  X  network into  X  X  X oles X  X  (as done by existing access control models) fails to capture the fluid nature of these various genres of disclosure in which one acts. The real problem with personal privacy in social systems then is how to reconcile the co-presence of various groups that one identifies with, in terms of what to share with whom, in a flexible and straight-forward way. It is this problem that our work is trying to address, by providing a user-centred mechanism for controlling access to the vast amount of user-created content that exist in social systems. In order to explore the idea of people-tagging for relationship management and how it can be used for managing personal privacy, we implemented the concept in an experimental social utility. OpnTag [7, 11] is an open source web application for note taking and book marking we developed to experiment with various aspects of personal information management in social contexts. The fundamental unit of information storage in OpnTag is the memo , a tagged textual annotation that may optionally link to a web resource. Users can create memos to save notes or bookmark URLs; browse and tag other users X  shared memos to mark their interest in them; and reply to other users X  memos to create a conversation. An important aspect of OpnTag is providing functionality to restrict the visibility of one X  X  memos to a certain group , including the private group consisting only of oneself (Figure 1). OpnTag supports two kinds of groups: 1. Classic, invitation-only groups (similar to google or 2. Egocentric groups created as a result of tagging people, OpnTag's privacy management model centers on the joint concepts of ownership and audience management. For each memo, the creator can specify the memo X  X  owner , which controls who owns the memo and thus can edit and delete it, and its audience , which controls who can see that the memo exists and read it. Audience restriction is the fundamental mechanism for selective sharing in OpnTag: when creating a memo, the user has access to both his classic group memberships and his relationship tags and can thus set the audience of the me mo to either a classic group s/he is a member of or one of these egocentric groups (Figure 4). Figure 3 shows how the concept of people-tagging is implemented in OpnTag. When visiting another user's profile page, a user can tag the profile owner with keywords that represent his/her perception of that user (i.e.  X  X uby expert X ) or their relationship ( X  X esearch fellow X ). In the same way that tagging resources both identifies and groups them (e.g. all memos tagged  X  X ails X  can be treated as a group), each such people-tag represents a relationship group that will later appear as an access control option for each of the tagging user X  X  memos (Figure 4). Each new tag applied to a person has a distinctly specifiable visibility. The choices for people tag visibility include only the tagger, only the taggee, only the set of people tagged with the same tag (by the same tagger),  X  X sers X , and  X  X nyone X , with the default visibility set as private (tagger only). Significantly, a single tag may have different visibility to different taggees (e.g. I may not want to share my assessment of others as  X  X nteresting X  with everyone I assess as such). However, in no case can the tagger make a tag visible to anyone other than the taggee without also making it visible to the taggee himself. Since all such tags are visibly attributed to the tag creator, this design choice was made to discourage antisocial tagging by forcing such taggings to be exposed to their subjects (e.g. I can't let my friends know that I've tagged someone as a  X  X erk X  without letting the  X  X erk X  know too). Unlike classic groups in which membership is voluntary, people-tags are assigned and removed by the tagger without a confirmation process for the taggee (and possibly without even notification). As such, th e relationship groups that are created as a result of people-tagging are entirely controlled by the creator; meaning people do not need to agree to be in the group, and they may not even know that they are included in a certain relationship group. An important implication of users being able to assign their acquaintances to different relationship gro ups (potentially without their knowledge or approval) is the opportunity for handling some social situations that ar e generally hard to handle in online world. One example of such situation is discretely concealing exclusions; i.e. I may want my  X  X riends X  (i.e. those others I have tagged with  X  X riends X ) to see that they are included and have special privileges to my information store as a result, but non-friends should not be visibly excluded. In OpnTag this situation can be handled by making the  X  X riends X  tag visible only to the people tagged as such. OpnTag also supports the concep t of social scoping, in the way that the same tag applied by different users will result in two distinct relationship groups. For example, people tagged  X  X riends X  by user A will comprise a different relationship group than people tagged  X  X riends X  by user B. Furthermore, both of these relationship groups will be independent of the classic group  X  X riends X , if either A or B are a member of such group. Figure 5 shows the incoming and outgoing tag clouds on a user X  X  profile page, typographically modulated based on the tag frequency. Different color codes imply various degrees of visibility. It is possible to pivot on the incoming or outgoing tags, both individually and collectively, to have various filtered views; i.e. all people who have used a certain tag (or a combination of tags) on this user, all people this user has tagged with a certain tag (or a combination of tags this user has applied to a certain user. In order to investigate how people tagging is understood and utilized by users in the context of personal and social information management, we performed an empirical study to evaluate the feature in terms of both utility and usability. Our goal was to address the following questions: 1. Does people-tagging enhance OpnTag privacy 2. Is the feature intuitive and easy to use for users, enough 3. What are the constraints that would make people-To find answers to these questions, we conducted a lab study with ten participants. The study consisted of three phases: an initial survey, user observation, and semi-structured interviews. The next sections provide a detailed description of the evaluation process and the results that were gained from it. We started our evaluation process by conducting an online survey with 10 questions covering general areas of users X  demographics (sex, age, education level), profession, expertise with computers and the Internet, plus specific questions on their familiarity with popular social systems (i.e. LinkedIn 4 , Orkut 5 , Facebook, or other) and the privacy management feature in them. The survey also included questions aimed at identifying users X  privacy attitude, i.e. what information they feel comfortable to reveal about themselves in social applicati ons they use and whether they have ever experienced privacy violation problems in the past. A survey request was dist ributed via email to mailing lists and social connections of existing OpnTag users. 18 people who received the invitation responded to the survey. Respondents came from diverse backgrounds. From this population, we invited a smaller sample (6 male and 4 female) for closer observation during a one-hour session. All the analysis that comes in the following sections is based on the data gathered from this set of 10 people. The criteria for choosing participants for the sample set included: 1. Some familiarity with social systems (i.e. at least using 2. Some concern for privacy (i.e. at least considering Figure 6 summarizes participants X  familiarity with social systems and figure 7 shows a summary of participants X  privacy concerns. Also, since OpnTag is designed for personal and social information management across a wide variety of usage contexts, we aimed for recruiting participants with diverse backgrounds, including both technical and non-technical b ackgrounds. All participants had some university education, with 7 participants having a graduate degree and 3 an undergraduate degree. Table 1 shows a summary description of the participants in our study. https://www.linkedin.com http://www.orkut.com None of our participants had used OpnTag before. On average, participants reported using various social systems for 6 hours per week. None had any special expertise related to privacy; however, when reflecting on their experiences with privacy management in applications they used, 7 participants said they find the feature useful and have used it at some point. 6 said although they consider privacy management mechanisms necessary, they often find them too difficult and/or time consuming to use. 5 said they don X  X  trust social systems to put their private information there. Only 2 participants said they think social systems provide adequate privacy management. 7 out of 10 participants reported experiencing privacy violation at some point while using social systems, either as a result of their own action or others. For the second stage of the study, each of the ten selected participants was invited for a one-hour session. After giving informed consent, participants were given a brief introduction to OpnTag and its privacy management mechanism. After clarifying potential questions, each participant was asked to login to OpnTag as an imaginary persona and perform a set of pre-defined tasks, each involving creating memos of various degrees of sensitivity and sharing them with various people in the imaginary persona X  X  social and/or professional network. The tasks were selected to represent the kinds of personal and social information management that real users might perform while using OpnTag. For each ta sk, participants needed to decide: 1. The appropriate owner and au dience for the memo they 2. Whether to use classic or ego-centric groups Participants were allowed to make any changes to the persona X  X  information space that they felt necessary for the purpose of carrying out the tasks; including creating, modifying, or deleting groups and/or people-tags, or changing the visibility of their groups/group members/people-tags. When conducting user studies, it is a challenge to ensure that the participants are repres entatives of real users, that they are put in settings that match expected usage, and that the tasks are designed as realistically as possible [6]. The initial survey helped us address the first challenge, by identifying participants that relate to and care about privacy issues in social systems. To address the other two key challenges, we needed to come up with usage scenarios that had a high degree of realism for our respondents. Since the goal of OpnTag is facilitating information management and sharing across a variety of personal, professional, and social contexts, this meant that we needed to design tasks in a way to cover a variety of information sharing scenarios in each of our participants X  personal, pr ofessional, and social life. To address this challenge, we used users X  demographic data (gathered through the initial survey) to align usage scenarios to participants X  varying professional backgrounds. In order to have greater confidence of the validity of the results, we decided to develop four sets of scenarios, each matching a sub-group of participants X  professional backgrounds. Each set included 5 tasks, starting from rather easy tasks towards the more difficult ones. We considered the following criteria in designing the sets: 1. That the tasks in each set cover information sharing 2. That the tasks in each set ar e meaningful to the sample 3. That the tasks in each set require using both classic Tables 2 through 5 provide a description of the four sets of scenarios used in this study. The first set (set A  X  personal scenarios) was used as a practice set for all participants to familiarize them with the nature of the tasks that were expected in the course of the study. While performing tasks in this set, participants were encouraged to ask questions if they needed clarification. Upon completion of tasks in set A, participants were asked to complete the tasks in a second set all on their own (i.e. with out receiving comments or clarifications). The decision on which set to give to the participant at this stage was made based on participant professional background as stated in the initial survey: participants 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 were given set B scenarios, situated in a corporate environm ent. Participants 2, 4, and 8 were given set C scenarios, situated in an academic setting. And finally, participants 1 and 7 were given set D scenarios, situated in a me dical office environment. The participants were encouraged to think aloud while going through the tasks, which would help us understand why they do things a certain way and assist in identifying potential sources of problems. 1 You try a new restaurant and want to recommend it to 2 Your kid has been diagnosed with head lice. You find 3 You find a good resource on supporting math activities 4 You want to arrange a play date for your kid with a 5 You want to invite 2 certain kids to your kid X  X  birthday 1 Team A is collaboratively working on a new design. 2 You have been to a business trip and are preparing a 3 The report is complete and you want to share it with 4 You are working on a new development with your 5 You want to endorse a certain team member to your 1 You want to share a paper draft with your advisor. 2 You find a link to some job resources 3 You want to keep notes on ideas for potential papers 4 You are attending a conference and want to record 5 You come across a paper at www.Apaper.com and 1 You want to create a space where everyone writes 2 A new treatment procedure is available at 3 There is a new office policy (change of rates) that all 4 There has been a tax issue that you want to share with 5 A patient has complaints about a specific practitioner. Upon completion of the scenarios, we engaged each participant in a semi-structu red, in-depth interview, specifically aimed at iden tifying the strengths and weaknesses of the people-tagging functionality and constraints that would make the feature more useful and usable. The general format of the interview was to use participant X  X  actions during the tasks as a starting point for the interview and trying to cover a number of topics. In all cases, we made sure to seek participants X  answers to the following questions: Q1) How did they decide when to use classic group functionality and when to use people-tagging? Q2) What is their opinions about the visibility options for people-tags: do they find all the five visibility options useful, or would they be more inclined to use either public or private tags most of the times? Q3) Would they be comfortable with the idea of other people assigning tags to them without explicit permission, or whether they think some sort of control on the part of taggee would be necessary? The open nature of the semi-structured interviews enabled us to gather ratings of usefulness and usability from the first-time users, probe for th e reasons behind the ratings, and discuss opportunities for improvements. An interesting result of using this methodology was evolution of new ideas from participants that were not part of our interview questions (as discussed in the following sections). However, a discussion guide was used throughout the interviews to ensure consistency and reliability, and to eliminate potential bias on th e part of the researcher. RESULTS This section presents the result of our evaluation process. While we discuss the results, two points are important to note: First, for most tasks, there were more than one correct way to complete the task with no certain right or wrong. For example, to share something w ith only one person (a task presented in all four sets), user could either create a classic group (either public, private, or semi-private) consisted of him/herself and the receiver, or use a tag on the receiver (again either a public, restrictedly shared, or private tag) to create an egocentric group, w ith both paths resulting the disclosure of the created memo to the right audience. Second, although the privacy management requirements for the tasks in each set were similar, participants employed different privacy management strategies based on their own privacy attitude and concern. For example, participant 2 considered a potential job reso urce (task C.2) a private data, while participant 8 considered it appropriate to share. Likewise, participant 5 thought that the resource on head lice (task A.2) must be shared with parents of kids in the same class, while others pref erred to keep it private. We considered the outcome  X  X orrect X  as long as users X  actions resulted achieving the  X  X ight X  level of privacy; i.e. exposing the created memo to the intend ed audience as mentioned by the user in the think aloud procedure. In this section, using both our observations and partic ipants X  feedback, we reflect on intuitiveness and suitability of the people-tagging feature in enhancing users X  privacy management experiences across the various usage scenarios. Comparing Classic Group and People-Tagging Functionality The two main distinctive features of people-tagging over traditional group functionality for privacy management are that: 1. People-tagging is user-centered; meaning the tagger 2. People-tagging is lightweight and dynamic; people tags In order to find out how users compared people-tagging with group functionality, we asked our participants how they decided which feature to use for any of the scenarios. Participants X  answers to this question showed that overall, people-tagging fared well as a fairly new concept: although all participants said they needed the practice session to grasp the concept, they were all able to perform tasks in set B, C, or D on their own, properly using either group or people-tagging functionality to create the right audience for the memos as described in each task. Users also mentioned that the people-tagging functionality made it easier for them to perform the tasks (compared to having to do it all with classic groups only). Table 6 shows some of participants X  comments comparing people-tagging and group functionality, which show that they understood the distinction and the added functionality and control provided by people-tagging. 2 Group is for longer term communication when you 6 Group is for ongoing communication, whereas 9 People-tagging is on-the-fly, temporary, dynamic. 4 My groups are like forums or communities; with 3 I will use group if I want to share with everyone; I 1 I say I classify people this way and I can put my Suitability of Visibility Options There were some variations among participants on their choice of the visibility level for people tags they created. Overall, we observed that users were more inclined to make their tags private or semi-private rather than public. We asked participants to reflect on their choices and explain how they decided to assign a certain visibility to a tag. 8 out of 10 participants said they think that in general, people tags should be exposed to the minimum audience possible (i.e. just tagger or tagger + taggee). 2 participants said they might occasionally disc lose a people tag to others similarly tagged, but only if the situation requires it. The rationale behind this argument was that participants mainly considered people tags as th eir personal opinion about others. As such, did not see any reason or need to share this with others, even with the subject of that opinion. An exception to this argument cam e from two of our enterprise participants: although this gr oup agreed that people tags should not be shared unless there is a certain need to do so, they could envision situations in the workplace where that need would be present. Examples included to mark someone as the  X  X oto X  person for a certain job, and to specify who is currently in char ge for tasks that are handled by different people at different times (e.g. who is writing automated tests right now?). These two participants thought public people tags would be extremely useful in such cases, providing valuable, time-saving information, specially to someone who is new to the corporation. Taggee X  X  Control on Incoming Tag Cloud Next, we asked participants to imagine using the people-tagging feature in a social system they are familiar with (i.e. Facebook): would they feel co mfortable with the idea of others tagging them without their confirmation or even knowledge? 9 out of 10 participants said they think some sort of control on taggee X  X  part would be necessary if they are going to adopt people-tagging as part of their daily information management activities. One participant, however, thought that since people tags don X  X  give the tagger any privilege over taggee X  X  data, it is OK to leave the feature as it is. It is important to note, though, that this particular participant was envisioning the feature in an enterprise setting, where transparency (the ability to link the tags to tagger X  X  identity) would be a natural barrier to anti-social tagging. We then followed up with the other 9 participants by asking which of the following control options they consider most appropriate: 1. Asking for taggee X  X  confirmation for incoming tags 2. Giving taggee the ability to delete his/her unwanted 3. Giving taggee the ability to change the visibility of Among these, the confirmation option was most popular, voted for by 8 out of the 9 participants as having the least social implication. Only one participant said she would find it awkward not to confirm an incoming tag, especially if it is from someone she knows, and would prefer the ability to delete unwanted tags at a later time. The 8 participants who preferred the confirm option said they find the delete option  X  X oo reactive X  and  X  X ather pointless X  (because the tag has already been exposed). None of the participants thought the ability to change the visibility of an incoming tag (i.e. to make it more restrictive) would be useful. They thought there is no point in changing visibility considering that the tagger can change it back. Also, they all found it natural for the tag visibility to be tagger X  X  choice,  X  X uch like the CC option in email X  as one participant put it. Although in the trade-off between keeping the current lightweightness and flexibility of the feature vs. having more control over tags applied to them the majority of participants opted for more control, some were able to come up with compromises (control options other than the ones we suggested) to keep the benefits of both worlds. One participant mentioned that she only thinks confirmation is necessary because currently in OpnTag anyone can tag anyone. She suggested limiting the ability of tagging someone only to his/her social network, since one X  X  social network would probably know him/her enough not to use any inappropriate tags. Another participant said he would find a simple notification of the incoming tags good enough and wouldn X  X  need a confir mation mechanism, an option that would keep the flexibility of the feature intact while providing the taggee with some awareness. Usability of the Interface We observed that the path to tagging a user was not completely intuitive to all our subjects. Although on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 indicating the worst performance and 5 indicating the best), users ranked the ease of use of the people-tagging functionality at 4.2 (with min = 3 and max = 5), all ten participants consistently reported two aspects of the interface problematic: 1. The fact that users needed to navigate to a user X  X  2. Also, our participants found the path to navigate to a Other desirable options mentioned by participants included the ability to  X  X ag a number of users at the same time X  (mentioned by 6 participants) and the ability to  X  X efine new tags in place X  at the audience pull-down menu, similar to Gmail labels (mentioned by 3 participants). DISCUSSION Our evaluation results indicated that people-tagging could potentially enhance OpnTag X  X  privacy management mechanism by enabling new social interactions that are not supported by current tools, such as transient/occasional information sharing and definition of nuanced social networks. We were particularly encouraged by the fact that after a fast learning curve, users seemed to understand the difference between privacy management through classic groups vs. people-tagging and appreciate the added utility that the people-tagging fe ature provided, which was promising for a fairly new concept. Compatibility with Users X  Mental Model Perhaps the most interesting outcome of the evaluation process was the indication that the underlying cognitive model behind tagging people for privacy management was a suitable match for users' mental model of personal privacy. Our participants were able to understand the implications of their privacy decisions to the point of making sophisticated observations and creative suggestions about the people-tagging model after only half an hour of controlled interaction with the system. This strongly suggests the advantages of this model over the existing models of privacy in cu rrent social systems. Current privacy models for soci al software suffer from two major problems: they either define privacy management as a private/public dichotomy, ignoring the various other shades of privacy in between (e .g. del.icio.us), or they are complicated and cumbersome fo r the average users, to the point that they can not always predict the consequences of their privacy decisions (e.g . Facebook). People-tagging seems to address both of thes e problems by giving users a simple, well-defined framewor k, which they can use to confidently define and reason about privacy policies. However, a deeper study that compares the expressiveness, understandability and predictability of these different approaches should be undertaken for a more grounded comparison. Study Limitations There are a few limitations to the study that must be taken into account when interpreting the results. Ideally, we would have liked to perform a field evaluation of the people-tagging feature with real users using OpnTag application and the people-ta gging feature in real-life information sharing situations. However, although OpnTag has been in small field trials within two pilot groups [7], the privacy management mechanisms were not used extensively in either of the test deployments. This might be attributed partly to the context of use for the field trials (one educational, one in a small team of collaborators) and partly to the fact that privacy and security features are usually appropriated late in the learni ng curve of an application, often after some unexpected security or privacy  X  X ncident X  [6]. In the absence of rich, meanin gful data from real users using the system in real-life situations, we opted for a lab evaluation instead. While our laboratory evaluation was effective at getting users X  initial feedback, it came with some inherent limitations. First of all, even though we tried to recruit participants of varying background to cover usage scenarios across a variety of contexts, our representative sample was a small one. Also, while in our scenarios we tried to mimic various information sharing situations as realistically as possible, b ecause participants were not dealing with their own data, they might not have been as motivated as in real life and as a result, not making the same effort to protect privacy of their data. We also believe that while general feedback was positive, there might be social implicati ons that didn X  X  show up in this limited study and may show up after the people-tagging feature has been in use for a prolonged time; i.e. tag maintenance and space pollution (spam). All points indicate that to ensure suitability of the people-tagging functionality for improving personal privacy across a wide range of privacy needs over time, a longitudinal evaluation in the field might be necessary. We explored the concept of tagging people for enhancing personal privacy in social systems. We showed how people-tagging enables users to categor ize their social network into groups of target audiences for their information in terms of their (often changing) relationships with them, by creating one-sided, egocentric, user-defined social relationship groups to which they can grant or deny access to various pieces of information in their personal space. A preliminary empirical evaluation provided initial validation of the feasibility of the concept and helped revealing users X  ideas regarding how to make the feature more useful and usable for their everyday privacy management; however, further evaluation is required to validate the approach in a natural usage environment. Our immediate next step is to rectify interface usability problems by incorporating the feedback received during the evaluation process. In addition, work is already under way to enhance the people tagging functionality in OpnTag in several ways, including people-tagging for groups in addition to individual (e.g.  X  X orporate X X  X  Customers X ) and combination of two or more people-tags as an access control option (e.g.  X  X riends &amp; family X ). A longitudinal field evaluation is also part of our future plans. 1. Erickson, T., From PIM to GIM: Personal Information 2. Farrell, S., Lau, T.: Fringe contacts: People-tagging for 3. Farrell, S.
