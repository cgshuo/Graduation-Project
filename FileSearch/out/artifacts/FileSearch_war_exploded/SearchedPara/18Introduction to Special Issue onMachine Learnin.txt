 In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in novel uses of machine learning for business applications. These applications cover a wide range of traditional as well as new business activities from intelligent customer segmentation for direct marketing to intelligent stock market analysis and the analysis of the long tail in the new Web-based economy. Innovative machine-learning techniques that make use of different aspects of newly emerged business data, such as customer feedback and behavior data and social network data are under development.

To further foster the advances of the most recent and exciting work on machine learn-ing for business applications, we initiated this special issue. The response to our call for papers was very strong. After careful reviews of the submissions by international experts in the area, we have selected six articles for this special issue.
Since the theme of the special issue is business applications, which relates to money, three of the six articles are about applying machine learning and data mining to the financial market.

In  X  X rediction in Financial Markets: The Case for Small Disjuncts X , Vasant Dhar proposes that a counterintuitive method of learning many small disjuncts instead of a single model can provide a credible model for financial market prediction, a problem with a high degree of noise. His results suggest that for problems characterized by a high degree of noise and lack of a stable target concept, which are widespread in many real-world applications, constructing sets of small rules and then reconstructing them periodically is a promising approach.
 In  X  X  Learning-Based Contrarian Trading Strategy via a Dual-Classifier Model X , Szu-Hao Huang et al. first discuss a return anomaly proposed by behavioral finan-cial experts called overreaction. Overreaction means that the past winning and losing stocks will have return reversal after a holding period of certain lengths. This phe-nomenon can be exploited in automatic trading approaches including the contrarian trading strategy. The authors develop a novel dual-classification method for the con-trarian trading strategy to improve the reliability of predicting stocks with the return reversal to form better portfolios. Various experiments showed that their system can increase the returns of portfolios impressively. However, their method does not consider the transaction cost in stock trading.

In  X  X ORN : Correlation-Driven Nonparametric Learning Approach for Portfolio Se-lection X , Li et al. present a statistical correlation-based method named CORN to select the best stocks to form new portfolios. CORN is tested thoroughly on four real-world market datasets (two of which are up-to-date). CORN is shown to significantly out-perform the market index and other previous stock selection techniques. However, the performance of CORN does seem to be reduced dramatically when the trading cost is considered.

Social network analysis has drawn significant attention in recent years, mainly due to the huge popularity of online social networking sites and the availability of social network data. However, there is a gap between the techniques developed by the data mining research community and their deployment in real-world applications.
In the article  X  X ocial Network Analysis and Mining for Business X , Bonebi et al. present an overview of the key problems and techniques in social network analysis from the perspective of business applications. They start by outlining areas of research in the context of a specific business-process classification framework. They then gave an overview of the main problems and survey the state-of-the-art approaches. The article provides a good guideline for researchers when they begin to investigate mining the rich information from social networks.

The last two articles are about mining consumer behavior for online and traditional companies.

Today X  X  online shoppers rely heavily on the customer reviews of products before making purchasing decisions, and they often have to go through a large amount of un-structured review information. In the article  X  X  Helpfulness Modeling Framework for Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Consumer-Opinion Platforms X , Zhang and Tran propose a probabilistic framework (with the graphical model and EM algorithm) for modeling the helpfulness of the reviews. Their method can estimate the probability distribution of the helpfulness of reviews, thus providing more reliable and useful information for consumers in making purchasing decisions.

Finally, in  X  X ulti-Focal Learning for Customer Problem Analysis X , Yong Ge et al. present so-called multi-focal learning for mining customer log data. The key idea is to divide the training data into different subsets and in so doing, different models can be learned within each subset. This method can be effective when the train-ing dataset consists of several different groups with divergent characteristics. The authors found that the problem-reporting logs from the experienced and novice cus-tomers exhibit divergent data distributions. Of course, the nontrivial and key issue is how to partition the data into such groups, as this in itself is a learning prob-lem. For the problem-log data and some artificial datasets, the authors showed that the proposed ontology-enhanced, correlation-based multi-focal learning method works well.

We hope that this special issue provides readers with some of the most recent and advanced research and applications on business use of machine learning and data mining techniques. We also hope that these selected articles can be a source of new knowledge and assurance that machine learning can indeed be profitably applied and deployed in many business applications of various domains and industries.

We would like to thank all of the authors who submitted articles to this special section. We are grateful to all of the referees for their careful reviews and constructive comments within a short timeframe.
