The tutorial aims to provide the IR researchers with an un-derstanding of how the patent system works, the challenges that patent searchers face in using the existing tools and in adopting new methods developed in academia.

At the same time, the tutorial will inform the IR re-searcher about the unique opportunities that the patent do-main provides: a large amount of multi-lingual and multi-modal documents, the widest possible span of covered do-mains, a highly annotated corpus and, very importantly, relevance judgements created by experts in the elds and recorded electronically in the documents.

The combination of these two objectives leads to the main purpose of the tutorial: to create awareness and to encourage more emphasis on the patent domain in the IR community.
Table 1 provides details on how the tutorial covers the topics of the SIGIR conference.

PhD Students, junior and senior researchers looking for a new challenge for their algorithms. In terms of general IR, the audience can have any level: beginner, intermediate or advanced. In terms of patent IR, the audience is expected to consist of novices in the domain.
The tutorial starts by introducing the attendees to the patent system. We discuss how it works, international standardiza-tion e orts, key players. In doing so, we de ne some of the terms that we will be using in the rest of this session. To understand what patent IR is we must understand the tasks that a professional searcher has to solve. While at rst sight this may be simply \search for patents", an in-depth look identi es di erent search tasks, with di erent types of requests for information and di erent expectations in terms of the results.
 Evaluation ( 30 minutes) The di erent tasks the professional searcher has to accom-plish are crystalized in benchmarking tasks. The domain is particularly suited for large-scale IR evaluation campaigns, since search reports are public information and can be used as relevance judgements. We will talk about the pros and cons of this use of search reports, and about how to run your own tests and create your own test collections.
 Contents ( 75 minutes) of the patent documents and what we can do with it. First, I will describe the standard metadata available for each patent document. It covers a set of di erent physical and legal per-sons, hyper-references between patents, dates, and several types of classi cations. From this, we can already extract interesting observation pertaining to the evolution of tech-nologies and their key players.

We can learn even more from the actual text, and I will present here examples of content and describe the current state-of-the-art in using this unstructured information for retrieval. Issues such as the use of di erent genres and lan-guages, as well as hidden semantic information will be pre-sented.

Finally, I will brie y talk about image search in this do-main. The particularity here is that most of the image re-trieval methdos, based on colors and textures, are powerless in this domain, where 2-bit color depth images are the rule. In conclusion, I will summarize the further resources avail-able to the researcher interested in the domain, as well as the sources of actual patent data publicly available.
