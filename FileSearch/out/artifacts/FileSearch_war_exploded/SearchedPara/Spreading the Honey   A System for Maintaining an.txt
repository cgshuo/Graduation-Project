 As online communities, such as soci al network sites, mature, they face challenges in sustaining user engagement. To address this, we designed and deployed a rating syst em to encourage a broad set of users to promote a diverse set of content on a social network site. By evaluating the impact of the promotions on the site X  X  content and users over time, we found that the system successfully promotes more diverse content and encourages new social interactions between users. H.5.3 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interfaces: Web-based interaction. Human Factors. Online community, social networking, ratings, rewards. The sustainability of online communities depends on two main factors: the creation of quality content and the continuing interaction of users around this c ontent. Over the lifetime of a community, there are different challenges. For example, when the community launches, the most important challenge is encouraging potential users to join and contribute. Once a community is formed and has a sufficient stream of user-generated content, ensuring users are able to find relevant content and interact with other users through and around the content becomes a more pressing challenge. In this research we look at the problem of content discovery on a large social network site deployed inside of IBM. This site, called Beehive, has been live for over a year and has over 50,000 registered users (~15% of the company), with approximately 10-15,000 unique visitors each month and 50% of visitors adding new content. Users come to the site to socialize and connect with their coworkers [8], and they do this by sharing photos [20], lists [10] and events [8]. Over the last year, more than 53,000 photos, personal topics. Beehive users  X  X ri end X  their colleagues on the site to form social networks. Throu gh a combination of customized profiles and sharing photos, lists and events, employees use the site to communicate informally with their colleagues [8]. Cross-organizational communication and collaboration are important priorities for the company and getting to know new people, particularly people with different skills and expertise, is one of the design intentions of the site. Ther efore, when evaluating the health of our community, we paid partic ular attention to the amount of diversity within the site X  X  most popular content as an indication of the diversity of ideas and people being seen by the community. As the user base of Beehive grew and matured over the last year, it became more evident that, while some of the content received a lot of attention, and subsequently a lot of comments and user interaction, much of the content on the site was being largely ignored. For example, half of the photos on the site had been viewed fewer than five times. In comparison, the average number of views on photos was 194.5 (sta ndard deviation=303.6) and the most viewed photo received 1994 views. The situation was similar but the average number of views was 125.7 (standard deviation=157.7) and the most popular list received 1284 views. Unfortunately, over 3000 photos and 200 lists had never been viewed by anyone other than their creators. This is an especially important problem because the least-viewed content is owned by a large number of users: the 5000 l east-viewed photos are owned by 2156 users and the 2000 least-viewed lists are owned by 1440 users. While we expected the views on th e site to follow a power law distribution, in which a few items received a lot of focus and the majority received less, we had evidence that this was a significant problem of the  X  X ich getting richer X  in terms of attention on the site. In addition to many photos having few views, the site X  X  web page that highlighted the top 25 most-viewed photos was a relatively stable list over time and it was unusual for new photos to  X  X reak in X  to the top 25. As Figure 1 shows, over the months of February, March and April 2008, the proportion of new photos entering the ranks of the top 25 shrank monthly, with less than 10% of April X  X  photos being new to the list. As a result, many photos and lists which could poten tially be interesting to the community had no chance of getting any visibility. The problem of the rich staying rich extended to individual people as well; the most-viewed photos a nd lists on the site were owned by a relatively small number of us ers, shown in Table 1. The top 50 most-viewed photos were owne d by 15 users, meaning each user on average owned more than three of the top-viewed photos. Similarly, 30 users owned the top 50 most-viewed list s. (The site shows the top 25 most-viewed photos on one page and the top 10 most-viewed lists on another page , so the issue of few people owning the most-viewed content we nt beyond the first page of browsing.) The most-viewed content was al so owned by users who were relatively well-known on the site : their profiles were amongst the most visited on the site. 86 of the 100 most-viewed photos and 78 of the 100 most-viewed lists were owned by people with the top 100 most-viewed profiles. In summary, at the point we evaluated the site, there was a strong bias to wards the content and profiles of a relatively small group of people, and much of the content on the site was not being viewed at a ll. Considering the over 50,000 users, 20 to 30% of which were vi siting the site each month, we felt that a mechanism should be put in place that highlighted a more diverse set of content and di verse set of users. Ideally this viewed. To support our organizational goal of exposing employees to a broad set of content, we wanted a diverse set of users contributing to the rating system so that the promoted content was also diverse. 
Goal 2: Deploy a rating system that encourages a diverse set Above and beyond the views and di versity goals, a user-driven promotion system has the potential to create a social connection between two people: between the promoter and the owner of the promoted content. When a piece of content is hand-selected by a user as something valuable, it creates a link between the selector and the selected that can encourage interaction between the users. Particularly within the context of an intranet, users working at the same company have higher levels of reciprocity and potential for connecting, and we wanted new so cial connections to occur on our social network site. Therefore our third goal was to create a system that initiated new social interaction. 
Goal 3: Promote content in su ch a way that encourages new An additional goal, which only long-term analysis will allow us to Previous studies have found that incentive and rating systems are often subject to gaming by users [5], [9]. Our challenges are not unique to Beehive: after the initial swell of adoption, sustaining a vibrant community often comes down to whether or not the content is sufficiently accessible and the users are able to discover relevant information. There is a large body of research in the area of  X  X nformation overload X  in online communities stating that when it is difficult for users to filter content down to the interesting and relevant items, the users ignore the information or leave the community (see [19] for a literature review and [12] for a focused study). Online communities frequently use a member-moderated community model for determini ng which content and comments are valuable, for the purpose of so rting, filtering, and promoting content. The most common approach used by ecommerce sites is to use a rating system, such as a five-star rating. But there are known problems with general rati ng systems: it is difficult to motivate people to contribute rati ngs, the quality of the ratings themselves can vary greatly and the averaging of low quality ratings with high quality ratings diminishes the benefit of the high quality ratings [5]. The following systems have each applied different techniques for avoiding these drawbacks and subsequently obtaining high quality ratings. MovieLens is a movie recommendati on website that relies on user ratings for quality recommendations. The site faces the continuing challenge of motivating users to rate more movies, in order to increase the quality of the syst em X  X  recommendations. They have deployed multiple techniques for encouraging rating, specifically using social comparison as a method for motivating users to rate recommendations reflects the overall success of their rating system, and the associated research indicates that incentives are useful for encouraging users to participate in rating. Researchers have also used MovieLens as a platform for determining the effect of use r-moderation on the quality of the site X  X  movie contributions [7]. Using the collective effort model as The system we designed centers around providing a new mechanism for discovering conten t, through promotions referred to as  X  X oney. X  Content with hone y is highlighted on the site for one week at a time in several ways:  X  X oneyed content X  is shown on the home page (Figure 2), in ever y user X  X  digest emails, and on separate web pages listing the current content with honey. On the honeyed content X  X  page, there is an icon indicating it has received honey (Figure 3). From there, user s can browse to discover other content with honey. The process by which this cont ent is selected depends on a rotating group of users who are given the ability to promote content for one week. Figure 4 shows a timeline of the process of content selection and highlighti ng on the site. During the first stage, a set of 50 users is selected to promote content. The users are selected from those who were active (in both browsing and adding content) above a minimum threshold the previous week and did not serve as promoters in the previous four weeks, but are otherwise randomly selected. We chose to have 50 promoters a week because we assumed a certain percentage would not particip ate due to lack of availability or interest and we wanted to ma ke sure we had a sufficient amount homepage (four random promoted photos, lists, and events are Promoters are listed on a special web page each week (Figure 6) icon with a mouse-over explaining this person served as a promoter (Figure 6). When the w eek ends, the star icon next to the user X  X  picture fades and says they served as a promoter in the past. This highlighting of promoter s X  elevated status is expected to further encourage users to participate in the promotion process because of desires for self-promotion [15]. When selecting which photo, list, and event to give honey to, users can promote any content except their own and content that was promoted in the past four weeks. Additionally, they cannot select content another promoter already selected for the week. This design choice was done to prevent gaming (self-promoting of content) and to foster divers ity of promoted items (preventing the same content from being highlighted week to week). In this way, no user can serve as a pr omoter and no content can be promoted twice within the same four weeks. If all promoters picked the maximum amount of content (1 photo, 1 list and 1 event each) the site would have 150 new items promoted each week, and over 600 new items in a month. In the second stage of the promotion cycle (the right-side of Figure 4), the promoters are tha nked for their contributions to the site and pointed towards pa ges to view themselves along with other promoters and to pages showing their selected content. The selected content is highlighted on the site, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. And behind the scenes, the next group of promoters is selected and told to start picking content for the next week X  X  highlighting. One of the goals of this system was to increase social interaction between colleagues on the site, by opening up the possibility of a new communication loop and perhaps social network  X  X riending X  between previously unknown individuals. The diagram shown in Figure 7 illustrates the type of communication loop that we hoped would be initiated by the promotion system. In the first step of this interac tion, in addition to giving honey to a piece of content, promoters can also leave a comment on the content, explaining why they ha ve given it honey. Receiving honey and a comment can lead the content owner to respond with a comment on the promoter X  X  profile (step 2). While commenting is not required or ev en suggested, we expect that social norms around gift giving and receiving will encourage receivers to thank the promoters for their honey, initiating a dialogue with the promoter. In part icular, because this is within the context of an organization and every user has some minimal level of common ground (the same employer), we expect to see higher levels of politeness and reciprocity than one might see in a more anonymous community on the Internet. We believe this emergent social interaction is one of the main benefits of designing a syst em based around hand-selecting content to promote. If the highlighted content were chosen randomly by the system, or were selected by an algorithm, such as the most-viewed content already in place, the amount of views, comments, and social ex changes generated between users would not be as high, and the first two steps in the social loop in Figure 7 would not occur. To evaluate the impact of this system, we gave a lot of consideration to deploying a cont rolled experiment where only a portion of the users would see the promoted content, and a  X  X ontrol X  group of users would not experience the promotions. The strength of such a deployment would be the comparison between the users who had and had not been exposed to the system. However, the users are interconnected through a single, very large social network and promoters could give honey to users in the control group, confusing the process. What we really wanted to study were the natural social dynamics that transpire through the process of promoting content within a large community. The strength of a full de ployment is that we can see this social interaction across the site. Since our goal was to have a broad effect on the community X  X  viewing and social interaction, a broad deployme nt seemed like the more appropriate evaluation method. Temporal analysis is a common methodological approach for evaluating the evolution of social software, such as blogs [6] and wikis [4], and the effect of triggering events over time. We adopted this methodology to evalua te the effect of the promotion system. To do this, we compared the interaction around content at five different time points: the week content was added to the site, the week before being promoted, the week it was selected for promotion, the week it was highlighted as promoted, and the week afterwards. These time periods are labeled T1 to T5 in Table 2. This type of repeated measures analysis allows for demonstration of changes over time. (If an item was given honey in the first or second week of its creation, T1 overlaps with T2 or T3. Rather than bi asing the data towards one week over another, in these cases, we included the content X  X  activity numbers in both of the applicable weeks. This choice specifically does not bias our an alysis towards demonstrating our hypotheses because the recency and novelty occurring in an item X  X  first week of creation is also accounted for in some cases in T2 or T3, boosting these numbers.) As a comparison of how the promoted content fairs over other types of highlighting, we also compared the promoted content with the most viewed and recently added content. The system was deployed on the site and our evaluation looked at the system X  X  first two weeks of promoters and the first three weeks of promoted content, covering the five weeks listed in Table 2. To start the system wi th both promoters and promoted content on the site on the same day, 11 users from our research department picked the first set of content to be promoted on the site in one hour instead of the re gular one week time period. We evaluated how the user community responded to this promoted content, but we did not consider these 11 users to be part of the group of promoters. We structured our analysis according to our three design goals outlined previously. Overall 88 users were selected as promoters (after removing our team of 11 and 12 miss-assigned users). Out of 88, 50 users Distribution, which is designed fo r zero inflated data. While all of the models give us the same statistical result, the Negative Binomial model had the best fit. We defined the model to use time as the repeated measure and the main factor, and views and comments as our response variables. We used Simple contrast to compare all levels against T4, our level of interest. 
Figure 8. Average number of views and comments around promoted content over five di fferent time points (N=128). 
Table 4. Statistical results comparing interactions around promoted content over time, re porting promotion time (T4) Figure 8 shows the average number of views and comments on the promoted content during each time period. As shown in the top figure, during the week a pie ce of content was promoted, it received the largest amounts of views. Overall there was a significant difference over time in terms of number of views (Wald  X  2=162.9, df=4, p &lt; 0.001). Comparing all levels against T4, the promotion week, we found a significant difference items in the set by the number of unique users owning the content. Perfect divers ity is a value of 1, meaning every user owns only one item in the set. During the three weeks content was promoted on the site, the ItemPerOwner for promoted content was 1.1 and was 4.2 for the most-viewed content on the site, indicating a much higher le vel of owner diversity, as compared to the most-viewed content. 
Figure 9. Frequency distribution of promoted photos before 
Figure 10. Frequency distribution of promoted lists before One of the challenges on the site was the lack of turn-over of content on the most-viewed page s, and over the long term, we hope that these pages will begin to highlight more diverse content, as a natural result of th e promotion system working. We were pleased to find that of th e 93 promoted photos and lists, only one of the items was already on the first page of most-viewed content. This was a list titled  X  X ive Best Kept IBM Secrets X  which has obvious br oad appeal and during its promotion week, in addition to more views, it received many more comments. At the time of our analysis, wi th only 3 weeks of promotions and over a year of accumulated views on the most-viewed content, none of the promoted content broke into the ranks of the top page of most-viewed content. The closest any of the content came was one list, which made it to second page of most-viewed lists (achieving rank 20). In response to promotion, owne rs of promoted content left  X  X hank you X  comments on promoter s X  profile pages. Following norms of reciprocity, users gave thanks for the gifts they received: 21% of promoters (12 out of 57, including promoters from our research group X  X  initial seeding of the system) received such comments. Some comments were as simple as  X  X hanks for the honey! X  or more substantive, pointing the promoter towards other content, for example:  X  X hanks for the Honey. I think you would like what I have been up to with my mentoring [list]. I X  X l be sharing this at today X  X  DFW-TEX event. X  And others were simply apprec iative of someone noticing their unique content:  X  X hanks for the honey on my [list]. Most people aren X  X  very open to my musical tastes. Glad you appreciated it. X  In some cases the thank-you comment led to an interchange between the promoters and the owner. For example:  X  X wner: thanks for the honey 
Promoter:  X  X hank you Debbie. I thought your [list] would be helpful to several others. X  Owner: Thanks again and have a great day! X  The promotion system encouraged social exchanges between promoters and owners that would not have otherwise occurred. We had also expected that promoters would receive more friend requests on the site as a result of being highlighted prominently as a promoter on the site. Howe ver, our results show that the number of friend requests to promoters did not change significantly during the period they were highlighted on the site. Perhaps even stronger highlighting of their role, lasting beyond one week, could work to ge nerate friend connections. One of the more interesting aspects of the promotion system X  X  effect on the overall site was the role of the promoters and the thought process they went through to select what to promote to the community. In interviews with two of the promoters, they talked about different intentions for their selections. One of the promoters described a photo he selected and said it was  X ... one of the unique pictures that are out there that are fun to look at. X  He indicated that his criteria for promoting had to do with something being fun and unique. Another promoter described a process of selecting a photo and linking it to an event, with a specific intention to drive views and attention to something he found valuable:  X  X ow as I put that [photo] down, I linked it with another event which I was aware of. So not only does that person and their comment get extra viewing next week, but it X  X  linked with another event which I also thought was valuable. X  This promoter had a specific multi-content strategy for promoting photos and events that he wanted to drive traffic to. This kind of strategic promotion has the potential to have a cultural impact on the site, be yond our straightforward goal of increasing diversity. With time , we expect to see stronger patterns like this, where different topics and areas of interest get a deliberate focus from the community of promoters. Our future analysis will be to focus on this process of promoting and the motivations involved. explanation step is important; these comments support users in fulfilling their job of assisting in the maintenance of the community. In conclusion, the promotion system deployed a new method for highlighting a diverse set of content in an online community by targeting a broad set of users with an explicit task of content promotion. The system of giving  X  X oney X  to content generated high levels of user traffic a nd comments and ge nerating social interactions around the promoted content.
