 Dehai Liu 1 , Benjin Mei 1 , Jinchuan Chen 2( An important threat to SNS is the existence of spammers. In this paper, the The existing works for combating spammers in SNS mainly depend on users X  followers, the information shown in user profiles, and the content of micro-blogs etc. The feature-based methods may perform quite well when they are designed. However, spammers are also generated by clever people. They will evolve in order to survive in SNS. In fact, according to our experience, on average we need about 30 seconds to decide whether an account is spammer or not. Feature-based methods cannot evolve quickly and keep up with the changes of spammers, and they will gradually lose their power.
 including both spammers and normal users, assigns trust and un-trust scores to the neighbors of the seeds, and further spreads these scores over the whole net-work. Finally, it ranks all users according to these scores. The link-based methods do not depend the features, and can still work when spammers evolve. However, since the number of seeds is very limited compared to the huge size of SNS, the initial scores of the original seeds will be quickly diluted. Therefore many users in the network can only receive an imprecise score which is not accurate enough to label these users as spammer or normal. The link-based approach is more suitable to rank users, as [ 1 ] does, but not good at classifying users.
 one thing. Note that the relationship of Sina Weibo (also Twitter) is not sym-metric. A user follows another one but may not get the link back. In reality, few people would like to follow fake accounts. By analyzing the data crawled from Sina Weibo, we find that on average, more than 90 percent followers of a spammer are also spammers. More importantly, people usually live in several communities, e.g. relatives, classmates, and colleagues etc. In the cyber social network, a user, whether fake or not, is still involved in some communities. Normal users tend to rebuild their relationship in physical world. Spammers need to cluster in order to avoid being detected [ 1 ]. Our observations is, although spamemrs may get links with normal users, it is hard for them to join normal communities .
 sub-graph of Sina Weibo. Each point stands for a user, with its color specifying the chance of this user to be spammer. Dark color represents spammer, and vice versa. We can see that users are clustered into communities, and the member of each community are almost homogeneous. Hence the communities will be split into two kinds, i.e. spammer communities (boxed in rectangles) and normal communities (boxed in ellipses).
 live in their own communities. We should take into account the features of a user X  X  community friends, i.e. those within the same communities as him/her, when judg-ing the label of this user. Our approach contains two major steps. We first detect communities from a given SNS. Next, we compute the label of each user based on the features of both himself/herself and his/her community friends. factorization method to build latent features like the work in [ 7 ] does. The labels predicted by SVM will be further refined by utilizing community information. Refining User Labels. Suppose after community detection, we recognize K overlapped communities from the network. According to the theory of hypergraph [ 6 ], each recognized community composes a hyperedge connecting all of its members. Therefore, the original social network could be transformed into the following hypergraph.
 of communities, the foundation of our proposed approach. In our problem, a desired community similarity measure should satisfy a basic requirement. The more communities both u i and u j belong to, the larger value of their simi-larity is.
 metric Laplacian matrix L of the hypergraph G . The Laplacian matrix L is a n  X  n matrix representing the similarity between users through the recognized communities. For any pair of accounts u i and u j , the more communities they both belong to, the larger value l i,j will be.
 ( t =0 , 1 ,  X  X  X  ). A user X  X  new label is obtained by combining his initial label and the influence of his community friends. In this work, we propose to detect spammers in Sina Weibo by utilizing the influence of communities. We propose a method to measure user similarities in terms of communities and, based on which, design two simple but effective algorithms for discovering spammers and spammer communities. According to the results over a real dataset, our method can outperform the state-of-the-art ones. In the future, we will study how to extract the features of a community and detect spammers in the community level.
