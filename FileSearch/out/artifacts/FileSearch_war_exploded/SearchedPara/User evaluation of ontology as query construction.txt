Abstract This study examines the use of an ontology as a search tool. Sixteen subjects created queries using Concept-based Information Retrieval Interface (CIRI) and a regular baseline IR interface. The simulated work task method was used to make the searching situations realistic. Subjects X  search experiences, queries and search results were examined. investigated. The effectiveness of the CIRI and baseline queries was compared. An Ontology
Index (OI) was calculated for all search tasks and the correlation between the OI and the overlap of search concepts and keys in queries was investigated. The number of search keys and concepts was higher in CIRI queries than in baseline interface queries. Also the overlap of search keys was higher among CIRI users than among baseline users. These both findings are due to CIRI X  X  expansion feature. There was no clear correlation between OI and overlap of search concepts and keys. The search results were evaluated with generalised precision and recall, and relevance scores based on individual relevance assessments. The baseline interface queries performed better in all comparisons, but the difference was statistically significant only in relevance scores based on individual relevance assessments.

In information retrieval users face problems with the selection of search keys and query formulation. It is known that users X  queries typically contain only a few keys which might not match the vocabulary of relevant documents. Also the formulation of queries poses problems if operators should be used to connect search keys. In this paper we present an ontology-based system assisting users in query construction.

With emergence of the semantic web, ontologies have become popular. Although there are different kinds of ontologies, they all can be described as specifications of a conceptualisation, or models showing concepts and their relations (Guarino, 1995). The ontology of the study is based on three abstraction levels: It includes concepts, expressions representing concepts, and matching models representing expressions as search keys (J  X  arvelin et al. 1996). Semantic relations typical of thesauri are also represented in the ontology. The leading idea is concept-based information retrieval : users select concepts that best represent their information needs from the ontology, and queries are constructed for the users by the system managing the ontology. The queries are then sent to an information retrieval system to be executed, and results are returned to the users. The system facilitates users by showing the concepts and their relations of an area of interest; by giving search keys for the selected search concepts; and by expanding a query with synonyms and narrower and associated concepts (J  X  arvelin et al., 2001).

The ontology is a product of the ongoing Finnish semantic web ontologies project, and was constructed for searching a digital newspaper archive. The archive includes full texts of newspaper articles which are not indexed with the ontology. The system managing the ontology supports free text searching, and performs automatic query expansion. The users interact with the system through a concept-based IR interface (CIRI). While an interactive evaluation of the system cannot be separated from the interface, we refer to the combination of the interface and the system behind it as CIRI. Our aim is to test how users interact with CIRI.
As a comparison we used a similar search interface without ontology support (baseline). We state the following research questions:  X 
What are subjects X  experiences of the two interfaces with different query construction methods?  X 
What kind are the queries constructed through the ontology compared to the subjects X  unaided queries?  X 
What is the effectiveness of the ontology queries compared to the subjects X  unaided queries?  X 
How great is the overlap in search keys among the CIRI users as opposed to the baseline user group?  X 
Will the overlap of search keys among CIRI users be greater in tasks where the search task description terminology is directly found in the ontology?
In this article term refers to the principal name of a concept in the ontology (or any docu-mentation language), other expressions denoting the concept are synonyms of the term. Key refers to any expression denoting a concept, and it may appear in documents, queries and ontologies. Thus, terms and synonyms are keys. Although we differentiate between expres-sions and matching models (representing expressions as character strings), we refer to both as keys when the difference is not important. Keys in queries are search keys . Search refers to the whole process of searching on a task and may include one or more queries .A query is a unique string of characters created and submitted by a subject based on a task description.
Next, we shall review related studies. In Section 3 we shall introduce the test setting and in Section 4 the results. Discussion and conclusions are in Section 5. 2. Related studies
Query expansion and reformulation have been studied intensively, also in interactive informa-tion retrieval. The sources for expansion are typically results of the initial search (relevance feedback) or some external knowledge structure (Efthimiadis, 1996). A thesaurus is an ex-ternal expansion source in several studies on real users X  searching. Jones et al. (1995) tested query expansion with the INSPEC thesaurus in the INSPEC database with the best match system OKAPI. Genuine users with own information needs ran first their own query. This query was mapped to the thesaurus, and a list of terms partly or completely mapping the original search key was presented to the users. They then selected any number of terms to be added as expansion keys to the queries. Based on results at document cut-off value (DCV) 20 no significant difference in the effectiveness of the original and the expanded queries was detected, whether run against full text or INSPEC index terms. The expansion had a reordering effect on the result sets, however (Jones et al., 1995).

Sihvonen and Vakkari (2004) studied subject novices X  and experts X  query formulation and expansion. The source of expansion was a thesaurus. They found out that the number of search keys in initial or expanded queries did not vary much between the two groups, yet the experts X  selection of expansion terms was more accurate with relation to effectiveness.
Sutcliffe et al. (2000) studied users X  searching behaviour including query formulation and reformulation. They emphasise the effects of search task, but found no simple correlation between search behaviour and performance.

Within the TREC interactive track relevance feedback methods for query reformulation have been examined by several researchers (Over, 2001). Belkin et al. (2001) conducted a series of experiments in TREC interactive track (instance finding task). Negative and positive feedback, as well as automatic and interactive feedback, were tested with different interfaces.
The article explains the system and interface development experiment by experiment. Joho et al. (2004) studied interactive query expansion using conceptual hierarchies as expansion source with TREC topics and measures for the instance finding task in the interactive track. hierarchies could help improve precision at higher DCVs (in instance finding task at DCVs 5 X 30).

To summarise, there are several studies on users X  query formulation and reformulation, and on interaction with thesauri at searching phase in intellectually indexed environments. Query based reformulation, like relevance feedback. Of different query reformulation methods relevance feedback has generally enhanced performance, but thesaurus-based expansion has given mixed results. In our test environment the initial query formulation starts within the ontology, which is employed as a tool for query construction and expansion. 3. Test setting
In this section we will present the methods and data of our study: First, the ontology and the search system with two test interfaces are introduced; second, subject recruiting and simulated work tasks are described; third, questionnaires eliciting the background of the subjects and their opinions are introduced; and fourth, evaluation measures are given. 3.1. Ontology, search system and interfaces The theme of the ontology is food industry and the subjects were food industry professionals.
The ontology contains professional as well as general food industry terms. The ontology information is organised according to the model of three abstraction levels: conceptual level, where the concepts and their relationships are given; linguistic level that contains expressions corresponding to the concepts; and occurrence level that consists of matching models of the expressions. The relationships between the concepts are generic, partitive, instance and associative relationships. At linguistic level the principal name of a concept (term) and its synonyms are defined. Terms also represent concepts for users at conceptual level. Synonyms are needed in queries to cover the variation in ways to refer to concepts in documents.
At occurrence level matching models corresponding to the expressions represent search keys suitable for different database indices, i.e. stems, lemmatised or inflected forms of the words (J  X  arvelin et al. 1996, 2001). An example of the abstraction levels is given in Fig. 1.
The ontology consists of 479 food industry concepts, represented by 689 expressions, which again are represented by 2087 matching models. Between the concepts 603 relation-ships have been defined. The top level of the ontology consists of 11 concepts and there are up to six lower levels of concepts for the top level concepts.
 The test database contains Finnish newspaper articles published in Aamulehti between January 2000 and June 2004. Aamulehti is the second largest daily newspaper in Finland.
There are 396 255 articles in the test collection and the average length of an article is 255 words. The collection is indexed automatically, not with the ontology. The index keys have been lemmatised. The test database is managed under the InQuery retrieval system which is a best match IR system (Allan et al., 1997; Turtle, 1990). CIRI is accessed via a web browser. It acts between the user, the relational database containing the ontology information, the search engine and the document database. It is based on applet-servlet architecture where the applet submits the queries through a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) interface in a PostgreSQL relational database. CIRI expands the query concepts automatically. At conceptual level,
CIRI collects by default narrower concepts of the search concept from three hierarchy levels, and concepts directly associated to the search concept (related concepts). At linguistic level, terms and all synonyms of any expression denoting the original or expansion concepts are collected. Then, at occurrence level, matching models of terms and their synonyms are placed levels can be changed, but the default was used in the test. The user can also add own query keys or remove keys from the query.

The CIRI web interface is shown in Fig. 2. The user first presses the Options button and chooses the database and a search system in the opening applet window. He or she then selects the ontology from the dropdown menu and opens the ontology with the Open button. In our experiment these two first steps were done on behalf of the subject to reduce the cognitive load introduced by a new interface. The ontology navigation tree opens into a new window, which is shown in Fig. 3. The user selects his or her choice of concepts, which appear in the Search text field on the top of the CIRI window in Fig. 2. After selecting the search concepts and possibly choosing the number of expansion levels, the user presses the Create query button on CIRI window. CIRI then constructs the query according to the syntax of the selected search system from the selected concepts. The query is displayed in the lower text field where the user may remove search keys from the query as well as add own search keys. Pressing the Submit query button sends the query to InQuery.

A part of the ontology navigation tree is shown in Fig. 3. It is presented as a standard concept boxes are highlighted like the concept Trade barriers in Fig. 3. Expansion concepts are highlighted in a different shade. By clicking the concept box again one can remove the interface, where one types in search keys in a text field and submits the query with a button (see Fig. 4). 3.2. Subjects and simulated search tasks
We approached food manufacturing companies, catering businesses, food industry related companies and organisations to recruit 16 subjects. Since our ontology was domain specific, education at secondary level at the minimum, work within food industry and follow the food industry news in the media.

We wanted to compare the subjects X  choice of search concepts from an ontology to the search keys the subjects type in without lexical help; the queries created by CIRI to the queries created by the subjects independently; and the effectiveness of the CIRI queries to the effectiveness of the subjects X  unaided queries. Most reliable comparisons can be made between queries that are based on the same task. To replicate real life information retrieval Borlund (2000). We applied a rather general work task to four more detailed search tasks. The work task was writing a fairly large report on the search task theme. The test was run in Finnish so the search tasks were also in Finnish.
 The tasks translated into English are:
Fat: What cholesterol lowering edible fats exist on the market and how has their market situation developed worldwide? Gene: How has the import controversy over transgenic food products between the United States and Europe developed?
Ice cream: How have the milk processing companies in Finland concentrated and reduced ice cream manufacture?
Organic: How has the demand of organic products developed in Finland within the past few years? What is restraining the sale of organic products? The labels, e.g. Fa t , were not shown to the subjects; they only refer to the tasks in our text.
The tasks were tested by the researchers to make sure that the database contained sufficiently relevant documents on each topic for a meaningful search. The wording of the tasks was planned a rather straightforward match with the ontology keys in two tasks: Ice cream and
Organic . In the wording of two tasks, Fa t and Gene , synonyms or keys referring to broader or narrower concepts of the ontology terms were used instead of the ontology terms to make the use of the ontology less automatic. This was done to observe the subjects X  reactions in a situation where the needed concept is not found in the ontology, as is bound to happen in real life searching. We wanted to see, whether the users were willing to do the best they can with the vocabulary of the ontology or whether they wanted to add their own search keys to the query. In all topics good search results could be reached by settling with the ontology concepts.

Each task was searched by all subjects. The subjects performed two searches with one interface and then two with the other. The order of the task sequence X  X nterface combinations was permuted based on basic 2  X  2 Latin squares: no task sequence X  X nterface combination pair was repeated in the matrix of eight subjects. The matrix was run twice, so each task sequence X  X nterface combination was performed by two subjects. 3.3. Test procedure and questionnaires The session was begun by presenting the subject with some general information on the study.
Then the subject filled in a background information questionnaire mapping e.g. his or her education, computer use and information retrieval experience and frequency, and following of food industry news. After that the first interface was introduced to the subject and the first search task description was handed to him or her, and the subject performed the first search.
The subject assessed the relevance of the top 15 documents on the result list using a four point scale (see Section 3.4). If the subject chose to modify the query, the last search result was evaluated as well. A questionnaire reflecting the search experience was filled in after the task, see Table 1. Then the task-related steps were repeated with the second interface. A post-system questionnaire was filled in after the two tasks on the first interface, see
Tables 2 and 3. Then the second interface was introduced to the subject and the search task and interface related steps were repeated with the second interface. In the end of the experiment a post-experiment questionnaire presented in Table 4 was filled in and the experimenter and the subject discussed freely. 3.4. Evaluation measures calculated an Ontology Index (OI) for each task description and compared the OI to the documents in their result lists with a four-point scale. The assessments were used in evaluating the effectiveness of the searches. Quantification of the relevance assessments, generalised effectiveness.
 3.4.1. Overlap and ontology index
In the analysis of the queries the individual keys have been mapped into concepts as suggested by Iivonen (1995). Keys were seen as representing the same concept, when  X  the character strings were identical  X  the keys were different inflected forms of the same word  X  there was an equivalence relationship between the keys.
 presented in Saracevic (1984). It has been widely used in research in measuring key similarity.
In the method the overlap of search keys of each pair of subjects is calculated by comparing the number of shared keys in two subjects X  queries to the total number of the keys each subject X  X  query. Let T i and T j be sets of search keys from queries Q on the same search task. The overlap of Q i with Q j is
The overlap values are first calculated between all pairs of subjects and after that an average of the overlap values of each subject with all other subjects is calculated. Then the mean of all individual averages and the mean of both interface users are counted for each search task.

For counting the OI we used a modified version of Iivonen X  X  Thesaurus Index that she used for measuring how well the concepts in the search tasks were represented in a the-individual nouns or noun phrases; pronouns, conjunctions, verbs and adverbs were left out of the analysis. The index values were assigned to the task description keys in the following manner:  X  when the task description key was found as such in the ontology, it was assigned the value 1  X  when a synonym of the key was found, it was assigned the value 0.75  X  when a broader concept of the description key was found, the key was assigned the value 0.5. The Ontology Index of the search task was calculated following the formula: where k i = index value of search task key i ; n = the number of search task keys. 3.4.2. Effectiveness
The subjects assessed the relevance of the search results of their first and last queries with DCV therefore relevance assessments were made with a four-point scale presented in Table 5. The assessments were quantified for calculation of precision and recall as shown in Table 5.
The subjects X  own view of their search success was studied by summing the quantified relevance assessments of each search result. If the subject has judged every one of the top 15 documents very relevant, the result set is worth 45 points. If there is not a single relevant document in the set, the value of the result set is 0. When the subject had performed two searches on the same task, the better result was chosen for the comparison.

We also measured the effectiveness of the search results with generalised precision and all relevant documents of all of the searches was formed. This recall base consists of doc-uments that at least one subject assessed at least marginally relevant in at least one of the searches. In case there were several assessments per document, an average relevance score was calculated for the document. The numbers of documents and their relevance assessments per topic in the recall base are shown in Table 6. Generalised precision and recall were calcu-lated for the result of the first search of each subject in each task. Relative recall calculation was based on the number of relevant documents in the recall base. Generalised precision and recall are defined as follows: where D = set of N documents, i.e. the database; R = set of n retrieved documents, R r ( d ) = score of the document.
 4. Results
In this section we will present the results starting with subjects X  background information and their opinions about the interfaces. Then the queries will be analysed with respect to the search keys and concepts, their overlap and ontology index. Finally, the effectiveness of the queries constructed with the two interfaces will be compared, and analysis of failed queries will be given. 4.1. Analysis of questionnaires 4.1.1. Background of subjects
The first questionnaire collected the subjects X  background information. Our subjects worked e.g. within product development, consumer service, restaurant management, food safety and quality control. The education level of the subjects was high: 9 subjects had an academic education in food industry, 3 subjects had a polytechnic education and 4 subjects either had some other education or were students of the field in addition to working within the field.
Subjects were predominantly female, only one was male. No subject was under the age of 25 years nor over 55 years.

Subjects were rather experienced computer users and information searchers, but informa-tion retrieval was not the main task of any of them. Over 10 years of information searching experience was gained by 2 subjects and less than 3 years by 3 subjects. All subjects used computers both at work and in free time. All but one performed searches both at home and at work, one performed searches only at work. Online searching is performed weekly by nine subjects while three subjects reported to search online daily and three monthly. Online searching is carried out less often than monthly by one subject.

Internet is the most familiar digital information source to the subjects: All subjects have used Internet information resources. Half of them have used library online cata-food industry news regularly. One subject follows the news seldom and two subjects very closely. 4.1.2. The subjects X  opinion on CIRI
The subjects X  impressions of CIRI were inquired on several questionnaires during the study (see Section 3.3). The results of the post-task questionnaires are presented in Table 7. Assess-ments 4 X 5 were summed under  X  X gree X  and 1 X 2 under  X  X isagree X . Value 3 stood for  X  X annot say X . A large majority of the subjects were familiar with all the task topics. Also a majority of the subjects found carrying out a search easy in all topics. In all other tasks but Fa t the subjects were predominantly satisfied with the results. In task Fa t nearly half of the subjects were satisfied with the results.

The post-system questionnaires mapped the subjects X  experience with the interfaces. Since we are primarily interested in the subjects X  experiences with CIRI, the results of the post-CIRI questionnaire are presented in Table 8. The ontology was easy to use to 13 of the subjects. Finding the concepts in the ontology was easy to 9 subjects.

The ontology was apparently well built, since 14 subjects found the terms representing concepts in the ontology the same they use for the same concepts and 12 subjects found the structure of the ontology logical.

The results of the post-experiment questionnaire are shown in Table 9. The tasks were found at least fairly similar to their own search tasks by 9 subjects. The system was found helpful in creating search keys by 10 subjects and in analysing the search task by 11 subjects. Using CIRI was easy to 13 subjects and 6 subjects found using it laborious.

The baseline interface was clearly considered easier to use than CIRI, by 11 subjects (see (Table 10). Almost the same number of subjects (10) also liked the baseline interface better. There was a subject who found the baseline interface easier to use but liked CIRI better.
Subjects that were less familiar with the search task terminology regarded the ontology as helpful in creating search keys while subjects familiar with both the topic and information retrieval stated that it was both quicker and less frustrating to type in the search keys than to browse the ontology looking for the concepts. One subject thought that given a chance she would use both interfaces in the same search to make the best possible search. Another subject thought she might use CIRI in searches with a highly specialized vocabulary, e.g. legal text databases.

Several subjects pointed out, that they would need more experience of using the system to be able to realistically evaluate the system. They expected practice to increase satisfac-tion with the system as one would become familiar with the structure of the ontology. Their comments are in line with Ingwersen (2000), who states, that new interfaces and their func-tionality require several sessions for a user to get accustomed to. It may be too hasty to make conclusions of the goodness or badness of a system based on an experiment where the user has a rather limited time to get acquainted with a whole new system with novel features.
Several subjects stated in both their written and verbal comments that the CIRI interface is not very user-friendly. For a novice CIRI user it is hard to figure out whether and where a certain concept exists in the ontology. A search window to facilitate searching within the ontology was suggested by a subject. This feature will be implemented in our future system. 4.2. Number of searches and queries searches. In 25 cases the subject chose to modify the query and in 39 cases only one query was made, so 89 search result sets were evaluated in total.

We wanted to investigate whether the interface has an effect on the subjects X  decision to modify his or her query. There are more steps involved in creating a query with CIRI so we wanted to see whether the laboriousness discourages the subjects from continuing searching.
The willingness to modify the query did not depend on the interface (see Table 11). On the other hand the position of the search task in the sequence seems to have an effect on the eagerness to modify the query (see Table 12). The query of the first search task was modified by 10 (out of 16) users, four times by the CIRI users and six times by the baseline interface users. The second and third search tasks were modified only by four and five users respectively. The final task inspired some users to an extra effort; six users modified their final search. The users are clearly putting less effort in the second and third work task and working harder with the first and last tasks. This finding further stresses the importance of permuting the order of the tasks among the test users.
 4.3. Analysis of queries 4.3.1. Number of search keys and concepts in queries
The following analysis is based on the subjects X  first queries and results, because most of the subjects did not reformulate their queries (see Section 4.2). Table 13 gives the average numbers of search keys and Table 14 search concepts per query. The average numbers of both keys and concepts are lower for the baseline interface because of the expansion feature of CIRI. However, the number of search keys in baseline queries is high compared to Internet searches. CIRI users were able to add their own search keys into queries, for example keys that did not exist in the ontology, yet the average figure is low (see column # own keys in Table 13).

The overlap between baseline users X  keys/concepts and ontology keys/concepts is given in Tables 13 X 14 (see column # keys/concepts also in ontology). It seems that in some search tasks the concepts are shared between the subjects leading also to a higher overlap (tasks Ice cream , Organic in Tables 13 X 14).

The idea of expansion in CIRI was not very intuitive or clear to the subjects. They selected general concepts, i.e. concepts high up in the hierarchy, which caused intensive query expan-sion. The subjects did not actually select more concepts in CIRI than in the baseline interface, but the automatic expansion creates the difference. Some subjects deleted expansion keys they found inappropriate.
 4.3.2. Ontology index and overlap of search keys and concepts in queries
The calculation of the overlap of search keys and concepts and the Ontology Index (OI) are explained in Section 3.4. The overlap values per search task are presented in Tables 15 and 16. The overlap is clearly greater among CIRI users than among baseline interface users and also greater than the average of all subjects. The overlap grows as we move from keys to concepts, but this is no surprise since the same keys are being combined to a more general level.

It can be argued that it is only logical that the overlap is greater among the CIRI users than among the baseline interface users since the CIRI users have a limited vocabulary at their use and the baseline interface users choose their search keys freely. On the other hand the
CIRI users have nearly 500 concepts to browse and choose from and the baseline interface users only have the keys in the task description to start with.

We calculated an Ontology Index (OI) for all topics to study the correlation between the availability of the search task description keys in the ontology and the overlap of keys and concepts in subjects X  queries. It can be assumed, that if the concepts in the task description are found in the ontology, they will be used by all CIRI users and there will be a positive correlation between the overlap of search keys and concepts and the OI.
 The keys distinguished in our search tasks and their ontology indexes were: Fat: cholesterol lowering, edible fat, market, market situation, development, worldwide 29.2 Gene: The United States, Europe, transgenic food products, import controversy 31.3
Ice cream: ice cream, manufacture, concentration, reduction, Finnish, milk processing com-pany 41.7 Organic: organic product, demand, development, Finland, restraint, sale 58.3
Tables 15 and 16 show that the correlations between the OI and the overlap of subject X  X  search concepts and keys do not support the statement that a high OI would lead to a high overlap in search concepts and keys. Correlation of OI and overlap of both search keys and concepts are negative among CIRI users. Correlation between OI and the overlap of search keys is at highest in search keys among all users.

The tasks Fa t and Gene had the lowest ontology indexes and they were designed as the least perfect matches with the ontology. Still the overlap of search keys as well as concepts among CIRI users is the second highest in Gene . This is due to the expansion feature of CIRI and the composition of the concept genetically modified foods in the ontology. The concept is expressed as a phrase combining the concepts genetically modified and food. With the expansion both concepts produce 42 search keys to the query, e.g. GMO, transgenic tomato, genetically engineered corn. Such a large number of keys produced just by one chosen concept raises the overlap clearly despite the variation in other search concepts.
A central concept lacking from ontology . In the task Fa t all three figures, OI, overlap in search keys and in search concepts are the lowest in all four search tasks among all users.
In the task description one of the important keys is cholesterol lowering . It does not exist in the ontology, instead the concept functional food products does, which can be considered a broader concept of cholesterol lowering food products . All but one CIRI users chose functional food products into their query. Out of the baseline interface users no one used the concept functional food product . This is what caused the overlap among all users be typed the search key cholesterol into their query. All CIRI users spent a lot of time looking for the concept in the ontology and were clearly frustrated because they did not find the concept. Three (out of eight) CIRI users chose to add the key cholesterol to the query by typing it themselves despite that it was rather difficult: as one can see in Fig. 1 the user can only see a small segment of a long query in the text field and the InQuery operators and characters are also shown to the user. Figuring out the spot where to add the key was rather troublesome and caused errors to queries. Our conclusion was that the users do need an easy way to add their own search keys into the query in cases the desired concept cannot task.

What was surprising about the choice of search keys in this task was the low use of proper names. Proper names are known in the IR field to be efficient search keys. All of these topics were related to recent major developments within food industry. Cholesterol lowering food fats are a significant Finnish contribution to the field of functional food products and most definitely all of these professionals knew two brand names of such products. Still only three subjects chose to use the brand names of these products as search keys, all of them CIRI users.
 Central concepts included in ontology . The tasks with highest matches with the OI were
Ice cream and Organic . Still the overlap of search keys is the lowest or the second lowest in all categories in the task Ice cream . The essential concepts, such as ice cream and ice cream manufacture did exist in the ontology, but locating them X  X articularly ice cream manufacture  X  X as complicated. Ice cream was used by all but one CIRI users but ice cream manufacture only by five. The concepts concentration, reduction and Finland were not included in the ontology and the subjects X  attempts to include keys referring to these aspects in their queries caused variation in the keys. The baseline interface users applied different forms of the same word stems, e.g. reduction, reduce, manufacture, manufacturer , which in the counting of keys were counted as a separate key each. In the concept hierarchy the different forms of the same stem were counted as the occurrences of the same concept. The same surprising lack of use of proper names continued in this search task. A major
Finnish milk product manufacturer sold their ice cream production to a multinational food producer just a few months before the tests and the case made big headlines throughout in these processes. Some of the subjects actually work for the company. Still only three baseline interface users had names of ice cream manufacturers as search keys. Names of food manufacturers were also provided in the ontology. Five (out of eight) CIRI users selected the names of companies as search concepts.

Organic was the most straightforward of the search tasks. The main concepts were easily found in the ontology and they were used in a rather uniform manner by both CIRI and baseline interface users. 4.4. Effectiveness of queries
The subjects X  own view of their search success was measured by summing the relevance scores of each search result (see Section 3.4). The results are shown in Table 17. In average the baseline users assessed their results with higher grades than CIRI users. The difference varies between 23 and 61 points. The baseline users X  results are 9 X 32 percent higher than the
CIRI users X . The difference between average scores of a set in tasks varies between three and seven points being largest in Gene and smallest in Ice cream . Comparison between CIRI and the baseline interface reveals that the baseline interface performs significantly ( p better than CIRI. The statistical test used in the comparison was the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test (Conover 1999).

Generalised precision and recall are given in Table 18. In all search tasks the baseline in-terface queries outperform the CIRI queries, but there is no statistically significant difference between the interfaces (Mann-Whitney test). 4.5. Analysis of failed queries
Our subjects produced a total of 89 queries. The DCV of the result set to be assessed was 15. There were 24 result sets, in which eight or more documents were non-relevant within the first 15 documents. This struck us as quite a large number so we analysed the queries retrieving poor results.

The distributions of the tasks and interfaces over task sequence are presented in Tables 19 and 20. The result sets are dissatisfactory most often in the tasks Fa t and Gene . Between the interfaces the situation is more interesting: in the first two tasks the interface producing most failed results is CIRI, but in the last two tasks the situation becomes even. The subjects who started their test with CIRI failed with it more often than those who used CIRI as their second interface.

More failed queries were created with CIRI than with the baseline interface. We examined the queries of these failed searches and recognised seven types of errors in queries. They are presented in Table 21. In some queries more than one error could be recognised. The main errors were different depending on the interface.

The main error observed in CIRI queries was a bad balance of concepts in the query giving too much weight to secondary concepts while the main concept got a low weight. This might be due to the subject not finding a concept she or he is trying to locate in the ontology and trying to replace the lacking concept with several near concepts, or just not realising that the search results are ranked according to the occurrence of search keys in the documents and the balance of the query concepts dictates the order of the search result.
 The main mistake made in baseline queries was the lack of synonyms of a search key.
Table 22 shows the cross-tabulation of topics and education levels of the creators of these failed queries. Subjects with an academic education produced on average one failed query per person whereas others produced 2.1 failed queries per person.

Table 23 presents the distribution of the levels of familiarity of the topics to subjects by topic in the failed queries. On a five-point scale the value 5 stood for the topic being very familiar to the subject, 4 for rather familiar and 2 for rather unfamiliar. Values 3 (no opinion) and 1 (very unfamiliar) were not utilised at all by these subjects in these tasks. The table reveals that 12 times a search result with less than half relevant documents were created by a subject who felt she or he knew the topic rather well and twice by a subject who felt he or she knew the topic very well. In these cases the reason for the query failing might have been problems with the system or search formulation. Ten of the failed queries were created by a subject who felt they didn X  X  know that much of the topic.
 We considered testing the statistical significance of the differences in tables 19 X 23 with the
Chi-squared test, but the expected numbers of observations were too small for an appropriate test.

As a conclusion one could say that more failed searches were produced with CIRI than with the baseline interface. The greatest common denominators of these failed searches are the topics Fa t and Gene and the lower educational level of the subject. These tasks were the least perfect matches with the ontology and they were more abstract and multi-faceted and their central concepts have more synonyms than the other two tasks. Subjects with an academic education have apparently more searching experience having searched information for their Master X  X  Theses and other reports. The errors in queries causing the failures differed between the interfaces. The errors in CIRI queries were mainly due to the subjects not finding the concepts they wanted in the ontology and choosing several secondary concepts to replace the one they cannot find. The errors in baseline queries were mostly lacking search keys and their synonyms.
 5. Discussion and conclusions
We tested the usefulness and effectiveness of an ontology search tool for real users. Altogether 16 food industry professionals searched two simulated search tasks with an ontology interface (CIRI) and two tasks with an interface without vocabulary support (baseline interface). The results indicate that the effectiveness of the baseline interface queries was slightly better. The numbers of both search concepts and keys were clearly higher in CIRI queries but that was largely due to the expansion feature of CIRI.

The ontology was shown to the subjects as a tree structure. Difficulty of locating the desired concepts in the ontology frustrated several subjects and sometimes led them to choose bad query concepts. Particularly the more experienced searchers with solid conceptual knowledge preferred using the baseline interface. Subjects with less conceptual knowledge found CIRI X  X  lexical help useful. Still, many of the users pointed out that they would need more practice with the novel system to be able to realistically evaluate its usefulness.

The expansion feature of the CIRI was not very well understood. The subjects tended to choose concepts high in the hierarchies, which led to an intensive expansion especially since it was not possible to choose a concept without the expansion concepts. When an essential key was not found in the ontology most subjects got frustrated and almost half of the subjects be able to add his or her own search keys into the query in a simple way in cases they find the ontology lacking important concepts.

The overlap of search keys was greater among the CIRI users than among the baseline feature: choosing one concept created a large number of common search keys in CIRI users X  queries. No significant correlation was found between overlap of search keys of CIRI users names as much as expected in their unaided searches although it would have been helpful in at least two of the tasks and the relevant proper names were most definitely familiar to the subjects. The interface had no effect on the frequency of the subjects modifying their queries but the position of the task in the sequence did. This finding further stresses the importance of rotating the search tasks among the subjects in user studies.

A quarter of all searches in the study resulted in eight or more documents judged non-relevant by the subjects within the first 15 documents of the result lists. Nearly two thirds of these failed searches were performed with CIRI. The greatest common denominators of these failed searches were the tasks Fa t and Gene and the lower educational level of the subjects. The errors in queries causing the search to fail were different with the two interfaces.
With CIRI the cause of failure was mostly subjects not finding the concept they wanted and choosing many secondary concepts. With the baseline interface the failure was most often caused by lacking query keys or their synonyms.

In this experiment the ontology and the subjects were specialised but article collection was general. Whether the expansion feature had been more useful in a more specialised concepts were pre-coordinated, e.g. genetically modified corn instead of two concepts, genetic modification and corn . This might not be a good solution for free text searching because modifiers of nouns may take many different positions, especially in newspaper language.
The subjects X  reactions were not totally negative. Many subjects found the ontology helpful in discovering search keys and they also praised the ontology X  X  clear structure. Browsing the ontology helped several subjects to clarify the search topic to themselves. Some subjects pointed out that for mastering CIRI more practise would be needed. In future experiments the hierarchies should be easier to navigate, e.g. by automatically mapping search keys to concept names, and the expansion feature more understandably presented.
