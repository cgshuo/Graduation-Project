Users upload their photos to these sites and control how they are displayed. structure of the Flickr user netw ork, but few have addressed the reasons or thought processes behind its users X  behavior. Previous studies of Flickr and other social networks focus on the nature of the links between users, as well as tallies of their activities [2, 3, 4]. Mislove et al., for example, shows that users who create many links with other users are in tu rn linked to by others [4]. known as reciprocity, which occurs through commenting, tags, views, and favoriting behaviors [5]. Reciprocation of these actions increases the chances that a us er X  X  photos will be favorited by others, as well as facilitating learning [5, 6]. Lerman and Jones, along with Zwol, demonstrate co rrelations between the quantity of contacts and the number of views of one X  X  photos [7, 8]. Reciprocity even overshadows exper tise: Stewart X  X  social network study of an open-source devel opment community shows that reputation is heavily depende nt on relationships between community members, rather than on factors such as their skill [9]. that is missing from the literature, our study examined the strategies users employ to advance self-promotion of their photos on the site X  X hy they do it, and what they think about it. on others X  photos, join interest groups made up of other users sharing common interests, add othe r users to a contact list, and select others X  photos as favorite s.

Dana recognized that the act of leaving comments not only established or cultivated contact with other users, it also boosted her pres ence on the Flickr network by leaving visible traces to be seen by others, as well as compelling other users to reciprocate by vis iting her page, thus adding further exposure to her work.

By posting photos to these groups, users knew they could increase the number of views and comments for their work without th e amount of effort required for one-on-one contacts. Patty X  X  approach was to post to multiple groups:  X ...if I really want the photo to be looked at, I will post it to groups I know X  X  will post it to a lot of groups so that it gets some exposure. X  Groups on Flickr provided a way for members with common interests to congreg ate, as well as a large captive audience for viewing members X  photos. Users in our study were well aware of how groups could in crease their exposure on Flickr, and took advantage of them for self-promotion purposes. divergent ways users successfully draw attention to their photos while also accomplishing social goals of interacting with others. and its results changed over time. Several participants said their initial reason for using Flickr was to share their work with the world; they started out by spending a lot of time and effort trying to draw visitors to their photogr aphs. According to Selma,  X  X hen I first started on Flickr, it was lik e,  X  X h my gosh, you looked at my photo?! X  And now you get very used to that. X  After the excitement of having people view their photos diminished over time, some Flickr members looked for more intimate relationships with their contacts within the netw ork, rather than continuing to amass a large, mostly anonymous following.
