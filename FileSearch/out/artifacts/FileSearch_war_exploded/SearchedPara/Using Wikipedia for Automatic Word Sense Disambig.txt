 Ambiguity is inherent to human language. In partic-ular, word sense ambiguity is prevalent in all natural languages, with a large number of the words in any given language carrying more than one meaning. For instance, the English noun plant can mean green plant or factory ; similarly the French word feuille can mean leaf or paper . The correct sense of an am-biguous word can be selected based on the context where it occurs, and correspondingly the problem of word sense disambiguation is defined as the task of automatically assigning the most appropriate mean-ing to a polysemous word within a given context.
Among the various knowledge-based (Lesk, 1986; Galley and McKeown, 2003; Navigli and Ve-lardi, 2005) and data-driven (Yarowsky, 1995; Ng and Lee, 1996; Pedersen, 2001) word sense dis-ambiguation methods that have been proposed to date, supervised systems have been constantly ob-served as leading to the highest performance. In these systems, the sense disambiguation problem is formulated as a supervised learning task, where each sense-tagged occurrence of a particular word is transformed into a feature vector which is then used in an automatic learning process. Despite their high performance, these supervised systems have an important drawback: their applicability is limited to those few words for which sense tagged data is avail-able, and their accuracy is strongly connected to the amount of labeled data available at hand.

To address the sense-tagged data bottleneck prob-lem, different methods have been proposed in the past, with various degrees of success. This includes the automatic generation of sense-tagged data using monosemous relatives (Leacock et al., 1998; Mi-halcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Martinez, 2004), automatically bootstrapped disambiguation patterns (Yarowsky, 1995; Mihalcea, 2002), paral-lel texts as a way to point out word senses bear-ing different translations in a second language (Diab and Resnik, 2002; Ng et al., 2003; Diab, 2004), and the use of volunteer contributions over the Web (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002).

In this paper, we investigate a new approach for building sense tagged corpora using Wikipedia as a source of sense annotations. Starting with the hy-perlinks available in Wikipedia, we show how we can generate sense annotated corpora that can be used for building accurate and robust sense clas-sifiers. Through word sense disambiguation ex-periments performed on the Wikipedia-based sense tagged corpus generated for a subset of the S ENSE -VAL ambiguous words, we show that the Wikipedia annotations are reliable, and the quality of a sense tagging classifier built on this data set exceeds by a large margin the accuracy of an informed baseline that selects the most frequent word sense by default.
The paper is organized as follows. We first pro-vide a brief overview of Wikipedia, and describe the view of Wikipedia as a sense tagged corpus. We then show how the hyperlinks defined in this resource can be used to derive sense annotated corpora, and we show how a word sense disambiguation system can be built on this dataset. We present the results obtained in the word sense disambiguation experi-ments, and conclude with a discussion of the results. Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, represent-ing the outcome of a continuous collaborative effort of a large number of volunteer contributors. Virtu-ally any Internet user can create or edit a Wikipedia webpage, and this  X  X reedom of contribution X  has a positive impact on both the quantity (fast-growing number of articles) and the quality (potential mis-takes are quickly corrected within the collaborative environment) of this online resource. Wikipedia edi-tions are available for more than 200 languages, with a number of entries varying from a few pages to
The basic entry in Wikipedia is an article (or page ), which defines and describes an entity or an event, and consists of a hypertext document with hy-perlinks to other pages within or outside Wikipedia. The role of the hyperlinks is to guide the reader to pages that provide additional information about the entities or events mentioned in an article.

Each article in Wikipedia is uniquely referenced by an identifier, which consists of one or more words separated by spaces or underscores, and occasion-ally a parenthetical explanation. For example, the article for bar with the meaning of  X  X ounter for drinks X  has the unique identifier bar (counter) . 2
The hyperlinks within Wikipedia are created us-ing these unique identifiers, together with an an-chor text that represents the surface form of the hy-perlink. For instance,  X  X enry Barnard, [[United States | American]] [[educationalist]], was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] X  is an example of a sen-tence in Wikipedia containing links to the articles United States, educationalist, and Hartford, Con-necticut. If the surface form and the unique iden-tifier of an article coincide, then the surface form can be turned directly into a hyperlink by placing double brackets around it (e.g. [[educationalist]] ). Alternatively, if the surface form should be hyper-linked to an article with a different unique identi-fier, e.g. link the word American to the article on United States , then a piped link is used instead, as in [[United States | American]] .

One of the implications of the large number of contributors editing the Wikipedia articles is the occasional lack of consistency with respect to the unique identifier used for a certain entity. For in-stance, the concept of circuit (electric) is also re-ferred to as electronic circuit , integrated circuit , electric circuit , and others. This has led to the so-called redirect pages , which consist of a redirection hyperlink from an alternative name (e.g. integrated circuit ) to the article actually containing the descrip-tion of the entity (e.g. circuit (electric) ).
Finally, another structure that is particularly rel-evant to the work described in this paper is the disambiguation page . Disambiguation pages are specifically created for ambiguous entities, and con-sist of links to articles defining the different mean-ings of the entity. The unique identifier for a dis-ambiguation page typically consists of the paren-thetical explanation (disambiguation) attached to the name of the ambiguous entity, as in e.g. cir-cuit (disambiguation) which is the unique identifier for the disambiguation page of the entity circuit . A large number of the concepts mentioned in Wikipedia are explicitly linked to their correspond-ing article through the use of links or piped links. Interestingly, these links can be regarded as sense annotations for the corresponding concepts, which is a property particularly valuable for entities that are ambiguous. In fact, it is precisely this observa-tion that we rely on in order to generate sense tagged corpora starting with the Wikipedia annotations.
For example, ambiguous words such as e.g. plant , bar , or chair are linked to different Wikipedia ar-ticles depending on their meaning in the context where they occur. Note that the links are manually created by the Wikipedia users, which means that they are most of the time accurate and referencing the correct article. The following represent five ex-ample sentences for the ambiguous word bar , with their corresponding Wikipedia annotations (links): In 1834, Sumner was admitted to the [[bar (law) | bar]] at the age of twenty-three, and entered private practice in Boston.
 It is danced in 3/4 time (like most waltzes), with the couple turning approx. 180 degrees every [[bar (music) | bar]] .
 Vehicles of this type may contain expensive au-dio players, televisions, video players, and [[bar (counter) | bar]] s, often with refrigerators. Jenga is a popular beer in the [[bar (establishment) | bar]] s of Thailand.
 This is a disturbance on the water surface of a river or estuary, often cause by the presence of a [[bar (landform) | bar]] or dune on the riverbed.

To derive sense annotations for a given ambigu-ous word, we use the links extracted for all the hy-perlinked Wikipedia occurrences of the given word, and map these annotations to word senses. For in-stance, for the bar example above, we extract five possible annotations: bar (counter), bar (establish-ment), bar (landform), bar (law) , and bar (music) .
Although Wikipedia provides the so-called dis-ambiguation pages that list the possible meanings of a given word, we decided to use instead the anno-tations collected directly from the Wikipedia links. This decision is motivated by two main reasons. First, a large number of the occurrences of ambigu-ous words are not linked to the articles mentioned by the disambiguation page, but to related concepts. This can happen when the annotation is performed using a concept that is similar, but not identical to the concept defined. For instance, the annotation for the word bar in the sentence  X  X he blues uses a rhyth-mic scheme of twelve 4/4 [[measure (music) | bars]] X  is measure (music) , which, although correct and di-rectly related to the meaning of bar (music) , is not listed in the disambiguation page for bar .

Second, most likely due to the fact that Wikipedia is still in its incipient phase, there are several in-consistencies that make it difficult to use the disam-biguation pages in an automatic system. For exam-ple, for the word bar , the Wikipedia page with the identifier bar is a disambiguation page, whereas for the word paper , the page with the identifier paper contains a description of the meaning of paper as  X  X aterial made of cellulose, X  and a different page paper (disambiguation) is defined as a disambigua-tion page. Moreover, in other cases such as e.g. the entries for the word organization , no disambiguation page is defined; instead, the articles corresponding to different meanings of this word are connected by links labeled as  X  X lternative meanings. X 
Therefore, rather than using the senses listed in a disambiguation page as the sense inventory for a given ambiguous word, we chose instead to col-lect all the annotations available for that word in the Wikipedia pages, and then map these labels to 3.1 Building Sense Tagged Corpora Starting with a given ambiguous word, we derive a sense-tagged corpus following three main steps:
First, we extract all the paragraphs in Wikipedia that contain an occurrence of the ambiguous word as part of a link or a piped link. We select para-graphs based on the Wikipedia paragraph segmen-To focus on the problem of word sense disambigua-tion, rather than named entity recognition, we ex-plicitly avoid named entities by considering only those word occurrences that are spelled with a lower case. Although this simple heuristic will also elim-inate examples where the word occurs at the begin-ning of a sentence (and therefore are spelled with an upper case), we decided nonetheless to not consider these examples so as to avoid any possible errors.
Next, we collect all the possible labels for the given ambiguous word by extracting the leftmost component of the links. For instance, in the piped link [[musical notation | bar]] , the label musi-cal notation is extracted. In the case of simple links (e.g. [[bar]] ), the word itself can also play the role of a valid label if the page it links to is not deter-mined as a disambiguation page.

Finally, the labels are manually mapped to their corresponding WordNet sense, and a sense tagged corpus is created. This mapping process is very fast, as a relatively small number of labels is typically identified for a given word. For instance, for the dataset used in the experiments reported in Section 5, an average of 20 labels per word was extracted.
To ensure the correctness of this last step, for the experiments reported in this paper we used two human annotators who independently mapped the Wikipedia labels to their corresponding WordNet sense. In case of disagreement, a consensus was reached through adjudication by a third annotator. In a mapping agreement experiment performed on the dataset from Section 5, an inter-annotator agree-ment of 91.1% was observed with a kappa statistics of  X  3.2 An Example As an example, consider the ambiguous word bar , with 1,217 examples extracted from Wikipedia where bar appeared as the rightmost component of a piped link or as a word in a simple link. Since the page with the identifier bar is a disambigua-tion page, all the examples containing the single link [[bar]] are removed, as the link does not re-move the ambiguity. This process leaves us with 1,108 examples, from which 40 different labels are extracted. These labels are then manually mapped to nine senses in WordNet. Figure 1 shows the la-bels extracted from the Wikipedia annotations for the word bar , the corresponding WordNet definition, as well as the Wikipedia definition (when the sense was defined in the Wikipedia disambiguation page). Provided a set of sense-annotated examples for a given ambiguous word, the task of a word sense dis-ambiguation system is to automatically learn a dis-ambiguation model that can predict the correct sense for a new, previously unseen occurrence of the word.
We use a word sense disambiguation system that integrates local and topical features within a ma-chine learning framework, similar to several of the top-performing supervised word sense disambigua-tion systems participating in the recent S ENSEVAL evaluations (http://www.senseval.org).

The disambiguation algorithm starts with a pre-processing step, where the text is tokenized and an-notated with part-of-speech tags. Collocations are identified using a sliding window approach, where a collocation is defined as a sequence of words that forms a compound concept defined in WordNet.
Next, local and topical features are extracted from the context of the ambiguous word. Specifically, we use the current word and its part-of-speech, a local context of three words to the left and right of the am-biguous word, the parts-of-speech of the surround-ing words, the verb and noun before and after the ambiguous words, and a global context implemented through sense-specific keywords determined as a list of at most five words occurring at least three times in the contexts defining a certain word sense.
This feature set is similar to the one used by (Ng and Lee, 1996), as well as by a number of state-of-the-art word sense disambiguation systems partici-pating in the S ENSEVAL -2 and S ENSEVAL -3 evalu-ations. The features are integrated in a Naive Bayes classifier, which was selected mainly for its perfor-mance in previous work showing that it can lead to a state-of-the-art disambiguation system given the features we consider (Lee and Ng, 2002). To evaluate the quality of the sense annotations gen-erated using Wikipedia, we performed a word sense disambiguation experiment on a subset of the am-biguous words used during the S ENSEVAL -2 and S
ENSEVAL -3 evaluations. Since the Wikipedia an-notations are focused on nouns (associated with the entities typically defined by Wikipedia), the sense annotations we generate and the word sense disam-biguation experiments are also focused on nouns.
Starting with the 49 ambiguous nouns used during the S ENSEVAL -2 (29) and S ENSEVAL -3 (20) evalu-ations, we generated sense tagged corpora follow-ing the process outlined in Section 3.1. We then re-moved all those words that have only one Wikipedia label (e.g. detention , which occurs 58 times, but appears as a single link [[detention]] in all the oc-currences), or which have several labels that are all mapped to the same WordNet sense (e.g. church , which has 2,198 occurrences with several differ-ent labels such as Roman church , Christian church , Catholic church , which are all mapped to the mean-ing of church, Christian church as defined in Word-Net). This resulted in a set of 30 words that have their Wikipedia annotations mapped to at least two senses according to the WordNet sense inventory.
Table 2 shows the disambiguation results using the word sense disambiguation system described in Section 4, using ten-fold cross-validation. For each word, the table also shows the number of senses, the total number of examples, and two baselines: a sim-ple informed baseline that selects the most frequent Table 2: Word sense disambiguation results, in-cluding two baselines (MFS = most frequent sense; LeskC = Lesk-corpus) and the word sense disam-biguation system. Number of senses (#s) and num-ber of examples (#ex) are also indicated. implements the corpus-based version of the Lesk al-gorithm (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000). Overall, the Wikipedia-based sense annotations were found reliable, leading to accurate sense classi-fiers with an average relative error rate reduction of 44% compared to the most frequent sense baseline, and 30% compared to the Lesk-corpus baseline. There were a few exceptions to this general trend. For instance, for some of the words for which only a small number of examples could be collected from Wikipedia, e.g. restraint or shelter , no accuracy im-provement was observed compared to the most fre-quent sense baseline. Similarly, several words in the Figure 1: Learning curve on the Wikipedia data set. data set have highly skewed sense distributions, such as e.g. bank , which has a total number of 1,074 ex-amples out of which 1,044 examples pertain to the meaning of financial institution , or the word mate-rial with 213 out of 223 examples annotated with the meaning of substance .

One aspect that is particularly relevant for any su-pervised system is the learning rate with respect to the amount of available data. To determine the learn-ing curve, we measured the disambiguation accu-racy under the assumption that only a fraction of the data were available. We ran ten fold cross-validation experiments using 10%, 20%, ..., 100% of the data, and averaged the results over all the words in the data set. The resulting learning curve is plotted in Figure 1. Overall, the curve indicates a continuously growing accuracy with increasingly larger amounts of data. Although the learning pace slows down after a certain number of examples (about 50% of the data currently available), the general trend of the curve seems to indicate that more data is likely to lead to increased accuracy. Given that Wikipedia is growing at a fast pace, the curve suggests that the accuracy of the word sense classifiers built on this data is likely to increase for future versions of Wikipedia.
Another aspect we were interested in was the cor-relation in terms of sense coverage with respect to other sense annotated data currently available. For the set of 30 nouns in our data set, we collected all the word senses that were defined in either the Wikipedia-based sense-tagged corpus or in the S EN -SEVAL corpus. We then determined the percentage covered by each sense with respect to the entire data set available for a given ambiguous word. For in-stance, the noun chair appears in Wikipedia with senses #1 (68.0%), #2 (31.9%), and #4(0.1%), and in S ENSEVAL with senses #1 (87.7%), #2 (6.3%), and #3 (6.0%). The senses that do not appear are in-dicated with a 0% coverage. The correlation is then measured between the relative sense frequencies of all the words in our dataset, as observed in the two corpora. Using the Pearson ( found an overall correlation of sense distributions in the Wikipedia corpus and the S
ENSEVAL corpus, which indicates a medium cor-relation. This correlation is much lower than the one observed between the sense distributions in the training data and in the test data in the S ENSEVAL corpus, which was measured at a high This suggests that the sense coverage in Wikipedia follows a different distribution than in S ENSEVAL , mainly reflecting the difference between the gen-res of the two corpora: an online collection of en-cyclopedic pages as available from Wikipedia, ver-sus the manually balanced British National Cor-pus used in S ENSEVAL . It also suggests that using the Wikipedia-based sense tagged corpus to disam-biguate words in the S ENSEVAL data or viceversa would require a change in the distribution of senses as previously done in (Agirre and Martinez, 2004). Table 3: Average number of senses and exam-ples, most frequent sense and Lesk-corpus baselines, and word sense disambiguation performance on the S Table 3 shows the characteristics of the S EN -SEVAL and the W IKIPEDIA datasets for the nouns listed in Table 2. The table also shows the most frequent sense baseline, the Lesk-corpus baseline, as well as the accuracy figures obtained on each dataset using the word sense disambiguation system Overall the sense distinctions identified in Wikipedia are fewer and typically coarser than those found in WordNet. As shown in Table 3, for the set of ambiguous words listed in Table 2, an aver-age of 4.6 senses were used in the S ENSEVAL an-notations, as compared to about 3.3 senses per word found in Wikipedia. This is partly due to a differ-ent sense coverage and distribution in the Wikipedia data set (e.g. the meaning of ambiance for the am-biguous word atmosphere does not appear at all in the Wikipedia corpus, although it has the highest fre-quency in the S ENSEVAL data), and partly due to the coarser sense distinctions made in Wikipedia (e.g. Wikipedia does not make the distinction between the act of grasping and the actual hold for the noun grip , and occurrences of both of these meanings are anno-tated with the label grip (handle) ).

There are also cases when Wikipedia makes dif-ferent or finer sense distinctions than WordNet. For instance, there are several Wikipedia annotations for image as copy , but this meaning is not even defined in WordNet. Similarly, Wikipedia makes the distinc-tion between dance performance and theatre perfor-mance , but both these meanings are listed under one single entry in WordNet ( performance as public pre-sentation ). However, since at this stage we are map-ping the Wikipedia annotations to WordNet, these differences in sense granularity are diminished. In word sense disambiguation, the line of work most closely related to ours consists of methods trying to address the sense-tagged data bottleneck problem.
A first set of methods consists of algorithms that generate sense annotated data using words semanti-cally related to a given ambiguous word (Leacock et al., 1998; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Martinez, 2004). Related non-ambiguous words, such as monosemous words or phrases from dictio-nary definitions, are used to automatically collect examples from the Web. These examples are then turned into sense-tagged data by replacing the non-ambiguous words with their ambiguous equivalents.
Another approach proposed in the past is based on the idea that an ambiguous word tends to have dif-ferent translations in a second language (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999). Starting with a collection of paral-lel texts, sense annotations were generated either for one word at a time (Ng et al., 2003; Diab, 2004), or for all words in unrestricted text (Diab and Resnik, 2002), and in both cases the systems trained on these data were found to be competitive with other word sense disambiguation systems.

The lack of sense-tagged corpora can also be cir-cumvented using bootstrapping algorithms, which start with a few annotated seeds and iteratively gen-erate a large set of disambiguation patterns. This method, initially proposed by (Yarowsky, 1995), was successfully evaluated in the context of the S ENSEVAL framework (Mihalcea, 2002).

Finally, in an effort related to the Wikipedia col-lection process, (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) have implemented the Open Mind Word Expert sys-tem for collecting sense annotations from volunteer contributors over the Web. The data generated using this method was then used by the systems participat-ing in several of the S ENSEVAL -3 tasks.

Notably, the method we propose has several ad-vantages over these previous methods. First, our method relies exclusively on monolingual data, thus avoiding the possible constraints imposed by meth-ods that require parallel texts, which may be difficult to find. Second, the Wikipedia-based annotations follow a natural Zipfian sense distribution, unlike the equal distributions typically obtained with the meth-ods that rely on the use of monosemous relatives or bootstrapping methods. Finally, the grow pace of Wikipedia is much faster than other more task-focused and possibly less-engaging activities such as Open Mind Word Expert, and therefore has the potential to lead to significantly higher coverage.
With respect to the use of Wikipedia as a re-source for natural language processing tasks, the work that is most closely related to ours is per-haps the name entity disambiguation algorithm pro-posed in (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006), where an SVM kernel is trained on the entries found in Wikipedia for ambiguous named entities. Other language pro-cessing tasks with recently proposed solutions re-lying on Wikipedia are co-reference resolution us-ing Wikipedia-based measures of word similarity (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), enhanced text classi-fication using encyclopedic knowledge (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2006), and the construction of com-parable corpora using the multilingual editions of Wikipedia (Adafre and de Rijke, 2006). In this paper, we described an approach for us-ing Wikipedia as a source of sense annotations for word sense disambiguation. Starting with the hy-perlinks available in Wikipedia, we showed how we can generate a sense annotated corpus that can be used to train accurate sense classifiers. Through ex-periments performed on a subset of the S ENSEVAL words, we showed that the Wikipedia sense annota-tions can be used to build a word sense disambigua-tion system leading to a relative error rate reduction of 30 X 44% as compared to simpler baselines.

Despite some limitations inherent to this approach (definitions and annotations in Wikipedia are avail-able almost exclusively for nouns, word and sense distributions are sometime skewed, the annotation labels are occasionally inconsistent), these limi-tations are overcome by the clear advantage that comes with the use of Wikipedia: large sense tagged data for a large number of words at virtually no cost.
We believe that this approach is particularly promising for two main reasons. First, the size of Wikipedia is growing at a steady pace, which conse-quently means that the size of the sense tagged cor-pora that can be generated based on this resource is also continuously growing. While techniques for supervised word sense disambiguation have been re-peatedly criticized in the past for their limited cover-age, mainly due to the associated sense-tagged data bottleneck, Wikipedia seems a promising resource that could provide the much needed solution for this problem. Second, Wikipedia editions are available for many languages (currently about 200), which means that this method can be used to generate sense tagged corpora and build accurate word sense clas-sifiers for a large number of languages.
