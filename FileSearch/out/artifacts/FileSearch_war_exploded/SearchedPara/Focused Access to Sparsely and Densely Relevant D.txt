 XML retrieval provides a focused access to the relevant content of documents. However, in evalua tion, full document retrieval has appeared competitive to focused XML retrieval. We analyze the density of relevance in documents , and show that in sparsely relevant documents focused retrie val performs better, whereas in densely relevant documents th e performance of focused and document retrieval is equal. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Search process Measurement, Performance, Experimentation. XML retrieval, tolerance to i rrelevance, focused retrieval. Ideal information retrieval (IR) systems would return only relevant information to the user. In traditional document retrieval, returned documents typically include both relevant and non-relevant content. Approaches lik e passage and XML retrieval aim at returning the relevant content more accurately: the user should be guided directly to the relevant content inside the document instead of having to browse through the whole document. Surprisingly, in recent studies document retrieval has been found a competitive approach to focused XML retrieval according to retrieval effectiveness [e.g. 7]. Ho wever, some essential features in focused access to a document have been overlooked: the order of browsing, the user X  X  reluctance to browse non-relevant information and the proportion of re levant text in documents. In the present study this proportion is referred to as the density of relevance of the document. An XML retrieval system provi des retrieved and assumedly relevant passages first to the user . If a returned passage turns out to be non-relevant, the user will not necessarily browse it through but rather continues with the next result. This user behavior is combined to effectiveness ev aluation in the tolerance to irrelevance (T2I) metric [4], which models the user interrupting to browse after a given amount of non-relevant information is encountered. The sooner T2I is reached, the less the document benefits the effectiveness in evaluation. In this study, we follow a browsing model with the given 
ACM 978-1-60558-896-4/10/07 Figure 1 shows the average precision of the five smallest deciles at percentages of the relevant documents X  running text. The relevant content in the lowest deciles is somewhat steady across the average document, which means the relevant content may be at any location, whereas the fourth and fifth decile shows a slight bias towards the beginning of a document. The remaining deciles especially from 7 upwards draw a high, relatively straight line and are left out for the readability of the lowest curves. To study the benefit of focused retrieval strategy for the retrieval within a document on each decile, we selected the retrieved passages of each relevant document. These passages were provided by the best performing run at INEX 2008 (RiCBest, University of Waterloo [5]). Then we compared these focused results with a document retrieval baseline, where each relevant document is browsed sequentially . Figure 2 shows the average recall, precision and the percentage of browsed content in the relevant documents for each decile. The elem column refers to the focused retrieval strategy (i.e. RiCBest) while the doc column refers to the document retrieval baseline. We report figures on two T2I points: 500 and 2000 characters. In other words the browsing is expected to end when the user has bypassed 500 or 2000 non-relevant characters. The amount of 500 characters corresponds approximately to the next paragraph. Figure 2c shows that the amount of browsed content is about the same for both of the strategies wh en assuming the same T2I. That is, the focused retrieval strategy does not reduce the amount of browsed content. However, with that amount the precision (Figure 2b) and especially the recall (Fi gure 2a) of the browsed content are notably higher with the focused strategy for half of the relevant deciles (dec1-5). The documents after sixth decile are uninteresting since they are densely relevant and neither browsing order matters nor T2I is reached. Focused retrieval is beneficial in locating the relevant content in between non-relevant material. Therefore documents with high relevance density are not interesting in the scope of focused retrieval. The results show that th e less relevant content, the better the focused retrieval performs. In plain document retrieval, the user is responsible for finding the relevant content within a sparsely relevant document. Th is leads into poor performance
