 Cascades are ubiquitous in various network environments such as epidemic networks, tra ffi c networks, water distribution networks and social networks. The outbreaks of cascades will often bring bad or even devastating e ff ects. How to accurately predict the cascading outbreaks in early stage is of paramount importance for people to avoid these bad e ff ects. Although there have been some pioneering works on cascading outbreaks detection, how to predict, rather than detect, the cascading outbreaks is still an open problem. In this pa-per, we attempt harnessing historical cascade data, propose a novel data driven approach to select important nodes as sensors, and pre-dict the outbreaks based on the cascading behaviors of these sen-sors. In particular, we propose Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regres-sion (OSLOR) method to jointly optimize node selection and out-break prediction, where the pred iction loss are combined with an orthogonal regularizer and L1 regularizer to guarantee good predic-tion accuracy, as well as the sparsity and low-redundancy of select-ed sensors. We evaluate the proposed method on a real online social network dataset including 182.7 m illion informatio n cascades. The experimental results show that the proposed OSLOR signi fi cantly and consistently outperform topological measure based method and other data driven methods in prediction performances.

An information cascade (or herding ) [10, 11] occurs when peo-ple observe the actions of others and then make the same choice as the others have made. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in var-ious network environments, such as epidemic di ff usion in social networks, tra ffi c jam spreading over transportation networks, and information propagation in social media, etc. Although these cas-cades are from di ff erent networks, all of them share a common characteristic: only a tiny proportion of them will break out (i.e. a large population of nodes in the network get a ff ected), and the remained will diminish before the critical point of outbreak [24]. How to predict these rare cascading outbreaks in early stage is of paramount importance for people to avoid disease prevalence, seri-ous tra ffi c congestion, rumor outbreak, and so on.

Cascades have been studied for many years in sociology, and most of them focus on the empirical analysis of those di ff usion processes. In recent years, cascades in networks and their out-break phenomena have aroused considerable interests from the re-searchers in computer science. A representative work by Leskovec et al. [18] proposed a cost-e ff ective methodology for near optimal sensor placement with multiple criteria to detect outbreaks in net-works. After that, a number of works have emerged following the line of outbreak detection in networks [5]. The major goal of these works is: given an outbreak cascade, how to detect this outbreak with minimum detection time or minimum a ff ected population? In contrast, the main goal of this paper is: given an arbitrary cascade, how to predict whether this cascade will break out or not in fu-ture with high accuracy? In other words, given a network and the dynamic cascades over the network, we want to select a set of n-odes as sensors to predict outbreaks in early stage according to their cascading behaviors (e.g. infecting a disease, involving in a tra ffi c congestion, adopting a piece of information or idea, etc.).
Take Twitter as an example, after a user publishes a post, some of his / her followers (or friends) will forward this post to their fol-lowers, and this post may spread out over the social network to form an information cascade, and possibly break out if a certain cascade size is reached. During the whole procedure, the cascad-ing behaviors (i.e. forwarding) of the involved users cause the out-break of this post, and clearly the importance of these users are not the same in that some user X  X  forwarding may bring more sub-sequent forwarding behaviors and thus has higher correlation with outbreaks. How to measure the user importance with respect to cascading outbreak prediction in early stage? A naive and intuitive solution would be to select the big users (e.g. celebrities) who have many followers. However, our empirical study suggests that these topological measures are not adequate, and they may not even di-rectly related to the task of outbreak prediction. In this paper, we Figure 1: Showcase: early prediction of cascading outbreak-s by OSLOR. The green line represents the accumulated for-warding number of a microblog from its generation to outbreak (outbreak threshold is 1200). The blue line represents the accu-mulated evidence of outbreak prediction. attempt to harness the historical information cascade data, and pro-pose a novel data driven approach to discover the important nodes.
In historical cascades, the behavior of each node may have in-dications in the early stage of multiple cascades, including both outbreak and non-outbreak cascades. Also the behaviors of mul-tiple nodes are often correlated or complementary with respect to outbreaks. Therefore we can select a subset of nodes, whose joint behaviors are highly correlated with the information outbreak, as sensors to achieve the prediction goal. However, this is a challeng-ing problem because: (1) the outbreak prediction and node selec-tion procedures need to be jointly optimized; (2) the node selection need to be parsimonious so that the monitoring over the selected sensors can be cost-e ff ective; and (3) the node selection process need to be e ffi cient so that the method can be applied into large realistic networks.

In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regres-sion (OSLOR) method to address the above requirements. In par-ticular, the outbreak prediction problem (a binary problem to pre-dict outbreak or non-outbreak) is formulated with a sparse logistic regression model, which minimizes the prediction loss with a s-parse linear model, in which only a small number of variates are active. In order to reduce the redundancy among the selected sen-sors without sacri fi cing the prediction quality, we add a penalty term to constrain the orthogonality of se lected nodes. We evaluate the proposed method on a real online social network dataset, which is collected from a Twitter style website. We have in total 116 . 3 million nodes (i.e. users) and 4 . 05 billion edges (i.e. social rela-tions) in the network, and 182 . 7 million cascades over the network. In our experiments, OSLOR achieves much higher prediction ac-curacy than topological measure based methods and other feature selection based methods. We show, perhaps counterintuitively, that the nodes with high indegree have poor predictive power for cas-cading outbreaks.

Figure 1 is a showcase of outbreak prediction by the proposed method. We show that by e ff ectively selecting users on social net-work to monitor their cascading behaviors, we can predict at 2,474 seconds (after its generation) that this information cascade will break out in future, which in actual break out around 13,620 sec-onds. Thus, we predict this cascading outbreak with the leading time of 11146 seconds. While for most information cascades, the evidence cannot reach the threshold (0.5) and thus will be predicted as non-outbreaks.

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) Enlightened by the outbreak detection works, we move one step forward to attempt outbreak prediction problem, which is of paramount importance for various applications, such as network monitoring, and viral marketing. (2) In contrast with the topological measure based methods com-monly used in previous research, we propose to measure the node importance with respect to cascading outbreaks from data driven angle, and we show that the nodes we discovered from historical data can, in most cases, signi fi cantly outperform the nodes selected by topological measures such as indegree. (3) We propose a novel Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regression method to jointly optimize outbreak prediction and node selection, which can provide cost-e ff ective solution for node selection while maintaining high prediction accuracy. (4) We extensively evaluate the proposed method on the appli-cation of information cascade outbreak prediction in online social network. The proposed method can be straightforwardly applied into outbreak prediction in other network environment, such as epi-demic, tra ffi c and water distribution networks.

The rest of this paper is organized as follow: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 presents a formal de fi nition of our problem, and introduce the proposed method. Section 4 describes the detail about experiments and shows the results. Finally, section 5 con-cludes the paper, summarize our contributions and discuss future work.
Although cascade has been studied for many years in sociolo-gy, only in recent years the computer science researchers start to pay attention to it, especially with the rapid development of online social networks. In this section, we will brie fl y survey the relat-ed work, introduce the corres ponding taxonomies, and pos ition the uniqueness of this paper.

Outbreak analysis and detection. Cascades and outbreaks hap-pen ubiquitously in various networks. The common way to detect outbreaks is to select important nodes and place sensors there to monitor. This strategy has been widely applied to detect water con-taminations in water distribution network [14], and virus outbreaks in human society [5]. Some early work placed sensors by topo-logical measures, e.g. targeting high degree nodes [31] or highly connected nodes[6]. Recently, Les kovec et al. [18] pr oposed to op-timize the sensor placement with di ff erent criterions such as mini-mizing detection time or population a ff ected. By taking advantages of submodularity property, the proposed algorithm can be used to optimize large scale real world graph. Also, Kumar et al. [15] analyzed the bursty evolution of blog network, and discovered its relation with community structures. Prakash et al. [28] investigat-ed, after a cascade started, how to identify the nodes from which the cascade started to spread. This paper is eventually enlightened by these works, and aim to optimally select important nodes as sensors to predict the cascading outbreaks. Our work is distinct from those existing works in two aspects: (1) The goal of this paper is to pre-dict, rather than detect, the cascading outbreaks in early stage; (2) Di ff erent from the topological measure based methods for impor-tant node selection, we attempt harnessing historical cascade data and propose a novel data driven approach to optimize the sensor placement.

In fl uence modeling and maximization. This is another impor-tant area emerging in recent years that is closely related to the work in this paper. The goal of in fl uence modeling and maximization is to evaluate user importance in social networks. Motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos et al. [7] proposed a method to select early starters to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions. Then Kempe et al. [13] proposed Stochastic Cascade Model to formalize this problem as a discrete optimization prob-lem. Chen et al. [4] improved the algorithm in e ffi ciency, and fi nal-ly derived a scalable solution. The approach was further extended to multiple cascades [34] or choosin g edges instead of users [32]. Gionis et al. [9] investigated the problem of opinion maximization in social networks. Although on the problem side, in fl uence maxi-mization is similar to the problem we target in this paper on impor-tant node selection, the stochastic cascade model they constructed their algorithms on is based on ideal assumption and thus can only be used in simulation, not real world cascade data. Recently, Cha et al. [3] empirically analyzed the social in fl uence in Twitter from di ff erent angles such as network topology and user behaviors, and drew the conclusion that topologi cal measures alone reveal very lit-tle about in fl uence of a user. This fi nding is consistent with ours, but our main task is to predict the cascading outbreaks, rather than empirical analysis.

Information cascades and social networks. In recent years, many methods have been proposed to analyze information cascades in various domains, including traditional mails [2], blogs [22][11], marketing [16], web news [17] and social media [35, 25, 21]. In macroscopic level, some methods are proposed to fi nd rules and patterns of the information cascades in social networks. Rodrigues et al. [29] analyzed the characteristics of the information cascades in Twitter. Anagnostopoulos et al. [1] examine the role of authority pressure on the observed information cascades. Yang et al. [35] proposed a time series clustering method to fi nd the information d-i ff usion patterns in Twitter. Matsubara et al. [21] built a unifying model SPIKEM with seven parameters to explain all cascades. In microscopic level, Menon et al. [23] investigated the cascading be-haviors and predicted the response of a user when receiving a piece of information. Besides, information cascades were exploited to in-fer the di ff usion process and the underlying network structure [10]. Most of these works focus on discovering the rules and patterns of information cascades in social networks. In contrast, we focus more on predictive modeling. Also, the outbreak phenomenon in social networks are rarely investigated, and how to accurately pre-dict these outbreaks in early stage is still an open problem.
In this section we will present our OSLOR method for early pre-diction of cascading outbreaks in detail. First we introduce some symbols and notations that will be used throughout the paper.
As stated in the introduction, the problem we focus on in this paper is to predict in its early stage whether a information cascade in a network will outbreak or not. To make the presentation more understandable, we will use the Twitter scenario as the context to introduce our method. In this case, an information cascade is started from a user X  X  posting, and constructed by a series of user forwarding behaviors.

Suppose there are a total of m information cascades and n partic-information cascades at time t since they are started, such that X t is either 1 or 0 indicating whether or not user j has participated in cascade i till timestamp t . Here we call the timestamp t as early garded as the behavior vector of the j -th user till time t , while row vector X t i  X  is the condition of the i -th cascade till time t .Ifweuse X  X  to represent the fi nal state of all cascades, then the i -th cascade breaks out means the number of participating users in it exceeds a certain threshold u 0. Let y = ( y 1 , y 2 ,  X  X  X  , y m ) T  X  R m  X  1 be the vector of prediction targets that whether those cascades will break out or not. Then we have : where sign (  X  ) is the sign function such that sign ( a )is1if a is posi-tive, and  X  1if a is negative. u is the prede fi ned outbreak threshold.
In this way, the problem of early prediction of cascading out-break is to predict y at t with X t where t is small. For instance, if the timestamp unit is second, then we use X 300 to predict whether a cascade will break out or not in just 5 minutes after it has been generated.
Till now we can see that the cascading outbreak prediction prob-lem is transformed into a binary classi fi cation problem: based on the current cascade status matrix X t , predicting whether those cas-cades will break out or not fi nally. We use logistic regression, a powerful binary classi fi cation approach to achieve such goal [12, 20, 30]. The decision function for the i -th cascade at time t is : tor. Here the value of  X  j suggests the impact of the j -th user to the outbreak of the cascades. A positive  X  j suggests the cascading behavior of user j has positive correlation with cascading outbreak (i.e., the participation of the j -th user in cascade i will more like-ly to lead its outbreak), while a negative  X  j indicates the behavior of user j has negative impact to the cascade outbreaks, and a zero  X  means that the behavior of user j has no impact on the cascade outbreaks. In the following presentation, for the sake of notational convenience, we (1) drop  X  0 because we can always extend  X  by another dimension with including  X  0 and X t i  X  with including one ad-ditional 1; (2) drop superscript t on the status matrix because the derived algorithm is independent of any speci fi c timestamp.
In logistic regression, the objective is to maximize the following equation with respect to  X  : To increase numerical stability, we usually work on maximizing the logarithm of L (  X  )as: In addition to the prediction accuracy, we also need to consider two other aspects of the cascade outbreak prediction problem:
Mathematically, the fi rst item can be achieved by adding a L1 regularization on  X  , the second item can be satis fi ed by adding an orthogona lity regularization term on the users X  behavior vectors. Figure 2: The distribution of the quantity of (outbreak) cas-cades that users participate.
 Combining everything together, we propose the Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regression (OSLOR) method which aims to minimize the following objective In the following section we will proposed an auxiliary function method to minimize F (  X  ). Before we go into the details, one issue we want to mention here is the scalability problem. In reality, the number of users n is over 10 8 , which makes the matrix X t too large to be handled e ffi ciently. However, the distribution of the quantity of cascades that users participate fi ts powerlaw, as shown in Figure 2. Many users only participate in one or two cascades. Thus we fi lter out the users according to their participation frequency.
To minimize F (  X  ) in Eq.(5), we propose an auxiliary function method in this section, which is similar as [19]. Speci fi cally, let is : where denotes the Hadamard product and H  X  is calculated as below : Obviously, the derivative function of g (  X  )is fi rst order continuous and di ff erentiable, thus it is locally Lipschitz continuous [8]. Then according to [26], for R  X  R + and  X   X  satisfying  X   X   X  &lt; R ,we have the following inequality, where || X || is Frobenious Norm. Now we de fi ne the following aux-iliary function Obviously S (  X  ,  X  ) has the following three properties Based on S (  X  ,  X  ), we can design the following iteration strategy to minimize F (  X  ). 2. Update  X  k + 1 = argmin  X  S (  X  ,  X  k )for k = 0 , 1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  . The generated  X  k series have the following property : Therefore the objective function value F (  X  ) will be monotonically decreasing with the those iteration rules. Now the only problem is to minimize S (  X  ,  X  k ) with respect to  X  . To solve that, we have the following lemma.

L emma 1. The global optimum of minimizing the following ob-jective with respect to u where u = [ u 1 , u 2 ,  X  X  X  , u n ] and a = [ a 1 , a 2 ,  X  X  X  , a sional vectors, is given by
P roof . According to the de fi nition of 1-norm and Frobenious norm, we have : Thus the minimization of J ( u ) could be achieved by minimizing each formula independently. Denote f i ( x ) = ( x  X  a i i = 1 ,  X  X  X  , n .Thenwehave: f ( x ) = Since every f i ( x ) is a combination of two quadratic function, the optimum value is obtained among three points : the junction point or the two parabola X  X  peaks. Thus : This proves the lemma.
 Then for the renew step, we have : If we set a =  X  k  X  1 R  X  g (  X  k ) , X  =  X  R , and apply the lemma above, we obtain a close form update formula for each entry of a new coe ffi cient : where symbol (  X  ) + means the positive part of the number within brackets.
 The whole algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. By compar-Algorithm 1 Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regression (OSLOR) Require: Tradeo ff parameters  X &gt; 0,  X &gt; 0, Radius R &gt; 0, Cas-1: Calculate the inner product matrix X  X  X 2: Initialize the coe ffi cient  X  0  X  0 3: Calculate the current value of object function using Eq.

Complexity Analysis The fi rst step of our algorithm takes O ( mn 2 ) time to calculate the inner product. Though in reality the column vector X i is very sparse that the actual time expense here is O (  X  mn 2 ) where  X  is the sparse rate. From Eq.(4), we can see the time com-plexity for calculating the loss function is O ( mn ). From Eq.(7), the time complexity is O ( n 2 ) when all the inner products have been al-ready calculated. From Eq.(10), to calculate H  X  takes O ( mn ) time. And Eq.(9) takes O ( mn + mn + mn ) = O ( mn ) time to calculate. At last, it spends O ( n ) time to update  X  from Eq.(16). In total, the time complexity of our algorithm is O (  X  mn 2 + k ( mn + n 2 )) where k is the number of iteration times. Due to our experimental result, k is about 10 2 , less than both n and m . Thus we have kmn &lt; nmn = mn 2 and kn 2 &lt; mn 2 .Brie fl y, the time complexity is O ( mn 2 ).
In this section we will present the empirical study results on ap-plying OSLOR for cascade outbreak detection in a real world data set. The dataset for experiments in this paper is collected from Tencent 500 million users in total. We collected all the information cas-warding these microblogs) with timestamps generated between March 10th and March 20th of year 2011, as well as the complete so-cial network snapshot of all users in Tencent Weibo at March 20th, 2011. The propagation paths of all the collected microblogs are explicitly known, which do not need to be inferred. In this dataset, we have in total 182. 7 million information cascades, and 116.3 mil-lion participated users. To better understand the dataset, we show a log-log distribution graph of cascade size in Figure 3, and list some data details in Table 1. Figure 3: Distribution of cascade size (in blue and solid). The red straight line is the linear fi tting result to the blue curve, showing the distribution fi ts power-law. The two green lines indicate the threshold which discriminate outbreaks and non-outbreaks. Those 2000 cascades in between are gap cascades and not used in experiments.

Figure 3 shows that the size of information cascades fi ts power-law, which means that only a tiny proportion of these information cascades break out while the remains are non-outbreaks. Table 1 shows that among th e 1.16 billion cascades , only about 420 thou-sand cascades are larger than 5, and about 1000 cascades are larger participate the cascades several times, we only record the earliest time. Table 1: Some detailed statistics of the cascade size, count and number of participated users. The number in the second col-umn indicates the quantity of cascades which have a larger size than the number in the fi rst column. The third column repre-sents the ratio of the second column over the total number of cascades. The last column is the number of users that involved in these cascades. than 1200. Thus, this is a seriously unbalanced dataset for outbreak prediction.
To avoid skewing the predictor towards the non-outbreak cas-cades, we did some selection on the cascades for training OSLOR. Speci fi cally, we rank all the cascades according to cascade size with decreasing order, and we select the top 1000 cascades as outbreaks, the 3001st -10000th cascades as non-outbreaks, and the 1001st -3000th cascades as the gap between outbreaks and non-outbreaks. After the fi ltering, the smallest size of outbreak cascades is 1200, and the largest size of non-outbreak cascades is 543, as shown in Figure 3. Although the setting o f boundary between outbreaks and non-outbreaks is not very precise, it has little e ff ect on the evalua-tion of the proposed method and the comparison with the baselines, which is demonstrated in experiment results. Any more solid meth-ods for outbreak thresholding can be straightforwardly applied in our method. Among the 8000 cascades, we randomly select 80% of them for training, and the remained 20% for testing. We conduc-t random selection of training and testing data for 100 times, and report the average results in the following.

Note that in our method, we emphasize the outbreak prediction in early stage. We thus set t in X t (inSection3.1)toashorttime duration. In our experiments, we set t to 300 seconds, 1800 sec-onds 3600 seconds and 5400 seconds to represent di ff erent levels of early stage. Given a cascade, we only use the selected sensors that participated this cascade before t since its generation to predict the outbreak.
In order to demonstrate the advantages and characteristics of the proposed methods, we implemented the following four methods as baselines:
As the outbreak prediction problem is transformed into binary classi fi cation problem, we use Precision, Recall and F1 to evalu-ate the prediction performances of the proposed methods and base-follow. H = ( h 1 , h 2 ,  X  X  X  , h m ) = ( h ( X t 1  X  ) , h ( X t predict vector and y is the result vector. Use T to denote the set of testing samples. Then
In this section, we will demonstrate the prediction performance of OSLOR and other baselines with respect to outbreak prediction accuracy.

With the di ff erent numbers of selected users (50, 100, 300 and 500), and di ff erent settings for early stage time (300, 1800, 3600 and 5400 seconds), we show the prediction performances of all the fi ve methods in Figure 4. From this fi gure, we have the following observations. (1) In terms of F1 measure, the proposed method OSLOR signif-icantly and consistently outperform other baselines. The more sen-sors selected, the larger improvement is made by OSLOR, which is owing to the subtle node selection process and the joint optimiza-tion of prediction accuracy and node selection. (2) In most cases, MRel and mRMR can achieve better predic-tion accuracy than indgree. Indgree is a representative topologi-cal measure, which is widely used for node importance evaluation. Here we carefully argue that for a speci fi c task in network where historical data is available, data driven approach can often outper-form topological measure based methods. (3) By observing the fi gures of precision and recall, we can see that the indegree method can always get highest precision, while our method can always get highest recall. That means the cascades participated by nodes with high indegree will be more probable to break out. On the other side, however, the outbreak cascades do not necessarily involve the top ranked nodes with respect to indegree. That is why the indegree method has poor performance in recall aspect. (4) The prediction accuracy increases with the early stage time increasing. This is because increasing the early stage time can bring in more information about the information cascades (i.e. more user-s participated in the cascades), with which we can better predict outbreaks. However, more information will bring more noise. In OSLOR, these noise is suppressed by the Lasso term. That is why the advantage of OSLOR become more obvious with the increasing of early stage time.

We show in Figure 5 the prediction accuracy with di ff erent num-ber of sensors for OSLOR and other three baselines (the curve for mRMR is omitted as its curve is very similar with MRel). We can precision rate precision rate precision rate precision rate see that the prediction accuracy increases with the number of sen-sors increasing for all methods, which is consistent with the intu-ition. The prediction accuracy increases fast when the number of sensors increase from 0 to 50 for OSLOR, MRel and indegree. The curve of MRel and indegree become stable around 100 sensors. But the prediction accuracy of OSLOR continuously increase.

We show in Table 2 the standard deviation of F1 for all methods with 500 sensors and di ff erent early stage time, which demonstrate the proposed method OSLOR is quite stable. Also, we conduct T-Test for OSLOR over all baseline methods, and demonstrate that OSLOR signi fi cantly outperform other baselines with p  X  value &lt; 0 . 05.
As we emphasize early prediction of cascading outbreaks, we will demonstrate how much leading time we can obtain for the early prediction. We show in Figure 6(a) the distribution of outbreak time for all outbreak cascades since the generation. We can see that the outbreak cascades in this dataset (whose setting is very similar with Twitter) break out very fast. Almost 75% of them break out within 3 hours after the generation. This is in contrast with the cascading outbreaks in other network environment, such as epidemic network and water distribution network, where the outbreak time counted in days. The fast outbreak make the prediction, especially in early stage, more challenging.

Fortunately, the proposed method OSLOR can predict 72 . 85% of these outbreaks with acceptable accuracy in fi ve minutes, as shown in Figure 6(b). There are only a few cascades that need over one hour for OSLOR to give a high outbreak evidence. Figure 6(c) shows the prediction leading time distribution. Although these cas-cades break out fast, we can still accurately predict the outbreak with at least one hour leading time for over 55% cascades. In fact, the average leading time is 2 . 77 hours.
In the design of OSLOR, we emphasize that the node selection process should be parsimonious, and impose the orthogonal and s-parse regularizers into the objective function. Here we show the (c) Distribution of prediction leading time. Figure 5: Predicting results of di ff erent methods with di ff erent number of sensors (from 10 to 500) and di ff erent early stage time (300sec, 1800sec, 3600sec, 5400sec). e ff ect in Figure 7. We compare the performance of OSLOR which combines the loss term with two regularizers, and the logistic re-gression method (denoted as LR in the fi gure) without any regu-larizers. We can see that the OSLOR signi fi cantly and consistent-ly outperform logistic regressi on method under var ious settings on sensor number and early stage time. In particular, for a certain number of sensors, the nodes selected and optimized by OSLOR are much more e ff ective than those from logistic regression. One main reason is that the orthogonal regularizer reduce the redun-dancy of the selected nodes, which guarantee the diversity of these nodes and maximize the e ff ective information amount that can be acquired from these nodes.

In this paper, we focus on predicting cascading outbreaks in ear-ly stage. We borrow the idea of placing sensors on important nodes of networks from outbreak detection works, and attempt harness-ing historical cascade data to discover the important nodes, whose cascading behaviors are aggregated to predict outbreaks. Aiming at this, we propose Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regression (OSLOR) method to jointly optimize the outbreak prediction and node se-lection. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that the pro-posed method can signi fi cantly and consistently outperform other data driven approaches (MRel and mRMR) and topological mea-sure based approach (indegree). Although the experimental dataset is collected from social network, the proposed approach can be s-traightforwardly applied into other networks such as epidemic net-works, tra ffi c networks and water distribution networks, etc.. In this paper, we have found out the important nodes that have strong predictive power for outbreaks. How to fi gure out the common characteristics of these nodes discovered by data driven approach will be our future work.
