 1. Introduction
Researchers have attempted to identify the underlying causes of citation errors with a view to targeting interventions for those who are most  X  X  X t-risk X  X  of constructing inaccurate reference lists. Sweetland (1989) found that one reason for citation errors to occur before publication is the  X  X  X omplexity X  X  of some citations or the  X  X  X ack of standardization X  X  in citation formats among journals. Another reason noted is that the authors take a shortcut and  X  X  X ave not actually seen the original, thus perpetuating any error that might be made by one who has X  X  ( Sweetland, 1989, p. 299 ). Other possible reasons that have been identified include carelessness and misuse of language, citing a forthcoming work that was never published later or even fictional references inserted just to make a rhetorical point ( Evans, Nadjari, &amp; Burchell, 1990; Grayson &amp; Young, 2001 ). Lok,
Chan, and Martinson (2001) found that although there are great variations in the incidence of citation errors, several factors affect the level of citation accuracy. Their findings suggest that long lists of references and single authorships are independent risk factors for minor incidences of citation errors such as misspelling of authors X  names and initials:  X  X  X hus, a long list of references may produce more room for error, whereas additional authors should allow better verification of the references X  X  (p. 226). Other factors that Lok et al. (2001) found might affect the occurrence of citation errors in reference lists include the journal impact factor and journal immediacy index. Both are assumed to be indicators of the quality of a journal. However, these researchers emphasize that all these factors are important predictors of minor citation errors only. Lok et al. (2001) failed to identify the possible factors contributing to major citation errors such as incorrect title, volume, year of publication, or page numbers. These major errors are likely to impede immediate retrieval of the original source of reference ( Eichorn &amp; Yankauer, 1987 ). The past studies have provided heuristic value by presenting often separated insights into the problem of citation errors. However, little is known about the characteristics of authors who tend to commit citation errors except for their  X  X  X arelessness X  X  and  X  X  X isuse of language. X  X 
Recently, in what appears to be the first study to investigate the profile of authors who commit citation errors, Waytowich, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao (2006) investigated the characteristics of graduate students who committed citation errors in their doctoral dissertation proposals. These researchers found that (a) students with the lowest expectation levels tended to have the highest citation error rates; and (b) students who have taken the most courses in their graduate programs tended to receive the lowest scores pertaining to the quality of reference lists. Also, graduate students with relatively high levels of self-oriented perfectionism (i.e., place high standards on themselves) and other-oriented perfectionism (i.e., place high standards on others) tended to commit the least citation errors and construct reference lists that closely resemble the stipulations of the Pub-lication Manual of the American Psychological Association ( American Psychological Association, 2001 ). To date, the study of Waytowich et al. (2006) represents the only formal inquiry examining the characteristics of authors who commit citation errors. Thus, clearly, more research is needed in this area.

The field of library anxiety study appears to offer a viable avenue for research on the attributes of authors who commit citation errors. In particular, because conducting literature reviews involves extensive use of library resources and services, it is likely that library anxiety plays a role in the formation of citation errors.
Library anxiety is formally defined as  X  X  X n uncomfortable feeling or emotional disposition, experienced in a library setting, which has cognitive, affective, physiological, and behavioral ramifications X  X  ( Jiao, Onwuegbu-zie, &amp; Lichtenstein, 1996, p. 152 ). Although the characteristics of library anxiety have been observed for years, detailed analysis and scientific understanding of the phenomenon is of relatively recent origin ( Onwuegbuzie, Jiao, &amp; Bostick, 2004 ).

The concept of library anxiety was formally introduced by Mellon (1986) . However, it took nearly six years before Bostick created the Library Anxiety Scale ( Bostick, 1992 ), which, as documented by Onwuegbuzie et al. (2004) , subsequently has been used for most of the quantitative studies of the phenomenon of library anxiety in academic libraries. According to Mellon (1986) , feelings of library anxiety stem from either the relative size of the library; inadequate knowledge about the location of materials, equipment, and resources of the library; lack of knowledge of how to initiate library research; or lack of awareness of how to proceed with a library search. Students with high levels of library anxiety often experience negative emotions such as fear, apprehen-sion, ruminations, and mental disorganization, which hinder their abilities to use the library effectively ( Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004 ). Indeed, library anxiety has been found to be one of the most predictive indicators of the library experiences of US college students, with between 75% and 85% of undergraduate students describing their initial library experiences in terms of anxiety ( Mellon, 1986 ).

Moreover, library anxiety can have debilitating effects on students X  academic achievement ( Onwuegbuzie, 1997; Onwuegbuzie &amp; Jiao, 2004; Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004 ). Specifically, using path analytic techniques, Onwuegbuzie and Jiao (2004) found that library anxiety plays a central role in their Anxiety-Expectation
Mediation (AEM) model. Library anxiety is related bi-directionally to the performance in research method-ology courses, as measured by students X  score on their research proposals. And, at the same time, library anx-iety mediates the relationship between research performance and other cognitive, personality, and demographic variables, including age, academic achievement (i.e., grade point average), learning style, aca-demic procrastination, and self-perception.

According to Onwuegbuzie and Jiao (2004) , the pivotal role of library anxiety in the AEM model suggests that Wine X  X  (1980) Cognitive-Attentional-Interference theory can be applied to the library setting. Specifically,
Wine X  X  theory would predict that library anxiety interferes with students X  ability to undertake successfully library information seeking tasks. Further, library anxiety likely reduces the efficiency with which cognitive processes are utilized while striving to receive, to encode, and to process new information, making it difficult to reach a successful search closure. This reduction in the efficiency of cognitive processes as a result of library anxiety also might be responsible, to some degree, for the tendency of some students to commit citation errors.
Yet, despite the potential of library anxiety to explain, at least in part, why students commit citation errors, to date, no researcher has examined this potential link. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between citation errors and library anxiety among graduate students. It was hoped that findings from this study would help to increase our understanding of the etiology of citation errors and, at the same time, provide further insights into the educational implications of library anxiety. 2. Method 2.1. Participants
Participants were 93 doctoral students from various disciplines in education (e.g., educational administra-tion, elementary education, school psychology) enrolled in five sections of a doctoral-level, dissertation prepa-ratory course at a large southeastern university. The majority of the sample was female (66.7%) and White (71.0%). Ages of the participants ranged from 22 to 57 years ( M = 34.77, SD = 9.27). The number of research methodology courses taken by the sample members ranged from 0 to 7 ( M = 2.29, SD = 1.70), with 15.1% of the participants never having taken a research methodology course. Similarly, the number of statistics courses taken by these individuals ranged from 0 to 5 ( M = 2.32, SD = 1.30), with only 4% of the sample members never having taken a statistics course. The participants were asked at the beginning of the course what the grade average they would expect to get on a 100-point scale. Final grades predicted by students ranged from 70 to 100 points ( M = 91.11, SD = 5.49). The participants, on average, had earned nearly 54 credit hours ( M = 53.92, SD = 26.06), and were taking an average of 11 credit hours ( M = 10.72, SD = 4.10) during the semester that they took the course. With respect to overall academic achievement, the students X  mean grade point average (GPA) was 3.80 (SD = 0.22). 2.2. Setting At the university where the study took place, the dissertation preparatory course is taught every semester.
These courses, which last for 16 weeks, are taught for four hours, once per week. The major requirement of the course is the completion of a mixed-methods dissertation research proposal. The objective of this dissertation proposal is to prepare students thoroughly to be able to write proposals that contained both quantitative and qualitative components, thereby preparing them to undertake quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods dissertations. Their dissertation proposals have to be unique and realistic. They must also have educational significance and extend the knowledge base. As such, the dissertation proposals provide authentic assessment ( Wiggins, 1990 ) of the students.

With respect to structure, the dissertation proposals have to include an introductory chapter (i.e., Chapter 1), comprising problem statement, background information, rationale of the study, statement of the purpose, grand tour questions, research question(s), research hypotheses, educational significance, definition of terms, limitations, delimitations, and organization of remaining proposal chapters. Further, the dissertation propos-als have to include a literature review section (i.e., Chapter 2), which includes a clear and explicit theoretical/ conceptual framework. In addition, the proposal has to include a methods section (e.g., participants, instru-ments, procedures, analysis) (i.e., Chapter 3). Consequently, the proposals have to contain all the major ele-ments of Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of traditional dissertations, containing at least 20 complete and consistent references . It is encouraged that the study proposed is in the student X  X  area of research and, if possible, rep-resents a potential dissertation topic that the student will pursue at the appropriate time of her/his degree pro-gram. Further, the proposed investigation has to integrate qualitative and quantitative research approaches.
Students are encouraged to begin the process of developing their dissertation research proposals from the first class meeting. In particular, they are required to formulate their research problems and develop their research questions by the second class meeting and to start obtaining literature sources by the third class meeting. Each proposal has to be typed, following guidelines specified by the Publication Manual of the American Psycho-logical Association (2001) . Scoring rubrics are used to assess the research proposals ( Wilson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 1999 ), with detailed feedback provided by the instructor. 2.3. Instruments and procedure Participants were asked to complete the Library Anxiety Scale (LAS) and the Background Information
Form (BIF). The LAS was developed by Bostick (1992) . This instrument contains forty-three 5-point Lik-ert-format items that assess levels of library anxiety experienced by users. The LAS contains the following five subscales or dimensions: (a) barriers with staff, (b) affective barriers, (c) comfort with the library, (d) knowl-edge of the library, and (e) mechanical barriers. Barriers with staff pertain to students X  perceptions and beliefs that librarians are threatening, intimidating, unapproachable, and inaccessible. Further, librarians are per-ceived as being too busy to provide students with help in conducting library tasks X  X hat is, they have duties that are much more important than helping them ( Jiao et al., 1996 ). Affective barriers refer to users X  feelings of ineptness while performing or attempting to perform library tasks. These feelings of inadequacy are exacer-bated by the assumption that other library users are more competent than they are in using the library ( Mel-lon, 1986 ). Comfort with the library deals with how comfortable, secure, welcoming, safe, and non-threatening users perceive the library to be. Knowledge of the library refers to the extent to which students believe they are familiar with the library. Finally, mechanical barriers involve anxieties that come to the fore when students use mechanical library equipment, including computers, printers, and photocopy machines. For the current inves-tigation, the score reliability coefficients pertaining to each of the library anxiety subscales are presented in Table 1 .

The Background Demographic Form was developed specifically for this study. This form extracted relevant demographic information such as gender, age, race, degree program, grade point average, number of college-level research methodology courses taken, number of college-level statistics courses taken, number of college-level mathematics courses taken, course load, and expected grade in the course.

Furthermore, a scoring rubric, entitled  X  X  X coring Checklist for Quality of Reference List, X  X  was used to eval-uate the quality of the reference lists contained in students X  research proposals ( Wilson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 1999 ).
This rubric consisted of a 5-point Likert-format scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree) that was designed to provide a score that determines the extent to which the reference list is free from grammatical and typographical errors and follows the guidelines of the Publication
Manual of the American Psychological Association ( American Psychological Association, 2001 ). This rubric contains eight items (e.g.,  X  X  X ll titles are written accurately and in strict adherence to American Psychological Association guidelines X  X ) such that scores range from 8 to 40, with high scores representing reference lists that adhere to the American Psychological Association (2001) stipulations. For the current study, score reliability, as measured by coefficient alpha (i.e., internal consistency), was .78 for the Scoring Checklist for Quality of
Reference List (95% CI = .71, .84). It should be noted that none of the study participants used bibliographic management software (e.g., Endnote, RefWorks) in the creation of their reference lists.

The scoring rubric, entitled  X  X  X coring Checklist for Quality of Reference List, X  X  was part of a larger rubric (i.e., Dissertation Proposal Rubric) that was used to assess the quality of the overall dissertation proposal. In addition to this Reference List checklist, the Dissertation Proposal Rubric contained a 5-point Likert-format scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree) that was designed to pro-vide a score for the content of the dissertation research proposal (i.e., Content Checklist). This rubric contains 310 items that evaluate all components of the traditional dissertation proposal (i.e., introduction section [Chapter 1], literature review section [Chapter 2], and methods section [Chapter 3]), such that scores range from 310 to 1550. The Dissertation Proposal Rubric also contains a rubric (i.e., Writing Style Checklist), con-sisting of a 5-point Likert-format scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree), which assesses the extent to which the dissertation proposal is free from grammatical and typographical errors and follows APA guidelines. Containing 34 items, scores range from 34 to 170.
Scores from all three rubrics (i.e., Content Checklist, Writing Style Checklist, Reference List Checklist) are converted into percentages. From these percentages, a final score is derived using the following weighting scheme: 60% for the Content Checklist and 40% for the Writing Style and Reference List Checklist combined.
Thus, each dissertation proposal receives a score on a 100-point scale. Because of the length of the rubrics, each dissertation research proposal typically takes between 5 hours and 6 hours to score. All dissertation pro-posals were graded by the same instructor. 2.4. Data analysis
For the purpose of the present inquiry, the number of citation errors was derived by determining the num-ber of missing citations (i.e., citation appearing in text but not presented in the reference list or citation appear-ing in the reference list that does not appear in the text.) or inconsistent citations (i.e., citation appearing in text not consistent with citation appearing in the reference list, with respect to author name(s) and/or publi-cation date). Further, the citation error rate (range = 0 X 100%) was calculated by dividing the number of cita-tion errors by the total number of citations in the reference list. The quality of reference list (range = 8 X 40) was evaluated via scores from the Scoring Checklist for Quality of Reference List, as described above.

The main analytical procedure used in this study involved canonical correlation analysis. Canonical corre-lation analysis is a multivariate technique that is utilized to investigate relationships between two sets of mea-sures, wherein each set contains at least two variables ( Cliff &amp; Krus, 1976; Darlington, Weinberg, &amp; Walberg, 1973; Onwuegbuzie &amp; Daniel, 2003; Thompson, 1980, 1984 ). This analysis was used to identify a combination of library anxiety dimensions (i.e., barriers with staff, affective barriers, comfort with the library, knowledge of the library, and mechanical barriers) that might predict simultaneously (a) citation error rate and (b) quality of reference list.

For the first canonical coefficient, both standardized canonical function coefficients and structure coeffi-cients were computed. Standardized canonical function coefficients represent computed weights that are applied to each variable in a given set for the purpose of determining the composite variate used in the canon-ical correlation analysis. As such, standardized canonical function coefficients are equivalent to factor pattern coefficients in factor analysis or to beta coefficients in a regression analysis ( Arnold, 1996 ). Conversely, struc-ture coefficients represent the association between a given variable and the scores on the canonical composite (i.e., latent variable) in the set to which the variable belongs ( Thompson, 1980 ). Consequently, structure coef-ficients indicate the extent to which each variable is related to the canonical composite for the variable set.
Moreover, structure coefficients are essentially bivariate correlation coefficients that range in value between 1.0 and +1.0 inclusive ( Thompson, 1980 ). Squaring the structure coefficient yields the proportion of variance that the original variable shares linearly with the canonical variate. The number of canonical functions (i.e., factors) that can be generated for a given dataset is equal to the number of variables in the smaller of the two variable sets (Thompson, 1980, 1984, 1988) . Because five library anxiety dimensions were correlated with two citation quality indices, two canonical functions were generated. 3. Results
The number of missing or incomplete citations found in the participants X  research proposals ranged from 1 to 53 ( M = 12.18, SD = 9.66). Taking into account the total number of citations made in each report, the pro-portion of missing or incomplete citations ranged from 1.62% to 86.89% ( M = 31.81%, SD = 20.54%). With respect to the quality of the reference lists of the research proposals, scores ranged from 8 to 36 on a scale of 40 points ( M = 14.48, SD = 6.29). Pertaining to the dissertation proposals, the mean score was 77.48 out of a possible 100 (SD = 18.09).

After applying the Bonferroni adjustment, the intercorrelations among the citation quality variables and the proposal scores revealed that proposal scores were statistically significantly related to the number of cita-p &lt; .001). Using Cohen X  X  (1988) criteria, the effect size involving the citation error rate was large, whereas the remaining two relationships represented moderate effect sizes. In addition, the quality of reference lists was statistically significantly related to both the number of citation errors ( r = .40, p &lt; .001) and the citation error rate ( r = .43, p &lt; .001). That is, students who committed citation errors also tended not to follow the American Psychological Association stipulations when constructing their reference lists. These correlations suggested moderate-to-large effect sizes ( Cohen, 1988 ).

The canonical analysis revealed that the two canonical correlations when combined were statistically sig-nificant ( p &lt; .05). However, when the first canonical root was excluded, the remaining canonical root was sta-tistically non-significant. Together, these results suggested that the first canonical function was both statistically significant and practically significant, with the first canonical correlation ( R 6.8% (i.e., R 2 c1 ) to the shared variance ( Cohen, 1988 ). However, the second canonical correlation was not sta-tistically significant. Consequently, only the first canonical correlation was interpreted.

Data pertaining to the first canonical root are presented in Table 2 . This table provides both standardized function coefficients and structure coefficients. Using a cutoff correlation of 0.3 ( Lambert &amp; Durand, 1975 ), the standardized canonical function coefficients revealed that both the citation error rate and the quality of reference list dimensions made important contributions to the set of citation quality variables. With respect to the library anxiety variable set, barriers with staff, affective barriers, and comfort with the library made noteworthy contributions. The structure coefficients pertaining to the first canonical function revealed that both the citation error rate and the quality of reference list dimensions made significant contributions to the canonical variate, with citation error rate making the biggest contribution to this variate X  X xplaining 90.3% of the variance. With regard to the library anxiety variable cluster, barriers with staff and comfort with the library made contributions, with barriers with staff making a very large contribution, explaining 67.2% of the variance. The signs of the structure coefficients indicate that students who reported the highest levels of library anxiety associated with barriers with staff and comfort with the library tended to commit the most cita-tion errors and constructed reference lists that departed the furthest from American Psychological Association (2001) stipulations.

Comparing the standardized and structure coefficients showed affective barriers as a suppressor variable because the standardized coefficient associated with this variable was large, whereas the corresponding struc-ture coefficient was relatively small ( Onwuegbuzie &amp; Daniel, 2003 ). Suppressor variables are variables that assist in the prediction of dependent variables due to their correlation with other independent variables ( Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1996 ). 4. Discussion
When taking into consideration the total of references cited in each proposal, the citation error rate was approximately one-third. The citation error rate of 31.81% is similar to the rate of 33.45% reported by Way-towich et al. (2006) . This indicates that, on average, for every three citations included in dissertation proposals, one of them represents some type of error.

An examination of the citation errors revealed that the doctoral students X  dissertation proposals, on aver-age, contained more than 12 missing, inconsistent, or incomplete citations. This finding is also very similar to that of Waytowich et al. (2006) . These researchers found a mean number of citation errors of 12.64, which is extremely close to the mean of 12.18 reported in the present investigation.

The citation error rate of one-third clearly is unacceptable. Indeed, with completed dissertations in the field of education averaging between 61 ( Beile, Boote, &amp; Killingsworth, 2004 ) and 105 ( Haycock, 2004 ) citations, one can expect some dissertations to contain between 20 and 35 citation errors. Moreover, with education dis-sertations at the high end of the spectrum containing between 159 ( Beile et al., 2004 ) and 295 ( Haycock, 2004 ) citations, one can expect as many as 98 citation errors (i.e., 295/3) committed by a doctoral student in a single reference list of a dissertation. Indeed, future research should examine the citation error rates of completed dissertations. Early indications suggest a disturbingly high citation error rate in completed dissertations. Spe-cifically, Onwuegbuzie (2007) found completed dissertations to contain as many as 69 citation errors out of 138 references X  X  citation error rate of exactly 50%.

Given the potential consequences of citation errors with respect to document retrieval, verifying data, social factors, and credibility of the author(s) ( Faunce &amp; Job, 2001; Hernon &amp; Metoyer-Duran, 1992; Pandit, 1993;
Spivey &amp; Wilks, 2004; Sweetland, 1989 ), the citation error rate found in the present study, as well as that doc-umented by Waytowich et al. (2006) , is a cause of great concern. This result is made even more disturbing by the fact that the instructor of the research methodology class informed the students continually throughout the course that he deducted one percentage point for every missing, incomplete, or inconsistent reference. This point-deduction policy also was stated in bold in the instructor X  X  syllabus. Thus, it is very possible that if the instructor had not penalized students for committing citation errors, the citation error rates would have been even higher.

An even more disconcerting aspect of the findings from both studies is the fact that most students in the class were in the final year of taking courses towards their degree programs, suggesting that students have been committing these citation errors throughout their programs of study. Moreover, this disturbing trend is fur-ther accentuated by Waytowich et al. X  X  (2006) observation that students who have taken the most courses in their graduate programs tend to construct reference lists of lower quality than do their less-advanced counter-parts. To the extent that these findings are reflective of many other doctoral programs, the fact that the cita-tion error rate does not appear to improve as doctoral students advance through their programs calls into question whether faculty and mentors are paying sufficient attention to this issue. Indeed, it is possible that the citation standards of doctoral students decline over time due to the lack of feedback from faculty or their apparent acceptance of citation errors. Whatever the cause, these findings suggest that, as recommended by
Waytowich et al. (2006) , all instructors should instill in doctoral students the importance of avoiding citation errors from the onset. In fact, it could be argued that a culture of error-free citations should also be instilled in undergraduate programs. Further, as noted earlier, none of the study participants used bibliographic manage-ment software (e.g., Endnote, RefWorks) to facilitate the creation of their reference lists. Thus, an implication of this study is that students X  X specially those who commit the most citation errors X  X ight benefit from using such software.

An important step in instilling a culture of error-free citations is identifying students who are most at risk for committing bibliographic errors X  X hereby providing a strong rationale for the present investigation.
Specifically, the canonical correlation analysis revealed that graduate students who committed the greatest proportion of citation errors and who constructed reference lists that departed the farthest from American
Psychological Association (2001) stipulations also tended to report the highest levels of library anxiety asso-ciated with barriers with staff, affective barriers, and comfort with the library. Thus, it is possible that library anxiety plays an important role in determining a student X  X  propensity to commit citation errors. Indeed,
Wine X  X  (1980) Cognitive-Attentional-Interference theory might explain the link between library anxiety and citation errors documented in the present investigation. In particular, Wine X  X  theory would predict that library anxiety interferes with students X  ability to construct an error-free reference list by reducing the efficiency with which they utilize their cognitive processes while engaging in this task, leading to a high number of citation errors. Therefore, to the extent that this relationship between library anxiety and citation errors/quality of ref-erence lists is causal, this link suggests that interventions that can help to reduce anxiety levels also might help to reduce citation error rates. As such, the findings of the present investigation have educational implications for current as well as future authors and contributors of research literature. However, caution should be exer-cised in interpreting the results of the present study. There are many unknown factors associated with a par-ticular college or university that may influence a student X  X  tendency to commit citation errors. Thus, the findings of this study, albeit significant, only reflect the unique circumstances of one institution. Future research that replicates this study will help shed more light on the relationship between citation errors and library anxiety.
