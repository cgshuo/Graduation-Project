 Temporal information processing is a crucial issue in many natural language processing applications such as information retrieval, information extraction, question answering, and text summarization. Recently , there has been considerable progress in the area of temporal information extraction and temporal reasoning in English [1-7]. Unfortunately, few efforts have been made in this area in Chinese. This impels us to investigate temporal information processing in Chinese. This paper focuses on extracting temporal expressions (TE) from Chinese texts. Here, TE is defined as chunks of text, which refer to time points or intervals. Unlike English, there are no orthographic boundaries between words in Chinese. Furthermore, Chinese is devoid of morphological alterations and change tags of case, number, tense, and part-of-speech. Hence, the difficulty of the TE identification problem is to identify TE in Chinese texts that have no any inflections at all. 
Currently, most works [8-11] concentrate on extracting TE of the Gregorian calendar from news text. However, Chinese society uses both the Gregorian calendar and the traditional Chinese calendar. In addition, Chinese people have their own ways of representing temporal entities such as the Stem-Branch timing system and the Emperor X  X  Title and Reign Title timing system. There exist two kinds of methods to recognize TE: rule-based methods and machine learning based methods. The former relies on hand-written rules and dictionary [8-12], while the latter depends on annotated corpus [13]. The rule-based approach is simple and effective, but it requires intensive knowledge resources and an exhaustive linguistic study over temporal information. Wu et al. [11] present a temporal parser based on temporal grammar rules and constraint rules built manually to extract Chinese TE. 
The purpose of this paper is to identify temporal expressions from Chinese unstructured text, which are based on the Gregorian calendar and the traditional Chinese calendar. We propose a transformation-based error-driven learning method to recognize TE. A TE annotator used in this approach is developed in terms of a Chinese time ontology, which consists of concepts of temporal expressions and their taxonomical relations. Experiments in three domains of news, history, and archaeology show that our algorithm obtained promising results. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a Chinese time ontology. Section 3 explains how to identify TE from Chinese texts. Experiments of the algorithm are given in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper. Temporal concepts are time and durations, and time is an instant or interval on the time line. A duration is a distance between two different times. It can be anchored by anchored on the time line. We build a Chinese time ontology, which gives the taxonomy hierarchy of TE including four classifications of TE, as shown in Fig.1. In Fig.1.(a), TE is divided into precise/definite TE and fuzzy/indefinite TE, based on the uniqueness of the starting and ending times of temporal entity. TE is also separated into absolute/explicit/non-anaphoric TE and relative/implicit/anaphoric/indexical TE according to the existence of time references. For example,  X  X an.1.2007 X  is a precise and absolute TE,  X  X pring 2007 X  is a fuzzy and absolute TE. In Fig.1.(b) and Fig.1.(c), TE is classified into time TE and duration TE in terms of times and spans, and direct and indirect TE grounded on the existence of lexical triggers within TE. The transformation-based error-driven l earning is a corpus-based and symbolic machine learning technique, which has been applied to many areas of natural language processing such as shallow parsing [14]. 
Our Chinese TE extraction algorithm first identifies TE in the training corpus using the TE annotator. During the first iteration, transformation rules, generated from incorrectly annotated TE, are used to update the EDL, which is an executable declarative language to write programs for identifying TE. The procedure repeats Therefore, new components and composition methods of TE can be continually learned to amend the EDL. The TE annotato r is to compile EDL and to recognize TE through executing EDL. The process of the error-driven learning method to identify TE is illustrated with Fig.2. Algorithm 3.1.1. An error-driven learning algorithm of TE identification The EDL program is composed of agents including contexts and operations. Contexts comprise a basic one and a constraint one, in which an agent can be activated. The content of a basic context is a regular grammar system, which is built based on the taxonomy of TE, and gives constitutive methods of every category of TE. The content of a constraint context consis ts of predicates used to restrict TE and its contextual features. An agent performs its operations if its contexts are met. NotContain(x,y) denotes that string y is not a sub-string of string x. The set of all word terminals on the right side of a production rule form a semantic class whose elements have the same semantic meaning or function, and whose appellation is the symbol on the left side of this rule. A transformation rule template consists of a triggering environment and actions. A set of rule templates determines a space of possible transformation rules. The transformation rule templates are given below, which mean that if one of five conditions is satisfied, then one of six series of actions is executed. 
Triggering Environment: (a) IF TempExp(X, Ct)  X  NonTempExp(X, Cr) (b) IF NonTempExp(X, Ct)  X  TempExp(X, Cr) (c) IF TempExp(X, Ct)  X  TempExp(Y, Cr)  X  Contain(Y, X) (d) IF TempExp(X, Ct)  X  TempExp(Y, Cr)  X  Contain(X, Y) (e) IF TempExp(X, Ct)  X  TempExp(Y, Cr)  X   X  Z (Contain(X, Z)  X  Contain(Y, Obligatory Actions: SegmentingWord(X)  X  SegmentingWord(Y) 
Optional Action: (a) AddSemanticCalssElement(X, Y, E) (b) AddSemanticClassRule(X, Y, R) (c) AddRule(X, Y, R) (d) AddRule(X, Y, R)  X  AddSemanticCalssElement(X, Y, E) (e) AddRule(X, Y, R)  X  AddSemanticClassRule(X, Y, R) (f) AddConstraintPredicate(X, Y, P) reference corpus. (b) TemExp(X, Ct) and NonTemExp(X, Cr) denote X in Ct is or is not SegmentingWord(X) is to do word segmentation of X. Actions of AddRule(X, Y, R) , AddSemanticClasseRule(X, Y, R) and AddSemanticCalssElement(X, Y, E) are to add a element E of a semantic class, generated by X and Y , to the EDL, respectively. Action AddConstraintPredicate(X, Y, P) adds the constraint predicate P to the EDL. 
Evaluation of a candidate transformation rule aims to quantitate positive and negative changes that are caused by applying the transformation rule to the training corpus. The objective function O(R) of a candidate rule R is C(R)-E(R) , where C(R) and E(R) denote the number of identified TE that cause positive or negative changes. Precision (P), recall(R) and F-measure (F) are used to evaluate experimental results obtained by our TE identification algorithm. Here, recall=N 2 /N, precision=N 2 /N 1 , number of identified TE, and N 2 is the total number of correctly identified TE. 
Three domains of news, history, and archaeology, and four corpora are used to test the performance of our Chinese TE extraction algorithm. These corpora are web pages from the website of Chinese Government News, Chinese History, and China Huaxia, and texts about relics, sites, cultures and the ancients of Archaeology Volume of Chinese Encyclopedia. The corpus collection is about 1.5 million characters, consisting of about 720 articles and 500 web pages. 70 articles and 50 web pages are randomly selected as the training corpus. The initial temporal grammar consists of about 200 production rules and about 160 transformation rules are built to update the EDL. Four human judges were asked to evaluate experiment results, and the averages of four precisions and recalls are the final precision and recall. The score of all corpora are 86.8% precision, 88.3% recall and 87.5% F-measure. Only the work in [11] identified Chinese TE, while other works [8-10,12,13] recognize TE from English, German, French, and Spanish texts, respectively. The result reported in [11] reaches 78.5% precision, 84.5% recall, and 81.38% F-measure. The reasons that our transformation-based learning method attains high performance are as follows: (a) the grammar system of Chinese TE is constructed based on the taxonomy hierarchy of TE. (b) The EDL can be continually updated by adding new production rules, terminals and constraint predicates driven by the error-driven learning approach. The main causes of incorrect TE are ambiguities of word segmentation and word senses. Time is a crucial dimension in information retrieval and extraction, and it is an indispensable element to achieve an activity and an event. In this paper, we present a transformation-based error-driven learning technique to identify temporal expressions in Chinese unstructured texts, and have shown its effectiveness through experiment results. In this learning approach, the temporal grammar and transformation rule templates are independent of languages. Hence our method can be applied to extracting temporal expressions in any language. In future, we would like to add the disambiguation of word senses to improve the performance of TE identification.
