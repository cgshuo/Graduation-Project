 A voting system is a set of rules that a community adopts to take collective decisions. In this paper we study voting systems for a particular kind of community: electronically mediated social net-works. In particular, we focus on delegative democracy (a.k.a. proxy voting) that has recently received increased interest for its ability to combine the benefits of direct and representative systems, and that seems also perfectly suited for electronically mediated social net-works. In such a context, we consider a voting system in which users can only express their preference for one among the people they are explicitly connected with, and this preference can be prop-agated transitively, using an attenuation factor.

We present this system and we study its properties. We also take into consideration the problem of missing votes, which is particu-larly relevant in online networks, as some recent case shows. Our experiments on real-world networks provide interesting insight into the significance and stability of the results obtained with the sug-gested voting system.

On April 23, 2009, Facebook announced the preliminary results of a site-governance vote, a ballot in which the users were called to express themselves on a change in the terms of use of the popular social networking site. The event was presented as an important step in the history of social networking 1 .

The vote came as the result of a petition by thousands of out-raged Facebook users, who criticized the social networking site for claiming too many rights over the user-generated content. In an attempt to make the social network more democratic, Facebook de-cided to let the users choose between the current terms of use and  X  Part of this work was done while the authors were visiting Yahoo! Research Labs, Barcelona http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post= 79146552130 two new documents it had published regarding site governance. It was also announced that at least 30% of the roughly 200 millions active Facebook users would have had to vote for the results to be binding. The outcome was that the new rules were preferred by 74.4% of the voters. And while only 600,000 users (0.3%) voted X  a turnout far smaller than Facebook had hoped for X  X he rules were adopted nevertheless 2 . The global privacy watchdog, Privacy Inter-national, called the Facebook vote a  X  X assive confidence trick X .
The low voting turnout was largely foreseeable. Obviously, only a small fraction of Facebook users have the time, patience and ded-ication, and take the service seriously enough to actively participate in its governance. Attempting this kind of direct democracy in a large social network turned out not to be a good idea. As we discuss in the rest of this section, there exist other voting systems that are more appropriate for online social networks, and that can raise the voting turnout and the credibility of the whole democratic process.
A voting system [1, 12] is a set of rules that a community adopts to take collective decisions. It specifies the way the voters express their preference (sometimes called the ballot ), and the algorithm that determines the final outcome (sometimes called the tally ing is done for basically one of two purposes: to decide on a (e.g., to pick the best among a series of alternatives), or to elect a representative or set of representatives (e.g., to elect a senate). In both cases the final goal is that of making decisions which reflect as much as possible the opinion of the citizens. The difference is the way in which this is pursued.

The former case, known as direct democracy , is based on the idea of ensuring maximum equality and fairness by making all citizens vote directly for the different motions. Direct democracy works better in practice for small cohesive groups. When public decisions reach a certain level of complexity, it becomes impractical for every citizen to become fully informed on every issue.

The latter case, known as representative democracy , involves a relatively small number of representatives who are elected by the citizens to take decisions on their behalf. Beyond the issue of which representation structure is the most appropriate for a given context, representative democracy presents certain risks in practice. For in-stance, by concentrating power in the hands of a small political elite, it creates fertile ground for corruption, entrenchment, conflict of interest, etc., which may result in bad government. http://www.cio.com/article/490775/After_ Vote_Facebook_Gets_New_Governing_Rules http://www.privacyinternational.org/ article.shtml?cmd[347]=x-347-564312
A third way, combining the benefits of direct and representat ive democracy while avoiding some of their drawbacks, is the so c alled delegative democracy which is based on proxy voting [5, 8, 19]. In this context a citizen can decide either to express directly her opin-ion on an issue, or to delegate her vote to a proxy , that is, another citizen that she trusts. If the proxy votes directly on the is sue, the weight of all delegated votes she received are added to her vo te. Proxy delegation may be transitive: one X  X  vote can be furthe r dele-gated to her proxy X  X  proxy.

In this novel kind of democracy, also known as liquid democ-racy 4 , citizens vote for local candidates who they know and trust personally, rather than distant candidates they know only t hrough reputation, costly mass-media campaigns and televised deb ates. This voting system seems well suited for online social netwo rks. In fact, people X  X  social connections can be seen as a mixture of strong ties (family, close friends) and weak ties (distant friends, ac-quaintances). Electronically-mediated social networks a llow peo-ple to maintain many more weak ties than before. This means th at the number of connections they have is larger than what one co uld consider an actual  X  X riendship X  network. On the other hand, current social networks are mostly networks of peers, in which the  X  X  uper-stars X  (the individuals with the larger number of connectio ns) do not have the visibility that can be achieved through mass med ia. The  X  X uper-stars X  in a social network may be known by only a ti ny fraction of the network.

Proxy-voting systems encourage people to cooperate to buil d di-rect, permanent political and social relationships with ea ch other and with their individual supporters, forming a web of trust . Ev-eryone can achieve political influence proportional to thei r level of public support.
In this paper we study the problem of voting in electronicall y-mediated social networks. We focus on delegative voting systems in which votes are transferred through a path of voting choic es over the social network, possibly damping the vote by an attenuation factor that reduces the strength of the mandate as the vote tr avels towards farther people. Specifically, we propose a system of gable proxy voting with exponential damping .

Although the theory of voting systems is a well-studied subj ect in social and political sciences, economics and mathematics, there are some assumptions behind the classical theory that hold true in the traditional scenarios but may fail in electronically-medi ated social networks. In particular, we study voting systems in which pe ople can only vote for someone they are explicitly connected to.
In the next section we provide some background and prelimina r-ies for our voting system, bridging some notions of voting theory in social science and concepts from graph theory. In this pap er, we discuss several design choices in terms of notions from vo ting theory, translate each choice in the context of the class of v oting systems under consideration, and select one alternative fo r analy-sis. Due to space constraints, we do not explore in detail eve ry branch of the possible design choices we present in this pape r.
In Section 3 we enter in the mathematical characterization o f the proposed voting system. We characterize the delegation graph and the possible winners and prove several properties of our voting systems.

In Section 4 we study how to deal with missing votes (absten-tion), including the limit case in which nobody actually exp resses a preference. The study of this limit situation leads to the de finition of a node centrality measure, dubbed voting centrality . We show that in this case the voting score of a node can be seen as a spe-http://democracialiquida.es/ cial, simpler case of PageRank for which we provide a closed-form formula.

In Section 5 we tackle some issues that apply specifically to t he case of electing multiple representatives. In Section 6 we p resent experimental results from a simulated vote in two social net works.
The class of social networks under examination are the ones h av-ing mutual (symmetric) friendship relationships, that are modeled by means of an undirected graph of friendship, say G = ( V defined by a set of vertices (or nodes) V G and a symmetric set of edges E G  X  V G  X  V G . We let, for every x  X  V G , N G ( x ) = { y | ( x , y )  X  E G } (the neighbors of x in G ). For the sake of presen-tation, we will assume that G is connected; this is not a limiting assumption as our results can be easily extended to deal with dis-connected components.

The key aspect of the voting system that we propose for social networks is that votes can be delegated transitively along t he exist-ing edges of the social network. That is, any member of the net work can choose a proxy among her contacts. A person can also choos e not to delegate her vote.

Besides the obvious organizational advantages, the assump tion that votes can only be assigned to a direct connection is twof old: on one hand, voters can base their decision on a direct person al knowledge of the person they vote for, making propaganda ess en-tially useless and thus decoupling popularity from credibi lity; on the other hand, the fact that mandates are attributed throug h a chain of direct connections should ensure a stronger sense of resp onsibil-ity.
 The tally. In the rest of this paper, unless explicitly stated, we consider voting in general, without distinguishing betwee n voting for motions and voting for choosing representatives, as bot h can be implemented using the same system. In particular, when vo t-ing for motions a weighted count is performed, where each vot er that decides not to delegate and instead expresses her prefe rence is counted, weighted by the amount of delegation she has receiv ed.
In the case of voting for representatives, a distinction wor th con-sidering is that between single-winner and multiple-winne r sys-tems. When a committee having s seats must be selected, we can simply select the top-s scoring candidates. However, there are other options, and we defer the discussion of them to Section 5; unl ess stated otherwise the remainder of the discussion applies to both the single-winner and the multiple-winner case.
 The ballot. Various possible choices exist for defining the ballot.  X  X ne-vote X  voting systems are those in which a voter picks ex-actly one candidate; in our case, one contact. In a  X  X anked X  system, each voter would rank her contacts in order of prefer ence, and in a  X  X ated X  voting system, voters would give a score to each contact. In this paper we consider only the one-vote kind of ballot, leaving the other two cases for future investigation.

Every node x  X  V chooses exactly one of his neighbors in G delegates to her. More formally, the voters X  choices are exp ressed by a voting function (or simply  X  X oting X ), a function v : V such that one has v( x )  X  N G ( x ) for all x  X  V ; the set of all voting functions for G is denoted by Vot G . For every v  X  Vot G D ( G , v) (the delegation graph ) be the directed graph ( V , A ) A = { ( x , v( x )) | x  X  V } . For persons that do not delegate, we include a self-loop in the delegation graph, implicitly ass uming a self-loop at each node in the friendship graph.
 Proposition 1 The delegation graph D = ( V , A ) is a directed, out-regular graph with out-degree 1. D is made of weak compo-nents each formed by a cycle with trees (oriented towards the ir roots) attached to every node in the cycle. Figure 1: An example of delegation graph over a social net-work. Delegations are represented by solid arcs, the remain der connections by dashed edges.
 Figure 1 illustrates an example of delegation graph.
 Interpretation of the ballot. In a delegable proxy voting, given that the vote is delegable, what a node x votes actually affects all the nodes that x transitively votes for X  X ll the nodes along the path to the root or roots of the weakly connected component contai ning the node. Hence, a  X  X ne-vote X  delegable proxy voting system can be interpreted as a ballot in which a person (implicitly) vot es for several candidates simultaneously. The case of voting for m ultiple candidates has three main interpretations in voting theory : lative voting (or weighted voting), approval voting , or preferential voting .

In a cumulative voting interpretation, D ( G , v) describes for each user u an assignment of scores that forms a distribution over the other users, with a weight of 0 for users that can not be reache d from u following a delegation path in D ( G , v) . In an approval voting interpretation, D ( G , v) indicates that a user u all users reachable through a delegation path. These two cas es are considered in the exponentially damped system of Section 3.
In a preferential voting interpretation, each user u ranks all the people along the path to a root of the connected components. T his adds a level of complexity to the interpretation, not only be cause of the description of the specific rank aggregation method, but because there is another choice between interpreting the user X  X  ran king as giving more preference to nodes close by than farther away (a s in the exponentially damped case), or the exact opposite, whic h can not be dismissed out of hand. We thus leave the preferential v oting interpretation for future work.
In this section, we will present our proposed tally system, t he transitive proxy voting system with exponential damping . This is similar to standard proxy voting, but with a damping factor t hat introduces some reluctance in the way delegated votes are tr ans-ferred. This reluctance corresponds intuitively to the ide a that in an electronically mediated social network typically you cann ot fully trust your connections, and you want to refrain from giving t hem all of your delegation. We might call this form of proxy votin g a viscous democracy (a form of  X  X iquid democracy X ), because of the way trust decays with the distance.

The situation is not much different from the typical link-ba sed ranking scheme  X  la PageRank [14], where every vote transfers by transitivity to distances larger than one, but with an atten uation fac-tor; Yamakawa et al. [19] use similar ideas, but aim at total vote estimation by mixing voters and motions in a single matrix: as a result, their election results are incomparable with ours ( see Sec-tion 7 for a more detailed comparison).
In PageRank, the arcs of a directed graph represent hyperlin ks between web pages, and a hyperlink is seen as a way to confer au -thority. More precisely, every time a page x points to a page is transferring a part of its own authority to y ; more precisely, if points to k pages, its authority will be equally distributed among those pages. This process is iterated transitively, with an attenua-tion factor introduced to limit the risk of forming oligopol ies ( sinks in the PageRank jargon).

Although there are many equivalent ways to define PageRank formally, for our purposes it is convenient to introduce it u sing the path formula of [10]: given a directed graph D = ( V D , E for a fixed  X   X  [ 0 , 1 ) referred to as the damping factor the PageRank of node x  X  V D as where n D =| V D | (the number of nodes of D ), Path D (  X  , x ) set of all directed paths of D ending in x and the branching of a path is defined as follows: where N + ( z , w)  X  E D } . Intuitively, every node x receives its importance (its delegations) through incoming paths: every incoming path g ives a contribution that depends on the number of branches the path con-tains, and that decays exponentially with its length. The Pa geRank formula can also be applied to an undirected graph, by looking at an edge e ={ x , y } as if it were a pair of arcs ( x , y ), ( y , x )
Let us adopt the PageRank method in our context: we define the (voting) score of node x for the voting function v as r D ( G ,v) the PageRank of x in the directed graph D ( G , v) . Note, however, that the PageRank formula applied to such simple graphs turn s out to be much easier to analyze. In a graph with out-degree 1, the branching factor is always 1; so we can write:
This voting system depends on a single parameter  X  . In the fol-lowing, we discuss its properties for  X  X mall enough X  and  X  X a rge enough X  values of  X  . It is worth noting that for any reasonable value of  X  the ballot has a cumulative interpretation, while the appro val interpretation corresponds to the voting system with no dam ping factor (i.e., when  X   X  1).
In this section, we will collect a number of properties that h old true for this voting system. For sake of presentation, we ass ume to vote for selecting representatives, i.e, the final result of the election is a non-empty set of winners , that depends on the votes cast by the nodes and on a parameter  X   X  [ 0 , 1 ) that determines how  X  X ransi-tive X  a vote is (  X  = 0 means that the vote is not transitive at all, i.e., that it does not propagate). A node x is transient if it votes for a node that does not transitively vote for x (i.e., iff it is a non-root node of a tree), non-transient otherwise.
 Undelegable mandates. The intuitive desire that a strong mandate cannot be delegated is satisfied at some extent in our voting s ystem, as the following proposition shows: Proposition 2 Suppose that x votes for y, y votes for z, and y, z do not receive other votes. Then the score of y is larger than t he score of z iff the score of x is larger than the average.
P ROOF . The ranks of y and z expressed in terms of the rank of x are Hence, the condition r y &gt; r z can be written as which is true iff r x &gt; 1 / n , the average score.

In other words, if y receives a mandate that is greater than the average, she will obtain a score that is greater than the one s he can delegate; the average score is a threshold over which a recei ved mandate cannot be completely delegated.
 Large damping (small  X  ) produces undelegable mandates. Con-sider the delegation graph among k + 2 members shown in Figure 2, and assume that x votes for herself.
 Figure 2: If the damping factor is large enough, y will be the winner, otherwise x will be the winner.

Intuitively, we should consider that if k is large enough, then member y is receiving a strong mandate. Should then sent the community, independently from her choice of delega ting to member x ? Using the same idea as in Proposition 2, y wins over x iff ( 1  X   X ) k / n &gt; 1 / n , that is  X  &lt; 1 / 2  X  1 is too much attenuation for the delegation to be transferred to of course, larger values of  X  will make x win, as she would in a traditional proxy system.
 This can be easily explained to voters using this voting syst em. The choice of the damping factor can be described as the choic e of the critical number of voters k  X  that creates an  X  X ndelegable X  mandate in this situation (of course other voters can affect the out-come, but y alone can not). More precisely, if we want that more voters always make the mandate to y undelegable, we have to choose  X  not larger than 1 / 2  X  1 / k  X  .
 Large damping (small  X  ) makes only direct votes count. We prove the following: Proposition 3 For sufficiently small  X  , all winners have the same maximum number of voters (i.e., the same indegree in the dele ga-tion graph).

P ROOF . Suppose that x is has a voters, y has b voters and Then the score of x is 1 + a  X  +  X  2 A ( X ) whereas the score of 1 + b  X  +  X  2 B ( X ) , for suitable polynomials A and B with positive coefficients. The score of x is smaller than the score of which implies which can never be true when  X  is sufficiently close to zero (the left-hand side goes to + X  , whereas the right-hand side is finite). As a corollary, we have: Corollary 1 For sufficiently small  X  , the vote of every node x can only influence the victory of its neighbors (i.e., it can add o r remove only one of the neighbors of x from the set of winners).
 Small damping (large  X  ) determines winners by size of sub-trees. Clearly, at least when  X  is large enough, the nodes that ob-tain the largest rank are the roots of all trees (we shall prov e this formally in Section 3.2): suppose that a node is the root of a t ree T of height d ( T ) , with n 0 ( T ) = 1 nodes at depth 0 (just the root), n 1 ( T ) nodes at depth 1 (the root X  X  children), n 2 ( T ) 2 etc. Then the rank of the root node  X ( T ) is proportional to At this point, the leader will be chosen among the nodes that p artic-ipate in the cycles (the roots of trees); suppose that a cycle contains k nodes, say x 0 , . . . , x k  X  1 , where x i is the root of a tree the rank of node i is a combination of the  X ( T j ) obtained by:
In the voting system under discussion, we can describe exact ly what happens in the case  X   X  1, that is, when no damping is introduced and the votes transfer transitively. We have tha t ends up being proportional to the number of nodes of T . Moreover, we note that r i  X  Thus, when  X   X  1 the winners are ( ex-aequo ) the nodes on the cy-cle belonging to the component with the largest average tree size. In the voting theory jargon this set of nodes is called minimal dom-inant set . When in a voting system there is a minimal dominant set of winners, the method is said to be Condorcet-efficient [8]. If no cycle exists, the winner (i.e., the top-scorer) is precisel y the root of the largest tree (or the roots of the largest trees, if more th an one tree of largest size exists), as prescribed by proxy voting. Small damping (large  X  ) makes transient nodes lose. We prove the following: Proposition 4 For sufficiently large  X  , all winners are non-transient.
P ROOF . Suppose that x is transient and votes for y . The score of x is ( 1  X   X ) S ( X )/ n , where S is a polynomial with positive coef-ficients (the coefficient of  X  k being the number of descendants of at depth k ), whereas the score of y is at least ( 1  X   X )( The score of x is smaller than the score of y iff if t is the sum of all the coefficients of S , the left-hand side tends to t as  X   X  1, whereas the right-hand side tends to t + 1, so the above inequality is ultimately true, hence x cannot be a winner for sufficiently large  X  .
 Bolzano-Weierstrass X  X  theorem for voting. It is worth observing that the scores produced by our voting system change continu ously with  X  : Proposition 5 If  X  0  X   X  1 , x is a winner at  X  0 and y is a winner at  X  1 , then there is some  X   X  [  X  0 ,  X  1 ] such that both x and y are winners at  X  .

P ROOF . Since the score r is a rational function of poles in [ 0 , 1 ] , the statement is trivial by continuity. Ultimate sovereignty. The condition that every node can become a winner is known as surjectivity or sovereignty .
 Proposition 6 If the graph G is reflexive (i.e., if everybody can vote for himself), for sufficiently large  X  every node can become a winner.

P ROOF . Due to Proposition 4, it is sufficient to prove that for all node x there is a v  X  Vot G such that x is the only non-transient in D ( G , v) . Consider a spanning tree for G (recall that nected), and root it at x ; then, make every node vote for his parent in the tree, and let x vote for itself.

The reflexivity condition is needed, as explained in the foll owing counterexample: consider a graph with n  X  2 nodes z 1 , . . . , z attached to a node y , and the latter adjacent to the node voting, z i can only vote for y , and so does x ; y can choose whether to vote for x or for some z i , but if we want x to be a winner, vote for x . In this condition, though, the score of x and and r x is always smaller than r y , so x can never be a winner.
In a realistic scenario, only a (probably small) fraction of users actually votes: recall the case discussed in the introducti on. We would like to consider how the election can still be carried o ut in the presence of abstentionism.
We start by studying the limit situation in which nobody actu ally expresses a preference. Our approach is to compute the expec ted result of the election if voters were to decide their vote uni formly at random, of course subjected to the constraint of voting for s omeone they are explicitly connected to. As we show in this section, this induces a novel measure of centrality for nodes on a graph.
Formally, we define the voting centrality of a node x as follows: which can be more explicitly rewritten as
In the rest of this section we produce a closed formula for thi s measure. We start by observing that for a voting function graph G ending in x , or a simple path with a simple cycle con-taining x attached at the end, possibly repeated many times: no other case is possible, because D ( G , v) has out-degree 1 so it can only contain a cycle at the end, if any.
 Definition 1 Given two paths  X  1 ,  X  2  X  Path G (  X  , x ) , we write  X  1  X  G , x  X  2 to mean that the following conditions hold: Under these conditions, we let  X  1  X   X  2 be the part of the path  X  1 that appears after y, and we define the set Note that this set either contains only  X  1 (if |  X  2 | = infinite.

This definition is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we show two pat hs  X  and  X  2 and how they are oriented in S ( X  1 ,  X  2 ) .
 We have that: Proposition 7 Let  X  1  X  G , x  X  2 . Then: 1. S ( X  1 ,  X  2 ) are disjoint for different pairs ( X  1 ,  X  2 ) ; 2. for every  X   X  S ( X  1 ,  X  2 ) , there are exactly 3. if  X   X  Path D ( G ,v) (  X  , x ) for some v , then there are  X 
P ROOF . From  X   X  S ( X  1 ,  X  2 ) one can deduce  X  1 and  X  as follows:  X  1 is the first part of  X  until the first occurrence of  X  2 is the following part of the path until the first repeated node (it will be a cycle if the first node repeated in  X  is x itself). This proves (1) and (3). To prove (2), notice that, for  X  1 = ( x 1 , . . . , x  X  2 = ( y 1 , . . . , y h ) you must define v( x i ) = x i + all the remaining nodes.

The lengths of the paths in S ( X  1 ,  X  2 ) are |  X  1 |+ k ( X  +|  X   X  =|  X  1  X   X  2 | and k &gt; 0. Now Figure 3: Two undirected paths  X  1  X  G , x  X  2 in the friendship graph, and with their orientation in S ( X  1 ,  X  2 ) . where we understand that the right-hand side should evaluat e to  X  |  X  1 | if |  X  2 |= 0.

As a consequence, we have the following explicit closed form ula for voting centrality: Theorem 1 The voting centrality of a node x in a graph G is given by
After studying the limit case of total abstention, we return to the more realistic case of partial abstention. We deal with this case by considering a partially directed graph that contains both d irected and undirected edges. Essentially we reduce to the previous case of total abstention, considering the real votes expressed a s sort of constraints. In practice, Equation 1 still holds provided t hat the simple paths  X  1 and  X  R 2 are chosen respecting the direction on the directed arcs.

We remark that Equation 1 expresses the voting centrality as a finite summation (there are only a finite number of pairs  X  ), and enumerating the pairs diagonally allows one to stop th e evaluation at a desired degree of precision.
Beyond its interpretation as voting score in the case of  X  X ot al abstentionism X , voting centrality is a new measure of centr ality in a graph that is worth further analysis.

In the following we provide a random-surfer interpretation of voting centrality, but we shall state it in a more general way , as an expected PageRank on a given graph distribution.
 Expected PageRank: the general case. Let V be a fixed set of elements and G be the set of all directed graphs with node set Let P (  X  ) be a probability distribution on G , and for each let v G be a distribution on its nodes. Let r G be the PageRank vector for the graph G  X  G using the preference vector v G , that is, where A G indicates the row-normalized adjacency matrix 5
We are interested in the expected PageRank vector  X  r = E [ that is
Consider a random surfer acting as follows. At each time, the surfer is in some node of some graph of G . When the surfer is in the node x of a graph G , with probability  X  , he moves to one of the out-neighbors of x at random; with probability 1  X   X  he resets, i.e., he chooses a graph G (according to the probability distribution P (  X  ) ) and a node in G , according to v G , and moves there.
Equivalently, one can think of the surfer as surfing on a singl e large graph H that is the disjoint union of all the graphs in the sake of simplicity, let V ={ 1 , . . . , n } and G ={ G and let us write v i for v G
Null rows are patched in the usual way, substituting them by r ows full of 1 / n . nodes, and its row-normalized adjacency matrix will be as fo llows: where 0 denotes an n  X  n matrix of zeros. The vector describes how the surfer chooses the pair graph/node when he de-cides to reset. So, the surfer X  X  behavior is described by the transi-tion matrix: whose stationary distribution is given by
Now ( I  X   X  P H )  X  1 can be written as  X   X   X   X   X  =  X   X   X   X   X   X  so ( 1  X   X ) v ( I  X   X  A H )  X  1 is equal to ( 1  X   X )( P 1 v 1 ( I  X   X  A G 1 )  X  1 , P 2 v 2 ( I  X   X  A Now, given a node x  X  V , the stationary probability that the surfer is in x is the probability that he is in one of the k copies of is, P 1 ( r 1 ) x ++ P k ( r k ) x =  X  r x .
 Expected PageRank: the case of voting. In the case of voting, we can state the surfing activity on the undirected graph G as follows. Whenever the surfer is in some node x : It is easy to see that this is just an equivalent restatement o f our previous general surfer, hence the average time spent on x precisely the voting centrality of x .
In the case of an election for electing several representati ves, there is an opportunity of selecting a committee that repres ents the diversity of users, by ensuring proportionality . The criterion of pro-portionality states that each group should have a share of th e seats roughly equal to its share of the votes [12]. 2 nd seat 6 8 5 3 rd seat 6 4 5 Figure 4: Example of proportional voting using D X  X ondt rule s and three seats. Numbers in boldface represent elected cand i-dates.

In most existing voting systems, the groups used as a base for measuring the proportionality of a committee are (i) voting dis-tricts; (ii) political parties or alliances; or (iii) a mixt ure of both. The concept of voting districts can be mapped easily into voting systems for on-line social networks. For instance, the voti ng can use explicit non-overlapping groups to which users belong ( in the case of social networks that support such groups). If these e xplicit groups are not available, then as social networks exhibit co mmu-nity structure [6], the friendship graph G can be partitioned using a graph clustering method and then members selected proporti onally to the sizes of each cluster. As in real-world voting distric ts, this allocation must be done before the voting takes place, and users should be able to vote only for their friends belonging to the same district as themselves. Furthermore, the allocation can be done ac-cording to the structure of the network. A well connected net work may need fewer representatives and fewer districts than a mo re dis-connected network.

The concept of parties or alliances can also be mapped easily into voting systems for on-line social networks. In this cas e, the allocation of users into parties is done after the voting takes place, as it depends on the voting. When no explicit alliances are de clared beforehand, a voting system for social networks may interpr et the connected components of the delegation graph as alliances, as they represent communities of like-minded people who delegate t o other members of their community but not to external people. Let us examine the case in which each connected component of D ( G , v) is considered an alliance, and we want to ensure alliances are represented proportionally. The number of nodes in each com-ponent corresponds to the number of people that voted for the cor-responding alliance. Let us assume in D ( G , v) there are connected components C 1 , C 2 , . . . C k with sizes m 1 Each alliance is considered an open list of candidates, in the sense that their ordering is not fixed in advance, but determined by the popular vote, e.g. by using the obtained scores.

The method for allocating the number of seats for each allian ce can be determined by any system for proportional voting. For con-creteness, we describe here the use of D X  X ondt rules [12], wh ich are a proportional representation system used for the parli ament of several countries, and in the European Parliament election s. Nev-ertheless we stress that most of the arguments that follow ap ply to other proportional voting systems.

Under D X  X ondt rules seat allocation is done round-wise. In e ach round the new seat is assigned to the party with the highest ra tio m /( s + 1 ) , where m is the number of votes received, and number of seats that party has been allocated so far. An examp le tally is shown in Figure 4(a). In the example m 1 = 8 , m 3 = 5 and s = 3, the numbers in the table are the ratios, and the first group gets two seats, the second group gets one seat, and the last group gets zero seats.
Monotonicity is another desirable property of voting syste ms It states that if an alternative x loses, and the ballots are changed to disfavor x , then x must still lose. As in many other multiple-winner voting systems in our voting system there is no monotonicity a counterexample, let us consider the top scoring node t 3 nent C 3 in Fig. 4(a), and let us assume that there are no cycles in the delegation graph. It would have been better for this node to v ote for the top node t 2 of C 2 , to create a larger community C 2 elect two representatives under these rules. In some circum stances (e.g. if C 2 were star-shaped, so that t 2 is the only one having in-degree larger than zero in C 2 ) then t 3 would be the 2-nd best node in the component C 2  X  C 3 and it would have been elected, as shown in Fig. 4(b).

The non-monotonicity is not limited to the case of non-deleg ation (or self-delegation). A non-elected node x in community C defecting to another community, e.g., voting for an elected node in community C j , might under certain circumstances (i.e. given a large enough damping factor), obtain a score larger than be elected, possibly displacing y from the committee if the target community does not have enough seats for both.

In general, in the case of strategic voting, as the vote of tively affects all the nodes in the path to the root of the comm unity of the user receiving her vote, it is in the best interest of for someone as close to the root as possible. This minimizes h er contribution to the score of other nodes and thus increases t he like-lihood of being among the top members in her community.
The effectiveness of a voting system in practice depends on q ual-itative factors, such as whether the decisions reached by th e com-munity are in some sense correct and whether the members of th e community accept such decisions. In this experimental sect ion, we focus instead on measurable aspects of the exponentially da mped voting system, such as its stability with respect to the choi ce of a damping factor, and its correlation with simpler measureme nts on social networks.

For these experiments, we picked two different social netwo rks, one of scientists (the DBLP co-authorship network) and one o f pho-tographers (the Flickr social network).
DBLP 8 is a bibliography service from which a scientific collab-oration network can be extracted. In this network each node r ep-resents a scientist and we interpret the co-authorship rela tion as a social tie, indicating that two scientists are connected if they have worked together on an article. The strength of the connectio n is the number of articles they have co-authored. We refer to this gr aph as the DBLP social network : as of now, it contains 326 186 scientists and 1 615 400 co-authorship relations. This particular soci al net-work has been studied in the past e.g. in [4], and it has been sh own that it shares many properties of a typical social network, i ncluding the small-world property.

We simulated a voting process in the DBLP social network, in which the community elects a committee of top scientists. Th is
Some political scientists, however, doubt the value of mono tonic-ity as a property of voting systems:  X  X onotonicity in electoral sys-tems is a non-issue: depending on the behavioral model gover ning individual decision making, either everything is monotoni c or noth-ing is monotonic. X  [2]
Arrow X  X  impossibility theorem , or Arrow X  X  paradox , demonstrates that no voting system can have all the desirable properties [ 1]. http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/ connections (co-authors). We will assume there are two fact ors that influence how this delegation is done: productivity (we use n umber of papers written as a proxy for productivity), and strength of the co-authorship relation (i.e., number of papers co-authore d).
More precisely, we ran a number of elections that all use the above criteria in different combinations:
We performed six elections (D was run three times, with  X  = 0 . we shall denote with r A , r B , r C , r D , 0 . 25 , r D , and in the following, unless otherwise specified we used the s tan-dard damping factor  X  = 0 . 85.
 Comparison with link-based metrics. Our first set of experiments aims at determining how much the result of the election depen ds on the voters X  choice, and whether and how it can be determined b y the underlying social network instead. For this purpose, we com-puted four more static scorings based on the DBLP social network: the degree D E G (where the score is the number of co-authors), the PageRank PR, the productivity P ROD (where the score is the num-ber of papers written), and the voting centrality C E N introduced in Sec. 4. We compared the ten scoring vectors using Kendall X  X  the Jaccard coefficient of the top 10, 100 and 1 000 authors: si nce these measures substantially agree, we report only the top 1 00 case in Fig. 5.

Although all scores are positively correlated, they marked ly dif-fer. The static measures are more highly correlated among th em (in particular, as expected, degree and PageRank), but they are not well correlated with the results of voting, except very mild ly for PageRank. On the other hand, the results of the six elections are different, and their Kendall X  X   X  never exceeds 0 . 84, and it is often Figure 6: Stability of the voting results in DBLP (left) and Flickr (right). Stability is studied with respect to: noisy prefer-ences, changes in  X  reflected by Kendall X  X   X  , and changes in  X  measured by Jaccard at 100. around 0 . 50; as for the Jaccard coefficient, it is at most 0 often under 0 . 1.

We can conclude that the outcome of the voting system strongl y depends on the voters X  choices and not only (or too strongly) on the graph structure or on the position of the node in the graph, bo th be-ing desirable properties in a democratic voting system for a n online social-network.
 Stability with respect to preferences. There is a second, some-what dual question about the stability of the proposed votin g system with respect to small changes in the preferences of the commu nity. How does a small change in the voters X  choice affect the outco me of the election? To answer this question, we randomized the v ote according to a noise parameter. With probability p , a voter simply votes for one of her connections at random, and with probabil ity 1  X  p she makes her choice as established. We then compare the resulting score vectors with the one obtained without noise . Figure 7: Flickr dataset: (a) Kendall X  X   X  , and (b) Jaccard coef-ficient of the top-100 set.

In Fig. 6 (top left), we present the results for the election C above. As the graph shows, even altering 10% of the votes leav es the scores substantially unaltered (  X  is above 0 . 90). Beyond that, the decay is very smooth, apparently linear, and there is a go od pos-itive correlation even at high noise levels, proving that th e system is stable and reasonably robust against noise.
 Stability with respect to the damping factor. Finally, we con-sider how the score depends on the damping factor. For a fixed election, we computed the voting scores for different value s of and compared them with the voting score obtained with  X  = The comparison was performed using Kendall X  X   X  and looking at the Jaccard coefficient at 10, 100 and 1 000. In Figure 6 (middl e and bottom) we show Kendall X  X   X  and Jaccard at 100 for election C above. As expected there is a dependency, and the results cha nge smoothly as  X  moves away from its starting value of 0 . 85. In par-ticular, Kendall X  X   X  is always above 0 . 95 for all values of than 0 . 65 (Jaccard is over 75% in the same region). It is curious to observe that  X  has an abrupt change around  X  = 0 . 5; interest-ingly enough, this happens on all the examples we considered , and more generally on all tree-shaped directed graphs. Our conj ecture is that this phase transition is related to the undelegable m andates described on Sec. 3.1, the phenomenon still requires furthe r analy-sis.
Flickr 9 is an online community were users can share photographs and videos. The interaction mechanism in Flickr is rich. For in-stance, users can comment on each other photos and maintain a collection of their favorite photos. In Flickr the notion of acquain-tance is modeled through contacts . Differently from other social networks, in Flickr contacts requests do not need to be confir med and are thus directed, but we used them disregarding their di rection for the purpose of building the friendship graph. We sampled 25 million users from Flickr and restricted our attention to th e largest connected component of contacts (526 606 users).

We simulated a voting process on this friendship network as f ol-lows: every user x votes for his contact y that has the most pho-tographs selected by x as  X  X avorites X  (with ties broken arbitrarily). This voting process produces a voting score vector r .

As for the DBLP graph, for comparison we considered other metrics: the number of incoming or outgoing contacts D number of incoming contacts D E G + , the PageRank PR (computed on the contact graph), the voting centrality C E N http://www.flickr.com/ number of times one of her pictures was selected as a  X  X avorit e X  by anyone in the network (not necessarily by one of her contac ts).
The correlation between such measures are shown in Fig. 7, an d once more we observe that the results of the voting are not det er-mined by any of the static metrics. Also the measures of stabi lity shown in Fig. 6 (right) exhibit the same behavior as in the DBL P dataset.

Finally, we can look at a more fine-grained measure on the top 100 users: the number F AVE S of their photos selected as  X  X avorites X  by other users, weighted by the scores assigned by them by the different ranking functions. We normalized the scores so th at they add up to 1 when considering the top 100 users. The results, in order of similarity to F AVE S , are r = 27K, PR = 22K, D C
E N = 18K, and D E G + = 8K. The results of the voting outperform the other metrics when compared with F AVE S .
Before the conclusions section, we summarize here the previ ous work in link-based methods for aggregating the preferences of in-dividuals.

Ranking by some kind of eigenvalue-related technique had it s origin with the work of Seeley [16]. In modern language, give n a square matrix M expressing preferences between individuals, See-ley proposes to compute the dominant eigenvector of M after row normalization (in other words, PageRank with  X  = 1). Indepen-dently, a few years later Katz [11] considered for the same pu rpose the power sum 1 M P  X  n M n (in other words, PageRank without row normalization X  X ee [3]) for suitable values of  X  . Many vari-ants of these two basic ideas have appeared in the following l itera-ture, and by now spectral ranking is a standard tool in many fields. It should be noted, however, that the same technique is used t o es-timate different concepts such as authority , power , influence centrality .

A spectral-ranking technique for delegated voting was prop osed by Yamakawa et al. [19]. Assuming not all voters might want to choose an option out of a given set, they propose computing PageRank (therein called the Bonacich index ) on a stochastic ma-trix containing both voters and motion. The results of this m ethod are incomparable to ours: if motions are just a copy of the vot ers, the resulting graph has a completely different structure, a s at least half of the nodes will be without successors. In case nobody v otes, they propose to use the scores obtained (which are now identi cal to our ranks) to select powerful voters and force them to expres s their opinion: however, at each selection the matrix is altered by delet-ing all delegations of the selected voter, so their order in c hoos-ing representatives does not coincide with ours. Finally, t hey do not consider the interplay between an underlying social net work of acquaintance and the votes, which for example would make it i m-possible to account for missing votes (in their terminology , missing delegation).

Reference [18] deals with a decentralized voting system for ob-ject reputation, but there is no collective decision, that i s, every peer decides how much to trust on the votes of others.

Our work is also related to the general issue of developing de cision-support systems for social networks [15], to the study of tru st [9, 7] and influence propagation [13] in social networks.
In this paper we wore hat and glasses: we wore the political scientist X  X  hat by concretely proposing a practical voting system for a social network, whose properties we studied through th e lens of the computer scientist X  X  glasses.
The main problems of voting in social networks are the exis-tence of many weak links, the fact that even the most well-kno wn users are not known by many, and the low voter turnout in gener al. We are convinced that a transitive proxy voting is the best choice in such a setting. The design of a transitive proxy voting sys tem for social networks includes many steps, including the choi ce of a ballot and a ballot interpretation (e.g.: one vote or many vo tes, cu-mulative or approval voting, etc.), and the choice of an appr opriate system for counting the votes. The latter includes issues su ch as delegable vs. undelegable mandates, and the choice of the sc oring method.

We propose a system of transitive proxy voting with exponen-tial damping , that allows us to frame these questions properly by means of a single parameter. We expect a voting system to be ro -bust to small differences in the choice of the damping factor , or small variations in the users X  preferences. We also expect t he sys-tem to produce an output that depends on the users X  choices an d not only (or too strongly) on the graph itself. Our experimental results are positive in these aspects.
 Future work. We have mentioned but left unexplored a number of paths that can be fruitful to study as future work. First, we d id not consider users delegating a varying fraction of their vote; for in-stance, some users may decide to delegate their whole vote, w hile others may prefer to delegate only half of their vote and keep the other half for themselves. Second, the choice of limiting th e ballot to one vote per person may be appropriate in some circumstanc es but not in others, and one may want to extend our system to the c ase of multiple votes, possibly with different weights (as in cu mulative voting). Third, the choice of considering only symmetric fr iend-ship networks is a restriction that in some cases does not hol d (as in Flickr where contacts are directed); although it is easy to r e-cast the proposal for this scenario, some of the properties we proved do not hold or need to be reformulated. Fourth, dealing with sybil a ttacks [17], as well as strategic/untruthful voting in social-net work vot-ing systems can by itself be a challenging and interesting re search topic. Finally, in a scenario with repeated elections, it ma y be in-teresting to understand whether the voting relationship is learnable; under this condition, and assuming a certain accuracy, we ma y use such an information as an alternative and more precise way to as-sign the missing votes.
