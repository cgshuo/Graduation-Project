 Recommender system aim at providing a personalized list of items ranked according to the preferences of the user, as such ranking methods are at the core of many recom-mendation algorithms. The topic of this tutorial focuses on the cutting-edge algorithmic development in the area of rec-ommender systems. This tutorial will provide an in depth picture of the progress of ranking models in the field, sum-marizing the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and discussing open issues that could be promising for future research in the community. A qualitative and quantitative comparison between different models will be provided while we will also highlight recent developments in the areas of Reinforcement Learning.

Recommender systems aim to provide users with personal-ized items, which are typically ranked in a descending order of predicted relevance [1]. Learning the personalized recom-mendation list can be cast as a ranking problem. Naturally this cutting-edge research topic, Learning to Rank (LtR) [4], has already attracted a lot of attention in the Information Retrieval and Machine Learning communities. Recent con-tributions to collaborative filtering (CF) have exploited LtR techniques for improving the ranking of the top-N recom-mendations. In this tutorial, we present the key ideas of dif-ferent categories of learning to rank approaches, and demon-strate examples that extend these ideas to specific CF meth-Netflix movie recommendation site. Higher grade indicates higher preference/relevance of the item. In implicit feed-back [2], users interact with items by downloading, purchas-ing, and their preferences are deduced from the interaction patterns. In this paper we propose a new model for the case of explicit/graded relevance data.

Various models for implicit feedback data use learning to rank [4] techniques to optimize binary relevance data rank-ing metrics. For example, several CF models [7, 9, 10] com-pute near optimal ranked lists with respect to the Area Un-der the Curve (AUC), Average Precision (AP) [5] and Recip-rocal Rank [11] metrics. However, metrics that are defined to handle binary relevance data are not directly suitable for graded relevance data. Binary metrics, and CF methods that optimize for these metrics can be used on graded rel-evance data if it is converted to binary relevance by e.g., imposing a threshold (e.g., setting rating 4 as the threshold for the 1-5 scale so that items rated 4 and 5 are treated as relevant). This process has two major drawbacks: 1) we lose grading information within the rated items, e.g., items rated with a 5 are more relevant then items rated with a 4. This information is crucial in building precise models. 2) the choice of the thresholding relevance is arbitrary and will have an impact on the performance of different recommendation approaches.
In many recommendation domains the content is often dynamic and/or short lived such as video, news recommen-dation and computational advertising. In these domains it is often difficult to collect enough information in the form of clicks or ratings to recommend an item accurately using standart CF methods. Exploration/exploitation methods from reinforcement learning such as Multi-armed Bandits are particularly well suited for these domains. LtR tech-niques can be also used for Multi-armed Bandits [6].
While there has been significant progress in the devel-opment of novel ranking methods one significant issue in CF methods and recommender systems in general is model-ing the dependencies of the items in a recommendation list. Modeling the dependencies within a recommendation list can potentially produce more accurate ranking, increased diversity and novelty. Other open issues despite significant progress include the efficient modeling of context (e.g. loca-tion) and item content information in ranking models.
The topic of this tutorial focuses on the cutting-edge al-gorithmic development in the area of recommender systems. This tutorial would bring a big picture of the progress of ranking models in the field, summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and discussing open issues that would be promising for the future research in the com-munity. The tutorial is intended for researchers and practi-tioners in the area of recommender systems, especially those who are interested in recommendation algorithms.
