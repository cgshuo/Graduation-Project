 1. Introduction
In recent years, recommender systems (RS) have played an important role in reducing the negative impact of information
Movie recommendation websites are probably the most well-known cases to users and are without a doubt the most well 2007 ) and e-learning ( Bobadilla, Serradilla, &amp; Hernando, 2009; Denis, 2007 ). number of elements that can be recommended (e.g. blogs, music, videogames, videos, photographs) can increase signifi-cantly when introduced (and not only voted) by the users. This new Web 2.0 approach generates new challenges for techniques.
 they work is very simple; a filtration process is performed for items using one of the following models: probably recommend a recent fiction film that he has not yet purchased on this website).  X  sonal attributes (sex, age, country, etc.) will also have common preferences.
 information is stored on the system we can make recommendations to each user based on information provided by those 2009; Leung, Chan, &amp; Chung, 2008; Qing, Sung, Myaeng, &amp; Man, 2007; Ryan &amp; Bridge, 2006 ). graphic filtering or CF with content based filtering, to exploit merits of each one of these techniques.
Regardless of the method used in the CF stage, the technical objective generally pursued is to minimize the prediction Papadopoulus, &amp; Symeonidis, 2007 ) of the RS as high as possible.

 similarity between users 1 and 6.

Considering item 1, we can deduce that the similarity between users 1 and 6 should be established as very high as they measure of similarity between these two users.

Concerning item 2, we can deduce that the similarity between users 1 and 6 should be established as very low, or even have cast the same vote.
 similarity between the user with a high level of singularity for the item and any other user is the same. these average singularities ought to lead to moderate similarity levels.

In this section the mathematical equations which support the proposed similarity measure are presented, which we will in the interval 1, ... , 10). 4.1. Parameters, measures and sets descriptions and 3 ). 4.2. Basic model users x and y , in a RS: r bol represents the absence of a vote.

We define R as the set of relevant values (positives) in a RS, and therefore R in a RS where m =1, M = 5, we can define We define P i as the set of users who have assigned to the item i a relevant value (positive). Using the example in Table 1 : We define N i as the set of users who have assigned to the item i a non-relevant value (non-positive). Using the example in Table 1 :
S ratings, the lower the singularity S i P related to this item will be, and vice versa. Using the example in Table 1 :
S  X  1 2 = 8  X  0 : 75 ; S 2 P  X  1 8 = 8  X  0 ; S 3 P  X  1 7 = 8  X  0 : 125 ; S

The singularity factors obtained provide us with contextual information with which we can improve similarity results iation of Mean Absolute Differences: Mean Squared Differences (MSD):
First, we perform the normalization on the ratings: r u , i
D x , y ={ i e I | r x , i  X  ^ r y , i  X  }, items rated by both user x and user y . By combining the equations described, we obtain the proposed singularities measure ( SM ): user has rated as relevant while the other has rated as non-relevant (these items belong to the set C ). Specifically, the Eq. (16) stands for the similarity between the users x and y on behalf of these three terms:
Term 1. Positive agreement : similarity between the users x and y on behalf of the items which both of them have rated with relevant values, weighting them by the singularity of relevant ratings for each of the items.
Term 2. Negative agreement : similarity between the users x and y on behalf of the items which both of them have rated with non-relevant values, weighting them by the singularity of non-relevant ratings for each of the items. for each of the items.

 P j i is defined as the whole set of users who have awarded a relevance value j to the item i s is defined as the singularity of the vote with relevance j for the item i.
The votes cast for an item i by users x and y can be represented as: The set of items in which the pairs of votes cast is: The extended equation equivalent to (16) is where double summation, which we will call e jq :
Taking into account that
The number of terms in the matrix (25) can be reduced according to the specifications of Eq. (27) : Finally, Eq. (23) can alternatively be defined as: where As an example, using the FilmAffinity database, where M = 10, we can establish a value of d = 3, and the sets: By applying Eq. (23) , we obtain the following: By applying Eq. (28) , we obtain the following: 5. Experiments achieved both in applying prediction qualities measures and in testing with recommendation qualities measures. 5.1. Reference similarity measure metric proposed must improve its results.

In order to corroborate the proper functioning of Pearson correlation and to discover the aggregation approach and the base, combining: Similarity measures : metrics set out in Eqs. (6) X (9) ; therefore: (PC, COS, CPC, SRC). Eqs. (3) and (4) (-Z).
 Results calculated : Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coverage, precision and recall.
 that present higher accuracy (lower MAE) are: CPC X  X S, CPC X  X S X  X , PC X  X FM, PC X  X FM X  X  and COS X  X  X  X FM. best values overall are: PC X  X FM, PC X  X FM X  X  and COS X  X  X  X FM. In turn, of these combinations, the one that offers the best result is PC X  X FM X  X , which will be the combination (measure, aggregation approach, standardization process) selected as the reference similarity measure. 5.2. Experiments using the proposed singularity measure (SM)
The experiments have been grouped in such a way that the following can be determined: accuracy, coverage, number of ing recommended to one user in one film matches the value (the stars number) rated by that user for that film. The RS databases that we use in our experiments present the general characteristics summarized in Table 5 . a range 2, ... , 20 of recommendations ( N ) and relevance thresholds h = 5 using Movielens and Netflix and h =9 using FilmAffinity.

When we use MovieLens and FilmAffinity we use 20% of test users taken at random from all the users of the database; with the remaining 80% we carry out the training. When we use Netflix, given the huge number of users in the database, in the experiments.

Results obtained using databases with limited voting ranges quality measures in comparison to the results provided by Pearson Correlation. For values of K = 200 X 300, where the SM mendation quality improves, on average, by 25% for recall and by 30% for precision. ommendation quality improves, on average, by 20% for recall and by 60% for precision. 5.4. Results obtained using a database with a wide voting range ation provides very good prospects for the successful use of the extended formulation model. improvements percentages are very similar to the Netflix and the MovieLens ones, showing that the extended formulation works fine using real databases and extending properly the basic equations.

In terms of prediction quality, in addition to reductions in the MAE margin, the improvements are dation quality measure precision versus recall, which is a measure which displays much smaller improvement variations when the various traditional metrics in CF are compared.

The coverage also displays drastic improvements when the proposed SM is used, and this contributes to an improvement From a practical perspective, where the improvements are is important; as in this case the improvements from using the taining an adequate quality of results and performance in the RS.

Recommender systems contain information which is not made use of by traditional metrics, the use of which is simple ignored in current RS.
