 Recently, due to the rapid development of wide-angle lens for cameras, the research community is paying more attention to the camera nonlinear lens distortions such as radial-based barrel distortions [ 1-2 ]. The lens distortion is that when the picture passes through the optical lens, it results in the loss of perspective, and forms the distortion effects. Barrel distortion is a distortion phenomenon that the image appears to be a barrel shape and it is caused by the physical properties and structure of the lens. Bar-rel distortion is the most common and the most widely used one. Hence, in our paper, we discuss the image enhancement algorithm for barrel distortion images. 
In general, cameras with fisheye lens produce barrel lens distortion images. The image formulation procedure of a typical camera with fisheye lens includes two major processes: barrel distortion and un-distortion (camera calibration) processes. Howev-er, the current research directions of enhancing the image quality captured from the wide-angle lens are limited to improving the accuracy of the un-distortion process [ 1-2 ]. There are very limited researches on enhancing the resolutions of the images with
