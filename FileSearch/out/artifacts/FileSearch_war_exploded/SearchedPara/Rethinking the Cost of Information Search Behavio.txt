 In this paper, we present a cognitive-economic approach to examining the cost in information search. Unlike previous studies on economic models, we calculated the cost in information search based on participants' eye-tracking da ta as well as their behavioral data, such as query formulation, search task duration, SERP and web page visits. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we explored a possible latent factor structure of variables representing the cost in information search. Our results indicated that the cost of information seeking could be associated with two distinct aspects of search, exploratory and validation processes. Information seeking stopping behavior, eye tracking. An extensive review of prior research on information search has been made into how people define information needs, generate queries, examine documents, refine queries, and make sense of the information they find (for a review see [1]). It has been found that terminating search too early or t oo late can bring harmful effects to its outcomes [2, 3]. In previ ous studies, information search stopping behavior has been investigated from different perspectives. Based on the econom ic principle as well as the findings reported by Azzopardi and his collegues [4-6], the cost of information search is one of the most important factors contributing to stopping behavior. Inspired by theories and methods from cognitive science, we report on a cognitive-economic approach to calcula ting the cost in information searching behavior. Economic principle is one of th e well-developed theories for understanding stopping behavior in information search. This principle was first proposed by Varian [7]. In his SIGIR 1999 keynote, he addressed the relati on between economics and search, and pointed out the feasibility of applying economics to solve several questions in Information Retrieval (IR), such as how to examine the economic value of information based on consumer theory, how to better estimate the probability of relevance, and how to apply Stigler X  X  theory [8] on Optimal Search Behavior to IR. An integral part of the economic perspective is to estimate the gain and the cost in information search. In previous studies, the cost has been mainly considered to result from a sequence of interactions. For instance, Azz opardi and his colleagues [4-6] simulated the cost of search in terms of a number of queries posted ( Q ), a number of search result pages examined per query ( V ), a number of snippets inspected per query ( S ), and a number of documents assessed per query ( A ) with some probability P total of interaction wa s modeled as shown in Eq 1 :  X  is the cost of inspecting a snippet, and  X   X  is the cost of assessing a document. In contrast to the models proposed in [4-6], Smucker proposed that the gain and the cost can be expressed in terms of time [1]. will have a total benefit of G(t) -the cumulative gain experienced by the users at time t . Assuming a decay function D(t) , in this time-based model, users will stop searching information when D(t) decreases to 0. The time-based model is shown in Eq 2 : Where T(k) refers to the expected time it would take for a user to reach result rank k and begin to judge the document. Although the aforementioned studies investigated the cost of search based on varying perspectives, all of them essentially considered information search as one-stage proce ss. However, a number of well established info rmation search models include multiple stages [9, 10]. Thus, it is possible that some costs are only associated with a specific stage of information search and that the cost associated with different stages can have varying effects on information search behavi or. In addition, the impact of individual differences on inform ation search was neglected by most of these studies. For instance, when reading the same irrelevant document, participan t A may invest more cognitive effort than participant B due to the differences in their working memory capacity. Lastly, in Azzopa rdi X  X  models, all of the queries were regarded as the cost. However, it has been found that generating queries of high quality also brings benefit to information search process [11-13] , though all queries carry a cost associated with them as it takes effort to generate and type them. In this regard, it could be more proper to only include queries with low quality in the estimation of the cost in information search. In our research, we have developed a method that includes both economic and cognitive aspects of information searching behavior. Specifically, we add ey e fixations to the assessment of the cost in information search. Previous research has demonstrated that the internal cognitive activity is reflected, to some extent, in the change of the number of fixations [14, 15]. In our study, the number of fixations was used to reflect the cognitive effort that each participant invested when they examine documents and search engine resu lt pages (SERPs). We consider the cost of information search results from query generation, document examination, search e ngine result pages (SERPs) and task description examinations. Recall that generating queries of high quality can bring benefit to information search process [11-13] , though all queries carry a cost with them as it takes effort to generate and type them. In our work, only not useful queries were considered in assessing the cost associated with query generation; their cost was reflected in two variables: Not useful queries were defined here as the queries that were used only once and did not return relevant documents (as judged by participants). For the queries that returned no relevant documents, but were used more on ce, we made an assumption that participants re-typed them on purpose. That is, these queries are not treated here as cost because they likely provided information that aided the participants in information search, for example, in reformulating existing or creat ing new queries. Queries that returned relevant documents are not treated as cost, because they directly facilitated discovery of the relevant documents. In information search, users might invest time and effort in reading some documents that are not useful for meeting their search goals. Examining such not useful documents could be regarded as a kind of a cost. This cost was reflected in the variable:  X  The number of fixations on visited not useful documents Not useful documents were defined as the examined documents that were located through not useful queries. This definition was based on an assumption that the documents returned by a query were less likely to be located by another completely different query (word stems of terms in both queries were different) in our experiment. That is to say, all of the assessed documents, located by not useful queries, were considered not useful, since useful documents could either be saved by participants as a relevant document (the interfaces in our experiment supported this functionality) or be found again by re-typing certain queries and then be re-examined. In contrast to not useful documents, all of the other documents that participants examined in the tasks were considered useful documents. The documents that were not examined were not considered as a cost since participants did not invest any effort reading them. The costs of examining SERPs were estimated based on the variable: Task descriptions were availabl e to participants during their searches in our study. We assume that participants opened task description, when they forgot or were not confident about information they were asked to find and needed to confirm it. In our study, opening tasks descriptions was regarded as a cost in the information search process. The cost of description examination was modeled, as follows: We conducted a controlled, lab-ba sed experiment to investigate Web searches on Wikipedia. Each experiment session was held in Information eXperience lab at the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin . 32 university students (15 females), aged 18 to 37, participated in this experiment. To control the in fluence of language on reading as well as the impact of divers ity in human vision on eye tracking, we pre-screened participants and recruited native English speakers who had normal to corrected-to normal vision. Upon completing the experiment session, each participant received $30. Experiment had a within-subjec t design. Each participant completed four search tasks in an experiment session that lasted up to 1.5 hours. The tasks were designed based on prior work [16] to be at two complexity levels : simple and complex, shown in Table 2. Two types of search us er interfaces were designed based on a commercial test search e ngine developed by Search 32 rotations of task complexity levels and user interface types with a constraint that UI is switched after two tasks. A rotation was assigned to each participant in a random order. In each search task, participants were required to read task description, complete pre-and post-questionnaires, and search information on Wikipedia using either of the two user interfaces. Participants were asked to bookmark and save the documents they judged relevant. There were no time limits set for search tasks. Before completing their experiment session, participants were asked to fill out exit questionnaires. Data analysis presented in this paper does not include user interface factor. Table 1 shows descriptive statisti cs for queries, documents examined and task de scriptions visited. Before performing data analysis , we removed bad fixation data (marked by Tobii as validity=4) and standardized all predictors: each predictor variable was divided by its standard deviation. We used principal component analysis [18] to explore a possible factor structure of variables representing the cost in information and T taskDescription . Prior to PCA, we performed Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy and Bartlett X  X  Test of Sphericity to ensure our sample supports valid PCA [19]. The result of KMO was 0.64, with Bartlett X  X  Test yielding 600.46 (p &lt;0.001). Both values indicate th at our own sample could satisfy the requisite assumptions for proceeding with PCA. Simple 1 Simple 2 Complex 1 Complex 2 To determine the number of component s to keep, we used parallel analysis [20]. Specifically, a ra ndom dataset was generated with the same number of rows and variable s as that in our sample data. Based on the generated dataset, we then created a correction matrix and computed eigenvalues. The results of parallel analysis are shown in Figure 1 with red line. According to the results, we kept only two components that appeared above the red line. Given the number of the components determined in parallel analysis, we ran PCA gain with oblique (Promax) rotation and the number of factors fixed to 2. The factor loadings for manifest variables were shown in Table 3 . The standardized loadings of these manifest variables (highlighted in Table 3 ) ranged from 0.70 to 0.98. The value of h 2 indicates the fi nal communality estimate: the proportion of variance accounted for by retained components. A value of h 2 &lt;0.40 indicates that an item is less strongly correlated with its c orresponding components [21]. Based on this criterion, all of the six variables in our research were correlated with their c orresponding components. Analyzing the results of PCA, we named the two factors exploratory process and validation process (shown in Table 3 ). The exploratory process was reflec ted in 3 variables: total time taken to enter not useful queries ( T notUseful ), number of words used in all not useful queries ( W notUseful ), and number of fixations on all SERPs ( F SERP ). The validation process was reflected in three other variables: number of fixations on visited task descriptions ( F and number of fixations on visited not useful documents ( D Figure 1. Revised scree plot sho wing parallel analysis results In the exploratory process, people first define their goals and express their information problem by generating queries that are expected to retrieve the relevant materials. The results of executing different queries are then explored by examining search engine result pages (SERPs). In the validation process people confirm whether the collected information satisfies task goals [10] by examining documents and task descriptions. Each of these two processes could span several stages of information search and that se archers can move back and forth between these processes. Roughly, the exploratory process takes place during Initiation, Selection and Exploration stages in Kuhlthau X  X  ISP model; it corresponds to Define Problem, Select Source, Formulate and Execute Query stages in Marchionini X  X  information seeking-process [9, 10 ]. The validation process takes place during Formulation and Collection stages in Kuhlthau X  X  model, and it corresponds to Examine Results stage in Marchionini X  X  information seeking-process. W notUseful 0.94 -0.07 0.85 
F taskDescription -0.08 0.98 0.92 
T taskDescription 0 0.94 0.88 D notUseful 0.04 0.7 0.51 Using PCA, we attempted to identify a possible factor structure of variables that represented different costs in information search. Our results demonstrated that these variables load onto two very well separated factors. This enables us to suggest that these two factors correspond to the two different processes in information search. We observe that they correspond quite well to exploratory process and validation process. To the best of our knowledge, this point has not been considered in previous studies. As mentione d before, in exploration process, people try to issue as many useful queries as they can to maximize information needs; during the validation process people confirm whether useful information ha s been found. In particular, validation process involves high level cognitive act ivities, during which people need to be aware what information has been gained from information seeking and whether the information meets their information needs. The evaluation of the cost in validation process possibly enabled people to monitor and control when to modify or enter new queries so that they can lower their cost and maximize gain in search. Our findings can inform further st udies on the cost of information search. For instance, in the previous studies, the different kinds of costs were linearly combined. Based on our findings, in the future study, we can examine relationships between the costs coming from the exploratory process and validation process and ask for example, are they linearly correlated with each other? Do they have different effect size on th e information searching stopping behavior ? Moreover, in our study, we have attempted to consider cognitive factor in the estimation of the cost in information search. For instance, we used the number of ey e fixations to reflect people X  X  cognitive efforts in reading. In the future study, we plan to examine how participants X  working memory (WM) ability affects their performance and subjective perception of the cost of information search. It has been found that WM has a significant correlation with reading comprehension ability [22]. Thus individuals with low WM capacity are expected to exert more cognitive effort and suffer higher costs when examining documents, as compared to those with high WM capacity. Limitations of our study include, firstly, PCA was used to find a possible underlying factor structure of a set of variables; it cannot be used to confirm the factor st ructure. Our study focused on the exploration of possible rela tions between the variables representing different costs in information search. In a future study, we intend to utilize confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) [20] to verify the factor structure that have been found in this paper. In addition, we made several simplifying assumptions about the not useful queries and documents. Lastly , owing to the limitation of our data sample, we had no additional dataset to the examine the gain of information search. We will try to address these limitations in our follow up studies.
