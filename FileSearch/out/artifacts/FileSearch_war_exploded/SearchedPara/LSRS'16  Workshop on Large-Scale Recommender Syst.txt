 industry practitioners tend to use long term engagement metrics to make final judgements.
 The motivation of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on large -scale recommender system s in order to: (1) share expe rience, techniques and methodologies used to develop effective large -scale recommender s , from architecture, algorithms, programming model, to evaluation (2) challenge conventional wisdom (3) identify key challenges and promising trends in the area, and (4) identify collaboration opportunities among participants. This workshop aims to foster discussions in several fields that are of interest to our growing community of recommendation system builders. On the practical side, we would like to encoura ge sharing of architecture best practices in large -scale recommender systems as they are practiced in industry, as well as particular challenges and pain points. We hope this will guide future research that is system aware. On the research side, we focus o n bringing in ideas and evaluations on sca ling beyond the current generation of big data systems , with improved recommendation metrics . We believe the brightest minds from both sides will mutually benefit from the discussions and accelerate problem solving . We solicited submissions from industrial level recommendation system practitioners in either a short paper or slides format on large scale system practice, as well as from recommendation systems researchers on their new research relate d to system aspect of recommendation with Big Data.
 We focused on the following topics: Systems of Large -scale RS: Dat a &amp; Algorithms in Large -scale RS: Leandro Balby Marinho, Federal University of Campina Grande Steve Bour ke, Schibsted Media Group Michael Ekstrand, Texas State University Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Qatar Computing Research Institute Andreas Lommatzsch, Technische Universit X t Berlin Vito Ostuni, Pandora Guy Rapaport, Turi Srikrishna Sridhar, Turi Christo ph Trattner, K now -Center , TU -Graz Andy Twigg, InsideSales.com David Zibriczky, ImpressTV The workshop will feature one keynote and three presentation sessions . We expect a mix of peer reviewed contributions one presentation sessio n to be 3-4 peer reviewed papers and the other two shorter sessions to be invited talks . We thank the RecSys 2016 organizing committee for giving us the opportunity to host this workshop in conjunction with RecSys 2016 in Boston, USA.
