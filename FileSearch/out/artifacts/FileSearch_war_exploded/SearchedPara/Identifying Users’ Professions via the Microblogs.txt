 Online microblogging services have become an integral part of the daily life for most Netizens. These services expect to know more about their users X  profiles, since user profile plays an important role in commercial services, such as personalized recom-mendation and online advertising. However, user profile is usually not easily obtained, because users are reluctant to expose their profiles to the public. Fortunately, some work has been conducted to solve this problem. A traditional practice is cutting user-s X  messages into bags of words and training a classifier. This practice can achieve an acceptable result on simple tasks such as predicting gender and age [1], but it can not solve more complex tasks [24].
 cial profile of microblog users. In Weibo, the largest microblogging service in China, users are mainly organized by their professions. To obtain more information they care about, users are more likely to follow other users that have the same profession with them. It is important to correctly identify user profession for microblogging services, because user recommendation rely mainly on profession.
 is one of the most popular functions in the existing microblogging services. In Weibo, users can forward messages or any interesting content on the web, such as real blogs, photos and external links. In this paper, if a weibo message was forwarded by any user, we define it as forwarded message, otherwise we define it as non-forwarded message. Based on a large dataset, we find that about 60% of weibo messages are forwarded messages. For most users, the massages they forwarded are exactly what they are inter-ested in. Users X  professions can be reflected by the messages they forwarded to some extent. But the traditional bag-of-words model will completely undermine the informa-tion contained in users X  forwarding behaviors. So here is a question: can we represent microblog users with the messages they forwarded, and predict their professions more accurate than the traditional method? that there exist too many forwarded messages. If we consider each forwarded message of these messages only have been forwarded by no more than 3 weibo users. In this paper, we define them as non-hot forwarded messages and define other messages that are forwarded by more users as hot forwarded messages. In our experiment, we discard the non-hot messages. Another challenge is that even though we can filter out non-hot messages, the number of remaining hot messages is still quite large. We observe that, every hot message points to a hot event (e.g. a breaking news or a recently released movie). We should come up with some methods to group similar hot weibo messages together.
 ing forwarding behaviors (PIFB). First, we identify the hot forwarded messages from a large number of candidates. Each of these identified messages points to a specific hot event. Next, we introduce three methods to group similar messages together, downsiz-ing our message sets. Then, users can be represented with the merged hot messages that they have forwarded. Finally, we predict users X  professions, which are found more accurate than those in the traditional method. We collect 41,531 manually annotated users from Weibo (http://weibo.com). To avoid robot users, we only collected verified users. Weibo conducts manual verifications to make sure that the verified users provide real and authentic information. These users belong to 11 representative professions. As Table 1 shows, the professions concerned in this paper include  X  X edia X ,  X  X ntertainment X ,  X  X ports X , and  X  X T X , etc.
 Users X  messages can be classified into two categories: forward action and post action. In general, forward action consists of trace and content . Trace contains the information that through which users the current user can see the final messages. Content can be extended to any forms as long as it can be shared by users with their followers, such as videos and blogs. A simple example is shown below: if a user froward the message:  X  X heldon X  and was forwarded by  X  X aj X , and now is forwarded by the current user again. posted an original message.
 In this section, we introduce the main steps of PIFB. As Figure 1 shows, the framework of PIFB contains three steps. In the first step, we find hot weibo messages from our dataset. In the second step, we group the similar hot messages together according to three criteria. In the third step, we represent users with the messages they forwarded and train a classifier to predict their professions.
 3.1 Hot Message Identification In this paper, we focus on forwarding behaviors, in other words, we focus on user X  X  behaviors about the forwarded messages. A critical step is to identify the hot forwarded messages. In the next part, we define hot messages under two standards.
 Absolutely Hot Message We believe that if a message has been forwarded by more users, the information behind it will be more. And the forwarding behaviors about this message can help our profession prediction more. Nowadays, Weibo has become the the biggest  X  X ews Site X  in China. Most traditional news organizations open their offi-cial accounts in Weibo and these accounts are all very active. They usually publish the breaking news timely and make the news spread quickly. There also exist many Chi-nese celebrities in Weibo, including actors, singers and entrepreneurs, etc. They post their personal views or daily lives in their accounts. They generally have a great num-ber of followers and their daily updates are likely to get thousands of forwards. So, in this paper, if a weibo message has been forwarded by more than a certain times (for ex-ample, 500), it will be regarded as the first kind of  X  X ot forwarded message X  (absolutely hot).
 Relatively Hot Message Unfortunately, those 11 professions, showed in Table 1, are not  X  X venly matched X  on attracting attentions. Nearly all the high forwarded messages are all posted by  X  X ntertainment X  and  X  X ports X  stars. For an  X  X state X  account, it is not easy to post an absolutely hot message, because  X  X state X  accounts usually have rela-tively less followers and lower forwarding rate. If we only adopt the absolutely hot messages as described in the previous paragraph, it is very possible that we only get the messages posted by a small subset of that 11 categories (may be 2-4). Therefore, as a supplement to the first standard, we define another kind of hot message. In our dataset, if a message X  X  owner has f followers (for example, f&gt; 500 ) and this message has been forwarded by more than f/p times (for example, p =5 ), it will be regarded as the second kind of  X  X ot forwarded message X  (relatively hot).
 whose each column denotes a hot message and each row denotes a user. This matrix represents all the forwarding relationships between weibo users and hot messages. M will have too much columns, if we don X  X  filter out the non-hot messages. Even though, the number of column is also very big. To slim down M , we propose three methods to group similar messages together in the next. 3.2 Group Similar Hot Messages Together In most microblogging services, users can be divided into two categories: informa-tion producer and information consumer. The information producer mainly includes the news site accounts, self-media accounts, and profit-seeking accounts with legions of followers. Their main purpose is making their microblogs broadcast as widely as pos-sible to expand their influence and get more new followers. Whenever there is a news, producers will timely post their relevant microblogs. The producers are very likely to post similar contents, because the texts may be pasted from the same source. The in-formation consumer mainly refers to normal weibo users. More than 90% weibo users can be classified into this category. Their most important action is reading and forward-ing messages. Normally, hot messages are more likely to attract them. The celebrity accounts have the characteristics of both producer and consumer. On the one hand, they produce hot messages, for they have so many fans. On the other hand, they also forward the messages that attract them.
 whether they are similar. But if they contain some text contents, the task will be a little difficult. In the next, we introduce three methods to solve it.
 Simhash As described above, the information producers are likely to post similar wei-bo messages. The most direct idea is that merging similar hot messages based on their word similarity. Simhash [2] is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in calculating the document similarity. This model can map high dimensional document vectors to small-sized fingerprints. With the help of simhash, we can transform such a high-dimensional vector into a k -bit fingerprint where k is quite small, such as 64. An important characteristic of simhash is that, similar documents have similar hash values. For instance, if there are two documents that only differ in a single word, the crypto-graphic hash functions will hash them into two completely different values. However, simhash will hash them into similar fingerprints. This characteristic is very important in calculating the document similarity.
 ter that, we can group the similar messages together, if the hamming distance of their simhash fingerprints is less than or equal to 3.
 Paragraph Vector The simhash can only calculate the documents X  similarity based on their word similarity. It can not deal with situation that, two documents have the similar semantics but written with different words. [12] proposes  X  X aragraph Vector X  (P2V), an unsupervised framework that learns continuous distributed vector represen-tations for pieces of texts. This method can be applied to variable-length paragraphs, and transform them into fixed-length vectors. In this model, every weibo message is mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in a matrix and every word is also mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in another matrix. The paragraph vectors and word vectors are concatenated to predict the next word. They are trained using stochastic gradient descent and the gradient is obtained via backpropagation. De-tails can be found in the original paper. After being trained, the distance between two paragraph vectors will be small if they talk about a same topic. It is not sensitive about the synonym. These vectors can be used as features directly to conventional machine learning models, such as logistic regression or k -means.
 Vector X  method. The length of vector is set to 400 according to the original paper. After that, we calculate their distances. A pair of hot messages can be grouped together if their distance is smaller than a threshold.
 User-Weibo Matrix Factorization The first method is based on message X  X  word simi-larity and the second is based on the semantic similarity. They are both directly calculat-ed by the weibo contents. As described in section 3.1, we have generated the user-weibo relationship matrix M . So we can further find more similar messages based on which users have forwarded these messages. Hofmann [7] introduced the PLSA, which de-veloped probabilistic latent semantic models for performing collaborative filtering. In this step, PLSA models users ( u  X  U ) and documents ( d  X  D ) as random variables, taking values from the space of all possible users and documents respectively. The relationship between them is learned by modeling the joint distribution of users and documents as a mixture distribution. The hidden variables t ( t  X  T , k T k = k ) represent the topics be-tween U and D . The model can be written in the form of mixture model as the next equation: The first is user-topic matrix, which represents each user with a vector of k topics. The second is document topic matrix, which represents each document with a vector of k topics either. In the second matrix, if the documents contain similar topics, their vectors are more likely similar. We can group two similar hot messages together, if the distance between their vectors is under a threshold. In this paper, we empirically set k to 400 and name this method UWMF. 3.3 Profession Prediction After merging similar hot messages, users can be represented as more compact vectors. Each element of these vectors represents a merged hot message, and the elements will be used as features in our multi-class classifier.
 ated. In our experiment, we compare Logistic Regression (LR) and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT). We choose GBDT as our default multi-class classifier, for we find that GBDT performs better in most instances. Hence, in the following part we only show the results obtained with GBDT [3]. In this section, we first statistically study our dataset. After that, we identify the hot weibo messages and merge the similar ones. At last, we compare our methods with the baseline method comprehensively. 4.1 Observation We firstly count user X  X  forwarding rates on different professions. As Figure 2(a) shows, different professions have different forwarding rates on average. It is a little surprise that the  X  X state X  and  X  X overnment X  accounts forwarded more messages compared with the  X  X inance X  accounts. Overall, the difference between different professions is not signif-icant. In our dataset, about 58% of weibos are all forwarded messages. For about 66% users, more than half of their messages are forwarded messages. Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of how many messages users forwarded (in their latest 500 messages) in our dataset. We find that about 95% users forwarded more than 50 messages. In this paper, our goal is to predict users professions only based on their forwarding behaviors, so we discard other 5% users who forwarded no more than 50 messages in our experiment. hot message separately. To better understand these two types, we calculate how many times that users X  latest 500 weibo messages have been forwarded on average by cate-gory. As Figure 2(c) shows, these numbers of different categories are very unbalanced. The  X  X ntertainment X  and  X  X iterature X  accounts attract much more forwarding behaviors than  X  X state X  accounts. The main reason is that the  X  X ntertainment X  and  X  X iterature X  ac-counts have relatively more followers. If we only adopt absolutely hot messages (for example, the threshold is set to 500), it is possible that we can not get any hot mes-sages posted by  X  X state X . So identifying relatively hot messages is very necessary in our model.
 Figure 2(d) shows the length distribution of hot messages in our dataset. We can find that there exist two peaks. The first peak represents the hot messages that only contain 10-20 characters. These messages are likely to be posted by star users who have millions of fans. This kind of message usually additional contains a picture or a video link. The second peak represents the messages that contain 140 Chinese characters. This kind of message generally contains rich semantics. 4.2 Identify Hot Messages As described in section 3.1, if a message has been forwarded by more than a certain number of times, it will be considered as an absolutely hot message. It is apparent that how to set the threshold is a double-edged sword. If we set the threshold to a smaller value (more hot messages), on one hand, user can be represented with more messages and our model X  X  expression ability will be increased; on the other hand, our model should handle more features and need to take the risk of over-fitting. As Table 2 shows, we set the threshold to 500, 2,000, and 10,000 separately. When the threshold is set to 500, we can get 731,153 hot weibo messages. This number is too large and most of these messages have been forwarded by no more than 5 users in our dataset (40 thousand users). Then, we filter out such messages from our hot message sets, leaving 100,219 valid messages. In the prediction tasks, we compare the performance of these three thresholds and choose 500 as the default value.
 and this message has been forwarded by more than f/ 5 times, we regard this weibo message as a relatively hot message. Just as the absolutely hot messages, we also filter out the messages that have been forwarded by no more than 5 users in our dataset, and get 61,806 relatively hot messages.
 61,806 relatively hot) 4.3 Group Similar Hot Messages Together In this part, we evaluate the performance of our three methods on clustering similar hot messages. As Table 3 shows: (1) In the simhash method, we choose 64 as the default length of hash value. In this step, we group similar messages together, if their hamming distance is less than or equal to 3. We can merge our 162,025 hot messages, identified from section 4.2, into 57,624 hot events. (2) In the second method, we choose 400 as the default size of paragraph vector, and merge similar messages according their Euclidean distances. In this step, we can merge the 162,025 hot messages into 32,118 hot events. (3) In the third method, we also choose 400 as the size of hidden variables, and adopt Euclidean distance to measure their similarities. In this step, we can merge the 162,025 hot messages into 27,129 hot events. In our experiment, the lengths of these three vectors (64, 400, 400) are chosen empirically [15][12]. We validate the other hyper-parameters (where to stop merging) with the validation set, and find the best stop points.
 simhash to find similar hot messages, making users X  representative vectors more com-pact. On the basis of this results, we adopt the second method, further compressing users X  vectors. At last, we perform the third method based on the current results. After these three steps, our 162,025 hot messages can cluster together into 17,196 hot events. In the next, we will study whether these optimizations can improve our profession iden-tification tasks.
 4.4 Results of Prediction We randomly divide our 40 thousand labeled users into training set, validation set, and test set, of which 6/10 for training, 2/10 for validation, and 2/10 for test. We regard user X  X  labeled profession as the gold standard, and select accuracy, macro-averaging precision/recall/F-Measure as evaluation metrics.
 didates of baseline model include: (1) Words in user X  X  original messages; (2) Words in user X  X  forwarded messages; (3) Mentioned user ids in messages; (4) URLs in messages; (5) Hash tags in messages. There exist hundreds of thousands of feature candidates and we have to perform feature selection to downsize our feature sets. Following the valid experience in feature selection for text classification, we use  X  2 statistic to select rep-resentative features. We evaluate performance with different numbers of features, and select 9200 feature candidates. We compare LR and GBDT on these features and found they have similar performance. To be consistent with our model, we also choose GBDT as baseline X  X  default classifier.
 baseline model. Other 3 lines represent our  X  X orwarding behavior based models X , which adopt different merging strategies. We can find that the baseline model achieves a per-formance of 62.38% in accuracy and our three models all get better results than it. This comparison proves user X  X  forwarding behavior is effective in profession identification. As Table 4 shows, along with the implementation of three merging strategies, our three models can make the prediction gradually improved. Our model in the fourth line that serially adopts all three merging strategies achieves the best result (accuracy=73.98, F1=73.53). This result indicates that effective clustering of similar messages is neces-sary, for there exist too many forwarded messages. In Table 5, the value of i th row and j th column represents the ratio of the users in profession i being identified as profession j . As the Equation 2 shows: we illustrate the ratio in each entry using different shades of color. We can observe that: (1) Our model performs differently on different professions. The recall scores (value on the diagonal) of most professions are bigger than 70%, with only  X  X ashion X  and  X  X it-erature X  less than 65%. The main reason is that the forwarding behavior of these two professions has no special characteristics. (2) The  X  X edia X  accounts occupy about a quarter of our user collections. Our model tends to predict the uncertain user as  X  X edi-a X  account. (3) The behaviors of some professions are quite similar. For example, the  X  X ntertainment X  user and  X  X ashion X  user have the similar interests, they usually follow and interact with each other. It makes the boundary between these two professions not very clear for identification. To better understand the relationships between user profiles and their behaviors, much work [11, 6] have been conducted and found users belong to different demographics behave differently. [8, 6, 10] showed that age, gender, and personality can be predicted from people X  X  webpage browsing logs. [14] showed user profiles can be predicted by their mobile phone apps. [21] analyzed tens of thousands of blogs and indicated sig-nificant differences in writing style and word usage between different gender and age groups. The similar result also showed in [23, 17, 5, 20].
 structure. In PAN [19], participants approached the task of identifying age, gender and personality traits from Twitter. [1, 16] predicted user X  X  gender and age based on their twitter linguistic characteristics achieving better performance than humans. [13] pro-posed a method to identify twitter users X  jobs and education attributes. [25] identified weibo users X  profiles only via the videos they talk about. [18] identified users X  political orientation and ethnicity by leveraging their network structure and linguistic character-istics. [4] predicted Twitter users X  profiles based on their social network structure, and [28] predicted user X  X  demographic attributes only by their chick-ins.
 ed an efficient framework for profession identification in Weibo. This work identified users X  professions based on both personal information and network structure. [9, 22, 26] showed that computers X  judgments of people X  X  personalities based on their Face-book Likes are more accurate than judgments made by their close acquaintances. [27] predicted the users X  professions in Q&amp;A site by using these users X  weibo messages. ing behaviors, which has been less studied by previous work. In this paper, we present an efficient framework PIFB to predict users X  professions by only examining which microblogs they have forwarded. In the first step, we identify the hot weibo messages from a large number of candidate messages, and represent users with the hot messages they forwarded. After that, we group hot messages together if they talk about the similar topics. This step can make users X  representative vectors more compact. At last, we design a multi-class classifiler to predict their professions. The experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of PIFB. Our method performs significantly better than the traditional  X  X ag of words X  based method.
