 The number of  X  X mart X  mobile devices such as wireless phones and tablet computers has been ra pidly growing. These mobile devices are equipped with a variety of sensors such as camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, NFC, WiFi, GPS, etc. These sensors can be used to capture images and voice, detect motion patterns, and predict locations, to name just a few. This keynote depicts techniques in configurati on, calibration, computation, and fusion for improving sensor performance and conserving power consumption. We also pres ent novel mobile information management and retrieval applicati ons that can benefit a great deal from enhanced sensor technologies.

This keynote presents a signal-fusion architecture XINS, where X stands for a signal source that can calibrate a moving device X  X  location as an external reference, and INS stands for inertial navigation system. An X can be GPS, WiFi, or location information of a nearby device transmitted over a P2P protocol. An INS can be, but is not limited to, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetic sensor. Modern phones like Google Nexus S and iPhone are equipped with tiny and energy-efficient INS X . The design goals of XINS are (1) to fuse signals from Xs and INS X  to predict the location of a moving device, and (2) to achieve so in a power-conserving way. System architectures similar to XINS have been developed before, but with vastly different constraints and at much higher costs. For instance, aircrafts, guided missiles and submarines have been designed to comput e positions and velocities using external references and inertia l navigation systems. A mobile phone, though, while equipped w ith similar motion-sensing devices, cannot compute positions and velocities as accurately as the former due to several factors. Some factors include low manufacturing quality originating from cost constraints, environmental noise, and the dynamic motions of people carrying the devices (as opposed to an aircraft for example). Moreover, the power usage of acquiring X signals on a mobile phone is much higher as a percentage of total energy consumed compared to that used on e.g., a submarine. These factors make the design of XINS exceedingly challenging. Inexpensive inertial navigation systems are notorious for producing errors due to misalignm ent, zero bias, and integration drift. A slightly inaccurate reading on linear acceleration (accelerometers) and angular velocity (gyroscopes) can be integrated into progressively (in time) large errors in velocity, which are compounded into greater errors in position. Worse yet, the motion of a mobile device is often  X  X on-smooth X  compared to an aircraft. For instance, different people can carry a mobile device at different time and in different manners. It is virtually impossible to tell true signals from noise. To eliminate noise, we have devised calibration schemes, and breakthrough signal processing algorithms using Equipartition theorem [1]. We further demonstrate that by us ing selected signals as primary sources and the others as constr aints, signal fusion [2] can be performed both effectively and efficiently. We enumerate applications that can benefit a great deal from XINS. Three examples are as follows: 1. XINS can predict indoor loca tions of mobile devices where GPS signal may be unavailable. 2. XINS can achieve location prediction in a power-conserving way by reducing sampling rates of primary signals and filling the gaps with power-conserving signals. 3. XINS can track the angle and the movement of a camera with high accuracy to enable smart image processing applications such as panoramas.
