 The challenge of deriving insights from the Internet of Things (IoT) has been recognized as one of the most exciting and key opportunities for both academia and industry. Ad-vanced analysis of big data streams from sensors and de-vices is bound to become a key area of data mining research as the number of applications requiring such processing in-creases. Dealing with the evolution over time of such data streams, i.e., with concepts that drift or change completely, is one of the core issues in IoT stream mining. This tuto-rial is a gentle introduction to mining IoT big data streams. The first part introduces data stream learners for classifi-cation, regression, clustering, and frequent pattern mining. The second part deals with scalability issues inherent in IoT applications, and discusses how to mine data streams on dis-tributed engines such as Spark, Flink, Storm, and Samza.

The Internet of Things (IoT), the large network of physical devices that extends beyond the typical computer networks, will be creating a huge quantity of Big Data streams in real time in the next future. The realization of IoT depends on being able to gain the insights hidden in the vast and growing seas of data available. Since current approaches don X  X  scale to Internet of Things (IoT) volumes, new systems with novel
In this part we present some basic concepts of IoT data stream mining and classification, regression, clustering and frequent pattern mining for IoT data streams. We will in-troduce some strategies to deal with concept drift, when it is present, and we will demonstrate basic algorithmic concepts about streams.
We start giving some motivation and examples of IoT mas-sive data streams that are continuously being generated. We show examples of how traditional mining methods can not deal with large amounts of data, to motivate the need for specific streaming methods. We give some notion of stream algorithmic complexity, and we show briefly some of the most frequently used approximation techniques in stream mining methods.
We discuss the problem of evolving data over time We discuss the problem of evolving data over time and define concept drift and emerging novel class (concept evolution). We discuss why and when concept drift happens. We out-line the most representative approaches to handle concept drift, concept evolution and, in detail, some change detection methods. We also discuss evaluation challenges of adaptive learning methods, and the most common evaluation method-ologies.
We start by presenting classification algorithms. We show the basic ones, such as the majority class, Naive Bayes, per-ceptron, and then we motivate the use of more advanced ones, such as decision trees and stochastic gradient descent learners. We give some insights on ensemble methods, as they have several advantages over single classifier methods: they are easy to scale and parallelize, they can adapt to change quickly by pruning under-performing parts of the ensemble, and they therefore usually also generate more ac-curate concept descriptions. We present recent methods on stream clustering as Stream-KM++, CluStream, ClusTree, or Den-Stream.. We discuss cluster evaluation measures. A common classification of these measures is the separation into so called internal mea-sures and external measures. Internal measures only con-sider the cluster properties, e.g. distances between points within one cluster or between two different clusters. Ex-ternal evaluation measures compare a given clusterings to separately given ground truth.
We present recent methods to deal with structured data as itemsets, sequences, trees and graphs.
