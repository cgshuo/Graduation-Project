 cability of the notion of Rademacher complexity to non-i.i. d. cases. coincides with the assumptions made in previous studies [7, 9, 10, 14, 15]. 2.1 Non-I.I.D. Distributions Definition 1 (Stationarity) . A sequence of random variables Z = { Z ( Z Thus, the index t or time, does not affect the distribution of a variable Z (note that this does not imply independence).
 Definition 2 (  X  -mixing) . Let Z = { Z any i, j  X  Z  X  X  X  X  X  , +  X  X  , let  X  j defined as Z numbers  X  exist real numbers  X  k units of time in the past weakens as a function of k . 2.2 Rademacher Complexity functions.

 We will denote by b R tation over a sample S drawn according to a stationary  X  -mixing distribution: in the i.i.d. case.

E where  X   X  =  X   X  E  X ( e
S 0 ) can be written in terms of h a as:  X ( e S 0 ) = R ( h a )  X  b R e S Thus, changing a block e Z McDiarmid X  X  inequality, the following holds for any  X  &gt; 2(  X  1) M  X  ( a ) : 3.3 Bound on the Expectation Here, we give a bound on E Lemma 2. The following inequality holds for the expectation E independent block sequence: E bounded in terms of empirical averages over two samples: as i.i.d. points : E [ X ( e S 0 )]  X  E In the second equality, we introduced the Rademacher random variables  X   X  i = 1 and Z  X  distributed due to the assumption of stationarity.

 with the Rademacher complexity R e D efficiently. In particular we can closely estimate b R following inequality holds for all hypotheses h  X  H : where  X   X  =  X   X  4(  X  1)  X  ( a ) . Proof. To derive this result from Theorem 1, it suffices to bound R e D application of Corollary 1 to the indicator variable of the e vent { R e D Now, we can apply McDiarmid X  X  inequality to R e D drawn in an i.i.d. fashion. Changing a point of S armid X  X  inequality gives 1  X   X / 2 , R  X  ( H )  X  b R S for a confidence parameter  X / 2 .
