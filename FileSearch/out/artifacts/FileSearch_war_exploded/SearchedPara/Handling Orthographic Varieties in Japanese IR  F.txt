 A serious problem in Japanese IR, although rarely discussed outside the major difficulty of correct word segmentation, is the high degree of orthographic variety in the Japanese language. Traditional IR systems, which compare terms according to their written representation, run the risk of missing documents that contain variant forms of search terms. 
One possible solution for the automatic handling of orthographic variety would be lexicon-based disambiguation, as suggested by Halpern [2, 3]. However, a the language is evolving quickly. Therefore, we argue that a more flexible strategy for automatic handling of orthographic varieties is needed. 2.1 Orthographic Variety in the Japanese Language Owing to the combined usage of four different scripts within one writing system (kanji, hiragana, katakana, and Roman characters), orthographic variety is very frequent in the Japanese language. The most common forms of orthographic varieties comprise cross-script variants (words which can be represented in different scripts), okurigana phonetic substitutes, and katakana variants. A comprehensive overview of the types of orthographic variety can be found in Halpern [2] and Kummer et al. [4]. From the information retrieval point of view, we can classify orthographic varieties in Japanese into two groups: (cross-script variants, okurigana variants, hiragana variants, kanji variants, and phonetic substitutes). represented (katakana variants). Variants in the first group share the same pronunciation. This fact can be exploited for information retrieval, if the terms are matched using their pronunciation instead of their distance may be an effective means of retrieving documents that contain katakana variants of a search term. 2.2 Yomi-Based Indexing Yomi-, or pronunciation-based, indexing is not a new strategy for use in Japanese IR. In contrast, it is a rather old technique, which used to be employed before the introduction of double-byte processing on computers, when information processing systems used the katakana syllabary to represent Japanese text phonetically. The yomi-based index Japanese language is very rich in homophones and the kanji characters convey important information for disambiguation. 
Although a yomi-based index may incur losses in precision through ambiguous homophones, we suppose that it may be valuable for the handling of orthographic negative influence of ambiguous homophones. 2.3 Fuzzy Querying for Katakana Terms licensed by Apache Software (http://lucene.apache.org). Lucene offers a query option denoted as  X  X uzzyQuery X , which matches terms similar to a specified term. If a query term is defined as  X  X uzzy X , the similarity between terms in the index and a specified target term is determined using the Levenshtein distance algorithm. The edit distance Equation 1 shows how the FuzzyQuery distance is calculated [5]. The variable  X  X argetlen X  refers to the length of the target term. We decided to use Fuzzy Querying for katakana terms to determine if it could prove helpful for the handling of katakana variants. Fuzzy Querying was implemented with a word-based index and added to our fusion approach as a fourth system. 2.4 Fusion in Japanese IR The evaluations of the NTCIR Workshop series have not produced a clearly superior indexing approach, but rather, show systems performing equally well using very different indexing approaches. The two basic approaches are word-based indexing, which requires Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and N-gram indexing, effectiveness varies case-by-case [6, 7]. To take maximum advantage of the strengths of the individual approaches, while at the same time minimizing their disadvantages, a number of enhanced approaches have been suggested. Among these are the  X  X ombination-of-evidence X , or fusion approaches. These approaches merge the result index search is a promising strategy in Japanese information retrieval [8, 9, 10]. Jones et al. [8] used coupled word-based and character-based indexing, and found employed character-based and morpheme-based matching to avoid matching problems caused by nonexplicit word boundaries. Vines and Wilkinson [10] tried several approaches: words without English, and bi-grams without English, obtaining an was calculated using the simple formula of sim new = 0.5  X  sim 1 + 0.5  X  sim 2 . 3.1 Test Collections NTCIR-4 collection, the Mainichi Shimbun articles from 1998, as an example of a rather standardized collection. Major news companies, including Mainichi Shimbun, The second test corpus used was the NTCIR-1 collection of scientific abstracts. About half the documents were from the fields of electronic engineering and computer sciences, where new concepts are created frequently and rapidly, and the terminology is higher than in the newspaper test collection (14.5% in the NTCIR-1 collection versus authorship. description, narrative, and concept. For the experiments with the newspaper genre, we used the 46 NTCIR-4 topics with more than five relevant documents in the Mainichi  X 98 collection. For the experiments with the NTCIR-1 collection, we used the official test Topics 31 to 83. The calculation of the average precision for each run was based on the relaxed relevance judgments provided by the NTCIR-1 and NTCIR-4 workshops, respectively. 3.2 Indices Three different indices were created: a bi-gram-based index, a word-based index, and a discarded, the katakana and roman character strings were left in their original forms, morphological analysis for the word-and yomi-based indices was carried out using the Japanese morphological analyzer ChaSen (http://chasen.aist-nara.ac.jp/hiki/ChaSen/). Out-of-vocabulary words, i.e . words not recognized by ChaSen, were divided into bi-grams. This can be called a hybrid approach [11, 12]. For the yomi-based index, in the case of more than one suggested reading for a term, the readings were indexed as separate terms ( e.g ., and for ). Stoplists were used to discard the most frequent terms per index type and per collection. 3.3 Fusion Strategy To determine the influence of the yomi-based index on the retrieval effectiveness, we determine the performance of the individual systems, we adapted their weights manually to obtain an optimum fusion result. The fusion strategy we adopted was Z-Score, which was successfully employed by Savoy [13] in the NTCIR-4 data, and yielded the best results in our earlier study [14]. Z-score fusion allows for a normalized linear combination of the search results. The contribution of the individual systems is controlled using a weight represented by the parameter  X  ( see . Equation 2). Key: RSV =  X  X etrieval Status Value X , i.e., the score assigned to a retrieved document. 4.1 Performance of the Individual Systems As a first step, we evaluated the performance of our four individual systems for both document collections. Table 1 shows the mean average precision (MAP) per system. 
The marked difference in retrieval performance across the two collections is bi-gram-based approach. Surprisingly, the yomi-based approach slightly outperformed the word-based approach for both collections. 
Fuzzy Querying clearly performs the worst. However, we found a number of cases where Fuzzy Querying clearly outperformed the other approaches. An analysis of the NTCIR-4 Topic 54 used with the Mainichi X 98 collection revealed that one of the katakana query terms was (faiba = fiber). However, the index contained only its variant (faibaa). The variant was contained in 407 abstracts, 96 titles, term. 4.2 Performance of Fusion Runs weight of unity to each of the indices. We then manually tuned the weights, using the higher weight. It turned out, however, that the best performance for both test collections was yielded by the non-tuned runs. Tables 2 and 3 show the percentage improvement system. Results marked with  X * X  are statistically significant (T-Test, confidence level = several indices and taking longer time for query processing. 
The results show that the additional yomi-based index leads to a significant NTCIR-1 collection of scientific abstracts. It also led to an increase in the MAP using the Mainichi  X 98 collection. However, this increase was not significant. The precision can be improved further by adding Fuzzy Querying as a fourth system. Key: N=N-gram-based index, W=word-based index, Y=yomi-based index, fW=fuzzy word We tested two strategies for the handling of orthographic varieties in Japanese: yomi-based indexing, and Fuzzy Querying. Integrating a yomi-based index system and merging the results obtained with a bi-gram-based, a word-based, and the yomi-based scientific abstracts, and to a slight improvement in precision for the Mainichi Shimbun  X 98 collection. Fuzzy Querying was not effective as a single approach. However, it led to a minor improvement of precision within our fusion system. N W Y fW
