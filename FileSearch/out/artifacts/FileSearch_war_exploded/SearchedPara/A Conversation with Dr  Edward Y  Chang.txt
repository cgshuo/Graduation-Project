 Ample evidence sh ows that KDD has become a major topic of interest in both research and industry in China since 2006. In academia, professor Zhi -Hua Zhou at Nanjing University in 2006 chaired a National Machine Learning workshop, inviting researchers in the greater China area to share their experience. In 2009, the first Asian Conference on Machine learning was inaugurated in Nanjing. In industry, both Google and MSRA influenced China Internet leading companies such as Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, and subsequently Renren and Shanda, to start their large -scale KDD operations. Three KDD engineers on my team were recruited to join Baidu (Dong Zhang, 2009), Tencent (Yi Wang, 2010), and Renren (Youlin Li, 2011), respectively; and Jian Wang at MSRA joined Alibaba in 2008. To the b est of my knowledge, the primary KDD application of these Internet companies this far is monetization, improving their ad/offer relevance and hence revenue. Besides Internet applications, research institutes in China such as China Academy of Science, T singhua University, and Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) have made impressive progress in areas of computer vision, pattern recognition, and bio -genomics. Applications such as face, gesture, voice, handwriting, and license plate recognition have been widely deployed. In the bio -genomics area, a team at BGI reached a significant milestone in 2008 by sequencing the first Asian individual X  X  diploid genome and published the result in Nature [1]. This sequencing effort took BGI one year to complete. Subsequent ly, speeding up genome sequencing has been among BGI X  X  top R&amp;D priorities. (One cannot imagine what one billion genomic sequences and their associated disease profiles can bring to advancing human health.) Researchers led by Ruiqiang Li from BGI and resea rchers from Google and universities at Canada and Hong Kong have met a couple of times to discuss large -scale data mining issues and solutions in hardware, algorithms, and data transportation. There is no doubt that KDD is thriving in China in several area s and its applications are rapidly growing, thanks to the increase of both data volume and demand for intelligent information analysis and trend prediction. In 2005, my team started working on devel oping parallel machine learning algorithms to mine large -scale datasets. My team developed PSVM [2], Parallel Frequent Itemset Mining [3], PLSA [4], Parallel Spectral Clustering [5], PSVD, and PLDA [6,7]. Among them, PSVM, Parallel Spectral Clustering, an d PLDA were made publicly available through Apache foundation, and they have been downloaded more than 4,000 times. Several Google products also use these parallel algorithms.
 Prior to the large -scale machine learning work, my work with Simon Tong on usi ng active learning to refine user query concepts published in 2001 [8] has been cited 850 times. Together with my works on formulating similarity function [9], learning on imbalanced datasets [10], indexing high -dimension data [11.12], fusing multimodal d ata [13], modeling personalization [7], and learning in large -scale, I published in 2011 a textbook [14] titled  X  X oundations of Large -Scale Multimedia Information Management and Retrieval ---Mathematics of Perception. X  This book treats multimedia KDD prob lem as a multi -disciplinary one, and addresses issues from feature extraction, knowledge representation, data mining, to scalability.
 At Google, my team developed and deployed Google Q&amp;A system to service millions of users. Since 2007, I architected, dire cted and subsequently my team launched Google Q&amp;A system (codename Confucius) in six languages at 68 countries including China , Russia , Thailand , Vietnam, Indonesia, 17 Arabic , and 40 Africa nations. The system is powered by Search and Social integration [15] and the aforementioned parallel algorithms. Google Q&amp;A system pioneered at least three distinctive KDD features, compared with the other Q&amp;A systems. First, it suggests labels (subjects) to questions for their easy organization and management. Second, it identifies subject experts via an algorithm called UserRank, and routes questions to subject experts. Third, Google Q&amp;A pioneers using data -driven Natural Language Processing algorithms to generate answers from the W eb. Together, these features (subsequently adopted by some other companies) have improved both quality and timeliness of answers, and substantially enhanced user experience and increased the number of active users. Large -scale datasets, continuous arriving of new data instances, and high-dimensional data are three key KDD technical challenges. At the other end of the spectrum, some applications face the challenges of lack ing training data and imbalanced training datasets. KDD communities in both China and the world are expected to collaborate as well as compete to tackle these tough technical barriers.
 One overlooked advantage in China is that the cost of obtaining high-quality training data is relatively low. One example is that my team invested about 600 person -months to carefully annotate a set of six million photos, ready to be made publicly available for conducting large -scale data -drive computer vision research. Similar ground-truth building efforts take place in several institutes, which may provide China future KDD research and development an edge.
 KDD R&amp;D has been becoming increasingly multi -disciplinary. Large -scale KDD R&amp;D requires knowledge of and experience with Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization, as well as Distributed Systems. At Google, we see, for example, Andrew Ng, Tom Dean, and Jeff Dean working together on a KDD project. When I spoke to professors at Google X  X  China faculty summit held in Ha ngzhou in November 2011, a few expressed concerns that not too many faculty members in China could teach a course on large -scale KDD because most had been narrowly focused in one area. We may have to make adjustments to our university KDD curriculum to e quip students with multi -disciplinary background to effectively tackle future KDD challenges.
