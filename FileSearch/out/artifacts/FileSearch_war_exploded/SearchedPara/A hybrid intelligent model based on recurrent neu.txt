 1. Introduction
The deregulation of electricity markets has led to competition and created opportunities for various market participants to trade electricity. Electricity price is determined using a bidding based system, where the final price is the outcome of a complex process which depends on various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. More-over non-storable nature of electricity as a commodity causes state of disequilibrium in demand and supply. Trading in elec-tricity markets is a more challenging task compared to traditional financial trading, as the former exhibits higher volatility. In this scenario, it is interesting to examine the dynamic nature of resultant electricity price time series and the scope of predict-ability in this system. Accurate estimation of future base load price is extremely helpful for the producers and consumers for deriving their respective bidding strategy and risk management.
In this paper we are concerned with short term price forecasting, in particular, day-ahead forecasting and, point and interval fore-casting of hour-ahead prices in the hourly market which are significant in modern power systems from short term decision making point of view. In many markets, an  X  X  X our-ahead X  X  program is followed where customers are given an hour X  X  notice on price, and interruptible customers are served on hour-ahead basis. For example, in Ontario market, predispatch prices (PDP) are updated every hour until real time and considered as final price signal to be sent from market operator to participants. However historical market data reveal significant deviation of actual prices from 1-hour-ahead PDP, implying the requisite of more accurate fore-casting model in hour-ahead scenario ( Zareipour et al., 2006c ).
Until now several approaches have been proposed for electricity price time series modeling. These applied methodologies can be broadly divided into five broad classes namely production-cost balance, equilibrium, fundamental methods, quantitative models.
The class of models constituting statistical approaches aim to obtain optimal model in term of forecasting indices. Either these models employ econometric models in context of power market or statis-tical models developed for load forecasting. Most widely used statistical models include multivariate regression, smoothing mod-els and time series based techniques. These models perform quite well during nonspiky regions where the seasonality trends prevail.
These models can incorporate fundamental factors such as load demand and fuel prices to enhance their performance.

Among the pool of models, the ones implemented on hour ahead market include NN based approaches ( Mandal et al., 2006 ;
Mirikitani and Nikolaev, 2010 ), Markov models ( Gonzalez et al., 2005 ), regression based models ( Zareipour et al., 2006a ) and hybrid approaches ( Rodriguez and Anders, 2004 ). These models have the advantage of tractability which is important for model-ing electricity markets, and are capable of producing visually convincing results, but lack performance accuracy in few cases as they do not address issues of non-stationarity and spiking.
Some of the approaches developed for day-ahead modeling include parametric approaches like ARIMA and their higher order variants ( Nogales et al., 2002 ; Contreras et al., 2003 ; Conejo et al., 2005a , 2005b ), or hybrid models combining statistical modeling with the basic concept of supply-demand balance ( Davison et al., 2002 ). Finally there are nonparametric artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques such as ANN, data mining expert models, SVM, fuzzy logic, etc. ( Mandal et al., 2006 ; Ranjbar et al., 2006 ;
Arciniegas and Arciniegas Rueda, 2008 ). AI based models tend to be flexible and can handle complexity and non-linearity. This makes them promising for short-term predictions. In fact a number of authors have reported their excellent performance in
STPF ( Mandal et al., 2006 ; Ranjbar et al., 2006 ). Nonparametric approaches such as neural networks, recurrent neural networks ( Mandal et al., 2006 ; Mirikitani and Nikolaev, 2010 ), fuzzy inference model ( Arciniegas and Arciniegas Rueda, 2008 ), and hybrid approaches ( Conejo et al., 2005b ; Fan et al., 2007 ) have the advantage of tractability which is important for modeling elec-tricity markets but lack performance accuracy in few cases. Most of the developed models compare their performances with ANN and statistical approaches. However some of the works indicate that there might be serious problems with the efficiency of ANNs and AI-based methods in general. The key limitation comes from the difficulty in successful training of models.

One strand of hybrid excitable models developed for electricity markets, which incorporate FHN system, are regime switching models which identify different dynamics as different operating regimes of the dynamic model and employ probabilistic transi-tions. A very complete and recent example in this attempt is given in Anderson and Davison (2008 ) where authors have applied the regime switching model as the describing dynamic model. These models incorporate various system characteristics and governing factors which lead to more robust and realistic spot price model-ing, as well as bringing insights about the spot price dynamics under various supply and demand scenarios. While not a fore-casting tool, the dynamics of these models behave as expected and match the statistical properties of the time series.
The approach mentioned in this work is a hybrid model which incorporates intelligent regime switching between spiking and stable regimes using multiple scale system. We carefully investigate the spiking mechanism caused b y excess of demand compared to supply. From dynamical systems point of view, the mechanism of spiking can be characterized by chan ge in topology of the underlying phase space structure caused by var iation in system parameters. The phenomenon of spiking will be studied using Fitz-Hugh Nagumo (FHN) dynamical system. Furthermore a hybrid model is proposed which incorporates approximation ability of RNN to regulate the parameters and time scales of FHN for accurate prediction of electricity prices. RNN regulated FHN is used mainly for spike forecasting. In future references, we will call it RNN-FHN. However this hybrid system is not able to produce satisfactory forecasts in stable regime of time series and the residue errors are high, which is why a simple feedforward neural n etwork is applied to forecast the residue errors. Evolutionary Strategies (ES), an evolutionary compu-tation technique, is used for training the feedforward and feedback weights of the RNN network while feedforward neural network is trained using backpropagation. The developed approach was tested in various markets worldwide over different seasons to test its forecasting ability, adaptability and robustness. Five of the most volatile electricity markets, NEMMCO Victoria, NEMMCO New South Wales markets in Australia, California, Spain and Ontario market in
Canada were modeled using the pro posed approach. The prediction results were compared with other previously developed approaches for hour-ahead and day-ahead pred iction. Moreover the same model was used to propose hour-ahead prediction intervals for risk assessment.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe and extract the multiple scale characteristics of electricity price time series. Section 3 briefly describes behavior of FHN in slow and fast time scales, while Section 4 presents the proposed hybrid model. Section 5 discusses the employed training procedure for proposed model. Sections 6 and 7 presents implementation over various markets worldwide and th e results corresponding to hour-ahead and day-ahead forecasting. Section 8 presents discussion followed by conclusion in Section 9 . 2. Electricity price and multiple scale systems
Most of the current real world physical systems share a basic mechanism, where a hidden slowly evolving process leads to variation in the systems process evolving in a faster time scale. The slow dynamics may correspond to gradually evolving system parameters. Or at micro-level, in competitive scenarios, multiple scales can  X  X  X nter X  X  the system when financial agents interact at different scales. Prices are endogenously formed in a financial market by the aggregate trading decisions of a large number of investors who interact by trading assets, while the resource money is limited. While dealing with huge amount of money for the same asset, these agents differ with respect to the time scale in which they take trading decisions. These different time scales significantly impact the dynamics of price. When the dynamics of market prices is modeled on a macro-level as the result of the dynamic coupling of two dynamical components, the degree of their dynamical decoupling is shown to have a sig-nificant impact on volatility clustering, and the multifractal behavior of time series.

The primary motivation in this work is to study the evolution of parameter changes in the slow scale and prediction of changes. In this section we extract the slow and fast scale characteristics of electricity price time series, which in turn will help in justifying FHN based modeling of time series. In FHN model, the spike formation is possible because of presence of these two time scales, slow evolution along an invariant manifold and instability of fast dynamics transverse to this manifold. The location of these spikes is fixed and can be determined from an analysis of the dynamics on the slow manifold. We are interested in developing methods capable of tracking the evolution of slow damage states in real time. This will provide the hidden time series dataset that will shed light on poorly understood multiple-scale dynamics of process. The approach tracks the evolution of slowly evolving hidden state using only measurement of fast subsystem which is source of non-stationarity on long time scales ( Chelidze and Cusumano, 2006 ): x  X  f  X  x , l  X  o  X  , t  X   X  e g  X  x , o  X  X  1  X 
Here x is the fast observable variable, o is the slow dynamic variable which is not directly accessible and behaves as the parameter whose variation causes non-stationarity in fast vari-able. l  X  o  X  is the function of parameter vector o , t is the time, the constant e is the separation of time-scale between fast and slow dynamics, and y is the scalar quantity derived from fast variable x . We implement the algorithm proposed by Chelidze and Cusumano (2006 ) based on extraction of slow variable features based on fast variable dynamics. The method uses idea of phase space warping which refers to distortions in fast dynamics phase space and uses short-time reference modeling error as its primary measurement.

Basically reconstruction of slow time trajectory based on fast time measurement is done based on a metric which is sensitive to change in the dynamics caused by variation in slow parameter.
This metric can be viewed as measure of deformation of fast time phase space due to slow time drifts. This metric used by Chelidze and Cusumano (2006 ) is called Phase Space Warping Function (PSWF).

Scalar data of fast measurements is collected and phase space is reconstructed using delay coordinate embedding as y  X  X  y  X  n  X  , y  X  n  X  1  X  , ::: , y  X  n  X  d 1  X  T A R d  X  2  X 
Here d is the embedding dimension. PSWF is formulated as e  X  f ; y n  X  X  y n  X  1 P  X  y n ; f damage  X  X  3  X  Here y n is a point in the reconstructed fast phase space.
P  X  y ; f damage  X  is the prediction of fast state for next time step based on a linear prediction model P .

The procedure for evaluating PSWF follows the partition of phase space into multiple disjoint hypercuboids, C i , i  X  1, which are small enough such that linear approximation is applicable. The PSWF value is calculated in each such region as e  X  f  X  X 
Here N ci is the number of points in hypercuboid C i , using data based estimated linear model P . All of these averaged PSWFs are collected as dN -dimensional feature vector [ e 1 ; e 2 ;...; e stack of observation, or { j } j  X  1,.., q snapshot of observation.
In order to examine if the phase space of slow parameter can be reconstructed without a priori knowledge of the changes occur-ring in damage states, we stacked the feature vectors as a time sequence in a row vector of a tracking matrix T A R q dN . Then the smooth orthogonal decomposition (SOD) of this tracking matrix provides the reconstructed damage phase space which is an approximation of actual damage phase space but is in affine relationship with it. Here the SOD is performed via generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of tracking matrix and its derivative DT ( Chelidze and Cusumano, 2006 ).
 T  X  UCX T ; DT  X  VSX T  X  5  X 
Upon GSVD ( Chelidze and Cusumano, 2006 ), the smooth orthogonal coordinates are given by the columns of UC while smooth orthogonal modes of damage phase space are provided by columns of X 1 . Smooth orthogonal values SOVs are obtained as  X  diag  X  C T C  X  = diag  X  S T S  X  :
In this work we implemented the above procedure on elec-tricity price time series to obtain the damage caused by hidden parameters in the system. These act as the variables which cause sudden transitions in time series such as spiking. The time series from California and Ontario market was taken as reference to study the damage evolution. Each time series was observed via moving window of snapshots containing 300 patterns each. Each observation was divided into 35 neighborhood hypercuboids. The corresponding SOVs for Ontario market are shown in Fig. 1 .
It can be observed that the damage phase space dynamics are dominated by single variable. The SOD analysis shows that the there is only one SOV that is substantially larger than the rest.
More importantly, the presence of additional time scale in this system is verified.

Furthermore, the SOM corresponding to this SOV is plotted along with the actual time series as shown in Fig. 2 . Interestingly it can be noted that the variation in parameter value take place a little ahead of actual tipping state in time series. This could greatly facilitate in prediction of critical transition in these time series systems.

The presence of multiple scales in this system encourages us to use a two-scale system for modeling this time series. Famous two scale Fitz-Hugh Nagumo (FHN) system has been employed for this task. This is further hybridized with recurrent neural net-works, given their universal nonlinear approximation capability, to successfully model this system. The hybrid model is described in next sections. 3. Fitz-Hugh Nagumo model
Dynamic models are extremely difficult to model incorporat-ing intermittent variable height spikes along with stable region dynamics. While, in general jump processes are not ideal choice for modeling market prices as they face the problem of mean reversion and modeling capability in stable region. In this work, both approaches have been hybridized for accurate prediction on overall time series. FHN system has been taken as the basic mathematical model for spiking. Under suitable choice of para-meters, FHN operates in resonating regime which works well for power markets ( Lucheroni, 2007 ). FHN model represents a wide class of non-linear excitable oscillatory systems ( Hoppensteadt and Izhikevich, 1997 ; Lucheroni, 2007 ) and is described using following equation: _ u  X  f  X  u , v  X  X  X  ku l u 3 = 3 v  X  = e  X  I _ v  X  g  X  u , v  X  X  X  g u  X  b b v A sin  X  o t  X  X  X  6  X 
Here e , g , l , b , A , $ , k , b and I are equation parameters. Varia-tions in these parameter values lead to  X  X  X ifurcation X  X  phenom-enon of behavior transition in dynamics of the system. A bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change made to the parameter values (the bifurcation parameters) of a system causes a sudden  X  X ualitative X  or topological change in system behavior.
Detailed study of this phenomenon can be found in Hoppensteadt and Izhikevich (1997 ). In (6), u behaves as an excitable variable and v is the slow refractory variable and I is an external variable.
FHN model follows a symmetric property when I  X  0, namely, (6) is invariant under transformation with respect to u and v .
With I a 0, the symmetric property is broken. The system exhibits topologically different dynamics for different values of bifurcation parameters.

There are at least two time scales present in Eq. (6) due to spike refractory period (which corresponds to internal frequency of the system) and the sinusoidal forcing frequency. The interplay between these time scales result leads to multiple scale behavior which is a typical source of intermittent spikes in a dynamical system. Fig. 3 depicts the behavior of Eq. (6) for certain parameter values. It can be observed that the dynamics match typical power market. 4. Proposed model
The proposed model is a novel approach for modeling spiky time series. The developed model consists of three components; a FHN model to mimic spiking behavior, a RNN unit to regulate FHN, and feedforward neural network to model the residue of RNN-FHN. The role of each component is described as follows:
FHN component : The motivation behind using the FHN system of equations in our model is evident from discussion in previous section. FHN is a multiple scale system, the dynamics of which take place at a slow scale and fast scale, as shown in Eq. (6) (in the equation, the parameter e determines the difference in time scales of two systems). Moreover for certain parameter values, FHN model exhibits dynamics similar to electricity prices, which is clearly shown in Fig. 3 .

RNN component : The ability of FHN model to model spiking time series such as electricity prices is evident from discussion above. However for accurate prediction purposes, it is required to intelligently control the parameters of FHN. We have employed RNN for this task of parameter control. RNN are dynamic models which are able to model long term dependencies by using internal state. Given the appropriate number of feedback units, RNN are universal approximators of dynamic systems with long term memory. In this work RNN uses a fixed window of past time series values as inputs and determine the FHN parameter values at the output.

Feedforward neural network : In this work we employ a feedfor-ward neural network in order to further improve prediction results. This component of proposed model is trained to model the residual error from FHN prediction, and in the testing phase, the output of this network is added to RNN-FHN model which assists in improving prediction accuracy. 4.1. Hybrid RNN-FHN model
As discussed above, desired behavior is achievable upon A and o , which are modulated using RNN according to the input values from the past time series, which reflect market conditions. The motivation behind using RNN for this task is its dynamic nature and nonlinear approximation capabilities ( Haykin, 1992 ). RNN offers explicit modeling of time and memory and exhibits temporal behavior which makes it pertinent for this dynamic problem. In this work, Elman state feedback configuration of RNN has been used, as shown in Fig. 4 .
 The following equation presents the discrete version of the FHN model obtained by Euler discretization: u  X  k  X  1  X  X  u  X  k  X  X  @  X  ku  X  k  X  l u 3  X  k  X  = 3 v  X  = e v  X  k  X  1  X  X  v  X  k  X  X  @  X  g u  X  b b v A sin  X  o t  X  X   X  u  X  k  X  1  X  X  7  X 
Here @ is the discretization step size, and k is the iteration step in FHN iteration. For day-ahead prediction, FHN is iterated 24 times, while for hour-ahead prediction, 1 iteration is carried out. The value of @ was chosen to be 0.05 in this work for good approximation of the continuous model and providing stability to the iterations, and I was chosen as 1.

Fig. 4 illustrates the proposed strategy. RNN uses K previous time series values X N 1 , X N 2, y , X N K as inputs. Wi, 1 r i r n are the complete set of weights connecting input layer to hidden layer, hidden layer to output layer and feedback weights con-necting hidden layer to input layer. One training vector is, there-fore, of length n . RNN evaluates the bifurcation parameter values. Subsequently, FHN system of equations uses these calculated bifurcation parameters and obtains the future value in time series X The inputs are employed to predict the hour ahead or day ahead price values, as shown in Fig. 5 .
 The learning in this model is carried out through training of
RNN weights, using evolutionary strategies, for the network to approximate the relationship between time series values and bifurcation parameters, as explained in the next subsection.
Feedforward neural network used to predict the residual error of uses K previous time series values as inputs. The output of this network is added to the predicted output of RNN-FHN. The network is trained using backpropagation algorithm. The overall hybrid model and complete strategy are elaborated in Fig. 4 . 5. Training of RNN in hybrid model
Evolutionary strategies ( Beyer, 2001 ) provide a promising algorithm for parametric learning of RNN. These algorithms are distinguished by their reliance on a population of search space positions, rather than a single position to locate the extrema of a function defined over a search space. Using random search operators such as mutation and recombination, and probabilistic selection, these algorithms implement a non-monotonic search that performs better in complex multimodal environments, which is pertinent to this forecasting problem. Derivation of a learning procedure in this hybrid problem can be a rigorous task for numerical and gradient based techniques, while in contrast ES is representation independent. The main motivation behind using
ES is that it is a global optimization method which scales well to high dimensional problems, while most of other learning algo-rithms run a risk of premature convergence to local extremum in complex problems.

The objective is to evaluate all connecting weight values of the network shown in Fig. 4 . Each chromosome, which represents the solution weights, can be represented as an array of weight values along with the mutation parameters for the individual weights. The weight vector chromosome representation is shown in Fig. 6 . Here mutation parameter s k corresponds to weight W k .
Mutation of weights takes place as given below:  X  k  X  1  X  X  s  X  k  X  n exp  X  t n N  X  0 , 1  X  X  t 0 n N 0  X  0 , 1  X  X  W  X  k  X  1  X  X  W  X  k  X  X  s  X  k  X  1  X  n N  X  0 , 1  X  X  8  X 
The mutation scheme used in this work is adaptive, uncorre-lated mutation scheme as shown in (8). Here N (0,1) is a Gaussian variable with 0 mean and variance equal to 1. t and t 0 are learning rate parameters which are determined as  X  1 =  X  2 m  X  1 = 2 t 0  X  1 =  X  2 m 1 = 2  X  1 = 2  X  9  X  where m is the length of the chromosome. Here the mutation works on coordinate level which allows the algorithm to adapt the nature and scale of its search to learning task. More details on mutation mechanism can be found in Beyer (2001 ). During one search cycle, members of the population are ranked according to a fitness function, and those with higher fitness are probabilistically selected to become parents. A population of l children is repro-duced from a population of m parents. Selective numbers of these parents or children constitute the population for the next gen-eration which takes part in the next iteration in training proce-dure. This selection process is crucial for the effectiveness of algorithm.

In the proposed strategy, non-elitist or ( m , l ) selection scheme was used, allowing good exploration of search space and averting convergence to suboptimal solutions ( Beyer, 2001 ). The fitness of each child is inversely proportional to the error evaluated over complete training data. Thus lowering the training error (obtained using that child chromosome) improves the fitness of the child and the chances of it being selected for the next generation. The parameters of ES applied in this work are shown in
Table 1 . Population size and the numbers of offspring were chosen to be high to facilitate good exploration of solution space.
The overall strategy is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Various hyper-parameters such as the size of recurrent neural network, RNN topology (number of inputs and size of middle layer), population size in evolutionary strategy, children size, selection scheme, etc. were chosen based on extensive experimentation. 6. Prediction of hourly prices
The proposed hybrid model was implemented for forecasting of hourly prices in testing data. Time series data from each market was divided into training and testing sets. Training of hybrid model was carried out in supervised manner and the performance of trained model was examined on unseen test data, without any adaptation. 6.1. Training and testing data The electricity markets most affected by restructuring include California and PJM markets in the US, UK, Spain, Ontario market in
Canada, and NEMMCO market in Australia. In some of these markets, higher energy prices have enticed new generating companies to enter, resulting in a greater competition and higher volatility ( Zareipour et al., 2006b ), while in markets like Ontario, huge networks with neighbor markets and regulated utilities significantly complicates the competition scenario. Volatility analysis done in some of the previous works has concluded that
UK and Ontario markets exhibit highest degree of volatility compared to other deregulated markets worldwide ( Zareipour et al., 2006a ). We have presented the implementation results in these five markets. The trained model was implemented on unseen testing datasets given in Table 2 . The training dataset includes one month data prior to testing period. The datasets used incorporate the defining characteristics of electricity price time series, like high volatility, occasional extreme jumps, and volati-lity clustering.

In normal circumstances, range of dataset is normalized from 0.1 to 0.9 with 0.9 corresponding to maximum value in data and 0.1 corresponding to minimum. However presence of large and rare spikes can affect the data characteristics upon normalization.
Thus we incorporate a special normalization procedure where high value spikes are ignored while normalizing the range of dataset, as shown in Fig. 7 :
P  X   X  P i  X  P min The normalization is carried out as in (10), where P max and
P min are selected as shown in Fig. 7 . In this work, P max after neglecting 10% of the highest prices to avoid spikes. Output of (10) is the desired normal price. It should be noted that normalized prices in spiking region exceed normalized P max
Application of the proposed model on these training and testing data is presented in the next section. 6.2. Experimental results
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) has been chosen as the error metric due to its wide application in evaluating forecasting models. MAPE is defined as MAPE  X  1 T
Here T is the total number of data, P i is the actual price and P is the predicted price. Many texts use variants of MAPE, namely mean absolute daily error (MADE), mean absolute weekly error (MAWE), etc. as forecasting error indices as low prices can have adverse shooting effects on MAPE. However for fair comparison with other works on hourly prices we use MAPE in this work as a performance index for hour ahead forecasting.

This section presents the performance of the hybrid model over point forecasting of hourly prices compared to other approaches recently proposed in the past, and relevant benchmarking is performed. Application of evolutionary algorithms as the training procedure brings large computat ion time to this developed model. Howeverthiscomputa tion time is not a key matter of concern as the learning process is carried out in offline manner and the trained model can be applied on a large set of unseen test data.
The corresponding performance curves, which show the com-parison of predicted and actual results, are shown in Fig. 8 for Spanish and Ontario market. The convergence characteristics for evolutionary algorithm based NN learning is shown in Fig. 9 .
The learning phase takes approximately 9 h using MATLAB 2007 on Intel duo core, 3.17 GHz workstation.

These performance curves depict the ability of the proposed model of providing close approximations over the stable regimes of time series while satisfactorily tracking the spiky regions. It can be seen that market clearing price (MCP) in Spanish market are stable and proposed approach closely approximates these prices, except 3rd (Tuesday) and 4th (Wednesday) day of the week.
While hour-ahead energy prices (HOEP) in Ontario market are comparatively more volatile with presence of intermittent spikes.
Fig. 8 (b) indicates that proposed approach performs satisfactorily in these spiking regimes (except day 5) and also in stable regimes (except day 2 X 3). Prediction results in terms of MAPE are presented in Table 3 , where comparison with benchmark models is given.
 The studies carried out in the past for prediction in Spanish, California, Ontario and Australia markets are given in Max (2001) ,
Rodriguez and Anders (2004) , Gonzalez et al. (2005) , Mandal et al. (2006) , Zareipour et al. (2006b , 2006c) , Catalao et al. (2009) , and Mirikitani and Nikolaev (2010 ). In Zareipour et al. (2006a ),
Zareipour et al. (2006c ) and Rodriguez and Anders (2004 ), one hour ahead HOEP forecasts have been reported using multi-adaptive regressive spline (MARS), RNN trained using expectation maximization procedure and nonlinear neuro-fuzzy model respectively. In Pindoriya et al. (2008 ), Spanish hourly prices have been modeled using hybrid NN-wavelet model; and using input-output hidden Markov model in Gonzalez et al. (2005 ). A hybrid approach based on NN-ARIMA and wavelet-TAR model has been applied for modeling hour-ahead prices in NSW market ( Max, 2001 ; Areekul et al., 2010 ). The benchmark model used for comparison in Victoria and California market includes NN based model ( Mandal et al., 2006 ; Srinivasan et al., 2007 ). The corre-sponding results are compared with the proposed approach in
Table 3 . Here, column 3 includes benchmark models used for direct comparison with proposed approach. For fair comparison, the testing periods used for proposed work are exactly same as those used in benchmark models given in column 3. While in column 4, other approaches applied in past over similar datasets (but different test periods) in same markets are given.
Performance curves in Fig. 8 and the comparison Table 3 depict the forecasting ability of proposed model in hour-ahead market. It can be deduced that the proposed hybrid model is able to approximate the dynamics of hourly electricity prices with satisfactory degree of accuracy. It is observed that the proposed approach outperforms the methods suggested in past on specified test set. Ability of the developed model to satisfactorily predict seemingly sporadic spikes allows the market participants to reduce financial losses in the high risk zone. 6.3. Interval forecasting for hourly prices
In addition to forecasting the price value, predicting the distribu-tion of the future price, i.e., the prediction interval (PI) is highly meaningful. Price intervals effectively reflect the uncertainties in the predication results and thus the risk associated with forecasting model. Prediction intervals are important in time series forecasting as they (a) allow to assess future uncertainty; (b) enable different strategies to be planned for different out-comes indicated by the PI; (c) it can be employed to evaluate the risks of the decisions made by market participants.

Interval forecasting includes proposition of a prediction inter-val l i , u i , shown in Fig. 10 , or future values with a specific confidence level ( a -level) in that interval ( Papadopoulos et al., 2001 ; Jun Hua et al., 2008 ).

Interval forecasts with confidence interval (CI) of 90%, 95% and 99% were obtained using the proposed approach for deregulated markets by following the statistical methodology ( Nandram et al., 1999 ). The mean m and variance s of forecasts are obtained upon m multiple runs on testing data, and CI is obtained as
CI  X  m 7 z  X  s =
Here z  X  2.576, 1.96 and 1.645 for a  X  99%, 95% and 90% respectively.

The criteria of absolute coverage error (ACE) ( Jun Hua et al., 2008 ), conditional coverage (CC) and unconditional coverage (UC) ( Christoffersen, 1997 ) have been used to evaluate the obtained intervals. Given N observations y i , 1 r i r N of time series and corresponding interval l i , u i with CI  X  a
ACE  X  a ^ a ; where ^ a  X  Thus ^ a is the fraction of observations lying within the interval.
Fig. 10 (a) shows the enlarged section of time series along with forecasted prediction intervals with CI  X  95% for Ontario market. It desirable to achieve intervals with smaller range l i , u maintaining low value of ACE. Similar criteria of unconditional coverage, LRuc, indicates the quality of coverage ( Christoffersen, 1997 ), as shown in the following equation: LR
UC  X  2 log  X 
Here p is the coverage rate; n 1 is the number of exceptions for the proposed prediction interval; n 0 is the number of non-exceptions.

In addition of having a good absolute coverage, a good interval forecast should be narrow in stable periods and wide in volatile spiky regions, indicated by test of conditional coverage (CC) ( Christoffersen, 1997 ). This property allows uniformity of cover-age. To assess this property for interval forecast obtained from proposed model, Pearson-type w 2 test has been used ( Wallis, 2003 ). This test is asymptotically equivalent to likelihood ratio test suggested in Wallis (2003 ). The chi-square statistic is eval-uated as ( Liu, 2005 ) LR
CC  X  2 log here n ij is the number value i followed by j in indicator sequence; and
The statistics ACE, LRuc and LRcc are given in Table 4 . Low values of ACE indicate that the proposed CI has coverage and confidence level closed to desired value. This suggests that quality of one-hour-ahead PI obtained using proposed approach is good.
ACE and unconditional coverage statistic LRuc for Ontario are higher compared to other markets due to higher volatility in this market. Moreover, it can be observed in Fig. 10 (b) that prediction interval are narrow in stable regime while interval range is large in spiking region which is due to high uncertainty associated with the regime. This property suggests uniformity of coverage over testing dataset. However it can be observed in Table 4 that conditional coverage statistic vary significantly from LRuc imply-ing that coverage uniformity is not as good as indicated in Fig. 10 (b). 6.4. Statistical analysis
Fig. 11 depicts the distribution of percentage errors corre-sponding to the predicted forecasts. Each bar of the histogram corresponds to the number of forecasts in that error range.
It can be seen that height of bars is maximum around minimum error, while there are very few bars with low height in high error value range. This scenario is favorable in reducing eminent financial risks associated with high forecasting error which is important in spiky time series scenario.

Table 5 shows the relevant statistical measures for the analysis of error achieved over the entire time series. Large standard deviation is noteworthy in case of Ontario market which experi-ences large values of standard deviation of error in all seasons of the year. Moreover the forecasts in Ontario market exhibit highest value of maximum error which testifies the presence of highest degree of volatility in this market.
 7. Day ahead forecasting
The proposed hybrid model was implemented for forecasting of day ahead prices in testing data. Time series data from each market was divided into training and testing sets. Training of hybrid model was carried out in supervised manner and the performance of trained model was examined on unseen test data, without any adaptation. The corresponding per formance curves, which show the comparison of predicted and actual results, are shown in Figs. 12 X 25 . The comparison to benchmark results is given in Table 7 .
The electricity markets most affected by restructuring and which are studied in used for forecasting include California and PJM markets in the US, Spain, Ontario market in Canada, and
NEMMCO market in Australia. In some of these markets, higher energy prices have enticed new generating companies to enter, resulting in a greater competition and higher volatility ( Zareipour et al., 2006b ), while in markets like Ontario, huge networks with neighbor markets and regulated utilities significantly complicates the competition scenario. The implementation results in these five markets have been presented. The trained model was implemented on unseen testing datasets given in Table 6 . The training dataset includes one month data prior to testing period.
The datasets used incorporate the defining characteristics of electricity price time series, like high volatility, occasional extreme jumps, and volatility clustering.

Table 6 presents a data description of the electricity price series in our study. For the California and PJM, price data are based on Dow Jones Electricity Price Indexes and are drawn from
Datastream International. These are volume-weighted price indexes based on Dow Jones Firm On-Peak daily indexes and are denominated in U.S. dollars per MW. For PJM, the data from PECO zone is considered for analysis.

In this work, six deregulated markets worldwide were inves-tigated and experimented upon. The idea of deregulation has disseminated among many countries with large power markets referable to its lowering in price effect. The markets most affected by restructuring include California, PJM, UK electricity market,
Ontario and NEMMCO Australia. The market data was obtained from www.elexon.co.uk for UK market, from www.ieso.ca for Canadian Ontario market, from www.nemmco.com.au for
NEMMCO Australian data, etc. Some of the literatures have tried to analyze these markets and the effects of deregulation upon them using various volatility indices. The Australian data is obtained from NEMMCO (www.nemmco.com.au) and represents hourly prices. The prices are denominated in Australian dollars per MW. The two trading hubs in the transmission network for which we obtain data are New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC).

The proposed hybrid model was implemented for forecasting of day ahead prices in testing data. Time series data from each market was divided into training and testing sets. Training of hybrid model was carried out in supervised manner and the performance of trained model was examined on unseen test data, without any adaptation. The corresponding performance curves, which show the comparison of predicted and actual results, are shown in Figs. 12 X 25 . 7.1. Results for Ontario market
The implementation results for RNN-FHN for Ontario market are shown in Figs. 12 X 14 where actual and predicted curves are presented.

In these three figures, it can be observed that the testing dataset for Ontario market consists of highly volatile chaotic oscillations with intermittent presence of single spikes. The developed model performs well in spiking region with consider-able accuracy. However the performance in chaotic region was observed to be rather unsatisfactory, especially when compared with PGRNN model. In chaotic region the behavior is oscillatory ripples, especially during Week 3. 7.2. Results for PJM
The implementation results for PGRNN for PJM market are shown in Figs. 15 X 18 where actual and predicted curves are presented.

In these four figures, it can be observed that the testing dataset for PJM market consists mainly of chaotic oscillations with almost no presence of spikes. The predicted and actual curve comparison confirms that RNN-FHN works well in low dimensional chaotic regions however results are inferior compared to benchmarks or
PGRNN model. 7.3. Results for Victoria
The implementation results for PGRNN for Victoria market are shown in Figs. 19 X 21 where actual and predicted curves are presented.
 In these figures, it can be observed that the testing dataset for Victoria market consists of low volatile chaos during Week 1 and
Week 2 while highly volatile chaotic oscillations in Week 3 with intermittent presence of single spikes. The developed model performs with considerable accuracy in both chaotic and spiking regions. 7.4. Results for NSW
The implementation results for PGRNN for NSW market are shown in Figs. 22 X 25 where actual and predicted curves are presented.

In these four figures, it can be observed that the testing dataset for NSW market consists of low volatile chaos during Week 1 X 3 with intermittent spikes while highly volatile chaotic oscillations in Week 4.

However the unique feature of Week 1 and Week 4 is the nature of spikes which is in the form of low frequency bursting.
The developed model performs with considerable accuracy in chaotic regions and single spiking regions, while the accuracy in bursting spiking region is much better compared to PGRNN. 8. Discussion
The performance curves and the comparison tables indicate the superiority of proposed model over other forecasting approaches proposed in past, over specified testing dataset.
Moreover closer prediction in spiking region strengthens its applicability as forecasting tool in high risk electricity markets.
The main contributions of this paper and the key advantages of the proposed model can be summarized as follows.

Improved prediction performance achieved through develop-ment of a heuristic based hybrid model combining merits of
RNN models and excitable properties of FHN coupled system of equations with better forecasting.

Satisfactory tracking and forecast in the spiking region which helps in good statistical results, thereby reducing the financial risk in this region of uncertainty.

Reasonably accurate performance over worldwide deregulated markets from different regions of the world over different seasons and time of the year, verifying the adaptability and applicability of the proposed model.

Satisfactory unconditional coverage provided by obtained prediction intervals upon interval forecasting. Prediction inter-vals obtained are narrow in stable regime and wider in spiky volatile regions.

The developed model avoids preprocessing of time series data, thereby avoiding possible loss of data due to filtering. In particular, avoiding the decomposition of time series signal averts the risk of losing high frequency components.

The developed model handles the problem of non-stationarity, which is why it doesn X  X  necessitate limiting the size of training data.

While the proposed model is able to achieve better results compared to traditional models on this time series, the MAPE of the forecasts can be further improved. The absence of information about the structure of the network required is a small disadvan-tage with this approach, but the key advantage of using this model is the ability to achieve fair predictions in the spiking region, which will help the bidders and strategy makers a great deal at the critical time. 9. Conclusion
In this paper a systematic approach has been adopted. First the dynamic mechanism behind spiking is studied, which lead to multiple scale dynamics. The presence of slow and fast scale dynamics is affirmed. A unique model is proposed which hybri-dizes multiple scale system, namely FHN, with RNN for accurate prediction in electricity price time series. The forecasting perfor-mance in stable regions and spiking regions was found to be satisfactory, over many deregulated markets in the world over different seasons, verifying its adaptability.

Success of this synergistic combination of RNN and coupled system of equations presents exciting opportunities for future work in day-ahead prediction in this time series system using multi-scale system. If the exact underlying slow X  X ast interaction mechanism can be extracted from time series, results can be considerably improved. Exact multi-scale modeling will be the future approach in this context.
