 Deep learning has catapulted to the front page of the New York Times, formed the core of the so-called  X  X oogle brain X , and achieved impressive results in vision, speech recognition, and elsewhere. Yet researchers have offered simple conundrums that deep learning doesn X  X  address. For example, consider the sentence:  X  X he large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam. X  What was made of Styrofoam? The large ball? Or the table? The answer is obviously  X  X he table X , but if we change the word  X  X tyrofoam X  to  X  X teel X , the answer is clearly  X  X he large ball X . To automatically answer this ty pe of question, our computers require an extensive body of knowledge. We believe that text mining can provide the requisite body of knowledge. My talk will describe work at the new Allen Institute for AI towards building the next-generation of text-mining systems. K.0 [ Computing Milieux ]: General Keywords: data mining; deep learning; text-mining Dr. Oren Etzioni is Chief Executive Officer of the Allen Institute for AI. He was a Professor at the University of Washington's Computer Science department starting in 1991, receiving several awards including GeekWire's Hire of the Y ear (2014), Seattle's Geek of the Year (2013), the Robert Engelmore Memorial Award (2007), the IJCAI Distinguished Paper Award (2005), AAAI Fellow (2003), and a National Young Investigator Award (1993). He was also the founder or co-founder of several companies including Farecast (sold to Microsoft in 2008) and Decide (sold to eBay in 2013), and the author of over 100 technical papers that have garnered roughly 20,000 citations. The goal of Oren's research is to solve fundamental problems in AI, particularly the automatic learning of knowledge from text. Oren received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 1991, and his B.A. from Harvard in 1986.
