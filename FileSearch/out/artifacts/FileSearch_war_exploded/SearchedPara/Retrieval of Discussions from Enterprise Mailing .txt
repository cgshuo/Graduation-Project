 Mailing list archives in an enterprise are a valuable source for employees to dig into the past proceedings of the orga-nization that could be relevant to their present task. Going through the proceedings of discussions about certain topics might be cumbersome and regular search techniques might not work in this context due to the genre that the documents belong to. In this paper, we propose methods, based on theory of subjectivity, to retrieve email messages that could contain argumentative discussions about the topic that the user is interested in.

Mailing lists of an organization offer a chance for the em-ployees to discuss technical problems, debate on policies-in-making to reach an acceptable solution. Archived mailing lists are a valuable source of information that gives users an opportunity to analyze the proceedings taken place over certain period of time [6] and may contain answers to such questions as: What points in the policy did most users agree/disagree with?
Users interested in past discussions might like to know both the pro and the con arguments made in those discus-sions. Hence, the retrieved email message(s) should satisfy two constraints: 1) It should be on the topic that the user is interested in and 2) It should have a pro/con argument about the topic in discussion.

Several approaches have been proposed to identify the dis-cussions with a pro/con argument on the topic [2]. We based our experiments on the hypothesis that emails containing a pro/con argument tend to express a subjective opinion of the author towards the topic in discussion. For example:
In discussions relating to the above example, participants contribute to the flow by expressing their viewpoints/opinions on the ideas proposed previously (or a new one if the author is initiating the discussion). This is followed by other par-ticipants taking turns in either agreeing with the previous author(s) or by suggesting some alternative. This motivates our hypothesis that by identifying the subjective opinion of the author about the topic, we may be able to retrieve the discussions having a pro/con argument in their content.
Skomorowski [4] proposed a method to determine if some text is expressing opinion targeted towards a topic, by taking into account the subjective adjectives surrounding the topic terms in text. Adjectives, in noun phrases or in the context of nouns, act as noun modifiers. Therefore, by identifying the likelihood of a subjective adjective modifying a noun, he proposed to infer the subjective opinion directed at that noun. In our work, we used the 1336 subjective adjectives manually composed by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown [3] to retrieve messages having arguments about the topic.
Instead of using all 1336 subjective adjectives, we selected a subset of adjectives based on the idea that subjective ad-jective usage varies with the topic in discussion. For exam-ple, subjective adjectives such as  X  X ncompatible X ,  X  X nsup-ported X  would be more frequent in discussions about  X  X ys-tems/products X  or  X  X evices X  and may also express the au-thor X  X  subjective opinion towards the topic of those discus-sions. We used the pseudo-feedback term selection method to select the subset of subjective adjectives, as proposed by Carpineto et.al [1].

We computed the KL divergence values for all the sub-jective adjective terms, composed by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown [3], as follows: where p R ( t ) is the probability of the term t in the relevant (pseudo-relevant) document set; p C ( t ) is the probability of the term t in the whole collection. The probability values were computed as follows: where, f ( C | R ) ( t ) is the count of the terms in the relevant document set ( R ), and N T ( C | R ) is the number of tokens in the document set. In the current experiments, we used the top 25 documents retrieved by Okapi BM25 retrieval [5] as the pseudo-relevant document set and extracted the top 40 subjective adjectives. We then used the selected set of ad-jectives for re-ranking the messages initially retrieved. We also used these subjective adjectives for expanding initial query, by treating these adjectives as pseudo-relevant feed-back terms.
Using the selected subset of subjective adjectives, we re-ranked the messages retrieved for initial query. We com-puted the BM25 term weight [5] for each subjective term as follows: where w t is the IDF value of the term t; T F t is the fre-quency of the term t in document k ; DL is the length of the document k and AV DL is the average document length in the collection, k 1 and b are constant values set to 1.2 and 0.5 respectively. The IDF Value of a term t is computed as follows: We then add the BM25 term weight, as computed above, of all subjective terms in the document ( w t Doc k ) to obtain an updated score.
We selected the top 25 subjective adjectives, ranked based on their KL divergence values, for query expansion. To avoid query drift caused by term expansion, we assigned lower weights to the subjective adjective terms. We trained our system using the Discussion Search 2005 test data [2] and found to achieve better performance when assigned a weight of 0.03 to each expansion term. In current experiments, we assigned the same weight (0.03) to each expansion term.
In order to evaluate the methods, we used the topic set and W3C corpus provided by NIST in context of the Discus-sion Search 2006 task. For baseline run, t.baseline , we ex-tracted the title terms from the topics as queries and ranked the messages based on the Okapi BM25 ranking function [5]. For re-rank run, s.re-rank , we re-ranked the messages ini-tially retrieved by the method explained in Section 2.1. For the feedback run, s.feedback , we followed the method ex-plained in Section 2.2.

All runs were compared by two levels of performance mea-sures [Table 1][Figure 1]:
We proposed methods to retrieve discussions containing a pro/con argument about a topic. We found that presence of subjective adjectives indicates the presence of a pro/con Table 1: Using subjective adjective terms for pseudo-feedback and re-ranking purposes. Only 46 queries had at least one judged document that con-tains a pro/con argument about the topic. Measures with  X  X  X  indicate statistical significance over baseline run (paired t-test p &lt; 0.05) Figure 1: Plots: Precision values ( P ) at various lev-els of documents retrieved ( K ) using first (on topic) and second (on topic + pro/con) level relevance judgements. argument about the topic. We would like to experiment fur-ther with various combinations of number of pseudo-relevant documents selected and number of subjective adjectives ex-tracted for query expansion. Further, we would like to de-termine the polarity of a message  X  whether it expresses a pro or against argument on the topic. We would also like to study the subjectivity property combined with the thread structure of emails in a mailing list.
