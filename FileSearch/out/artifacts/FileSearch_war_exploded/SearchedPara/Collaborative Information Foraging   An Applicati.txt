 H.1.1 Systems and Information Theory: Value of information . group decision making, informati on foraging, time constraint My research thesis revolves around the fields of computer-supported cooperative work, human -computer interaction, and information and communicati on technologies. My primary research interest is to understand, model, and support collaborative information foraging in decision-making environments that are especially characterized by time-constraint and changing level of severity. Traditional studies of information seeking or processing (i.e., handling) in such environments have focused on the description of the interaction of individuals and informati on sources available to them; however, recent research has found that the environment in which the decisions are made have the potential to shape how decision-makers seek and/or ha ndle information in order to Although there is a continuous in crease of interest in how important collaboration is to in formation seeking and handling, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying dynamics of information items that are sought or handled, especially in time-critical situations. Consequently, th ere is a lack of models that predict how people find and use in formation to make informed decisions. My research addresse s these gaps by investigating the impact of two post-emergency environment characteristics--time-constraint and level of severity X  X n collaborative information foraging by emerge ncy response personnel as they perform an emergency response operation. Emergency response operations are those activities undertaken by professional and non-professi onal personnel to help reduce economic or human losses following a highly disruptive event. Often enough, these operations take place in risky environments, where a premium is placed on an ability to think and act quickly and effectively. In order to manage what are sometimes large and complex opera tions, representatives of key agencies (such as police, fire, medical and hazardous materials) are assembled into groups called emergency response organizations (EROs). EROs wo rk in a management-level capacity to identify and resolve problems that cut across organizational boundaries (Quara ntelli, 1978, Scanlon, 1994), such as coordination of fire suppression activities with building evacuation activities (Lawson and Vettori, 2005). As suggested by their design, EROs are supposed make use of common information (i.e., information held by all members) as well as unique (or partially-shared) inform ation (i.e., information held by some subset of members) (Hunton, 2001, Parks and Cowlin, 1996). They do so through information foraging : that is, through the combined activity of seeking information from various sources and handling (or processing) it to determine whether it is likely to meet information needs. More formally, information seeking refers to  X  X he purposiv e seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal X  (Wilson, 2000), while information handling refers to the physical and mental acts involved in incorporating the information found into the group X  X  existing knowledge base (Wilson, 2000). The study design (Section 2) and future di rections (Section 3) of this research are briefly described in the following sections. Although data from field settings offer potentially rich explanations for the phenomena under study, they are notoriously difficult to secure (Mendon X a, 2008). Additionally, the potential for finding and collecting data from some relatively homogeneous population of emergency even ts is slim indeed. Laboratory settings (including those in which computer agents serve as proxies for human actors) enable a degree of control not available in the fi eld, but must compromise on realism to achieve this control. The decision to employ laboratory settings for this research program was driven by a desire for a more systematic observation of the phenomena under consideration, with the exp ectation that study results and methods would inform the devel opment of field work in the future. In prior work under this research program, a series of computer-based simulations have been de veloped to represent properties of the immediate post-disaster environment (Mendon X a and Hu, 2008). These simulations have been under more or less continuous development for the past ten years (Mendon X a et al., 2006, Mendon X a et al., 2003). They have been developed using historical cases of emergency ev ents, modified in consultation with subject matter experts, and reviewed formally and informally by participants in various studies (Mendon X a et al., 2003). Information on the state of the simulation is presented through a human-computer interface (see Figure 1). The ERO X  X  task in the simulation is to decide which resources to allocate to an incident in order to meet response goals. To do so, they must seek and handle information, both from the simulation and from each other. In Figure 1, the map at the left displays the locations of resources and the incident location ( X  X  X ). Group members obtain inform ation for a site by clicking on its icon. A list of resources av ailable at a selected site is displayed in the lower left. Some information is unique: each member can view only the resources at the sites controlled by the member X  X  service. Other information is common: all members have access to a description of the incident and to information on resources that are not controlled by a particular service. The group coordinator has access to information about all resources. Participants in the pilot studies were emergency managers taking part in training at the U. S National Fire Academy (NFA). Participation in the study was voluntary following presentations made to the emergency managers enrolled in an NFA course in incident management. Each group consists of five roles: one group coordinator (CO), and one representative from each of the following four emergency servi ces: Police Department (PD), Fire Department (FD), Medical Officer (MO) and Chemical Advisor (CA). The data are produced by identifying information seeking events from the log files (an automated procedure) and by identifying information seeking and handling events from transcripts of the conversations (a manual procedur e in which independent coders are provided with instructions for identifying and classifying events of interest). Each seeking or handling event has three attributes: the information item being sought or handled; the member doing the seeking or handling; and the time of the event. The complete dataset is a merger between computer-based log files and conversa tion-based data streams. Research questions pertaining to time constraint and information distribution effects will be addre ssed using the merged data set described previously. We will atte mpt to build statistical models in order to investigate imp acts of time constraint and distribution of information on collaborative information foraging Additionally, we will also undertake analysis of foraging dynamics by developing a small number of event-driven models. In such a model, current event probabilities are conditioned on prior ones, to greater or lesser degrees, whether the events are cognitive, behavior al or social interaction. 1. Box, G. E.
