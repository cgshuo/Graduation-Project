 Document summarization aims to rephrase a doc-ument in a short form called a summary while keeping its  X  X eaning. X  In the present study, we aim to characterize the meaning of a document us-ing embeddings or distributed representations of words in the document, where an embedding of each word is represented as a real valued vector in a Euclidean space that corresponds to the word (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b).
Many previous studies have investigated sum-marization (Lin and Bilmes, 2010; Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Lin and Bilmes, 2012; Sipos et al., 2012; Morita et al., 2013), but to the best of our knowledge, only one (K  X  ageb  X  ack et al., 2014) con-sidered a direct summarization method using em-beddings, where the summarization problem was formalized as maximizing a submodular function defined by the summation of cosine similarities based on sentence embeddings. Essentially, this method assumes linear meanings since the objec-tive function is characterized by the summation of sentence-level similarities. However, this assump-tion is not always valid in real documents, and thus there may be a better combination of two other sentences than the best and second best sentences in terms of similarity in a document.

In this study, we consider a summarization method based on document-level similarity, where we assume the non-linearity of meanings. First, we examine an objective function defined by a co-sine similarity based on document embeddings in-stead of sentence embeddings. Unfortunately, in contrast to our intuition, this similarity is not sub-modular, which we disprove later. Thus, we pro-pose a valid submodular function based on em-bedding distributions , each of which represents a set of word embeddings in a document, as the document-level similarity. Our objective func-tion is calculated based on the nearest neighbors X  distances on embedding distributions, which can be proved to be asymptotically related to KL-divergence in a continuous space. Several stud-ies (Lerman and McDonald, 2009; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) have addressed summariza-tion using KL-divergence, but they calculated KL-divergence based on word distributions in a dis-crete space. In other words, our study is the first attempt to summarize by asymptotically estimat-ing KL-divergence based on embedding distribu-tions in a continuous space. In addition, they in-volved the inference of complex models, whereas our method is quite simple but still powerful. We treat a document as a bag-of-sentences and a sentence as a bag-of-words. Formally, let D be a document, and we refer to an element s  X  D of a sentence and w  X  s of a word. We denote the size of a set S by | S | . Note that D and s are defined as multisets. For example, we can define a document such as D := { s 1 ,s 2 } with s 1 := { just , do , it } and s 2 := { never , say , never } , which cor-respond to two sentences  X  X ust do it X  and  X  X ever say never, X  respectively. From the definition, we have | s 1 | = 3 and | s 2 | = 3 . 2.1 Submodularity Submodularity is a property of set functions, which is similar to the convexity or concavity of continuous functions.
 We formally define submodularity as follows. Definition 1 (Submodularity) . Given a set X , a set function f : 2 X  X  R is called submodular if for any two sets S 1 and S 2 such that S 1  X  S 2  X  X and element x  X  X \ S 2 , f ( S 1  X  X  x } )  X  f ( S 1 )  X  f ( S 2  X  X  x } )  X  f ( S 2
For simplicity, we define f S ( x ) := f ( S  X  { x } )  X  f ( S ) , which is called the marginal value of x with respect to S . A set function f is called monotone if f S ( x )  X  0 for any set S  X  X and element x  X  X \ S .

If a set function f is monotone submodular, we can approximate the optimal solution efficiently by a simple greedy algorithm, which iteratively are broken arbitrarily, and we substitute S i +1 = S i  X  { x  X  } in the i -th iteration beginning with S 0 =  X  . This algorithm is quite simple but it is guaranteed to find a near optimal solution within 1  X  1 / e  X  0 . 63 (Calinescu et al., 2007). 2.2 Embedding An embedding or distributed representation of a word is a real valued vector in an m -dimensional Euclidean space R m , which expresses the  X  X ean-ing X  of the word. We denote an embedding of a word w by ~w  X  R m . If for any two words w 1 and w 2 , the meaning of w 1 is similar to that of w 2 , then ~w 1 is expected to be near to ~w 2 .

A recent study (Mikolov et al., 2013a) showed that a simple log-bilinear model can learn high quality embeddings to obtain a better result than recurrent neural networks, where the concept of embeddings was originally proposed in studies of neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003). In study (K  X  ageb  X  ack et al., 2014). In this study, we focus on a summarization task as sentence selection in a document. The opti-mization framework in our task is the same as in the previous study and formalized in Algorithm 1, where w s represents the pre-defined weight or cost of a sentence s , e.g., sentence length, and r is its scaling factor. This algorithm, called modified greedy, was proposed in (Lin and Bilmes, 2010) and interestingly performed better than the state-of-the-art abstractive approach as shown in (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). Note that we have omitted the notation of D from f for simplicity because D is fixed in an optimization process.

An embedding of a document D is defined as v D := Note that the optimal solution does not change, if we use an average embedding v D / stead of v D . The next theorem shows that a solu-near optimal.
 Proof. A simple counterexample is sufficient to prove the theorem. Let us consider D := { s 1 := { w 1 } , s 2 := { w 2 } , s 3 := { w 3 } , s 4 := { w 4 }} with corresponding vectors ~w 1 := (1 , 1) , ~w 2 := (1 , 2) , ~w 3 := (1 ,  X  1) , and ~w 4 := (1 ,  X  2) , re-spectively. In this case, the document embedding v
D is (4 , 0) . We set C 1 := { s 1 } and C 2 := { s 1 ,s 2 } . Clearly, C 1  X  C 2 . However, we ob-0 . 187 and f Cos f Cos ( { s 1 ,s 2 } )  X  0 . 394 . Therefore, we have Similarity Based on Embedding Distributions We propose a valid submodular objective function observation is that for any two embedding distri-butions A and B , when A is similar to B , each em-bedding in A should be near to some embedding in B . In order to formalize this idea, we define the nearest neighbor of a word w in a summary C as is the Euclidian distance in the embedding space, i.e., d ( ~w,~v ) := k ~w  X  ~v k . We denote the dis-tance of w to its nearest neighbor n := n ( w,C ) by N ( w,C ) := d ( ~w,~n ) . Finally, we define f NN as follows: where g is a non-decreasing scaling function. The function f NN represents the negative value  X   X  of dissimilarity  X  between a document and summary based on embedding distributions. Note that we can use sentence embeddings instead of word em-beddings as embedding distributions, although we focus on word embeddings in this section.

The next theorem shows the monotone submod-ularity of our objective function, which means that be near optimal.
 Proof. (Monotonicity) First, we prove the mono-tonicity. For simplicity, we use the follow-ing two abbreviations: C s := C  X  { s } and P D of sentences and sentence s  X  D \ C , P C s , obviously N ( w,C )  X  N ( w,C s ) holds. decreasing property of g . (Submodularity) Next, we prove the submodu-larity. For any two sets C 1 and C 2 of sentences such that C 1  X  C 2  X  D , and sentence s  X  D \ C 2 , g ( N ( w,C s 1 ))  X  g ( N ( w,C 2 )) + g ( N ( w,C s 2 ))) . Let  X  := g ( N ( w,C 1 ))  X  g ( N ( w,C s 1 ))  X  g ( N ( w,C 2 )) + g ( N ( w,C s 2 )) .

If n ( w,C s 2 )  X  s , then n ( w,C s 1 )  X  s holds, since C s 1  X  C s 2 . This means that N ( w,C s 2 ) = N ( w,C s 1 ) = N ( w, { s } ) . Clearly, N ( w,C 1 )  X  N ( w,C 2 ) , since C 1  X  C 2 . Therefore, we obtain  X   X  0 from the non-decreasing property of g .
If n ( w,C s 2 ) /  X  s and n ( w,C s 1 ) /  X  s , we have N ( w,C s 1 ) = N ( w,C 1 ) and N ( w,C s 2 ) = N ( w,C 2 ) . This indicates that  X  = 0 .

If n ( w,C s 2 ) /  X  s and n ( w,C s 1 )  X  s , so sim-ilarly N ( w,C s 1 )  X  N ( w,C 1 ) and N ( w,C s 2 ) = N ( w,C 2 ) hold. Therefore, we obtain  X   X  0 . for small documents, but the next theorem shows tion of KL-divergence in a continuous space, if g is a logarithmic function. This result implies that we can use mathematical techniques of a contin-uous space for different NLP tasks, by mapping a document into a continuous space based on word embeddings.
 Theorem 3. Suppose that we have a document D and two summaries C 1 and C 2 such that | C 1 | = | C 2 | , which are samples drawn from some proba-bility density functions p , q , and r , i.e., D  X  p , C 1  X  q , and C 2  X  r , respectively. If the scal-ing function g of f NN is a logarithmic function, and f NN ( C 2 ) is asymptotically the same as that of the KL-divergences D i.e., E [ f NN ( C 1 )]  X  E [ f NN ( C 2 )] &gt; 0  X  D r )  X  X  and | C 2 | X  X  X  .
 Proof. Let m be the dimension on embeddings. Using a divergence estimator based on nearest neighbor distances in (P  X  erez-Cruz, 2009; Wang et al., 2009), we can approximate D by b D Therefore, we obtain b D P and only if b D The fact that E [ b D | C 1 |  X   X  and | D |  X   X  concludes the theo-rem. We compared our two proposed methods DocEmb and EmbDist with two state-of-the-art methods SenEmb and TfIdf . The first two methods DocEmb and EmbDist represent Algorithm 1 with an objective function based on the sum of co-sine similarities of tf-idf vectors that correspond to sentences, which was proposed in (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). SenEmb uses a cosine similar-ity measure based on embeddings instead of tf-idf vectors in the same framework as TfIdf , which was proposed in (K  X  ageb  X  ack et al., 2014).
We conducted an experiment with almost the same setting as in the previous study, where they used the Opinosis dataset (Ganesan et al., 2010). This dataset is a collection of user reviews in 51 different topics such as hotels, cars, and products; thus, it is more appropriate for evaluating sum-marization of user-generated content than well-known DUC datasets, which consist of formal news articles. Each topic in the collection com-prises 50 X 575 sentences and includes four and five gold standard summaries created by human au-thors, each of which comprises 1 X 3 sentences.
We ran an optimization process to choose sen-size and weights as ` = 100 and w s = | s | for any sentence s , respectively. As for TfIdf and SenEmb , we set a cluster size of k -means as k = | D | / 5 and chose the best value for a threshold coefficient  X  , trade-off coefficient  X  , and the scal-ing factor r , as in (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). Note that our functions DocEmb and EmbDist have only one parameter r , and we similarly chose the best value of r . Regarding DocEmb , EmbDist , and SenEmb , we used the best embeddings from the CW Vector and W2V Vector for each method, and created document and sentence embeddings by averaging word embeddings with tf-idf weights since it performed better in this experiment. In the case of EmbDist , we used a variant of f NN based ApxOpt 62.22 21.60 8.71 4.56 EmbDist ( ln x ) 56.00 16.70 4.93 1.89 EmbDist ( x ) 55.70 15.73 4.59 1.84 EmbDist ( e x ) 56.29 15.96 4.43 1.39 DocEmb 55.80 13.59 3.23 0.90 SenEmb 53.96 15.42 3.97 1.10 TfIdf 52.97 17.24 5.40 1.49 Table 1: ROUGE-N (R-N) metrics of DocEmb , EmbDist , SenEmb , and TfIdf . on distributions of sentence embeddings. In ad-dition, we examined three scaling functions: log-arithmic, linear, and exponential functions, i.e., ln x , x , e x , respectively.

We calculated the ROUGE-N metric (Lin, ric for summarization methods. ROUGE-N is based on the co-occurrence statistics of N-grams, and especially ROUGE-1 has been shown to have the highest correlation with human summaries (Lin and Hovy, 2003). ROUGE-N is similar to the BLEU metric for machine translation, but ROUGE-N is a recall-based metric while BLEU is a precision-based metric.
 Table 1 shows the results obtained for ROUGE-N (N  X  4 ) using DocEmb , EmbDist , SenEmb , and TfIdf . ApxOpt represents the approxima-tion results of the optimal solution in our prob-lem, where we optimized ROUGE-1 with the gold standard summaries by Algorithm 1. The ob-tained results indicate that our proposed method EmbDist with exponential scaling performed the best for ROUGE-1, which is the best metric in terms of correlation with human summaries. The W2V Vector was the best choice for EmbDist . Furthermore, the other proposed method DocEmb performed better than the state-of-the-art methods SenEmb and TfIdf , although DocEmb is not theoretically guaranteed to obtain a near optimal solution. These results imply that our methods based on the document-level similarity can capture more complex meanings than the sentence-level similarity. On the other hand, TfIdf with tf-idf vectors performed the worst for ROUGE-1. A pos-sible reason is that a wide variety of expressions by users made it difficult to calculate similarities. This also suggests that embedding-based methods naturally have robustness for user-generated con-tent.

In the case of N  X  2 , TfIdf performed the best for ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-3, while EmbDist with logarithmic scaling is better than TfIdf for ROUGE-4. According to (Lin and Hovy, 2003), the higher order ROUGE-N is worse than ROUGE-1 since it tends to score grammatical-ity rather than content. Conversely, Rankel et al. (2013) reports that there is a dataset where the higher order ROUGE-N is correlated with human summaries well. We may need to conduct human judgments to decide which metric is the best in this dataset for more accurate comparison. How-ever, it is still important that our simple objective functions can obtain good results competing with the state-of-the-art methods. In this study, we proposed simple but power-ful summarization methods using the document-level similarity based on embeddings, or dis-tributed representations of words. Our experimen-tal results demonstrated that the proposed meth-ods performed better than the existing state-of-the-art methods based on the sentence-level similar-ity. This implies that the document-level similar-ity can capture more complex meanings than the sentence-level similarity.

Recently, Kusner et al. (2015) independently discovered a similar definition to our objective constructed a dissimilarity measure based on a framework using Earth Mover X  X  Distance (EMD) developed in the image processing field (Rubner et al., 1998; Rubner et al., 2000). EMD is a con-sistent measure of distance between two distribu-tions of points. Interestingly, their heuristic lower linear scaling function, i.e., g ( x ) = x . Moreover, they showed that this bound appears to be tight in real datasets. This suggests that our intuitive framework can theoretically connect the two well-known measures, KL-divergence and EMD, based on the scaling of distance. Note that, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no known study that considers such a theoretical relationship.
In future research, we will explore other scal-ing functions suitable for our problem or different problems. A promising direction is to consider a relative scaling function to extract a biased sum-mary of a document. This direction should be use-ful for query-focused summarization tasks.
