 Distributional methods for semantics approximate the meaning of linguistic expressions with vectors that summarize the contexts in which they occur in large samples of text. This has been a very suc-cessful approach to lexical semantics (Erk, 2012), where semantic relatedness is assessed by compar-ing vectors. Recently these methods have been extended to phrases and sentences by means of composition operations (see Baroni (2013) for an overview). For example, given the vectors repre-senting red and car , composition derives a vector that approximates the meaning of red car .

However, the link between language and mean-ing is, obviously, bidirectional: As message recip-ients we are exposed to a linguistic expression and we must compute its meaning (the synthesis prob-lem). As message producers we start from the meaning we want to communicate (a  X  X hought X ) and we must encode it into a word sequence (the generation problem). If distributional semantics is to be considered a proper semantic theory, then it must deal not only with synthesis (going from words to vectors), but also with generation (from vectors to words).

Besides these theoretical considerations, phrase generation from vectors has many useful applica-tions. We can, for example, synthesize the vector representing the meaning of a phrase or sentence, and then generate alternative phrases or sentences from this vector to accomplish true paraphrase generation (as opposed to paraphrase detection or ranking of candidate paraphrases).

Generation can be even more useful when the source vector comes from another modality or lan-guage. Recent work on grounding language in vi-sion shows that it is possible to represent images and linguistic expressions in a common vector-based semantic space (Frome et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013). Given a vector representing an im-age, generation can be used to productively con-struct phrases or sentences that describe the im-age (as opposed to simply retrieving an existing description from a set of candidates). Translation is another potential application of the generation framework: Given a semantic space shared be-tween two or more languages, one can compose a word sequence in one language and generate trans-lations in another, with the shared semantic vector space functioning as interlingua.

Distributional semantics assumes a lexicon of atomic expressions (that, for simplicity, we take to be words ), each associated to a vector. Thus, at the single-word level, the problem of genera-tion is solved by a trivial generation-by-synthesis approach: Given an arbitrary target vector,  X  X ener-ate X  the corresponding word by searching through the lexicon for the word with the closest vector to the target. This is however unfeasible for larger expressions: Given n vocabulary elements, this approach requires checking n k phrases of length k . This becomes prohibitive already for relatively short phrases, as reasonably-sized vocabularies do not go below tens of thousands of words. The search space for 3-word phrases in a 10K-word vocabulary is already in the order of trillions. In this paper, we introduce a more direct approach to phrase generation, inspired by the work in com-positional distributional semantics. In short, we revert the composition process and we propose a framework of data-induced, syntax-dependent functions that decompose a single vector into a vector sequence. The generated vectors can then be efficiently matched against those in the lexicon or fed to the decomposition system again to pro-duce longer phrases recursively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly and systematically pursue the generation problem in distributional semantics. Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) use top-level, composed dis-tributed representations of sentences to guide gen-eration in a machine translation setting. More pre-cisely, they condition the target language model on the composed representation (addition of word vectors) of the source language sentence.

Andreas and Ghahramani (2013) discuss the the issue of generating language from vectors and present a probabilistic generative model for distri-butional vectors. However, their emphasis is on reversing the generative story in order to derive composed meaning representations from word se-quences. The theoretical generating capabilities of the methods they propose are briefly exemplified, but not fully explored or tested.

Socher et al. (2011) come closest to our target problem. They introduce a bidirectional language-to-meaning model for compositional distributional semantics that is similar in spirit to ours. How-ever, we present a clearer decoupling of synthesis and generation and we use different (and simpler) training methods and objective functions. More-over, Socher and colleagues do not train separate decomposition rules for different syntactic config-urations, so it is not clear how they would be able to control the generation of different output struc-tures. Finally, the potential for generation is only addressed in passing, by presenting a few cases where the generated sequence has the same syn-tactic structure of the input sequence. We start by presenting the familiar synthesis set-ting, focusing on two-word phrases. We then in-troduce generation for the same structures. Fi-nally, we show how synthesis and generation of longer phrases is handled by recursive extension of the two-word case. We assume a lexicon L , that is, a bi-directional look-up table containing a list of words L w linked to a matrix L v of vectors. Both synthesis and generation involve a trivial lex-icon look-up step to retrieve vectors associated to words and vice versa : We ignore it in the exposi-tion below. 3.1 Synthesis To construct the vector representing a two-word phrase, we must compose the vectors associated to the input words. More formally, similarly to Mitchell and Lapata (2008), we define a syntax-dependent composition function yielding a phrase vector ~p : where ~u and ~v are the vector representations asso-ciated to words u and v . f comp (for d the dimensionality of vectors) is a compo-sition function specific to the syntactic relation R
Although we are not bound to a specific com-position model, throughout this paper we use the method proposed by Guevara (2010) and Zanzotto et al. (2010) which defines composition as appli-cation of linear transformations to the two con-stituents followed by summing the resulting vec-use the following equivalent formulation: where W R  X  R d  X  2 d and [ ~u ; ~v ] is the vertical con-catenation of the two vectors (using Matlab no-tation). Following Guevara, we learn W R using examples of word and phrase vectors directly ex-tracted from the corpus (for the rest of the pa-per, we refer to these phrase vectors extracted non-compositionally from the corpus as observed vectors). To estimate, for example, the weights in the W AN (adjective-noun) matrix, we use the corpus-extracted vectors of the words in tuples such as  X  red, car, red.car  X  ,  X  evil, cat, evil.cat  X  , etc. Given a set of training examples stacked into matrices U , V (the constituent vectors) and P (the corresponding observed vectors), we estimate W R by solving the least-squares regression problem:
We use the approximation of observed phrase vectors as objective because these vectors can pro-vide direct evidence of the polysemous behaviour of words: For example, the corpus-observed vec-tors of green jacket and green politician reflect how the meaning of green is affected by its occur-rence with different nouns. Moreover, it has been shown that for two-word phrases, despite their relatively low frequency, such corpus-observed representations are still difficult to outperform in phrase similarity tasks (Dinu et al., 2013; Turney, 2012). 3.2 Generation Generation of a two-word sequence from a vec-tor proceeds in two steps: decomposition of the phrase vectors into two constituent vectors, and search for the nearest neighbours of each con-stituent vector in L v (the lexical matrix) in order to retrieve the corresponding words from L w . Decomposition We define a syntax-dependent decomposition function: where ~p is a phrase vector, ~u and ~v are vectors as-sociated to words standing in the syntactic relation
We assume that decomposition is also a linear put phrase vector, returns two constituent vectors: Again, we can learn from corpus-observed vectors associated to tuples of word pairs and the corre-sponding phrases by solving: If a composition function f comp alternative is to learn a function that can best revert this composition. The decomposition function is then trained as follows: where the matrix W R is a given composition function for the same relation R . Training with observed phrases, as in eq. (2), should be better at capturing the idiosyncrasies of the actual dis-tribution of phrases in the corpus and it is more robust by being independent from the availability and quality of composition functions. On the other hand, if the goal is to revert as faithfully as possi-ble the composition process and retrieve the orig-inal constituents (e.g., in a different modality or a different language), then the objective in eq. (3) is more motivated.
 Nearest neighbour search We retrieve the near-est neighbours of each constituent vector ~u ob-tained by decomposition by applying a search function s : where NN ~u is a list containing the t nearest neighours of ~u from L v , the lexical vectors. De-pending on the task, t might be set to 1 to retrieve just one word sequence, or to larger values to re-trieve t alternatives. The similarity measure used to determine the nearest neighbours is another pa-rameter of the search function; we omit it here as we only experiment with the standard cosine mea-3.3 Recursive (de)composition Extension to longer sequences is straightforward if we assume binary tree representations as syn-tactic structures. In synthesis, the top-level vector can be obtained by applying composi-tion functions recursively. For example, the vector of big red car would be obtained as: f is the composition function for adjective-noun phrase combinations. Conversely, for generation, we decompose the phrase vector with f decomp The first vector is used for retrieving the nearest adjective from the lexicon, while the second vec-tor is further decomposed.

In the experiments in this paper we assume that the syntactic structure is given. In Section 7, we discuss ways to eliminate this assumption. In our empirical part, we focus on noun phrase generation. A noun phrase can be a single noun or a noun with one or more modifiers, where a mod-ifier can be an adjective or a prepositional phrase. A prepositional phrase is in turn composed of a preposition and a noun phrase. We learn two com-position (and corresponding decomposition) func-tions: one for modifier-noun phrases, trained on adjective-noun (AN) pairs, and a second one for prepositional phrases, trained on preposition-noun (PN) combinations. For the rest of this section we describe the construction of the vector spaces and the (de)composition function learning procedure. Construction of vector spaces We test two types of vector representations. The cbow model introduced in Mikolov et al. (2013a) learns vec-tor representations using a neural network archi-tecture by trying to predict a target word given the words surrounding it. We use the word2vec soft-text window of 5 words to either side of the target. We set the sub-sampling option to 1e-05 and esti-mate the probability of a target word with the neg-ative sampling method, drawing 10 samples from the noise distribution (see Mikolov et al. (2013a) for details). We also implement a standard count -based bag-of-words distributional space (Turney and Pantel, 2010) which counts occurrences of a target word with other words within a symmetric window of size 5. We build a 300Kx300K sym-metric co-occurrence matrix using the top most frequent words in our source corpus, apply posi-tive PMI weighting and Singular Value Decompo-sition to reduce the space to 300 dimensions. For both spaces, the vectors are finally normalized to
For both types of vectors we use 2.8 billion to-kens as input (ukWaC + Wikipedia + BNC). The Italian language vectors for the cross-lingual ex-periments of Section 6 were trained on 1.6 bil-form + POS-tag string. We extract both word vec-tors and the observed phrase vectors which are required for the training procedures. We sanity-check the two spaces on MEN (Bruni et al., 2012), a 3,000 items word similarity data set. cbow sig-nificantly outperforms count (0.80 vs. 0.72 Spear-man correlations with human judgments). count performance is consistent with previously reported (De)composition function training The train-ing data sets consist of the 50K most frequent  X  u, v, p  X  tuples for each phrase type, for example,  X  red, car, red.car  X  or  X  in, car, in.car  X  . 7 We con-catenate ~u and ~v vectors to obtain the [ U ; V ] ma-trix and we use the observed ~p vectors (e.g., the corpus vector of the red.car bigram) to obtain the phrase matrix P . We use these data sets to solve the least squares regression problems in eqs. (1) and (2), obtaining estimates of the composition and decomposition matrices, respectively. For the decomposition function in eq. (3), we replace the observed phrase vectors with those composed with f comp R ( ~u, ~v ) , where f comp R is the previously esti-mated composition function for relation R . Composition function performance Since the experiments below also use composed vectors as input to the generation process, it is important to provide independent evidence that the composi-tion model is of high quality. This is indeed the case: We tested our composition approach on the task of retrieving observed AN and PN vectors, based on their composed vectors (similarly to Ba-roni and Zamparelli (2010), we want to retrieve the observed red.car vector using f comp We obtain excellent results, with minimum accu-racy of 0.23 (chance level &lt; 0.0001). We also test on the AN-N paraphrasing test set used in Dinu et al. (2013) (in turn adapting Turney (2012)). The dataset contains 620 ANs, each paired with a single-noun paraphrase (e.g., false belief/fallacy , personal appeal/charisma ). The task is to rank all nouns in the lexicon by their similarity to the phrase, and return the rank of the correct para-phrase. Results are reported in the first row of Ta-ble 1. To facilitate comparison, we search, like Dinu et al., through a vocabulary containing the 20K most frequent nouns. The count vectors re-sults are similar to those reported by Dinu and col-leagues for the same model, and with cbow vec-Table 1: Median rank on the AN-N set of Dinu et al. (2013) (e.g., personal appeal / charisma ). First row: the A and N are composed and the closest N is returned as a paraphrase. Second row: the N vector is decomposed into A and N vectors and their nearest (POS-tag consistent) neighbours are returned. tors we obtain a median rank that is considerably higher than that of the methods they test. 5.1 One-step decomposition We start with testing one-step decomposition by generating two-word phrases. A first straightfor-ward evaluation consists in decomposing a phrase vector into the correct constituent words. For this purpose, we randomly select (and consequently re-move) from the training sets 200 phrases of each type (AN and PN) and apply decomposition op-erations to 1) their corpus-observed vectors and 2) their composed representations. We generate two words by returning the nearest neighbours (with appropriate POS tags) of the two vectors produced by the decomposition functions. Ta-ble 2 reports generation accuracy, i.e., the pro-portion of times in which we retrieved the cor-rect constituents. The search space consists of the top most frequent 20K nouns, 20K adjec-tives and 25 prepositions respectively, leading to chance accuracy &lt; 0.0001 for nouns and adjectives and &lt; 0.05 for prepositions. We obtain relatively high accuracy, with cbow vectors consistently out-performing count ones. Decomposing composed rather than observed phrase representations is eas-ier, which is to be expected given that composed representations are obtained with a simpler, lin-ear model. Most of the errors consist in generat-ing synonyms ( hard case  X  difficult case , true cost  X  actual cost ) or related phrases ( stereo speak-ers  X  omni-directional sound ).

Next, we use the AN-N dataset of Dinu and colleagues for a more interesting evaluation of one-step decomposition. In particular, we reverse the original paraphrasing direction by attempting to generate, for example, personal charm from charisma . It is worth stressing the nature of the Table 2: Accuracy of generation models at re-trieving (at rank 1) the constituent words of adjective-noun (AN) and preposition-noun (PN) phrases. Observed ( A.N ) and composed repre-sentations ( A  X  N ) are decomposed with observed-(eq. 2) and composed-trained (eq. 3) functions re-spectively. paraphrase-by-generation task we tackle here and in the next experiments. Compositional distri-butional semantic systems are often evaluated on phrase and sentence paraphrasing data sets (Bla-coe and Lapata, 2012; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Socher et al., 2011; Turney, 2012). However, these experiments assume a pre-compiled list of candidate paraphrases, and the task is to rank correct paraphrases above foils (paraphrase rank-ing) or to decide, for a given pair, if the two phrases/sentences are mutual paraphrases (para-phrase detection). Here, instead, we do not as-sume a given set of candidates: For example, in N  X  AN paraphrasing, any of 20K 2 possible com-binations of adjectives and nouns from the lexicon could be generated. This is a much more challeng-ing task and it paves the way to more realistic ap-plications of distributional semantics in generation scenarios.
 The median ranks of the gold A and N of the Dinu set are shown in the second row of Table 1. As the top-generated noun is almost always, uninterestingly, the input one, we return the next noun. Here we report results for the more moti-vated corpus-observed training of eq. (2) (unsur-prisingly, using composed-phrase training for the task of decomposing single nouns leads to lower performance).

Although considerably more difficult than the previous task, the results are still very good, with median ranks under 100 for the cbow vectors (ran-dom median rank at 10K). Also, the dataset pro-vides only one AN paraphrase for each noun, out of many acceptable ones. Examples of generated phrases are given in Table 3. In addition to gen-erating topically related ANs, we also see nouns disambiguated in different ways than intended in
Input Output Gold Table 3: Examples of generating ANs from Ns us-ing the data set of Dinu et al. (2013). the gold standard (for example vitriol and folk in Table 3). Other interesting errors consist of de-composing a noun into two words which both have the same meaning as the noun, generating for ex-ample religion  X  religious religions . We observe moreover that sometimes the decomposition re-flects selectional preference effects, by generat-ing adjectives that denote typical properties of the noun to be paraphrased (e.g., animosity is a (po-litical, personal,...) hostility or a fridge is a (big, large, small,...) refrigerator ). This effect could be exploited for tasks such as property-based concept description (Kelly et al., 2012). 5.2 Recursive decomposition We continue by testing generation through recur-sive decomposition on the task of generating noun-preposition-noun (NPN) paraphrases of adjective-nouns (AN) phrases. We introduce a dataset con-taining 192 AN-NPN pairs (such as pre-election promises  X  promises before election ), which was created by the second author and additionally cor-rected by an English native speaker. The data set was created by analyzing a list of randomly se-lected frequent ANs. 49 further ANs (with adjec-tives such as amazing and great ) were judged not NPN-paraphrasable and were used for the experi-ment reported in Section 7. The paraphrased sub-set focuses on preposition diversity and on includ-ing prepositions which are rich in semantic content and relevant to paraphrasing the AN. This has led to excluding of , which in most cases has the purely syntactic function of connecting the two nouns. The data set contains the following 14 preposi-tions: after, against, at, before, between, by, for,
NPN phrase generation involves the applica-tion of two decomposition functions. In the first step we decompose using the modifier-noun rule ( f decomp AN ). We generate a noun from the head slot vector and the  X  X djective X  vector is further de-composed using f decomp which is not identical to the previously generated one). The results, in terms of top 1 accuracy and median rank, are shown in Table 4. Examples are given in Table 5.

For observed phrase vector training, accuracy and rank are well above chance for all constituents (random accuracy 0.00005 for nouns and 0.04 for prepositions, corresponding median ranks: 10K, 12). Preposition generation is clearly a more diffi-cult task. This is due at least in part to their highly ambiguous and broad semantics, and the way in which they interact with the nouns. For exam-ple, cable through ocean in Table 5 is a reason-able paraphrase of undersea cable despite the gold preposition being under . Other than several cases which are acceptable paraphrases but not in the gold standard, phrases related in meaning but not synonymous are the most common error ( overcast skies  X  skies in sunshine ). We also observe that often the A and N meanings are not fully separated when decomposing and  X  X races X  of the adjective or of the original noun meaning can be found in both generated nouns (for example nearby school  X  schools after school ). To a lesser degree, this might be desirable as a disambiguation-in-context effect as, for example, in underground cavern , in secret would not be a context-appropriate para-phrase of underground . This section describes preliminary experiments performed in a cross-lingual setting on the task of composing English AN phrases and generating Italian translations.
 Creation of cross-lingual vector spaces A common semantic space is required in order to map words and phrases across languages. This problem has been extensively addressed in the bilingual lexicon acquisition literature (Haghighi et al., 2008; Koehn and Knight, 2002). We opt for a very simple yet accurate method (Klementiev et al., 2012; Rapp, 1999) in which a bilingual dictio-nary is used to identify a set of shared dimensions across spaces and the vectors of both languages are projected into the subspace defined by these (Sub-space Projection -SP). This method is applicable to count -type vector spaces, for which the dimen-phrase representations.
 sions correspond to actual words. As the cbow di-mensions do not correspond to words, we align the cbow spaces by using a small dictionary to learn a linear map which transforms the English vectors into Italian ones as done in Mikolov et al. (2013b). This method (Translation Matrix -TM) is applica-ble to both cbow and count spaces. We tune the pa-rameters (TM or SP for count and dictionary size 5K or 25K for both spaces) on a standard task of translating English words into Italian. We obtain TM-5K for cbow and SP-25K for count as opti-mal settings. The two methods perform similarly for low frequency words while cbow -TM-5K sig-nificantly outperforms count -SP-25K for high fre-quency words. Our results for the cbow -TM-5K setting are similar to those reported by Mikolov et al. (2013b).
 Cross-lingual decomposition training Train-ing proceeds as in the monolingual case, this time concatenating the training data sets and estimating a single (de)-composition function for the two lan-guages in the shared semantic space. We train both on observed phrase representations (eq. 2) and on composed phrase representations (eq. 3).
 Adjective-noun translation dataset We ran-domly extract 1,000 AN-AN En-It phrase pairs from a phrase table built from parallel movie sub-titles, available at http://opus.lingfil. uu.se/ (OpenSubtitles2012, en-it) (Tiedemann, 2012).
 A  X  N (En) A,N (It) 0.31,0.59 0.24,0.54 A  X  N (It) A,N (En) 0.50,0.62 0.28,0.48 Table 6: Accuracy of En  X  It and It  X  En phrase translation: phrases are composed in source lan-guage and decomposed in target language. Train-ing on composed phrase representations (eq. (3)) (with observed phrase training (eq. 2) results are  X  50% lower).

Results are presented in Table 6. While in these preliminary experiments we lack a proper term of comparison, the performance is very good both quantitatively (random &lt; 0 . 0001 ) and quali-tatively. The En  X  It examples in Table 7 are repre-sentative. In many cases (e.g., vicious killer , rough neighborhood ) we generate translations that are arguably more natural than those in the gold stan-dard. Again, some differences can be explained by different disambiguations ( chest as breast , as in the generated translation, or box , as in the gold). Translation into related but not equivalent phrases and generating the same meaning in both con-stituents ( stellar star ) are again the most signifi-cant errors. We also see cases in which this has the desired effect of disambiguating the constituents, such as in the examples in Table 8, showing the nearest neighbours when translating black tie and indissoluble tie . Table 8: Top 3 translations of black tie and indis-soluble tie , showing correct disambiguation of tie . In Section 3.2 we have defined a search function s returning a list of lexical nearest neighbours for a constituent vector produced by decomposition. Together with the neighbours, this function can naturally return their similarity score (in our case, the cosine). We call the score associated to the top neighbour the generation confidence : if this score is low, the vector has no good match in the lexicon. We observe significant Spearman cor-relations between the generation confidence of a constituent and its quality (e.g., accuracy, inverse rank) in all the experiments. For example, for the AN(En)  X  AN(It) experiment, the correlations be-tween the confidence scores and the inverse ranks for As and Ns, for both cbow and count vectors, range between 0.34 ( p &lt; 1 e  X  28 ) and 0.42. In the translation experiments, we can use this to au-tomatically determine a subset on which we can translate with very high accuracy. Table 9 shows AN-AN accuracies and coverage when translating only if confidence is above a certain threshold.
Throughout this paper we have assumed that the syntactic structure of the phrase to be generated is given. In future work we will exploit the corre-lation between confidence and quality for the pur-pose of eliminating this assumption. As a concrete example, we can use confidence scores to distin-guish the two subsets of the AN-NPN dataset in-troduced in Section 5: the ANs which are para-phrasable with an NPN from those that do not

We assign an AN to the NPN-paraphrasable class if the mean confidence of the PN expansion in its attempted N(PN) decomposi-tion is above a certain threshold. We plot the ROC curve in Figure 1. We obtain a significant AUC of 0.71. In this paper we have outlined a framework for the task of generation with distributional semantic models. We proposed a simple but effective ap-proach to reverting the composition process to ob-tain meaningful reformulations of phrases through a synthesis-generation process.

For future work we would like to experiment with more complex models for (de-)composition in order to improve the performance on the tasks we used in this paper. Following this, we would like to extend the framework to handle arbitrary phrases, including making (confidence-based) choices on the syntactic structure of the phrase to be generated, which we have assumed to be given throughout this paper.

In terms of applications, we believe that the line of research in machine translation that is currently focusing on replacing parallel resources with large amounts of monolingual text provides an inter-esting setup to test our methods. For example, Klementiev et al. (2012) reconstruct phrase ta-bles based on phrase similarity scores in seman-tic space. However, they resort to scoring phrase pairs extracted from an aligned parallel corpus, as they do not have a method to freely generate these. Similarly, in the recent work on common vector spaces for the representation of images and text, the current emphasis is on retrieving existing cap-tions (Socher et al., 2014) and not actual genera-tion of image descriptions.

From a more theoretical point of view, our work fills an important gap in distributional semantics, making it a bidirectional theory of the connec-tion between language and meaning. We can now translate linguistic strings into vector  X  X houghts X , and the latter into their most appropriate linguis-tic expression. Several neuroscientific studies sug-gest that thoughts are represented in the brain by patterns of activation over broad neural areas, and vectors are a natural way to encode such patterns (Haxby et al., 2001; Huth et al., 2012). Some research has already established a connection be-tween neural and distributional semantic vector spaces (Mitchell et al., 2008; Murphy et al., 2012). Generation might be the missing link to power-ful computational models that take the neural foot-print of a thought as input and produce its linguis-tic expression.
