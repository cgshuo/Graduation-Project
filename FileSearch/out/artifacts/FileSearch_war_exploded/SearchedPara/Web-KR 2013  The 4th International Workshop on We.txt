 As a continuous effort for organizing discussions and providin g possible theories and techniques to deal with the barriers for knowledge processing at Web scale, the 2013 International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval and Reasoning (Web-KR 2013) was held in conjunction with the 2013 ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2013) on November 1st, 2013 at Burlingame, CA, United States. This is the 4th version of the Web-KR workshop. As in previous workshops under the same title, accepted papers of this workshop cover many important topics in the field. This year, the contributions focus on multi-faceted understanding of Web knowledge sources, Web entity linking, deep Web knowledge acquisition, and Web-scale stream reasoning. Many new approaches are proposed to deal with these problems in the context of large scale Web resources. This summary introduces the major contributions of accepted papers in the Web-KR 2013 workshop.

In order to discuss current and future challenges and provide possible theories, methods, and techniques for Web-scale knowledge processing, the workshop series titled  X  X eb-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, and Reasoning (Web-KR) X  and serves as one of the major contributions of the proposed approach. Unlike many semantic knowledge bases such as DBPedia, YAGO, and OpenCYC which provide downloadable files (e.g. RDF dumps) [1, 4, 6], many of the declarative knowledge resources (such as facts about a book, e.g. author names, price, publisher, etc.) are implicitly stored in databases, and deep Web crawling is required to obtain them. The whole deep Web is huge, and it is not possible to have complete and most updated knowledge bases containing all the facts from the deep Web. For some application driven knowledge bases, it is more practical to obtain facts from the deep Web according to user needs and the selection strategies based on the quality of different resources. In [10], the author proposed a hybrid template-driven approach for obtaining factual knowledge from deep Web, which serves as a  X  X iddle-ground X  solution that combines the advantages of the traditional virtual and surfacing approaches. This effort can be considered as step forward user-driven deep Web knowledge acquisition and is better-positioned to handle the vast volume of deep Web resources. 
In many Web based scenarios, when data bearing timestamps is continually received (e.g. microblog posts, video streaming data from sensors, etc.), it is impossible to keep the entire data source for a long time. In recent years, reasoning over streaming data was proposed and has attracted much attention in the fields of Web reasoning [9]. In [2], the authors provided a survey of five types of windowing mechanisms for Web scale stream reasoning, and highlighted some of the major challenges in this field. We would like to thank all Program Committee Members for their continuous support on the Web-KR workshops over the four years. For Web-KR 2013, the PC members are Frank Van Harmelen (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Guilin Qi (South East University, China), Veli Bicer (IBM Ireland Research Lab, Ireland), Edy Portmann (UC Berkeley, USA), Wei Hu (Nanjing University, China), Alexey Cheptsov (High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart, Germany), Zhichun Wang (Beijing Normal University, China), Christophe Gueret (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Gong Cheng (Nanjing University, China), Ioan Toma (University of Innsbruck, Austria), Jun Fang (Norwestern Polytechnical University, China), and Dongsheng Wang (Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). We would also like to thank the ACM CIKM 2013 conference organizers for providing an excellent venue, with researchers and practitioners from various backgrounds, ranging from Information Retrieval and Databases, to Knowledge Management, to discuss research topics and contributed efforts related to knowledge representation, retrieval and reasoning at web scale.
