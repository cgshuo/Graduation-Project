 In this paper, we present a Bayesian decision theory-based trust model that combines agent) wants to find an appropriate service provider ( provider agent) on the Semantic Web, and his problem is which provider may be the most suitable for him. Assuming exchanging information about their opinions. We call it reputation of a given provider experience from history interactions with the provider agents. And then, the trust can be generated by incorporating prior and reputation information. communicating or dealing with other agents and the trust model should balance these costs and benefits. Following [K. O'Hara et at., 2004], The costs and utility associated with trust evaluating include the following. 
Operational Cost. Operational costs are the expenses of computing trust value. In Therefore, the more complex the algorithm is the higher the cost is expected to be. making better decision via further investigation. fee that incurred when an agent asks for the opinions from the consultant agents, the other is Final service charge that will be paid to the selected provider agent. necessary to assign numbers indicating how much something is valued. Such numbers used to estimate possible consequences of the decisions. 2.1 Closed Trust Model and Bayesian Decision Theory decision. Supposing that  X  (  X  | x ) is the posterior distribution of provider agent B , the expected utility of function U A ( r ) over  X  (  X  | x ), denoted E  X  (  X  | x ) [ U A ( r )], is possible gain of consequence of selecting B . If there are several provider agents can be considered, we simply select one that will result in the most expected utility. 
By treating an agent as a node, the "knows" relationship as an edge, a directed graph emerges. To facilitate the 
Decisions are more commonly called actions and the set of all possible actions under consideration will be denoted A . In our example, agent A is trying to decide whether to select agent B (action b ) or C (action c ) as business partner ( A = { b , c }). Service charges of B and C are 400 and 450 units respectively ( SC B = 400, SC
C = 450). We will treat quality of service,  X  , as a discrete variable, and  X  affects the decision process is commonly called the state of nature . In making decision it is clearly important to consider what the possible states of nature are. {good, average, bad} represents three levels of service quality. See Figure 1, a notion agents represents reliability factor, that between consultant and provider agents is the  X  willing to pay. 
We take the assessments of B' s quality from consultant agents as sample about  X  B , and in order to answer the question of which sample information should be used with higher priority we propose following order rules. (1) The sample from the agent with shorter referral distance should be used first; (2) If the samples come from the agents that have the same referral distance, which with larger reliability factor is prior to that with smaller one. 
Note that  X  and X have joint (subjective) density and that X has marginal (unconditional) density it is clear that (providing m ( x )  X  0) information. Firstly, we use the sample information from D through the path A  X  considered when calculating this posterior distribution. We used following formula to distribution after rectification respectively, and R is reliability factor. and 3. We employ multiplying to merge two or more than two reliability factors. For will produce more utility. Expected utility of B and C are Utility of B Utility of C appropriate than B in the eyes of A . 2.2 Open Trust Model and Bayesian Sequential Analysis idea is that at every stage of the procedure (after every given observation) one should compare the (posterior) utility of making an immediate decision with the "expected" (preprosterior) utility that will be obtained if more observations are taken. If it is cheaper to stop and make a decision, that is what should be done. To clarify this idea, we transform Figure 1 to the structure of tree, shown in Figure 2. The goal of preposterior analysis is to choose the way of investigation which minimizes overall cost. This overall cost consists of the decision loss (including opportunity quantities are in opposition to each other and we will be concerned with the balancing of these two costs in this section. shown in Figure 2, we begin at the stage 1 when A only holds the prior information of extending the tree of Figure 2 down to the next layer. that initiator agent can estimate the cost of consultant services at the next stage more exactly in real situation. 
The utility of an immediate decision is the larger of and 84 450 100 33 . 0 600 34 . 0 900 33 . 0 )] ( [ ) ( =  X   X  +  X  +  X  =  X  Hence the utility of an immediate decision is 190. If the request messages is sent and of B (because 84 )] ( [ ) ( =  X  not making immediate decision (opportunity cost) is: max {404.15,84} X 0.24+ max {225.55,84} X 0.47+ max { X 44.88,84} X 0.29  X  4 = 223.36 should stop investigating and select C as a decision. The semantic web is full of heterogeneous, dynamic and uncertain. If it is to succeed, opportunity and service charges incurred during trust evaluating have been considered approach enables an user to combine a variety of sources of information to cope with the inherent uncertainties on Semantic Web and each user receives a personalized set of trusts, which may vary widely from person to person.
