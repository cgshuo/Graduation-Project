 E-discovery is the requirement that the documents and in-formation in electronic form stored in corporate systems be produced as evidence in litigation. It has posed great chal-lenges for legal experts. Legal searchers have always looked to find  X  X ny and all X  evidence for a given case. Thus, a le-gal search system would essentially be a recall-oriented sys-tem. It has been a common practice among expert searchers to formulate Boolean queries to represent their information need. We want to work on three basic problems: 1. Boolean query formulation -Our primary goal is to 2. Data fusion -We would also like to explore the effec-3. Error modeling -Finally, we will work on error mod-Boolean query formulation
The Boolean queries have traditionally been created man-ually and on a trial-and-error basis. It can be useful for the lawyers if some system can automatically generate Boolean query suggestions from specific information needs. Perhaps the most relevant work in this line is by Kim et al. [2], but it was done for patent retrieval and the medical domain. No such work has been report ed on the legal domain. We believe, therefore, that it is worthwhile to investigate this problem on legal data. The TREC Legal dataset can be used for this purpose.

To start with, our aim is to form an ideal Boolean query , i.e., the query that retrieves all and only the relevant docu-ments for the given information need. This will be created from the available set of relevance judgements. Any auto-matically generated Boolean query can be compared with the ideal query which will act as the upper limit of the per-formance achievable by any Boolean query. One approach to preparing an ideal query can be to choose the top k terms in each relevant document based on tf*idf values. The ideal Boolean query may be difficult to achieve in practice. In suchacase,wewilltrytoforma pseudo ideal query which will retrieve all relevant documents and at the same time, minimize the number of non-relevant documents in the re-sult set.
 An E-discovery topic is different from conventional TREC Ad Hoc topics, so using them straightaway in retrieval pro-duces poor baseline results. Therefore, we plan to generate the baseline run using sample relevant assessments. There-after, our endeavor will be to select terms on the basis of the baseline run using the traditional query expansion tech-niques[1] and try to impose a Boolean structure on these terms based on relations among them.
 Data fusion
We look to combine the goodness of runs based on the estimated values of different evaluation measures in improv-ing recall. The values of the evaluation measures are based on a small fraction of the relevant information. We will try to devise an algorithm which will enable us to choose the candidate runs whose fusion will lead to an improvement in recall. We will test our method on the TREC Legal Ad Hoc datasets.
 Error modeling
OCR error modeling is crucial while performing retrieval from noisy OCRed legal documents. So, we will try out new error modeling techniques on such data.
