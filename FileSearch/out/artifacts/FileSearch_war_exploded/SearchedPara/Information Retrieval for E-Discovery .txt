 Discovery, the process under which parties to legal cases must reveal documents relevant to the disputed issues is a core aspect of trials in the United States, and a lesser but important factor in other countries. Discovery on documents stored in computerized systems (known vari ously as electronic discovery, e-discovery, e-disco, EDD, and ED) is increasingly the major factor in discovery, and has become a multi-billion dollar industry. the materials involved, and th e economics of identifying and reviewing potentially responsive ma terial. I will then focus on three major IR areas of interest: search, supervised machine learning (including text classifi cation and relevance feedback), and interface support for manual relevance assessment. For each, I will discuss technologies currently used in e-discovery, the evaluation methods applicable to measuring effectiveness, and existing research results not yet seeing commercial practice. I will also outline research directi ons that, if successfully pursued, would potentially be of great interest in e-discovery applications. A particular focus will be on areas where researchers can make progress without access to operati onal e-discovery environments or "realistic" test collections. C onnections will be drawn with the use of IR in related tasks, such as enterprise search, criminal investigations, intelligence analysis , historical research, truth and reconciliation commissions, and freedom of information (open records or sunshine law) requests.
