 With the tremendous success of social networking websites nowadays, diverse social network services have been vigorous and much popular. Although many services related to social network websites exist, it is important to set up a stan-dard which helps users to make a deci sion if it is worthy of them. In recent years, many recommendation systems have been proposed to integrate with so-cial networking websites and been used in many different business applications such as movies, music, books, news, etc. Some popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon, eBay, and Netflix analyze the shopping behavior of users to build the recommendation list of products to their customers. The online shopping system recommends each customer the p roducts bought by others who have similar shopping behavior in the past. In addition, some well-known social net-working websites, Facebook, Myspace and Twitter provide users to establish their own personal communities or social networks based on friends. There are many services for persona lized recommendations in soc ial networking websites. For example, InSuggest 1 provides personalized r ecommendations of bookmarks originating from the social bookmarking site Delicious 2 ,andOutbrain 3 provides personalized blog recommendations from blogging services. The purpose of these recommendations are to adapt the conten ts of the websites to the specific needs of the individual user by presenting the most attractive and relevant items to users.

Traditional recommendation systems usually generate recommendation lists based on popularity of items and/or analyze the behavior of the target user and then make further recommendations. Howe ver, these systems focus on providing popular items or items posted by close friends. This leads to problems listed as follows: 1. Popular items always occupy the reco mmendation list and they are usually already known by the user. 2. Items recommended by familiar users, who frequently communicate with the target user, may no t be interesting. 3. Interesting items from similar users with lower popularity are ignored. Fig. 1 shows the personal social network of the target user U 1 . Circular nodes represent users and the link between two users indicates the friend relationship. The number on the link denotes the number of direct communication between these two users and MF represents the number of mutual friends between U 1 and the other user. In addition, square nodes represent items posted by the connected user, where the number indica tes the number of comments left by all users and the number of likes, which means other users are interested in the item. Traditional recommendation systems usually recommend items I 4 : 150 and I 1 : 100, since I 4 is the most popular item and I 1 is copied by many users. However, these items are easily found by the target user and should not occupy the recommendation list. On the other hand, I 9 : 55 from similar user U 3 with lower popularity is easily ignored. New paragraph to remedy these defects, we propose to discover unknown but interesting items, and design an algorithm to generate recommendation list on personal s ocial networks. The personal social network contains the target user and his/her direct friends. We also include items posted by these users.

Our proposed algorithm not only considers the popularity of items and the similarity with friends, but also discovers unknown but interesting items through the target user X  X  social behavior. We propose three scores to calculate Unknown But Interesting Score of each item in the target user X  X  personal social network. The first score is Quartile-aided Popularity Score, which is based on the popu-larity adjusted by quartiles of items, to find out items with lower popularity. The second score is Social Behavior Score, w hich depends on social interactions on social network websites and direct comm unication between users. The third score is User Similarity Score, which is based on interests between users, to model the similarity of the target user and his/her friends. Combining these three scores, we can generate the recommendation list with unknown but interesting items to the target user.

Finally, to evaluate our approach, we implement our system on a social net-working website, and collect users X  fee dback to compare diff erences between tra-ditional approaches and our proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can successfully find unknown but interesting items and the satisfaction percentage of our system is higher than compared methods.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief survey of related works is presented. The proposed algorithm is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 presents the exp erimental results. Finally, we conclude this work in Section 5. 2.1 Social Networking Social networking is the development of social collaborative technologies, and connected by one or more specific types of relationship, such as friendship, sim-ilar interest. In recent year, online soc ial networking has been around in the world, therefore, many online social net working websites are being generated which allow users to establish their social network by adding other users to their friend lists. For example, many users of popular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Many research issues of social networking focused on de-velopment of information techniques and data processing [7], and then extend to social networking analysis [10], which is a set of methods to discover relations between nodes in a social network.
A number of measures in social networking analysis including network size, degree centrality, betweenness, de nsity etc. are considered. Bird et al. [5] pro-posed a method to extract social networks from e-mail communication. Agrawal et al. [3] using web mining techniques to understand the behavior of users in news group, the proposed the behavior is meaning a newsgroup posting consists of one or more quoted lines from another posting followed by the opinion of the author. Adamic et al. [2] developed a method to discover the relationship of friends and neighbors in the web. Many social networking analysis approaches have propose similar ideas to find neighborhoods and paths with the social net-work [8], [9]. In our work, we extend the concept of social networking to discover the unknown but interesting items from social network site. 2.2 Recommendation Systems Recommendation systems are widely used fo r personalized information filtering technology, always used to recommend items that are of interest to users based on customer demographics, features of items, or user preferences. Therefore, users should provide their interest profiles to recommendation systems in order to get recommendations. Then recommendation systems can utilize these interest profiles to estimate the ratings of the unrated items for users or predict that items to be liked by users. In general, recommendation systems are usually classified into the following three methods: content-based recommendation, collaborative filtering and hybrid approaches.

The first method is based on contents [12], which analyzes the contents of in-formation products and user information to produce the recommended method. This method is mainly dependent on the data description of goods and users of consumer behavior in the past, for the two meta-analysis to calculate the characteristics of different commodities of the scores for the summary, identify the items for the user with a higher satis faction scores in order to establish recommended.

The second method is based on collaborative filtering [14], which utilizes simi-larities of user X  X  preferen ces to recommend item s. Collaborative filtering is a set of similarity measure methods, as follows: Jaccard X  X  coefficient of similarity, Cosine similarity [15], Pearson correlation-based similarities [13]. Many approaches em-ploy the technique of collaborative filtering, for instance, Bell et al. [4] proposed novel algorithms for predicting user ratings of items by integrating complemen-tary models that focus on patterns at diff erent scales. Facebook has a feature, called  X  X eople You May Know X , which r ecommends user to co nnect with based on a  X  X riend of a friend X  approach [1].

Finally, many recommendation systems use hybrid approaches by combining content-based methods and collaborative filtering [6], which helps to avoid cer-tain limitations of content-based and collaborative systems. For example, TAN-GENT [11] focused on the  X  X urprise m e X  query, in which a user may be bored with usual genre of items, and may reco mmend new genre of items. This research closes to our belief, however, traditio nal recommendation systems always focus on high frequency of item with similarity of user. That gives us an inspiration that we can make use of the impact in our work. In this section, we illustrate the system architecture and the details of our pro-posed algorithm, Unknown But Interesting algorithm. 3.1 System Architecture We build a recommendation system on a social networking platform. The ar-chitecture of the system is shown in Fig. 2. First, when the target user logs in to our system, the target user X  X  social data is collected and is used to generate the personal social network. The social data includes the target user X  X  profile, which contains his/her posts, interests, friends list, and social interactions. From the friends list, the open information of the target user X  X  friends is also collected, which includes the number of mutual friends and direct communication. We only consider 1-level friends, who have the d irect connections to the target user. The reason is that users are usually not interested in the social behavior of friends of 1-level friends and friends of friends have little influence power to the target user. After the collection of the social data, w e analyze the personal social network to calculate three different scores of each item and obtain unknown but interesting score by the proposed algorithm. Finally, we can generate the recommendation list of items show the results on the social networking website. 3.2 Unknown But Interesting Algorithm Unknown But Interesting ( UBI ) algorithm focuses on the popularity of items, the similarity between users, and the social behavior of the target user. The proposed algorithm calculate three scores as follows: 1. Quartile-aided Popularity Score ( QPS )ofeachitem. 2. Social Behavior Score ( SBS ) by considering social interactions of users. 3. User Similarity Score ( USS ) of each friend of the target user.
 Finally, we combine these three scores to obtain the Unknown But Interesting Score ( UBIS ), and provide the recommendation list to the target user. We explain the formulas and significance of each score as follows.
 Quartile-Aided Popularity Score. In the social networking website, users can post messages, photos, videos, and links on their own pages. Other users are able to leave comments on the posted items or simply click  X  X ike X  button to show their interests in the items. Therefo re, in our system, the popularity score, PS iv , is defined as the number of comments and likes of a certain item i posted by user v .

As we explained earlier, traditiona l recommendation systems always recom-mend popular items to users, but these items are well-known and easily noticed by users themselves. In order to deter mine a certain degree of popular items, we use the concept of quartile, Q r = | r ( n +1) / 4 | ,where r determines which quartile, and n is total number of items. The items are sorted by their popularity score, PS iv , ascendingly. The upper quartile, Q 3 ( PS iv ), represents the popular-ity of the item with the 3( n +1)/4 th rank in the list. In this way, we define quartile score, QS iv , to be the popularity score minus the upper quartile. Fig. 3 shows the PS iv and QS iv of each item posted by each user in Fig. 1. In this example, n is 14. Therefore Q 3 is the 11th lowest value of PS iv . The respective QS iv is shown in middle row. Furthermore, in order to find items which are not very popular but still have enough attention, we propose Quartile-aided Popularity Score, QPS iv .
 QPS iv normalizes QS iv by the maximum value and gives the upper quartile the highest credit. In this way, we can capture the popularity of items adjusted by the upper quartile.
 Social Behavior Score. In addition to adjusting the popularity of items, UBI considers the social behavior of the target user to further discover unknown items. In the social networking website, users usually allowed to meet friends and make connections to one another. Users can easily get information from the friends they are familiar with. Therefore, UBI includes two factors from the social behavior, i.e., mutual friends and direct communication. We define mutual friend, MF uv , be the number of mutual friends between user u and user v ,and direct communication of users, DC uv , be the number of direct communication between user u and user v . For the target user u , the more mutual friends u and v have the more likely it is that items ar e spread between those friends. In addition, the more direct co mmunication there is between u and v ,themore likely it is that items posted by user v are already known by the target user u . Therefore, in order to find unknown items, we define Social Behavior Score as follows.
 where Max ( MF uv ) represents the maximum value of MF uv among all friends v of the target user u ,and Max ( DC uv ) is the maximum value of DC uv among all v . SBS uv represents the inverse probability that the items posted by user v are already known by the target user u . Fig. 4 shows some SBS uv of users in Fig. 1. User Similarity Score. UBI not only takes popularity of items and familiarity of users into consideration, but also includes the similarity of users to obtain interesting items. If the item is recommended by a similar user of the target user, it is more likely that the target user is interested in the item. At first, users can do different actions in the social net working website to show their interest in some items, e.g., posting a link, commenting on a photo, or liking a video. We give each action a worth value, WV , indicating how much a user is interested to some item by performing this action.
 For example, the number of articles is 100, the number of comments is 500, and the number of likes is 1000. We can get the sum of all action as 1600, and we can calculate the worth value of posting an article to be 16, leaving a comment to be 3.2, and liking an item to be 1.6. Then, users may have a variety of behavior on the same item, as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, we sum up the worth value of all actions performed on the same item i to get the interesting score, IS i . Finally, we can define the user behavior as where IS i is the total interesting score of the user v to the item i . Accordingly, the User Similarity Score, USS uv , between user u and user v is computed by the following equation.
 From the user behavior listed in Fig. 5, user similarity score between U 1 and U 3 is 0 . 5, and USS between U 1 and U 19 is 0 . 21.
 Unknown But Interesting Score. Finally, we combine QPS , SBS ,and USS to calculate the unknown but interesting score for each item on the personal social network of the target user u . Thus, we define Unknown But Interesting Score as follows.
 where is the sum of same item i among all user v . Consequently, we can generate the recommended list based on UBIS .AsshowninFig.6,wesort UBIS and recommend the Top-k it ems to the target user.
 In this section, the methodology and the performance evaluation are discussed. The experiment is conducted to measure the percentages of unknown but inter-esting items in the recommendation list. The methodology is discussed in Section 4.1. The performance evaluation is pr esented and discussed in Section 4.2. 4.1 Methodology We implement recommendation system on a popular social networking website, Facebook, in order to compare our algorithm to traditional recommendation sys-tems. We can obtain user X  X  social information easily to discover unknown items. We generate three recommendation lists each on Facebook, traditional method, and our algorithm. First, Facebook recommendation list is based on latest up-dates from user X  X  posting. Second, traditional method is based on popular items with user X  X  preferences on Facebook. In ot her words, users usually focus on pop-ularity of items with similarity among users. At last, our algorithm is based on UBIS which recommends unknown but interesting items. We generate recom-mendation list which presents Top-20 items to the target user, as shown in the Fig.7, which is the interface of UBI recommendation system on Facebook, and we show one of the lists randomly. Furthermore, we show posted user X  X  name, content of the item, and each list has two questions for each message, and ques-tionnaires, which are as follows: unknown or known, and interesting. The ques-tion about unknown or known represents whether the message is unread or read by the target user respectively. The quest ion about interesting denotes whether the target user is interested in the message. We can compare UBI algorithm with the other two methods based on our questionnaires. 4.2 Performance Evaluation We randomly invited 355 users to partici pate in our experiment. Our experi-ments were conducted in the months starting from July through September of 2011, and 185 active users participated per month. At first, we compared three recommendation lists, and focused on unknown and interesting questions checked by users. In other words, these two indicators are used to determine the target user X  X  satisfaction. Fig. 8 presents percentages of items in the recommendation lists. Facebook (FB) recommends unknown it ems better than others, because FB usually recommends latest items, but users are usually not interested in them. The percentage of unknown items of traditional method with popularity with similarity (PS) is worst than that of other methods whereas the percentage of interesting items of traditional method with PS is better than that of FB. Be-cause traditional method recommends items, which are usually already known to users, based on PS among users. Our UBI algorithm can discover unknown items almost same as FB does and interesting items is better than FB and PS. In terms of overall satisfaction with unknown and interesting questionnaires, our algorithm can recommend unknown but interesting items exactly.

In addition, we recommend Top-20 item s for each recommendation system, then we compared percentages of Top -5 to Top-20. We want to ensure good performance of satisfaction for each stage. Fig. 9 represents the percentage of options checked by users for Top-5 to Top-20. In Fig. 9(a), the UBI algorithm discovers unknown items almost the same as FB, and the percentage of interest-ing is higher than FB and PS. Besides, Fig. 9(b), (c), and (d) also show this trend. This phenomenon represents not only Top-20 better UBI recommendations, but Top-5 to Top-15 also better than FB and PS. Therefore, we can obtain user X  X  satisfaction from user X  X  feedback is better than that of FB and PS. Finally, We found that our proposed algorithm to discover unknown but interesting items is better than Facebook and the traditional methods. Traditional systems are based on similarity and popularity. This strategy leads to some problems. We proposed an algorithm which recommends unknown but interesting item by utilizing three scores: Quartile-aided Popularity Score, So-cial Behavior Score, and User Similari ty Score. We focus on the communication among users and mutual friends, and discover the unknown but interesting item for user. In other words, we not only consider the similarity but also care about the user X  X  social interaction. Experimental results show that the performance of UBI significantly outperforms that of traditional methods in terms of the percentages of unknown and interesti ng items in the recommendation list. Our future work could focus on information propagation in social networks, and friend of friend structure and utilize cloud computing techniques to improve the system performance.
