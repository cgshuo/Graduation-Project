 1. Introduction and background
Many people worldwide access the Web for information and Web search engines are one of the most frequently used tools to reach information on the World Wide Web ( Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, &amp; Spink, 2004 ). The popularity of search engines has attracted the attention of many researchers to investigate
Retrieval (IR) systems are performed within their information-seeking behaviors and the topic of their search for information ( Ingwersen, 1996 ; Spink, 1998 ; Vakkari, 2001 ).
 ing to their needs.

There are many implications of contextual information on Web search engine design. Some of these are listed in Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, and Spink (2003a) . For example, custom-tailored graphical user interfaces 1997 ; Talja, Keso, &amp; Pietilainen, 1999 ).

Although there is a growing interest in investigating information seeking behavior within contextual be-havior, obtaining contextual information on Web search engine logs is a difficult task. Users submit few mutlu, 2003d ) and there is a growing trend among Web search engine users to submit several queries on

He et al. (2002) developed a topic identification algorithm based on Dempster X  X hafer Theory ster X  X hafer Theory enables the combination of two separate probabilistic events related to a single property (such as the topic change). Dempster X  X hafer Theory requires the probabilities of each event, the weights (importance) of these separate probabilistic events and a threshold value used to identify a topic shift. Probabilities are easily obtained through the analysis of the data log. To set the tification algorithm depends on the probabilities of the events, two weights w t
The performance of the topic identification algorithm is determined by the measures of precision and recall. The third and the main measure, fitness function F study: 1.

How important are the parameters (the weights and the threshold) on the performance of the proposed algorithm? How sensitive is the performance of the proposed algorithm to the changes in the parameters?
These research questions are also important to identify whether there is a set of universal set of para-meters to apply He et al. X  X  (2002) methodology for topic identification. In this case, there is no need to apply genetic algorithm or some other methodology to each new dataset. To answer this question, we will apply the algorithm on the Excite dataset with different sets of values for the parameters (the weights and the threshold).

In our previous studies ( Spink, Jansen, &amp; Ozmutlu, 2000 ), we have applied four mutually exclusive back and other). The comparison of the query classes is given in Table 2 .

We believe that division of modified type queries into generalization, specialization and refor-mulation sub-groups may provide more insight to the Web user search behavior analysis. Therefore, in this study generalization, specialization and reformulation classes are used to replace the modified class.

For the remaining classes there is one to one correspondence except for the  X  X  X epetition X  X  and  X  X  X ther X  X  classes. The definition of the repetition class in He et al. (2002) is  X  X  X he second activity (query) a Excite data set. Therefore, repetition class is not applicable in this study.
 lowed by another query. Since relevance feedback command registers an empty query, it is impossible to relationship with the subsequent query. Hence, the query is labeled as  X  X  X ther X  X .
One other change is that the term  X  X  X rowsing X  X  is replaced with  X  X  X ext page X  X  since browsing also has another meaning as  X  X  X rowsing the Web X  X .
 The detailed definitions of the classes of the search patterns are as follows: Unique (New): the second query has no common term compared to the first query. results on the first query.

Generalization: The second query has fewer terms than the first query, and all terms of the second query are in the first query.

 first query has some other terms that are not included in the second query. This means that the user has in different order, it is also considered as reformulation. This incident cannot be considered as Next Page, where subsequent queries should be identical.

Relevance feedback: The second query has zero terms (empty) and it is generated by the system when the user selects the choice of  X  X  X elated pages X  X .
 Others: If the second query does not fit any of the above categories, it is labeled as other.
The search patterns are automatically identified by a computer program written in PASCAL. The pro-summarized as follows: Input: Queries Q i 1 , Q i , Q i +1 (set of three subsequent queries) Local: Q c , current query (as a string) Q n , next query (as a string) in both Q c and Q n
C = {t j t 2 Q c and t 6 2 Q n }, the set of terms, which appear in Q
D = {t j t 6 2 Q c and t 2 Q n }, the set of terms, which appear in Q
Output: Search Pattern, SP begin if ( Q i == / ) then else Q c = Q i , endif
SP = other //default value if ( Q n == / ) then SP = Relevance Feedback endif // if the next query is empty then if ( Q n == Q c ) then SP = Next Page endif if ( B  X  / and C  X  / and D == / ) then SP = Generalization endif if ( B  X  / and C == / and D  X  / ) then SP = Specialization endif if ( B  X  / and C  X  / and D  X  / ) then SP = Reformulation endif if ( Q n  X  Q c and B  X  / and C == / and D == / ) then SP = Reformulation endif if ( Q c  X  / and B == / ) then SP = New endif end The remaining notation used in this study is explained below:

Reuter X  X  dataset. It is also possible to use the parameters of w the parameters we calculated using our genetic algorithm. Additionally, the parameters of w t shift were randomly generated, and the performance of the topic identification algorithm was tested with these values.
 The following sections explain how the these six test cases are used.

In other words, if the parameters of the original study work for the Excite dataset, this could be interpreted as these values being universally applicable to all types of Web user search sessions. 2.4.4.

A correction In He et al. (2002) , the precision formula is as follows:
There seems to be an error in this formula, in the sense that N number of true shifts (when all true shifts are identified correctly). Therefore the formulation for the upper bound for P can be derived from the original P formulation as follows. Since the equality ( N ing formulation can be given as the upper bound for P . misprint in He et al. X  X  (2002) precision formulation.

To discover the correct precision formulation, we have done some experimentation and noticed that F demonstrated below.

Although the P formula that He et al. (2002) had used may be unknown, we believe that the formulation should not include N contin to be consistent with the precision definitions ( Yang, 1999 ). Without N the study: 3. Results The results of the study are organized in the same fashion as in the methodology section of the paper. of the query. The probabilities are given in Tables 4 and 5 .

The genetic algorithm is trained with the first 5014 queries of the 10,000 query Excite dataset. This is approximately half the Excite dataset, without dividing any user session. Note that not all of 5014 queries can be used for training, since the last query of each user session cannot be processed for pattern classification and time duration. Pattern classification and time duration cannot be deter-mined for the last query of each session, since there are no subsequent queries after the last query of topic shifts and continuations, 2544 topic continuations and 269 topic shifts were identified within the 3813 queries.

The probabilities in Tables 4 and 5 are used in Cases 1, 3 and 5. For the remaining cases, Cases 2, 4 algorithm is run on the test dataset with the corresponding w error and F b are calculated for each case. The results of Cases 1 X 6 are given in Tables 6 and 7 . 3.1. Results of Case 1: Replicate He et al.

In this case, it is necessary that the relationship between the parameters w fitness function is analyzed.

Comparing Cases 5 and 6, we observed that on average there is approximately a 0.14 increase in F abilities on F b is tested in the following section. the fitness function F b values
The average F b value of Cases 3 and 5 is 0.18, whereas the same value for Cases 4 and 6 is 0.36.
