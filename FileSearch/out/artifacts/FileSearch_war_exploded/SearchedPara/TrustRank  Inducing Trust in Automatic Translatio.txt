 The accuracy of machine translation (MT) soft-ware has steadily increased over the last 20 years to achieve levels at which large-scale commercial applications of the technology have become feasi-ble. However, widespread adoption of MT tech-nology remains hampered by the lack of trust as-sociated with machine-translated output. This lack of trust is a normal reaction to the erratic trans-lation quality delivered by current state-of-the-art MT systems. Unfortunately, the lack of pre-dictable quality discourages the adoption of large-scale automatic translation solutions.

Consider the case of a commercial enterprise that hosts reviews written by travellers on its web site. These reviews contain useful information about hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc. There is a large and continuous stream of reviews posted on this site, and the large majority is written in En-glish. In addition, there is a large set of potential customers who would prefer to have these reviews available in their (non-English) native languages. As such, this enterprise presents the perfect oppor-tunity for the deployment of a large-volume MT solution. However, travel reviews present specific challenges: the reviews tend to have poor spelling, loose grammar, and broad topics of discussion. The result is unpredictable levels of MT quality. This is undesirable for the commercial enterprise, who is not content to simply reach a broad audi-ence, but also wants to deliver a high-quality prod-uct to that audience.
 We propose the following solution. We develop TrustRank, an MT system enhanced with a ca-pability to rank the quality of translation outputs from good to bad. This enables the user to set a quality threshold, granting the user control over the quality of the translations that it employs in its product. With this enhancement, MT adop-tion stops being a binary should-we-or-shouldn X  X -we question. Rather, each user can make a per-sonal trade-off between the scope and the quality of their product. Work on automatic MT evaluation started with the idea of comparing automatic translations against human-produced references. Such comparisons are done either at lexical level (Papineni et al., 2002; Doddington, 2002), or at linguistically-richer levels using paraphrases (Zhou et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006), WordNet (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), or syntax (Liu and Gildea, 2005; Owczarzak et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008; Amig  X  o et al., 2009). In contrast, we are interested in per-forming MT quality assessments on documents for which reference translations are not available.
Reference-free approaches to automatic MT quality assessment, based on Machine Learning techniques such as classification (Kulesza and Shieber, 2004), regression (Albrecht and Hwa, 2007), and ranking (Ye et al., 2007; Duh, 2008), have a different focus compared to ours. Their ap-proach, which uses a test set that is held constant and against which various MT systems are mea-sured, focuses on evaluating system performance. Similar proposals exist outside the MT field, for instance in syntactic parsing (Ravi et al., 2008). In this case, the authors focus on estimating perfor-mance over entire test sets, which in turn is used for evaluating system performance. In contrast, we focus on evaluating the quality of the trans-lations themselves, while the MT system is kept constant.

A considerable amount of work has been done in the related area of confidence estimation for MT, for which Blatz et al. (2004) provide a good overview. The goal of this work is to identify small units of translated material (words and phrases) for which one can be confident in the quality of the translation. Related to this goal, and closest to our proposal, is the work of Gamon et al. (2005) and Specia et al. (2009). They describe Ma-chine Learning approaches (classification and re-gression, respectively) aimed at predicting which sentences are likely to be well/poorly translated. Our work, however, departs from all these works in several important aspects.

First, we want to make the quality predic-tions at document-level, as opposed to sentence-level (Gamon et al., 2005; Specia et al., 2009), or word/phrase-level (Blatz et al., 2004; Ueffing and Ney, 2005). Document-level granularity is a re-quirement for large-scale commercial applications that use fully-automated translation solutions. For these applications, the need to make the distinction between  X  X ood translation X  and  X  X oor translation X  must be done at document level. Otherwise, it is not actionable. In contrast, quality-prediction or confidence estimation at sentence-or word-level fits best a scenario in which automated translation is only a part of a larger pipeline. Such pipelines usually involve human post-editing, and are useful for translation productivity (Lagarda et al., 2009). Such solutions, however, suffer from the inherent volume bottleneck associated with human involve-ment. Our fully-automated solution targets large volume translation needs, on the order of 10,000 documents/day or more.

Second, we use automatically generated train-ing labels for the supervised Machine Learning approach. In the experiments presented in this pa-per, we use BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) as training labels. However, they can be substi-tuted with any of the proposed MT metrics that use human-produced references to automatically as-sess translation quality (Doddington, 2002; Lavie and Agarwal, 2007). In a similar manner, the work of (Specia et al., 2009) uses NIST scores, and the work of (Ravi et al., 2008) uses PARSE-VAL scores. The main advantage of this approach is that we can generate quickly and cheaply as many learning examples as needed. Additionally, we can customize the prediction models on a large variety of genres and domains, and quickly scale to multiple language pairs. In contrast, solutions that require training labels produced manually by humans (Gamon et al., 2005; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007) have difficulties producing prediction mod-els fast enough, trained on enough data, and cus-tomized for specific domains.

Third, the main metric we use to assess the per-formance of our solution is targeted directly at measuring translation quality gains. We are inter-ested in the extrinsic evaluation of the quantitative impact of the TrustRank solution, rather than in the intrinsic evaluation of prediction errors (Ravi et al., 2008; Specia et al., 2009). 3.1 Domains We are interested in measuring the impact of TrustRank on a variety of genres, domains, and language pairs. Therefore, we set up the exper-imental framework accordingly. We use three proprietary data sets, taken from the domains of Travel (consumer reviews), Consumer Electron-ics (customer support for computers, data storage, printers, etc.), and HighTech (customer support for high-tech components). All these data sets come in a variety of European and Asian language pairs. We also use the publicly available data set used in the WMT09 task (Koehn and Haddow, 2009) (a combination of European parliament and news data). Information regarding the sizes of these data sets is provided in Table 2. 3.2 Metrics We first present the experimental framework de-signed to answer the main question we want to address: can we automatically produce a ranking for document translations (for which no human-produced references are available), such that the translation quality of the documents at the top of this ranking is higher than the average translation quality? To this end, we use several metrics that can gauge how well we answer this question.
The first metric is Ranking Accuracy (rAcc), see (Gunawardana and Shani, 2009). We are inter-ested in ranking N documents and assigning them into n quantiles. The formula is: where TP i (True-Positive i ) is the number of correctly-assigned documents in quantile i . Intu-itively, this formula is an average of the ratio of documents correctly assigned in each quantile.
The rAcc metric provides easy to understand lowerbounds and upperbounds. For example, with a method that assigns random ranks, when using 4 quantiles, the accuracy is 25% in any of the quan-tiles, hence an rAcc of 25%. With an oracle-based ranking, the accuracy is 100% in any of the quan-tiles, hence an rAcc of 100%. Therefore, the per-formance of any decent ranking method, when us-ing 4 quantiles, can be expected to fall somewhere between these bounds.

The second and main metric is the volume-weighted BLEU gain (vBLEU  X  ) metric. It mea-sures the average BLEU gain when trading-off volume for accuracy on a predefined scale. The general formula, for n quantiles, is with w i = where BLEU 1 ...i is the BLEU score of the first i quantiles, and BLEU is the score over all the quantiles. Intuitively, this formula provides a volume-weighted average of the BLEU gain ob-tained while varying the threshold of acceptance from 1 to n -1. (A threshold of acceptance set to the n -th quantile means accepting all the transla-tions and therefore ignore the rankings, so we do not include it in the average.) Without rankings (or with random ranks), the expected vBLEU  X  X  n ] is zero, as the value BLEU 1 ...i is expected to be the same as the overall BLEU for any i . With ora-cle ranking, the expected vBLEU  X  X  n ] is a positive number representative of the upperbound on the quality of the translations that pass an acceptance threshold. We report the vBLEU  X  X  n ] values as signed numbers, both within a domain and when computed as an average across domains.

The choice regarding the number of quantiles is closely related to the choice of setting an ac-ceptance quality threshold. Because we want the solution to stay unchanged while the acceptance quality threshold can vary, we cannot treat this as a classification problem. Instead, we need to pro-vide a complete ranking over an input set of doc-uments. As already mentioned, TrustRank uses a regression method that is trained on BLEU scores as training labels. The regression functions are then used to predict a BLEU-like number for each document in the input set. The rankings are de-rived trivially from the predicted BLEU numbers, by simply sorting from highest to lowest. Ref-erence ranking is obtained similarly, using actual BLEU scores.

Although we are mainly interested in the rank-ing problem here, it helps to look at the error pro-duced by the regression models to arrive at a more complete picture. Besides the two metrics for ranking described above, we use the well-known regression metrics MAE (mean absolute error) and TE (test-level error): where BLEU k is the BLEU score for document k , predBLEU k is the predicted BLEU value, and predBLEU is a weighted average of the predicted document-level BLEU numbers over the entire set of N documents. 3.3 Experimental conditions The MT system used by TrustRank (TrustRank-MT) is a statistical phrase-based MT system sim-ilar to (Och and Ney, 2004). As a reference point regarding the performance of this system, we use the official WMT09 parallel data, monolingual data, and development tuning set (news-dev2009a) to train baseline TrustRank-MT systems for each of the ten WMT09 language pairs. Our system produces translations that are competitive with state-of-the-art systems. We show our baseline-system BLEU scores on the official development test set (news-dev2009b) for the WMT09 task in Table 1, along with the BLEU scores reported for the baseline Moses system (Koehn and Haddow, 2009).

For each of the domains we consider, we par-tition the data sets as follows. We first set aside 3000 documents, which we call the Regression set 1 . The remaining data is called the training MT Moses 17.8 22.4 13.5 11.4 6.5 TrustRank-MT 21.3 22.8 14.3 9.1 8.5 Moses 21.2 22.5 16.6 16.9 8.8 TrustRank-MT 22.4 23.8 19.8 13.3 10.4 Table 1: BLEU scores (uncased) for the TrustRank-MT system compared to Moses (WMT09 data). set, on which the MT system is trained. From the Regression set, we set aside 1000 parallel docu-ments to be used as a blind test set (called Regres-sion Test) for our experiments. An additional set of 1000 parallel documents is used as a develop-ment set, and the rest of 1000 parallel documents is used as the regression-model training set.
We have also performed learning-curve exper-iments using between 100 and 2000 documents for regression-model training. We do not go into the details of these experiments here for lack of space. The conclusion derived from these exper-iments is that 1000 documents is the point where the learning-curves level off.

In Table 2, we provide a few data points with respect to the data size of these sets (tokenized word-count on the source side). We also report the BLEU performance of the TrustRank-MT system on the Regression Test set.

Note that the differences between the BLEU scores reported in Table 1 and the BLEU scores under the WMT09 label in Table 2 reflect dif-ferences in the genres of these sets. The offi-cial development test set (news-dev2009b) for the WMT09 task is news only. The regression Test sets have the same distribution between Europarl data and news as the corresponding training data set for each language pair. As mentioned before, TrustRank takes a super-vised Machine Learning approach. We automat-ically generate the training labels by computing BLEU scores for every document in the Regres-sion training set.

We have compared and contrasted results using all the regression packages offered by Weka, includ-ing regression functions based on simple and multiple-feature Linear regression, Pace regres-sion, RBF networks, Isotonic regression, Gaussian Processes, Support Vector Machines (with SMO optimization) with polynomial and RBF kernels, and regression trees such as REP trees and M5P trees. Due to lack of space and the tangential im-pact on the message of this paper, we do not report these contrastive experiments here.

The learning technique that consistently yields the best results is M5P regression trees (weka.classifiers.trees.M5P). Therefore, we report all the results in this paper using this learning method. As an additional advantage, the decision trees and the regression models produced in train-ing are easy to read, understand, and interpret. One can get a good insight into what the impact of a certain feature on a final predicted value is by simply inspecting these trees. 4.2 The features In contrast to most of the work on confidence es-timation (Blatz et al., 2004), the features we use are not internal features of the MT system. There-fore, TrustRank can be applied for a large variety of MT approaches, from statistical-based to rule-based approaches.

The features we use can be divided into text-based, language-model X  X ased, pseudo-reference X  based, example-based, and training-data X  X ased feature types. These feature types can be com-puted either on the source-side (input documents) or on the target-side (translated documents). Text-based features These features simply look at the length of the in-put in terms of (tokenized) number of words. They can be applied on the input, where they induce a correlation between the number of words in the in-put document and the expected BLEU score for that document size. They can also be applied on the produced output, and learn a similar correla-tion for the produced translation.
 Language-model X  X ased features These features are among the ones that were first proposed as possible differentiators between good and bad translations (Gamon et al., 2005). They are a measure of how likely a collection of strings is under a language model trained on monolingual data (either on the source or target side).
The language-model X  X ased feature values we use here are computed as document-level per-plexity numbers using a 5-gram language model trained on the MT training set.
 Pseudo-reference X  X ased features Previous work has shown that, in the absence of human-produced references, automatically-produced ones are still helpful in differentiating between good and bad translations (Albrecht and Hwa, 2008). When computed on the target side, this type of features requires one or more sec-ondary MT systems, used to generate transla-tions starting from the same input. These pseudo-references are useful in gauging translation con-vergence, using BLEU scores as feature values. In intuitive terms, their usefulness can be summa-rized as follows:  X  X f system X produced a trans-lation A and system Y produced a translation B starting from the same input, and A and B are sim-ilar, then A is probably a good translation X .
An important property here is that systems X and Y need to be as different as possible from each other. This property ensures that a convergence on similar translations is not just an artifact, but a true indication that the translations are correct. The secondary systems we use here are still phrase-based, but equipped with linguistically-oriented modules similar with the ones proposed in (Collins et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2009).

The source-side pseudo-reference X  X ased fea-ture type is of a slightly different nature. It still re-quires one or more secondary MT systems, but op-erating in the reverse direction. A translated doc-ument produced by the main MT system is fed to the secondary MT system(s), translated back into the original source language, and used as pseudo-reference(s) when computing a BLEU score for the original input. In intuitive terms:  X  X f system X takes document A and produces B , and system X  X  1 takes B and produces C , and A and C are similar, then B is probably a good translation X . Example-based features For example-based features, we use a develop-ment set of 1000 parallel documents, for which we produce translations and compute document-level BLEU scores. We set aside the top-100 BLEU scoring documents and bottom-100 BLEU scoring documents. They are used as positive examples (with better-than-average BLEU) and negative ex-amples (with worse-than-average BLEU), respec-tively. We define a positive-example X  X ased fea-ture function as a geometric mean of 1-to-4 X  X ram precision scores (i.e., BLEU score without length penalty) between a document (on either source or target side) and the positive examples used as references (similarly for negative-example X  X ased features).

The intuition behind these features can be sum-marized as follows:  X  X f system X translated docu-ment A well/poorly, and A and B are similar, then system X probably translates B well/poorly X . Training-data X  X ased features If the main MT system is trained on a parallel cor-pus, the data in this corpus can be exploited to-wards assessing translation quality (Specia et al., 2009). In our context, the documents that make up this corpus can be used in a fashion similar with the positive examples. One type of training-data X  based features operates by computing the number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens with respect to the training data (on either source or target side).
A more powerful type of training-data X  X ased features operates by computing a BLEU score be-tween a document (source or target side) and the training-data documents used as references. Intu-itively, we assess the coverage with respect to the training data and correlate it with a BLEU score:  X  X f the n-grams of input document A are well cov-ered by the source-side of the training data, the translation of A is probably good X  (on the source side);  X  X f the n-grams in the output translation B are well covered by the target-side of the parallel training data, then B is probably a good transla-tion X  (on the target side). 4.3 Results We are interested in the best performance for TrustRank using the features described above. In this section, we focus on reporting the results ob-tain for the English-Spanish language pair. In the next section, we report results obtained on all the language pairs we considered.

Before we discuss the results of TrustRank, let us anchor the numerical values using some lower-and upper-bounds. As a baseline, we use a re-gression function that outputs a constant number for each document, equal to the BLEU score of the Regression Training set. As an upperbound, we use an oracle regression function that outputs a number for each document that is equal to the ac-tual BLEU score of that document. In Table 4, we present the performance of these regression func-tions across all the domains considered.

As already mentioned, the rAcc values are bounded by the 25% lowerbound and the 100% upperbound. The vBLEU  X  values are bounded by 0 as lowerbound, and some positive BLEU gain value that varies among the domains we consid-ered from +6.4 (Travel) to +13.5 (HiTech). The best performance obtained by TrustRank Baseline WMT09 25% 0 9.9 +0.4 Travel 25% 0 8.3 +2.0 Electr. 25% 0 12.2 +2.6 HiTech 25% 0 16.9 +2.4 Dom. avg. 25% 0 11.8 1.9 Oracle WMT09 100% +8.2 0 0 Travel 100% +6.4 0 0 Electr. 100% +9.2 0 0 HiTech 100% +13.5 0 0 Dom. avg. 100% +9.3 0 0 Table 4: Lower-and upper-bounds for ranking and regression accuracy (English-Spanish). for English-Spanish, using all the features de-scribed, is presented in Table 3. The ranking ac-curacy numbers on a per-quantile basis reveals an important property for the approach we ad-vocate. The ranking accuracy on the first quan-tile Q 1 (identifying the best 25% of the transla-tions) is 52% on average across the domains. For the last quantile Q 4 (identifying the worst 25% of the translations), it is 56%. This is much better than the ranking accuracy for the median-quality translations (35-37% accuracy for the two middle quantiles). This property fits well our scenario, in which we are interested in associating trust in the quality of the translations in the top quantile.
The quality of the top quantile translations is quantifiable in terms of BLEU gain. The 250 doc-ument translations in Q 1 for Travel have a BLEU score of 38.0, a +6.8 BLEU gain compared to the overall BLEU of 31.2 (Q 1  X  4 ). The Q 1 HiTech translations, with a BLEU of 77.9, have a +18.9 BLEU gain compared to the overall BLEU of 59.0. The TrustRank algorithm allows us to trade-off quantity versus quality on any scale. The re-sults under the BLEU heading in Table 3 repre-sent an instantiation of this ability to a 3-point scale (Q 1 ,Q 1  X  2 ,Q 1  X  3 ). The vBLEU  X  numbers reflect an average of the BLEU gains for this in-stantiation (e.g., a +11.6 volume-weighted average BLEU gain for the HiTech domain).

We are also interested in the best performance under more restricted conditions, such as time constraints. The assumption we make here is that the translation time dwarfs the time needed for fea-Domain Ranking Accuracy Translation Accuracy MAE TE WMT09 34% 26% 29% 40% 32% 44.8 43.6 42.4 41.1 +2.1 9.6 -0.1 Travel 50% 26% 29% 41% 36% 38.0 35.1 33.0 31.2 +3.4 7.4 -1.9 HiTech 65% 48% 49% 75% 59% 77.9 72.7 66.7 59.0 +11.6 8.6 -2.1 Dom. avg. 52% 35% 37% 56% 45% -+5.9 8.5 1.7 ture and regression value computation. Therefore, the most time-expensive feature is the source-side pseudo-reference X  X ased feature, which effectively doubles the translation time required. Under the  X  X ime-constrained X  condition, we exclude this fea-ture and use all of the remaining features. Table 5 presents the results obtained for English-Spanish.

The results presented above allow us to draw a series of conclusions.
 Benefits vary by domain Even with oracle rankings (Table 4), the benefits vary from one domain to the next. For Travel, with an overall BLEU score in the low 30s (31.2), we stand to gain at most +6.4 BLEU points on average (+6.4 vBLEU  X  upperbound). For a domain such as HiTech, even with a high overall BLEU score close to 60 (59.0), we stand to gain twice as much (+13.5 vBLEU  X  upperbound).
 Performance varies by domain As the results in Table 3 show, the best perfor-mance we obtain also varies from one domain to the next. For instance, the ranking accuracy for the WMT09 domain is only 32%, while for the HiTech domain is 59%. Also, the BLEU gain for the WMT09 domain is only +2.1 vBLEU  X  (com-pared to the upperbound vBLEU  X  of +8.2, it is only 26% of the oracle performance). In contrast, the BLEU gain for the HiTech domain is +11.6 vBLEU  X  (compared to the +13.5 vBLEU  X  up-perbound, it is 86% of the oracle performance). Positive feature synergy and overlap The features we described capture different infor-mation, and their combination achieves the best performance. For instance, in the Electronics do-main, the best single feature is the target-side n -gram coverage feature, with +5.3 vBLEU  X  . The combination of all features gives a +6.5 vBLEU  X  .
The numbers in Table 3 also show that elimi-nating some of the features results in lower perfor-mance. The rAcc drops from 45% to 44% in under the  X  X ime-constraint X  condition (Table 5). The dif-ference in the rankings is statistically significant at p &lt; 0 . 01 using the Wilcoxon test (Dem  X  sar, 2006).
However, this drop is quantitatively small (1% rAcc drop, -0.1 in vBLEU  X  , averaged across do-mains). This suggests that, even when eliminating features that by themselves have a good discrim-inatory power (the source-side pseudo-reference X  based feature achieves a +5.0 vBLEU  X  as a sin-gle feature in the Electronics domain), the other features compensate to a large degree.
 Poor regression performance By looking at the results of the regression metrics, we conclude that the predicted BLEU numbers are not accurate in absolute value. The aggregated Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 8.5 when using all the features. This is less than the baseline MAE of 11.8, but it is too high to allow us to confidently use the document-level BLEU numbers as reliable indicators of translation accuracy. The Test Error (TE) numbers are not encouraging either, as the 1.7 TE of TrustRank is close to the baseline TE of 1.9 (see Table 4 for baseline numbers). In this section, we present the performance of TrustRank on a variety of language pairs (Table 6). We report the BLEU score obtained on our 1000-document regression Test, as well as ranking and regression performance using the rAcc, vBLEU  X  , MAE, and TE metrics.

As the numbers for the ranking and regres-sion metrics show, the same trends we observed for English-Spanish hold for many other language pairs as well. Some domains, such as HiTech, are easier to rank regardless of the language pair, and the quality gains are consistently high (+9.9 av-erage vBLEU  X  for the 5 language pairs consid-ered). Other domains, such as WMT09 and Travel, are more difficult to rank. However, the WMT09 English-Hungarian data set appears to be better suited for ranking, as the vBLEU  X  numbers are higher compared to the rest of the language pairs from this domain (+4.3 vBLEU  X  for Eng-Hun, +7.1 vBLEU  X  for Hun-Eng). For Travel, English-Dutch is also an outlier in terms of quality gains (+12.9 vBLEU  X  ).

Overall, the results indicate that TrustRank ob-tains consistent performance across a large vari-ety of language pairs. Similar with the conclusion for English-Spanish, the regression performance is currently too poor to allow us to confidently use the absolute document-level predicted BLEU numbers as indicators of translation accuracy. As the experimental results in Table 6 show, the regression performance varies considerably across domains. Even within the same domain, the nature of the material used to perform the experiments can influence considerably the results we obtain. In Figure 1, we plot  X  BLEU,predBLEU  X  points for three of our language pairs presented in Table 6: Travel Eng-Fra, Travel Eng-Dut, and HiTech Eng-Rus. These plots illustrate the tendency of the pre-dicted BLEU values to correlate with the actual BLEU scores. The amount of correlation visible in these plots matches the performance numbers pro-vided in Table 6, with Travel Eng-Fra at a lower level of correlation compared to Travel Eng-Dut and HiTech Eng-Rus. The  X  BLEU,predBLEU  X  points tend to align along a line at an angle smaller than 45  X  , an indication of the fact that the BLEU pre-dictions tend to be more conservative compared to the actual BLEU scores.

 Travel Eng-Fra case, the predicted BLEU numbers are spread across a narrower band (95% of the val-ues are in the [19-35] interval), compared to the actual BLEU scores (95% of the values are in the [11-47] interval).

These intervals are also useful for gauging the level of difficulty stemming from the nature of the material used to perform the experiments. In the case of Travel Eng-Fra, the actual BLEU scores are clustered in a narrower band (interval [11-47] covers 95% of the values), compared to the actual BLEU scores for Travel Eng-Dut (interval [11-92] covers 95% of the values) and HiTech Eng-Rus (interval [3-80] covers 95% of the values). This

To provide an intuitive feel for the difference between the level of translation performance be-tween documents ranked close to the bottom and documents ranked close to the top, we present here two example translations. They are docu-ments that we randomly picked from the bottom 10% and top 10% of the Travel Eng-Fra document set, and they correspond to points A and B in the first plot of Figure 1, respectively. The A-Fra and B-Fra entries below are produced by our Eng-Fra TrustRank-MT system, starting from A-Eng and B-Eng 3 , respectively.
 Document A-Fra is a poor translation, and is ranked in the bottom 10%, while document B-Fra is a nearly-perfect translation ranked in the top 10%, out of a total of 1000 documents. Commercial adoption of MT technology requires trust in the translation quality. Rather than delay this adoption until MT attains a near-human level of sophistication, we propose an interim approach. We present a mechanism that allows MT users to trade quantity for quality, using automatically-determined translation quality rankings.

The results we present in this paper show that document-level translation quality rankings pro-vide quantitatively strong gains in translation qual-ity, as measured by BLEU. A difference of +18.9 BLEU, like the one we obtain for the English-Spanish HiTech domain (Table 3), is persuasive evidence for inspiring trust in the quality of se-lected translations. This approach enables us to develop TrustRank, a complete MT solution that enhances automatic translation with the ability to identify document subsets containing translations that pass an acceptable quality threshold.
When measuring the performance of our solu-tion across several domains, it becomes clear that some domains allow for more accurate quality pre-diction than others. Given the immediate benefit that can be derived from increasing the ranking accuracy for translation quality, we plan to open up publicly available benchmark data that can be used to stimulate and rigorously monitor progress in this direction.
