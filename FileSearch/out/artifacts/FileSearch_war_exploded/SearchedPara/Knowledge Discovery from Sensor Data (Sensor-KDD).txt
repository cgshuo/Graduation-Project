 Extracting knowledge and emerging patterns from sensor data is a nontrivial task. The challenges for the knowledge discovery community are expected to be immense. On one hand, dynamic data streams or events require real-time anal-ysis methodologies and systems, while on the other hand centralized processing through high end computing is also required for generating offline predictive insights, which in turn can facilitate real-time analysis. In addition, emerging societal problems require knowledge discovery solutions that are designed to investigate anomalies, changes, extremes and nonlinear processes, and departures from the normal. Keeping in view the requirements of the emerging field of knowledge discovery from sensor data, we took initiative to develop a community of researchers with common inter-ests and scientific goals, which culminated into the organiza-tion of Sensor-KDD series of workshops in conjunction with the prestigious ACM SIGKDD International Conference of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. In this report, we summarize the events of the Second ACM-SIGKDD Interna-tional Workshop on Knowledge Discovery form Sensor Data (Sensor-KDD 2008). Wide-area sensor infrastructures, remote sensors, and wire-less sensor networks, RFIDs, yield massive volumes of dis-parate, dynamic, and geographically distributed data. As such sensors are becoming ubiquitous, a set of broad re-quirements is beginning to emerge across high-priority ap-plications including disaster preparedness and management, adaptability to climate change, national or homeland secu-rity, and the management of critical infrastructures. The raw data from sensors need to be efficiently managed and transformed to usable information through data fusion, which in turn must be converted to predictive insights via knowl-edge discovery, ultimately facilitating automated or human-induced tactical decisions or strategic policy based on deci-sion sciences and decision support systems.

The online and real-time knowledge discovery im-ply immediate opportunities as well as intriguing short-and long-term challenges for practitioners and researchers in knowl-edge discovery. The opportunities would be to develop new data mining approaches and adapt traditional and emerging knowledge discovery methodologies to the requirements of the emerging problems. In addition, emerging societal prob-lems require knowledge discovery solutions that are designed to investigate anomalies, changes, extremes and nonlinear processes, and departures from the normal. The Sensor-KDD workshop seeks to bring together researchers from academia, government and the industry working in various aspects of knowledge discovery from sensor data. The expected ubiquity of sensors in the near future, com-bined with the critical roles they are expected to play in high priority application solutions, point to an era of unprece-dented growth and opportunities. The online knowledge discovery requirements described earlier imply immediate opportunities as well as intriguing short-and long-term chal-lenges for practitioners and researchers in knowledge discov-ery. In addition, the knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) community would be called upon, again and again, as partners with domain experts to solve critical applica-tion solutions in business and government, as well as in the domain sciences and engineering. The main motivation for the Sensor-KDD series of workshops stems from the increas-ing need for a forum to exchange ideas and recent research results, and to facilitate collaboration and dialog between academia, government, and industrial stakeholders. This is clearly reflected in the successful organization of the first workshop [3] along with KDD-2007, which was attended by more than seventy registered participants. The high qual-ity of submissions allowed to us to put together an edited book [2] and a special issue in the  X  X ntelligent Data Analysis X  journal [1]. Based on the positive feedback from the previous workshop attendees and our own experiences and interactions with the government agencies such as DHS, DOD, and involve-ment with numerous projects on knowledge discovery from sensor data, we organized the 2 nd Sensor-KDD workshop along with the KDD-2008 conference. As expected we re-ceived very high quality paper submissions which were thor-oughly reviewed by a panel of international program com-mittee members [4]. Based on a minimum of two reviews per paper, we have selected seven full papers and six short papers. In addition to the oral presentations of accepted papers, the workshop featured two invited speakers Dr. Kendra E. Moore, Program Manager, DARPA/IPTO and Prof. Jiawei Han, Department of Computer Science, Uni-versity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We now briefly summarize each of these presentations, for full details about each of the presented papers, please refer to the workshop proceedings [5]. The first session was moderated by Dr. Auroop Ganguly. This session featured our first invited speaker, Dr. Kendra Moore, followed by two paper presentations. Dr. Moore presented the challenges of knowledge discovery from sensor data in defense applications. She touched upon wide va-riety of topics including heterogeneity, distributed sensors, real-time requirements, privacy, and applications of national importance.
 The paper,  X  X nomaly Detection from Sensor Data for Real-time Decisions X  by Olufemi A. Omitaomu, Yi Fang, and Auroop R. Ganguly, is presented by Olufemi. This paper is concerned about the detection of unusual profiles or anoma-lous behavioral characteristics from multiple types of sensor data. The authors presented a two-stage knowledge discov-ery process, where offline approaches are utilized to design online solutions that can support real-time decisions. They illustrated this innovative solution in the context detecting anomalous behavior of trucks using sensor-based measure-ments collected at truck weigh stations. This is a fine ex-ample of knowledge discovery application in the context of national security.
 The paper,  X  X etwork Service Disruption upon Natural Dis-aster: Inference Using Sensory Measurements and Human Inputs X  by Supaporn Erjongmanee and Chuanyi Ji, shows important role of data mining and machine learning in in-ferring large-scale network service disruption. Natural dis-asters, like recent Hurricane Katrina, can cause large-scale network service interruptions which leads to unreachability of networks. The authors presented a joint use of large-scale sensory measurements from Internet and a small number of human inputs for effective network inference through a clustering and semi-supervised learning algorithm. This ap-proach is evaluated on network service disruption induced by Hurricane Katrina at subnet level. The results showed that clustering reduces the spatial dimensionality by 81%, and the subnet statuses inferred by the semi-supervised clas-sifier showed interesting facts of network resilience. The second session was moderated by Dr. Olufemi Omi-taomu. This session featured five paper presentations, cov-ering variety of topics.
 The paper,  X  X patio-Temporal Outlier Detection in Precipi-tation Data X  by Elizabeth Wu, Wei Liu, and Sanjay Chawla, was presented by Elizabeth. This paper address one of the core data mining techniques, outlier detection, from large volumes of spatio-temporal data. Current data min-ing techniques have several limitations in handling spatio-temporal data, therefore it is very important to develop new techniques or extend existing techniques to handle spatio-temporal data. The authors presented a spatio-temporal outlier detection algorithm called Outstretch, which discov-ers the outlier movement patterns of the top-k spatial out-liers over several time periods. The top-k spatial outliers are found using the Exact-Grid Top-k and Approx-Grid Top-k algorithms, which are an extension of algorithms developed by Agarwal et al. [2]. These algorithms use Kulldorff spatial scan statistic, which is designed to discover all outliers, unaf-fected by the neighbouring regions that may contain missing values. After generating the outlier sequences, the authors shows how these sequences can be interpreted, by compar-ing them to the phases of the El Nino Southern Oscilliation (ENSO) weather phenomenon.
 The paper,  X  X robabilistic Analysis of a Large-Scale Urban Traffic Sensor Data Set X  by Jon Hutchins, Alexander Ihler, and Padhraic Smyth, was presented by Jon. It is very impor-tant to detect underlying patterns in large volumes of spa-tiotemporal data as it allows, for example, human behavior modeling, traffic planning, etc. However, real-world sensor time series are often significantly noisy and more difficult to work with than the relatively clean data sets that tend to be used as the basis for experiments in many research pa-pers. In contrast, the authors report on a large case-study involving statistical data mining of over 100 million mea-surements from 1700 freeway traffic sensors over a period of seven months in Southern California. They discussed the challenges posed by the wide variety of different sensor fail-ures and anomalies present in the data. The volume and complexity of the data precludes the use of manual visual-ization or simple thresholding techniques to identify these anomalies. The authors describe the application of prob-abilistic modeling and unsupervised learning techniques to this data set and illustrate how these approaches can suc-cessfully detect underlying systematic patterns even in the presence of substantial noise and missing data.
 The paper,  X  X iFi Miner: An Online Apriori-Infrequent Based Wireless Intrusion Detection System X  by Ahmedur Rahman, C.I. Ezeife, and A.K. Aggarwal, deals with intrusion detec-tion in wireless networks. Their system, WiFi Miner, is ca-pable of finding frequent and infrequent patterns from pre-processed wireless connection records using infrequent pat-tern finding Apriori algorithm. This online Apriori-Infrequent algorithm improves the join and prune step of the traditional Apriori algorithm with a rule that avoids joining itemsets not likely to produce frequent itemsets. An anomaly score is then assigned to each packet (record) based on whether the record has more frequent or infrequent patterns. Con-nection records with positive anomaly scores have more in-frequent patterns than frequent patterns and are considered as anomalous packets. The authors described a solution that eliminates the need for hard-to-obtain training data in wire-less network environments, and increases intrusion detection rate and reduces false alarms.
 The paper,  X  X obile Visualization for Sensory Data Stream Mining X  by Pari Delir Haghighi, Brett Gillick, Shonali Kr-ishnaswamy, Mohamed Medhat Gaber, and Arkady Zaslavsky, introduces an integrated architecture of situation aware adap-tive data mining and mobile visualization techniques for ubiquitous computing environments. With the emergence of ubiquitous data mining and recent advances in mobile com-munications, there is a need for visualization techniques to enhance the user-interactions, realtime decision making and comprehension of the results of mining algorithms. To ad-dress this important problem, the authors proposed a novel architecture for situation-aware adaptive visualization that applies intelligent visualization techniques to data stream mining of sensory data. Their architecture incorporates fuzzy logic principles for modeling and reasoning about con-text/situations and performs gradual adaptation of data mining and visualization parameters according to the oc-curring situations. A prototype of the architecture is imple-mented using J2ME and tested in the area of health-care monitoring.
 The paper,  X  X ense Pixel Visualization for Mobile Sensor Data Mining X  by Pedro Pereira Rodrigues and Joo Gama, describes dense pixel visualization techniques for visualiz-ing sensor data and as well as absolute errors resulting from predictive models. Sensor data is usually represented by streaming time series. Current state-of-the-art systems for visualization include line plots and three-dimensional rep-resentations, which most of the time require screen resolu-tions that are not available in small transient mobile devices. Moreover, when data presents cyclic behaviors, such as in the electricity domain, predictive models may tend to give higher errors in certain recurrent points of time, but the human-eye is not trained to notice these cycles in a long stream. To overcome some of these limitations, the authors proposed a simple dense pixel display visualization system, exploiting the benefits that it may represent on detecting and correcting recurrent faulty predictions. A case study is also presented, where a simple corrective strategy is studied in the context of global electrical load demand, exemplifying the utility of the new visualization method when compared with automatic detection of recurrent errors. This session which was moderated by Dr. Joao Gama, fea-tured our second invited speaker, Prof. Jiawei Han, and two paper presentations. Prof. Jiawei X  X  talk on  X  X ata Mining in Sensor Network Systems: Trouble-Shooting and Shooting-Trouble X  captures dual application of data mining and touches recent advances made in the filed. Abstract of Prof. Jaiawei Han X  X  talk is given below.  X  Data mining will play an essential role in the development of robust sensor network systems. The talk will discuss our recent work in two research frontiers: (1) how to develop effective data mining methods for troubleshooting in the de-velopment of robust sensor network systems; and (2) how to develop new data mining methods for shooting troubles (i.e., anomalies) in data streams, which should be an essential function in sensor network systems.
 Handling the first task leads to a tool, called DustMiner, for uncovering bugs due to interactive complexity in net-worked sensing applications. Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individ-ually non-faulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable, making them partic-ularly hard to find, as the particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behav-ior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes of failure. The tool helped uncover event sequences that lead to a highly degraded mode of operation. Fixing the problem significantly improved the performance of the protocol.
 For shooting troubles (i.e., anomalies) in sensor network systems, we propose a new approach to build predictive mod-els for rare events in sensor data streams. The method estimates reliable posterior probabilities using an ensemble of models to match the distribution over under-samples of negatives and repeated samples of positives (i.e., anoma-lies). We formally show some interesting and important properties of the proposed framework, e.g., reliability of es-timated probabilities on skewed positive class, accuracy of estimated probabilities, efficiency and scalability. Experi-ments are performed on several synthetic as well as real-world datasets with skewed distributions, and they demon-strate that our framework has substantial advantages over existing approaches in estimation reliability and predication accuracy. X  The paper,  X  X onitoring Incremental Histogram Distribu-tion for Change Detection in Data Streams X  by Raquel Se-bastio, Joo Gama, Pedro Pereira Rodrigues, and Joo Bernardes, addresses important problem of detecting changes in con-structing histograms from time-changing high-speed data streams. Histograms are a common technique for density estimation and they have been widely used as a tool in ex-ploratory data analysis. Learning histograms from static and stationary data is a well known topic. In this paper au-thors present algorithms to detect changes from high-speed time-changing data streams. The authors studied strategies to detect changes in the distribution generating examples, and adapt the histogram to the most recent data by forget-ting outdated data. They used the Partition Incremental Discretization algorithm for this task. The authors com-pared the distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence, defining a threshold for change detection decision based on the asymmetry of this measure and evaluated their algo-rithm on controlled artificial data. The final session was moderated by Dr. Nitesh Chawla. This session featured four paper presentations.
 The paper,  X  X nsupervised Plan Detection with Factor Graphs X  by George B. Davis, Jamie Olson, and Kathleen M. Car-ley, describes synchronous and asynchronous expectation maximization algorithms for unsupervised learning in factor graphs. Recognizing plans of moving agents is a natural goal for many sensor systems, with applications including robotic path finding, traffic control, and detection of anomalous be-havior. However, plan recognition gets complicated in the absence of contextual information such as labeled plans and relevant locations. Authors introduced two unsupervised methods to simultaneously estimate model parameters and hidden values within a Factor graph representing agent tran-sitions over time. These algorithms were evaluated by ap-plying them on a GPS tracking dataset consisting of 1074 ships over 5 days in the English channel. Initial results in-dicated that a reasonable model may be inferred on this difficult problem.
 The paper,  X  X n Adaptive Sensor Mining Framework for Per-vasive Computing Applications X  by Parisa Rashidi and Di-ane J. Cook, presents adaptive data mining framework for detecting patterns in sensor data. Mining sequences of sen-sor events poses unique challenges to the KDD community especially when the underlying data source is dynamic and the patterns change. In this papers the authors have in-troduced an adaptive data mining framework that detects patterns in sensor data, and more importantly, adapts to the changes in the underlying model. The frequent and pe-riodic patterns of data are first discovered by the Frequent and Periodic Pattern Miner (FPPM) algorithm; and then any changes in the discovered patterns over the lifetime of the system are discovered by the Pattern Adaptation Miner (PAM) algorithm, in order to adapt to the changing envi-ronment. This framework also captures vital context infor-mation present in pervasive computing applications, such as the startup triggers and temporal information. This data mining framework is evaluated using the data collected in the CASAS smart home testbed.
 The paper,  X  X patiotemporal Neighborhood Discovery for Sensor Data X  by Michael P. McGuire, Vandana P. Janeja, and Aryya Gangopadhyay, describes a framework for the dis-covery of spatiotemporal neighborhoods in sensor datasets where a time series of data is collected at many spatial lo-cations. The purpose of the spatiotemporal neighborhoods is to provide regions in the data where knowledge discovery tasks such as outlier detection, can be focused. As build-ing blocks for the spatiotemporal neighborhoods, authors have developed a method to generate spatial neighborhoods and a method to discretize temporal intervals. These meth-ods were tested on real life datasets including (a) sea sur-face temperature data from the Tropical Atmospheric Ocean Project (TAO) array in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean and (b) highway sensor network data archive and initial results were encouraging.
 The paper,  X  X xploiting Spatial and Data Correlations for Approximate Data Collection in Wireless Sensor Networks X  by Chih-Chieh, Hung Wen-Chih, Peng York, Shang-Hua Tsai and Wang-Chien Lee, describes algorithms for finding representative sensor nodes. Finding sensor nodes with sim-ilar readings is an important task as it allows data reduction. However, efficiently identifying the sensor groups and their representative nodes is a very challenging task. Authors pro-posed an algorithm, namely DCglobal, to determine a set of representative nodes that have high energy levels and wide data coverage ranges, where a data coverage range of a sen-sor node is the set of sensor nodes whose reading vectors are very close to the sensor node. Furthermore, they propose a maintenance mechanism to dynamically select alternative representative nodes when the representative nodes have less energy or representative nodes can no longer capture spa-tial correlation within their data coverage ranges. Experi-mental studies on both synthetic and real datasets, showed that DCglobal was able to effectively and efficiently provide approximate data collection while prolonging the network lifetime.
 Closing remarks of the workshop were provided by Dr. Raju Vatsavai. He summarized the days proceedings by thanking invited speakers, sponsors, program committee members, and participants.
