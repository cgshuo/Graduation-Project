 Morphologica l segmentation, which breaks words into the basic syntactic or semantic formation retr ieval and speech recognition [ 1]. Morphological segmentation has been a r esearch focu s in recent years [ 2]. 
Mongolian is a morphological rich minority language which has significant diffe r-ence compared with Chinese. Mongolian word is generated by connecting stem and none or one or more affixes according to the grammatical order. There are consider a-ble independence between stem and additional ingredient which are just affixed when needed. There are about more than 30000 stems and 297 inflectional affixes in Mo n-golian [ 3]. Theoretically speaking, Mongolian word form will be derived in expone n-tial growth. Table 1 illustrates the morphology of Mongolian.

From table 1, we can conduct that Mongolian is a rich morphology language and morphological segmentation is necessary for Mongolian natural language processing.
Previous work on Mongolian morphological segmentation is based on dictionaries, rules and statistics [ 4-9]. These proposed methods in previous work have achieved good segmentation results, however, they need lots of annotated training data or co m-plicated r ules concluded by linguists. The building of fundamental resource for Mo n-golian is very time -consuming, which is extremely difficult for researchers who do Mongolian morphological segmentation from scratch.

Difference with above work, we explore a novel and effective semi -supervised morphological segmentation method for a practical application, i.e., statistical m a-of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data are ava ilable. We aim to leverage the large unlabeled data to alleviate some drawbacks caused by the lack of the labeled data, and reduce the reliance on the manual annotation.
 The framework of the paper is shown in Figure 1.

Semi -supervised learning includes three steps by small amount of labeled data and abundant amount of unlabeled data. First, we investigate a CRF -based supervised learning to predict morpheme boundaries via small amount of labeled data. Then, the abundant unlabeled data is exploited to compensate the weakness of the CRF -based segmentation. Finally, we present some error correction models to revise segment a-tion results.

As the proposed method is for statistical machine translation, we integrate mo r-phemes into Chinese -Mongolian SMT by the combination of word alignment and morpheme -based alignment. The translation results demonstrate that morphological segmentation based on small amount of labeled data can help to achieve a satisfactory translation performance. 2.1 CRF -based Segmentation Conditional random fields [ 10] is a probabilistic models to segment and label s e-quence data, which can avoid label bias problem. Assume X is the the random vari a-ble over data sequence to be labeled and Y is the random variable over corresponding label sequence. Let G= ( V,E ) denote s an undirected graphical model, where v  X  V dencies among random variables. P ( Y|X ) is a conditional random fields if the follo w-ing formula is established for any vertex v : where w~v means w and v are neighbors in G and w  X  v means all vertices except v.
In this paper, we simplify the CRF into linear chain conditional random fields by assuming X and Y have the same graphical structure, since we regard Mongolian mo r-phological segmentation as sequence labeling problem.

Formally, given X=x (characters in a word ) and Y=y (classes corresponding to ch a-racters), the probability P ( y|x ) is written as : 
In the subsection, only small amount of labeled data is exploited to accomplish pure supervised segmentation. It should be noted that there exists stem lemmatization in morphological segmentation. For example, Mongolian word  X  BAYIG _A X  has a stem  X  X AI X  and an affix  X  X  _A X . Since labeled data is small, we just ignore the stem lemmatization in a low -resource setting. The performance of SMT with morpholog i-cal information demonstrates the effectiveness of semi -supervised segmentation a l-though we ignore the stem lemmatization. In this paper,  X  X AYIG _A X  wil l be se g-mented to  X  X AYI X  and  X  X  _A X . The tag set used in conditional random fields is shown in Table 2.

Feature extraction is the key issue for conditional random fields. We describe the pendence. 2.2 Lexicon -based Segmentation The performance of CRF -based model will be limited due to t he small amount of labeled data. In this subsection, we explore a lexicon -based segmentation model which utilizes large unlabeled data to overcome the weakness of CRF -based model. given small labeled data as heuristic information.

We follow the work [ 11], which is a generative probabilistic model, in this subse c-tion. The model parameters  X  encode a morph lexicon, which includes the properties of the morphs, such as their string representations. Each morph m in the lexicon has a probability of occurring in a word. The probabilities are assumed to be independent. The model uses a prior P (  X  ) derived using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. During model learning,  X  is optimized to maximize the posterior probabil i-ty: where D w includes words in the training data.

The cost function is expressed as:
We process o ne word at a time, and the segmentation that minimizes the cost fun c-tion with the optimal model parameters is selected:
Then, the parameters are updated:
We repeatedly exploit small amount of labeled data as the heuristic information to train morph lexicon with the large unlabeled data, which perform Expectation -Maximization (EM) using the Viterbi algorithm on the morphological segmentation. The lexicon -based model proposed in this subsection is exploited to segment the Mongolian words which is error from the CRF -based model. We have an inflectional mented by the CRF -based model is not found in the inflectional affix dictionary, we explore the lexicon -based model to segment its word form. 2.3 Error Correction We find the e rror in CRF -based segmentation and lexicon -based segmentation a c-cor ding to inflectio nal affix dictionary and employ the lexicon model of word and its affix, the reverse maximum match with 1 -gram model of affix to correct the mistake. We search the most pos sible affix for the error segmentation result based on the le x-icon model. If the affix is not found in lexicon model, we use reverse maximum match method to obtain the final segmentation result.

The lexicon model of word and its affix is lowing decision rule segmentation affix. 3.1 Morphological Segmentation In this subsection, we will report the data set, evaluation metric and experimental results. We extract 80 0 high frequency words from Mongolian monolingual corpus and the 800 Mongolian word types are segmented by the linguists manually. Note that a Mongolian word may have different segmentations due to the different context and we choose the most frequent one. We only use 800 high frequency words as small labeled data in this paper. And it is different with much related work [ 4, 5, 7, 9, 12], which exploit large amount of labeled sentences. The test set contains 1000 sentences. 29.4% word tokens in the test set are unknown words.
 A Mongolian word is segmented correctly when both stem and affix is correct. Since semi -supervised segmentation in the paper is used to improve the performance of Chinese -Mongolian SMT, we utilize stem of Mongolian word in the word alig n-ment step and ignore the boundaries between different affixes. In this paper, we assess the segmentation results with stem -level accuracy as evaluation indicators. Experimental results are shown in Table 3.

From Table 3, we can conclude that the accuracy of our semi -supervised morph o-logical segmentation , which uses CRF -based segmentation, lexicon -based segment a-tion and error correction, could reach 90.03% although 29.4% word tokens in the test set are unknown words. The segmentation accuracy improves significantly when we utilize lexicon -based approach fo r the errors in CRF -based segmentation, demonstra t-ing that large unlabeled data is useful for Mongolian morphological segmentation.
There are large amount of labeled sentences needed in related work, while semi -supervised learning we proposed only need 800 high frequency words annotation rather than labeled sentences. The comparative experiments are not conducted b e-cause much related work need labeled sentences, which capture the context inform a-tion for n -grams. 3.2 Improved SMT with Morpheme Our Chinese -Mongol ian parallel corpus is obtained from the 5th China Workshop on Machine Translation (CWMT 2009). The statistics of the experimental data are listed in Table 4, where 500 X 4 means that each source sentence has four reference se n-tences.
 In this subsection, we integrate Mongolian morpheme information into Chines e-Mongolian SMT. Generally speaking, we use Mongolian stem rather than word to generate word alignment matrix with Chinese word sequence. The word alignment matrix that contains morpheme information is use d to replace the word alignment result of baseline SMT. Besides, we explore the two alignment results combination to further improve the translation performance.

The baseline is a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation system. We conduct two group experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method.

We employ GIZA++ and grow -diag -final -and [ 13] heuristic to generate the bid i-rectional word alignment. A 3 -gram language model with modified Kneser -Ney parser [1 6] to parse Chinese sentences. The log -linear model feature weights are with BLEU [1 8]. We use toolkit ICTCLAS for Chines e word segmentation. Max i-mum phrase length is set to 7 when extracting phrase pair. We run each experiment 3 times and get the average BLEU score as the experimental result.

Table 5 illustrates translation results, where  X  X  X  denotes the standard phrase -bas ed system,  X  X  X  denotes that we use Mongolian stem rather than word to generate word alignment matrix with Chinese word sequence. The word alignment matrix which contains morpheme information is used to replace the alignment result of system  X  X  X  .  X  X  X  denotes we combine the alignment results of both  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  at the same time.
From Table 5, we can conclude that morphological information segmented by semi -supervised learning improves the performance of SMT significantly.

In order to have a better intuition about the performance improvement, we compare translation result between system  X  X  X  and system  X  X  X . Figure 2 illustrates the transla-tion results, where  X  X ource sentence X  means Chinese sentence to be translated into Mongolian,  X  X n glish translation X  denotes the corresponding English translation for better understanding,  X  X ef0 X  to  X  X ef3 X  denotes source sentence is translated by four Mongolian linguistic experts independently since the correct answer of translation result is not uniqu e. 
The example is the selection of the correct morphology.  X  X ystem A X  predicts the verb  X   X   X  of the source sentence as  X  X VGV X . Although  X  X VGV X  is the translation of  X   X   X   X  is t he first person,  X  X VGVY_ A X  not only means  X   X   X  but also represents grammatical meaning. Hence,  X  X ystem C X  can generate correct morphology of Mo n-golian. Mongolian morphological segmentation has been a research focus recently. Generally speaking, previous work are based on dictionaries, rules and statistics [ 4-9]. (Nasanurtu, 1997) [ 19] proposed the method of combining rule -based and dicti o-nary to accomplish Mongolian word segmentation. The construction of the rules and dictionary need significantly efforts by linguists. (Hou, et al., 2009) [ 6] used rules to segment Mongolian words and applied Mongolian statistical language model to eli m-inate the ambiguity in the process. However, the rules may also be conflicted with each other.
 Statist ical methods are the dominant approaches. (He, et al., 2012) exploited a HMM -based approach [ 8] for Mongolian morphological segmentation. Besides, CRF -based model [ 7, 9] achieved outstanding performance. Some approach [1 2] combined the statistical machine translation method and the minimum constituent context cost model to accomplish Mongolian morphological segmentation, which handled in-vocabulary and out -of-vocabulary Mongolian words well respectively. However, these approaches did not pay much attention on word formation characteristics of the morphology. (Jiang, et al., 2011) [ 4, 5 ] proposed a directed graph model for Mongolian lexical analysis. This model described the lexical analysis result as a directed graph and used segmented and tagged candidate for each word according to the context.

The methods mentioned above need lots of annotated training data or complicated rules concluded by linguists, and the construction process is significantly time -consuming.

Difference from above work, we explore a novel and effective method which use large unlabeled data to compensate the weakness of the lack of labeled data. Our work more attention to the performance of machine translation system. We explore the semi -supervised learning for Mongolian morphological segmentation. To our kno w-ledge, it is the first time for Mongolian to apply semi -supe rvised morphological se g-mentation. The paper proposes a method, which makes full use of large unlabeled data and small labeled data, to segment Mongolian words into morphemes. We investigate a CRF -based supervised learning to pre dict morpheme boundaries via small amount of l a-beled data. Besides, the abundant unlabeled data is exploited to compensate the weakness of the small amount of labeled data. Furthermore, some error correction models are exploited to revise segmentation resu lts. The experimental results on mo r-phological segmentation and Chinese -Mongolian SMT demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, we make the following contributions.
