 High-quality automatic evaluation has be-come increasingly important as various ma-chine translation systems have developed. The scores of some automatic evaluation meth-ods can obtain high correlation with human judgment in document-level automatic evalua-tion(Coughlin, 2007). However, sentence-level automatic evaluation is insufficient. A great gap exists between language processing of au-tomatic evaluation and the processing by hu-mans. Therefore, in recent years, various au-tomatic evaluation methods particularly ad-dressing sentence-level automatic evaluations have been proposed. Methods based on word strings ( e.g. , BLEU(Papineni et al., 2002), NIST(NIST, 2002), METEOR(Banerjee and Lavie., 2005), ROUGE-L(Lin and Och, 2004), and IMPACT(Echizen-ya and Araki, 2007)) calculate matching scores using only common words between MT outputs and references from bilingual humans. However, these meth-ods cannot determine the correct word corre-spondences sufficiently because they fail to fo-cus solely on phrase correspondences. More-over, various methods using syntactic analyt-ical tools(Pozar and Charniak, 2006; Mutton et al., 2007; Mehay and Brew, 2007) are pro-posed to address the sentence structure. Nev-ertheless, those methods depend strongly on the quality of the syntactic analytical tools.
As described herein, for use with MT sys-tems, we propose a new automatic evaluation method using noun-phrase chunking to obtain higher sentence-level correlations. Using noun phrases produced by chunking, our method yields the correct word correspondences and determines the similarity between two sen-tences in terms of the noun phrase order of ap-pearance. Evaluation experiments using MT outputs obtained by 12 machine translation systems in NTCIR-7(Fujii et al., 2008) demon-strate that the scores obtained using our sys-tem yield the highest correlation with the hu-man judgments among the automatic evalua-tion methods in both sentence-level adequacy and fluency. Moreover, the differences be-tween correlation coefficients obtained using our method and other methods are statisti-cally significant at the 5% or lower signifi-cance level for adequacy. Results confirmed that our method using noun-phrase chunking is effective for automatic evaluation for ma-chine translation. The system based on our method has four pro-cesses. First, the system determines the corre-spondences of noun phrases between MT out-puts and references using chunking. Secondly, the system calculates word-level scores based on the correct matched words using the deter-mined correspondences of noun phrases. Next, the system calculates phrase-level scores based on the noun-phrase order of appearance. The system calculates the final scores combining word-level scores and phrase-level scores. 2.1 Correspondence of Noun Phrases The system obtains the noun phrases from each sentence by chunking. It then determines corresponding noun phrases between MT out-puts and references calculating the similarity for two noun phrases by the PER score(Su et al., 1992). In that case, PER scores of two kinds are calculated. One is the ratio of the number of match words between an MT out-put and reference for the number of all words of the MT output. The other is the ratio of the number of match words between the MT out-put and reference for the number of all words of the reference. The similarity is obtained as an F -measure between two PER scores. The high score represents that the similarity be-tween two noun phrases is high. Figure 1 presents an example of the determination of the corresponding noun phrases.
 Figure 1: Example of determination of corre-sponding noun phrases.

In Fig. 1,  X  X he amount X ,  X  X he crowning fall X  and  X  X he end X  are obtained as noun phrases in MT output by chunking, and  X  X t X ,  X  X he end part X ,  X  X he amount X  and  X  X rowning drop X  are obtained in the reference by chunking. Next, the system determines the corresponding noun phrases from these noun phrases between the MT output and reference. The score between  X  X he end X  and  X  X he end part X  is the highest among the scores between  X  X he end X  in the MT output and  X  X t X ,  X  X he end part X ,  X  X he amount X , and  X  X rowning drop X  in the refer-ence. Moreover, the score between  X  X he end part X  and  X  X he end X  is the highest among the scores between  X  X he end part X  in reference and  X  X he amount X ,  X  X he crowning fall X ,  X  X he end X  in the MT output. Consequently,  X  X he end X  and  X  X he end part X  are selected as noun phrases with the highest mutual scores:  X  X he end X  and  X  X he end part X  are determined as one corresponding noun phrase. In Fig. 1,  X  X he amount X  in the MT output and  X  X he amount X  in reference, and  X  X he crowning fall X  in the MT output and  X  X rowning drop X  in the ref-erence also are determined as the respective corresponding noun phrases. The noun phrase for which the score between it and other noun phrases is 0.0 ( e.g. ,  X  X t X  in reference) has no corresponding noun phrase. The use of the noun phrases is effective because the frequency of the noun phrases is higher than those of other phrases. The verb phrases are not used for this study, but they can also be generated by chunking. It is difficult to determine the corresponding verb phrases correctly because the words in each verb phrase are often fewer than the noun phrases. 2.2 Word-level Score The system calculates the word-level scores between MT output and reference using the corresponding noun phrases. First, the sys-tem determines the common words based on Longest Common Subsequence (LCS). The system selects only one LCS route when sev-eral LCS routes exist. In such cases, the sys-tem calculates the Route Score (RS) using the following Eqs. (1) and (2): weight ( w )=
In Eq. (1),  X  is a parameter for length weighting of common parts; it is greater than 1.0. Figure 2 portrays an example of deter-mination of the common parts. In the first process of Fig. 2, LCS is 7. In this example, several LCS routes exist. The system selects the LCS route which has  X , X ,  X  X he amount of X ,  X  X rowning X ,  X  X s X , and  X . X  as the com-mon parts. The common part is the part for which the common words appear contin-uously. In contrast, IMPACT selects a differ-ent LCS route that includes  X , the X ,  X  X mount of X ,  X  X rowning X ,  X  X s X , and  X . X  as the com-mon parts. In IMPACT, using no analytical knowledge, the LCS route is determined using the information of the number of words in the common parts and the position of the com-mon parts. The RS for LCS route selected using our method is 32 (= 1 2 . 0 +(2+2+ 1) RS for LCS route selected by IMPACT is 19 In the LCS route selected by IMPACT, the weight of  X  X he X  in the common part  X , the X  is 1 because  X  X he X  in the reference is not in-cluded in the corresponding noun phrase. In the LCS route selected using our method, the weight of  X  X he X  in  X  X he amount of X  is 2 because  X  X he X  in MT output and  X  X he X  in the reference are included in the corresponding noun phrase  X  X P1 X . Therefore, the system based on our method can select the correct LCS route.

Moreover, the word-level score is calculated using the common parts in the selected LCS route as the following Eqs. (3), (4), and (5). Figure 2: Example of common-part determi-nation.
Equation (3) represents recall and Eq. (4) represents precision. Therein, m signifies the word number of the reference in Eq. (3), and n stands for the word number of the MT out-put in Eq. (4). Here, RN denotes the repe-tition number of the determination process of the LCS route, and i , which has initial value 0, is the counter for RN . In Eqs. (3) and (4),  X  is a parameter for the repetition process of the determination of LCS route, and is less than 1.0. Therefore, R wd and P wd becomes small as the appearance order of the common parts between MT output and reference is different. Moreover, length ( c ) represents the number of words in each common part;  X  is a param-eter related to the length weight of common parts, as in Eq. (1). In this case, the weight of each common word in the common part is 1. The system calculates score wd as the word-level score in Eq. (5). In Eq. (5),  X  is deter-mined as P wd /R wd . The score wd is between 0.0 and 1.0.
In the first process of Fig. 2,  X  i c  X  LCS length ( c )  X  is 13.0 (=0 . 5 0  X  (1  X  are 0.5 and 2.0, respectively. In this case, the counter i is 0. Moreover, in the second process of Fig. 2,  X  i c  X  LCS length ( c )  X  is 2.5 (=0 . 5 1  X  (1 2 . 0 +2 2 . 0 )) using two common parts  X  X he X  and  X  X he end X , except the common parts determined using the first process. In Fig. 2, RN is 1 because the system finishes calculating  X  i c  X  LCS length ( c )  X  when counter i became 1: this means that all common parts were processed until the second process. As a result, R wd is 0.1969 (= (13 . 0+2 . 5) / 20 2 . 0 = and P wd is 0.2625 (= (13 . 0+2 . 5) / 15 2 . 0 =  X  0 . 0689). Consequently, score wd is 0.2164 determine the matching words correctly using the corresponding noun phrases between the MT output and the reference.
 The system calculates score wd multi using R tively, maximum R wd and P wd when multiple references are used as the following Eqs. (6), (7) and (8). In Eq. (8),  X  is determined as P tween 0.0 and 1.0.

P 2.3 Phrase-level Score The system calculates the phrase-level score using the noun phrases obtained by chunking. First, the system extracts only noun phrases from sentences. Then it generalizes each noun phrase as each word. Figure 3 presents exam-ples of generalization by noun phrases.
 Figure 3: Example of generalization by noun phrases.

Figure 3 presents three corresponding noun phrases between the MT output and the refer-ence. The noun phrase  X  X t X , which has no cor-responding noun phrase, is expressed as  X  X P X  in the reference. Consequently, the MT output is generalized as  X  X P1 NP2 NP3 X ; the refer-ence is generalized as  X  X P NP3 NP1 NP2 X .
 Subsequently, the system obtains the phrase-level score between the generalized MT output and reference as the following Eqs. (9), (10), and (11).
 R P
In Eqs. (9) and (10), cnpp denotes the common noun phrase parts; m cnp and n cnp respectively signify the quantities of common noun phrases in the reference and MT output. Moreover, m no cnp and n no cnp are the quanti-ties of noun phrases except the common noun phrases in the reference and MT output. The values of m no cnp and n no cnp are processed as 1 when no non-corresponding noun phrases exist. The square root used for m no cnp and n no cnp is to decrease the weight of the non-corresponding noun phrases. In Eq. (11),  X  is determined as P np /R np . In Fig. 3, R np and P np are 0.7071 (= 0.5 and  X  is 2.0. Therefore, score np is 0.7071.
The system obtains score np multi calculat-ing the average of score np when multiple ref-erences are used as the following Eq. (12). 2.4 Final Score The system calculates the final score by com-bining the word-level score and the phrase-level score as shown in the following Eq. (13).
Therein,  X  represents a parameter for the weight of score np : it is between 0.0 and 1.0. The ratio of score wd to score np is 1:1 when  X  is are used for Eq. (13) in multiple references. In Figs. 2 and 3, the final score between the MT output and the reference is 0.4185 can realize high-quality automatic evaluation using both word-level information and phrase-level information. 3.1 Experimental Procedure We calculated the correlation between the scores obtained using our method and scores produced by human judgment. The system based on our method obtained the evaluation scores for 1,200 English output sentences re-lated to the patent sentences. These English output sentences are sentences that 12 ma-chine translation systems in NTCIR-7 trans-lated from 100 Japanese sentences. Moreover, the number of references to each English sen-tence in 100 English sentences is four. These references were obtained from four bilingual humans. Table 1 presents types of the 12 ma-chine translation systems.

Moreover, three human judges evaluated 1,200 English output sentences from the per-spective of adequacy and fluency on a scale of 1 X 5. We used the median value in the evalua-tion results of three human judges as the final scores of 1 X 5. We calculated Pearson X  X  correla-tion efficient and Spearman X  X  rank correlation efficient between the scores obtained using our method and the scores by human judgments in terms of sentence-level adequacy and fluency.
Additionally, we calculated the correlations between the scores using seven other methods and the scores by human judgments to com-pare our method with other automatic evalua-tion methods. The other seven methods were IMPACT, ROUGE-L, BLEU 1 , NIST, NMG-WN(Ehara, 2007; Echizen-ya et al., 2009), METEOR 2 , and WER(Leusch et al., 2003). Using our method, 0.1 was used as the value of the parameter  X  in Eqs. (3)-(10) and 1.1 was used as the value of the parameter  X  in Eqs. (1) X (10). Moreover, 0.3 was used as the value of the parameter  X  in Eq. (13). These val-ues of the parameter are determined using En-glish sentences from Reuters articles(Utiyama and Isahara, 2003). Moreover, we obtained the noun phrases using a shallow parser(Sha and Pereira, 2003) as the chunking tool. We revised some erroneous results that were ob-tained using the chunking tool. 3.2 Experimental Results As described in this paper, we performed com-parison experiments using our method and seven other methods. Tables 2 and 3 respec-tively show Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient for sentence-level adequacy and fluency. Tables 4 and 5 respectively show Spearman X  X  rank cor-relation coefficient for sentence-level adequacy and fluency. In Tables 2 X 5, bold typeface signifies the maximum correlation coefficients among eight automatic evaluation methods. Underlining in our method signifies that the differences between correlation coefficients ob-tained using our method and IMPACT are statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Moreover,  X  X vg. X  signifies the aver-age of the correlation coefficients obtained by 12 machine translation systems in respective automatic evaluation methods, and  X  X ll X  are the correlation coefficients using the scores of 1,200 output sentences obtained using the 12 machine translation systems. 3.3 Discussion In Tables 2 X 5, the  X  X vg. X  score of our method is shown to be higher than those of other meth-ods. Especially in terms of the sentence-level adequacy shown in Tables 2 and 4,  X  X vg. X  of our method is about 0.03 higher than that of IMPACT. Moreover, in system No. 8 and  X  X ll X  of Tables 2 and 4, the differences be-tween correlation coefficients obtained using our method and IMPACT are statistically sig-nificant at the 5% significance level.

Moreover, we investigated the correlation of machine translation systems of every type. Ta-ble 6 shows  X  X ll X  of Pearson X  X  correlation co-efficient and Spearman X  X  rank correlation coef-ficient in SMT ( i.e. , system Nos. 1 X 2, system Nos. 4 X 8 and system Nos. 10 X 11) and RBMT ( i.e. , system Nos. 3 and 12). The scores of 900 output sentences obtained by 9 machine translation systems in SMT and the scores of 200 output sentences obtained by 2 machine translation systems in RBMT are used respec-tively. However, EBMT is not included in Ta-ble 6 because EBMT is only system No. 9.
 In Table 6, our method obtained the highest correlation among the eight methods, except in terms of the adequacy of RBMT in Pear-son X  X  correlation coefficient. The differences between correlation coefficients obtained us-ing our method and IMPACT are statistically significant at the 5% significance level for ad-equacy of SMT.

To confirm the effectiveness of noun-phrase chunking, we performed the experiment using a system combining BLEU with our method.
 In this case, BLEU scores were used as score wd in Eq. (13). This experimental result is shown as  X  X LEU with our method X  in Tables 2 X 5. In the results of  X  X LEU with our method X  in Ta-bles 2 X 5, underlining signifies that the differ-ences between correlation coefficients obtained using BLEU with our method and BLEU alone are statistically significant at the 5% signif-icance level. The coefficients of correlation for BLEU with our method are higher than those of BLEU in any machine translation sys-tem,  X  X vg. X  and  X  X ll X  in Tables 2 X 5. More-over, for sentence-level adequacy, BLEU with our method is significantly better than BLEU in almost all machine translation systems and  X  X ll X  in Tables 2 and 4. These results indicate that our method using noun-phrase chunking is effective for some methods and that it is statistically significant in each machine trans-lation system, not only  X  X ll X , which has large sentences.

Subsequently, we investigated the precision of the determination process of the corre-sponding noun phrases described in section 2.1: in the results of system No. 1, we cal-culated the precision as the ratio of the num-ber of the correct corresponding noun phrases for the number of all noun-phrase correspon-dences obtained using the system based on our method. Results show that the precision was 93.4%, demonstrating that our method can de-termine the corresponding noun phrases cor-rectly.

Moreover, we investigated the relation be-tween the correlation obtained by our method and the quality of chunking. In  X  X ur method X  shown in Tables 2 X 5, noun phrases for which some erroneous results obtained using the chunking tool were revised.  X  X ur method II X  of Tables 2 X 5 used noun phrases that were given as results obtained using the chunk-ing tool. Underlining in  X  X ur method II X  of Tables 2 X 5 signifies that the differences be-tween correlation coefficients obtained using our method II and IMPACT are statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Fun-damentally, in both  X  X vg. X  and  X  X ll X  of Ta-bles 2 X 5, the correlation coefficients of our method II without the revised noun phrases are lower than those of our method using the revised noun phrases. However, the difference between our method and our method II in  X  X vg. X  and  X  X ll X  of Tables 2 X 5 is not large. The performance of the chunking tool has no great influence on the results of our method because score wd in Eqs. (3), (4), and (5) do not depend strongly on the performance of the chunking tool. For example, in sentences shown in Fig. 2, all common parts are the same as the common parts of Fig. 2 when  X  X he crowning fall X  in the MT output and  X  X rown-ing drop X  in the reference are not determined as the noun phrases. Other common parts are determined correctly because the weight of the common part  X  X he amount of X  is higher than those of other common parts by Eqs. (1) and (2). Consequently, the determination of the common parts except  X  X he amount of X  is not difficult.

In other language sentences, we already per-formed the experiments using Japanese sen-tences from Reuters articles(Oyamada et al., 2010). Results show that the correlation co-efficients of IMPACT with our method, for which IMPACT scores were used as score wd in Eq. (13), were highest among some methods. Therefore, our method might not be language-dependent. Nevertheless, experiments using various language data are necessary to eluci-date this point. As described herein, we proposed a new auto-matic evaluation method for machine transla-tion. Our method calculates the scores for MT outputs using noun-phrase chunking. Conse-quently, the system obtains scores using the correctly matched words and phrase-level in-formation based on the corresponding noun phrases. Experimental results demonstrate that our method yields the highest correlation among eight methods in terms of sentence-level adequacy and fluency.

Future studies will improve our method, enabling it to achieve high correlation in sentence-level fluency. Future studies will also include experiments using data of various lan-guages.
