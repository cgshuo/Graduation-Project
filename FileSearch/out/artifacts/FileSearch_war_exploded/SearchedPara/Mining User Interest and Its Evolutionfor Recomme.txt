 The micro-blogging (also named as post) allows users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links. As a convenient com-munication means, especia lly with mobile phone, micro-blogging has been prevailing at Internet. Sina micro-blogging system would produce 25,000,000 Chinese posts each day, and Twitter get 50,000,000 posts each day. The information explosion of posts certainly brings the problem of predicting and recommending really interested micro-blogging for a user.

Recommender systems usually apply information filtering techniques to create rec-ommendations that are indeed of users X  interest. These recommender approaches seek to predict the users X   X  X reference X  on the posts they had not yet operated, using models built with the characteristics of posts, like content based approaches, or the user X  X  inter-action, like collaborative filtering approach es. Also the combined models are schemed and proved more effectively on some cases. In our opinion, the social networking func-tions of micro-blogging reflect users X  preference to some extent, and should not be neglected. People prefer to browse and retweet those important users X  posts that con-centrates on a specialized topic, i.e, the leader opinion. We think that the hybrid user interest model that combines users X  social interaction on posts would demonstrate more accurate recommendations than those appro aches that only rely on a single source in a micro-blogging system.

As we noticed, micro-blogging also has the characteristic that the focus changes very quickly because of the topic explosion cause d by live discussion on breaking news or other themes at Internet, which also changes and influences users X  interests unobtru-sively and quickly. We need to consider the time factor to improve the user interest model. i.e. the evolution of user interest.

In this paper, we first define the concepts related with the user interest model, in-troduce the content based user interest model based on the topic model. Second, social interaction information extracted from post operations is collected to model the con-nection based user interest model, and then a hybrid model is schemed to calculate user preference. Finally we define two time factor s modeling evolution of user interest, and recommend top N posts calculated by the approach introduced. A post in a micro-blogging system always includes two basic information: the post content and the user interaction information. Our work is closely related with two kinds of basic approaches: recommender system and social network analysis. Researchers have done much work in these fields.

Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations through collab-orative filtering [1] or content-based filtering [2]. Modeling user interest is common practice for the construction of recommendation engines such as Amazon 1 ,Netflix 2 nowadays. Also different models are enhanced to model user interest for recommen-dation based on collaborative filtering [3][4], LDA [5] topic model [6], or author topic model [7]. Basically, these methods used item p reference predicting user interest within the system.

Within the social network analysis area, the social information is widely used to model the user interest [8]. Also the user X  X  social relations can be used to improve per-sonalized social recommendation [9], boosting information sharing among users with similar interests [10], and user similarity on social media [11].

Recently, with the rising popularity of micro-blogging, much research work have been taken out leveraging both the content and connection information. [12] studied content recommendation on Twitter and explored three separate dimensions: content sources, topic interest models for users, and social voting to improve performance of recommending interesting contents. TweetSieve [13] exploited that events catch user interest gain distinguishably more attention than the average mentioning of the sub-ject. Also, twitter based user interest model can be applied to emotion summariza-tion [14], recommend real-time topical news [15], understand temporal dynamics of sentiment [16].
Most of work on micro-blogging introduced above were presented with user interest model considering both of textual content and social network, while the topics in micro-blogging systems are diverse and changing quickly, which brings difficulty to model users X  short-term interest. Research work [17 X 19] presented new models to capture so-cial network evolution [17], topic evolution [18] and community evolution [19]. These work would help us to model the user interest evolution both for the topic evolution and the social network evolution through consid ering time decay factors and rebuilding the user interest at each timestamp.

The work most similar to ours are [20] [21]. [20] proposed a method of making tweet recommendations based on collaborative ranking to capture personal interests. Their work considered three major elements on Twitter: tweet topic level factors, user social relation factors and explicit features such as authority of the publisher and quality of the tweet. [21] proposed a collaborative filtering approach to take user interest evo-lution into account. In that work, a clustering algorithm was first adopted to group the similar items. Subsequently, the preference of each cluster was calculated by the given preferences on each item in this cluster as we ll as the corresponding timestamps. Dif-ferent from this work, we consider social networking functions to model user interest accurately since the connection informatio n in a micro-blogging system plays the same important role with the textual content. As described above, our user interest model is derived from two sources: post contents and user connections. The post content means the semantics a post wants to express which is always represented with a set of keywords. The user connection is implied by the operations on the post like  X  X ollowing X ,  X  X ommenting X ,  X  X etweeting X . To catch a user X  X  short-term interest without losing the long-term interests, two time factors are introduced to illustrate the principles of user interest evolution. 3.1 Content Based User Interest Intuitively, user interest is a set of user pre ferences on some specialized topics, which can be abstracted from latent topic lt learned from visited posts po . That means a user u may operate different posts, a post has probability distribution on different latent topics, and thus brings the user interest on latent topics.
 DEFINITION 1 (LATENT TOPIC). A latent topic lt is what a post po is talking about. Each post can be represente d with probability distribution on a set of latent topic lt : bility distribution lt = { p ( w 1 ) ,p ( w 2 ) , ..., p ( w i ) } on a set of keywords w . The concept of latent topic is very similar with the current prevailing topic model. Topic model is a generative model, in which a document D is presented as random mixtures over topic lt , and each topic lt is characterized by a probability distribution over keyword terms w . We adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5] to calculate the probability distribution of post po on latent topic lt . LDA constructs a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model based on the idea of topics. We use LDA to generate each post po with multinomial dirichlet distribution over topics lt . Then repeatedly sample each topic lt with multinomial distribution over words w .
Equation (1) calculates the topic lt distribution on keywords w , and Equation (2) presents the post po distribution on topics lt . In the three level Bayesian network of LDA, parameter  X  and  X  are applied to corpus level where  X  is a k vector and  X  is a k  X  V matrix ( k is the the dimensionality of the topic lt , V is the length of a keywords vector from a vocabulary).  X  is a document level variable which presents multinomial distribution over topic lt n and  X  k i =1  X  =1 .The lt n and w n are word level variables which measures the multinomial probability between a word w n in post po with a topic lt n . Then the user X  X  preference on a specialized latent topic is defined as follows: calculated by Equation (1)(2), P po l u post po l .Wehave After calculating user preference on each la tent topic, each user has his/her preference vector on topics, we then acquire those similar neighbors for the current user.
We adopt current popular l1-distance similarity measure to estimate the user similar-ity of two users u i and u j based on the corresponding preference vector on topics. The user similarity is defined as: where C K is the total number of the latent topics.

Before calculating the user preference on the posts, we would first introduce the con-nection based user interest model, and combine two kinds of user similarity functions to calculate the hybrid user preference on the posts.
 3.2 Connection Based User Interest Users X  operations on posts also bring another source for recommendation. In the content based user interest model, we have got C K topics, and then found those similar users based on these topics. In the approach of connection based user interest model, we would first define the concept of user popularity to measure the importance of each user u on each topic lt .
 DEFINITION 2 (USER POPULARITY). User popularity shows how popular a user u i measured with the connections between users extracted from the operations (comment, retweet, favorite, and other behaviors) on the posts .

We assume that if a post is created by a user and is operated by an another user on a topic, a directed link is constructed between these two users to represent their connection. In this link, the user who made the operation would be the start point of the directed line, and the user who was ope rated (such as being commented, being retweeted) would be viewed as the end point of the directed line.

We give an example of the links between users in the same topic and in the different topics shown in Figure 1. For the user U i in topic A , there are four types of connections: and the end point from outer topic C . Also two users may have dual link since they may make operations on each othe r separately in topic D , we would make two connections for these dual links for simplicity.

Intuitively, we say the in degree is more important than the out degree, and the degree out of the cluster would reduce the user popularity in a topic cluster. Thus the user popularity up m is defined as follows: where each u k is connected with user u i ,and u inner cluster, is the number of connections to u i out of cluster, from u i out of cluster.

To m a ke up ( m ) C l u divided with ( D u i +  X  1  X 
Then each user has his/her personal popul arity vector on topics. We adopt the co-sine similarity measure to estimate the user similarity of users u i and u j basedonthe corresponding popularity vectors. The cosine similarity measure is defined as: 3.3 Combined User Interest In this paper, user interest would be modeled with the content of post and connection of users. We combine Equation (5) and (7) to provide the hybrid similarity of users as presented with Equation (8). We then identify top N C nearest neighbors for the user according to Equation (8). With the top N C neighbors, the user preference on a post po is defined as follows. where V ( UIM po m u P Equation (4). P po m lt calculated by Equation (1)(2).

We then generate the recommendations selecting top N p posts with the highest val-ues of UIM po u to a user. 3.4 User Interest Evolution Micro-blogging is a place to share those latest news and information, which also brings the issue of changing focuses very quickly for a user. For example, a user would con-centrate on  X  X ocial network analysis X  at this moment, and  X  X ooking X  at next moment. These two topics are totally unrelated, whereas they illustrate real interest change for a user at different periods.

We made an investigation on two users concentrating their interest change from 01/01/2012 to 31/03/2012. User u 1 is a software engineer, he focuses on the topics related with his work at timestamp 01/01-10/01. He then will change his interest since he plans to travel for his Spring Festival at the next timestamp. Finally he will change his interest again when he is back to work. User u 2 is a computer scientist, he is inter-ested in the topic  X  X ene search X  since he would write a conference paper related to this topic with his novel data mining algorithm. He would finally present the same interest as the one at the first period since he has finished this conference paper.
We define two time factors to model user interest evolution: decay factor  X  df and near time factor  X  ntf . Decay factor aims to reduce the impact of the post which is published or discussed long time ago. Near time factor aims to increase the impact of the post which is published or discussed at current time.

Consequently, to calculate V ( UIM po m u and near time factor  X  ntf which can be measured as follows: where  X t is a timestamp to cut posts to different periods, t 0 is labeled as the initial time and set as 01/10/2011 in this paper, t i is the operation time on the post. w t is measured as follows: N max is the maximum value that aims to omit those overdue posts long time ago.
We then apply the above equations to update the user preference on the post after each timestamp  X t . 3.5 Recommending Recommending is a process of selecting top N p posts with highest preference values calculated by our user interest model. Considering the calculation of user preference is a time consuming process, we prefer to execute the algorithm at each timestamp  X t . We crawled 1,201,799 original micro-bloggings from Sina Weibo micro-blogging sys-tem with its API from 2011/10/01 to 2012/3/31. There are 726,552 new posts, 475,247 retweets, 506,239 comments, 456,720 @, 19,982 tags, and 10,300 favorites from 3,312 users. In the collected dataset, we choose our training dataset from 2011/10/01 to 2011/11/30, and the remains as the test dataset. In this training dataset, there are 304,160 micro-bloggings and 914,873 words identified by Chinese terms. Considering the par-ticularity of the Chinese micro-blogging system, we generated these Chinese terms from several basic corpus, including Sogou Pinyin input dict 3 , nlpir micro-blogging corpus 4 . Moreover, to avoid the possible bias of training user preference, we randomly choose 50 users from our dataset, and  X  X  X  them with those individual recommend-ing micro-bloggings. The volunteers showed their best effort helping to retweet those perferred micro-bloggings.

We adopt the evaluation criteria precision to evaluate the prediction accuracy, which is widely used in the information ret rieval area and defined as follows: where hits presents the number of recommending pos ts that are labeled as interested ones, and N p is the total recommendations produced by our approach. 4.1 Parameters Tuning for User Interest Model Our model would involves several parameters, including the number of topics C K ,the weight of connection  X  , the weight of similarity  X  , the timestamp of interest change  X t , the maximum value to omit overdue posts N max , the number of neighbors N C ,and the number of recommending results N p . Because these parameters interact with each other and effect the final result of the recommending precision, we would just fix the other parameters when doing the experiment on one parameter for simplicity. Finally, we got the tuning values for each parameter t o acquire the best recommending precision as shown in Table 1. 4.2 The Precision of Our Approach To check the precision of our approach, W e repeated the experiment 10 times for each 10 days to get the average result. Also the comparisons of our model with the topic model and the collaborative filtering approach were provided. The topic model ap-proach aims to model the user interest with the content information, and the collabora-tive filtering approach aims to model the user interest with the connection information.
As shown in Figure 2, we can see that our approach outperforms than the topic model and the collaborative filtering approaches since our approach considers the factors of the content and the connection information, and also brings the concept of evolution of interest. The topic model approach would achieve better precision than the collaborative filtering approach because there doesn X  X  ex ist the rank score for micro-bloggings, and the  X  X rowser X  operations are missing since we cannot get the visiting logs. In the left side of Figure 2, we got the avera ge result of 10 experiments for each user. We found that our model is better than the other approaches, and the recommending precision is more smooth than the others X  b ecause our model considered the factors of topic classification, user relation and topic evolution though there exists influence from subjective evaluation. In the right side of Figure 2, we got the average precision of 50 users for each recommending time. We found that though our result is better than the other approaches X , each period exhibits appa rently different precision. One reason is that the topic we classified may not reflect the r eal interested topic, such as different topic scope, topic hotness, and topic life cycle, which would be discussed in the next section. In our opinion, our model is suitable for general recommendation, still we need to consider more factors to keep the stability of recommending precision. As we described above, each user exhibits di fferent precision of recommending for the reason of topic scope, topic hotness, topic life cycle. We then gave an investigation on these factors that reflect the influence of recommending precision. We first selected four specified topics to check the precision results on  X  X omputer science X ,  X  X reaking news X ,  X  X ravel X , and  X  X ood X , which had the same experimental steps as the above section.
As shown in Figure 3, recommending topics on  X  X omputer science X  presents almost the same result of the general recommending in the right side of Figure 2, this is because the topic  X  X omputer science X  is also a big topic that composes of many sub topics. Recommending topics on  X  X reaking news X  presents acute fluctuation of recommending precision, this is because the topics on break ing news always have short concentration time but present strong hotness. This phenomenon would bring user interest on the topics for a short time but with a strong concentration. The topics  X  X ravel X  and  X  X ood X  present almost the same influence of reco mmending precision, this is because when a user travels to some palaces, he/she would als o interest local delicious foods meanwhile. In the real recommending system, we should take the following factors to improve the commending precision: 1) life cycle and hotness of specialized topics, such as breaking news, holiday related topics; 2) the relations of topics, such as  X  X ravel X  and  X  X ood X .
Considering that the topic  X  X omputer science X  is too big to model real user interest, we selected two sub topics  X  X loud computi ng X , and  X  X ecommender system X  to check the precision. We repeated the experiments introduced in the above section expect that we just selected 10 users because few users inte rested on the topic  X  X ecommender system X .
The upper two figures in Figure 4 presented two latent information for recommen-dation. The first one is that the precision of  X  X ecommender system X  is higher than the one of  X  X loud computing X , and the connection based user interest model provides more contribution on the precision. We found that the users interested in topic  X  X ecommender system X  are relatively professional and fixed, and their connections are tight, which would exhibit higher precision. Whereas  X  X loud computing X  is more prevailing, many users involved in this topic, and the connections are loose, which would present lower precision as a whole, and the precision of content based user interest model is higher than the one of connection based user interest model. The second one is that the pre-cision on  X  X ecommender system X  is more smooth and higher than the one on  X  X loud computing X  because the users interested on the first topic are always professional users, form a small team, and present the tight connection to discuss those most interested micro-bloggings. In the real recommending system, we should take the following fac-tors to improve the commending precision: 1) the number of interest users and their reputation; 2) the popularity of topics, for example, the topic  X  X loud computing X  may be more popular than the topic  X  X ecommender system X  in the micro-blogging system. The micro-blogging system shows its rapid dissemination speed of updated news and topics, so how to recommend preferred items to a user from large scale of micro-bloggings according to his/her interest is a r esearch focus. In this paper, we scheme a hybrid user interest model that combines the content and the social interaction infor-mation to calculate the user preference on the micro-bloggings, and define two time factors modeling user interest evolution.

Still there are several issues should be solved. The first one is that a user may change his/her interest smoothly, which can be viewed as  X  X opic evolution X , we should make a further investigation on this topic evolution behavior to model user X  X  interest more accurately. The second problem is that retweets and comments present strong attitude on the post. The attitude may be his or her judge ment or evaluation, affective state, or the intended emotional communication to repre sent his/her strong interest or uninterest. We need to adopt opinion mining approach to identify these subjective information.
