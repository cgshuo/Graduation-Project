 Discourse relations between units of text are cru-cial for the production and understanding of dis-course. Different taxonomies of discourse rela-tions have been proposed (i.a. Hobbs (1985), Las-carides and Asher (1993) and Knott and Sanders (1998)). One taxonomy is based on deictic conti-nuity (Segal et al., 1991; Murray, 1997): continu-ity in the sense of Segal et al. (1991) means that the same frame of reference is maintained, for ex-ample by subsequent sentences talking about the same event, without a shift in perspective (Asr and Demberg, 2012). For instance, a causal relation such as I was tired, so I drank a cup of coffee. is continuous, and adversatives show discontinuous relations: I drank a cup of coffee but I was still tired. Other continuous relations include temporal succession, topic succession and so on. The conti-nuity hypothesis predicts that sentences connected by continuous relations are easier to understand than ones connected by discontinuous relations.
Previous work on continuity hypothesis (Maury and Teisserenc, 2005; Cain and Nash, 2011; Hoek and Zufferey, 2015) suggests that discourse connectives are indicators of the continuity of discourse and help the interlocutors predict the level of continuity of upcoming sentences. Se-gal et al. (1991) propose that connectives which signal discontinuous discourse relations, such as but , are the marked ones because they indicate harder-to-comprehend content. Asr and Demberg (2012, 2013) extend this idea to discourse rela-tions, proposing that discourse relations which are discontinuous, or posing a conceptual difficulty (Haspelmath, 2006), may be less explicitly con-veyed in text, or more explicitly marked by a con-nective which unambiguously conveys that spe-cific relation than continuous ones. They propose a new measure called markedness to capture this, but when computed on the Penn Discourse Tree-bank, results do not fit the continuity theory well. This paper improves on Asr and Demberg (2013) X  X  measure and shows that the results on the Penn Discourse and the Chinese Discourse Treebanks fit the continuity hypothesis very well. Penn Discourse Treebank The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is a corpus of Wall Street Jour-nal articles annotated with discourse relations (Prasad et al., 2008). The discourse relations are organized in a hierarchical structure with three lev-els: a level 1 (e.g. TEMPORAL ), level 1/level 2 (e.g. TEMPORAL .Asynchronous) or level 1/level 2/level 3 (e.g. TEMPORAL .Asynchronous.succession) re-lation can appear between two clauses within a sentence. Discourse relations with overt discourse connectives are annotated as  X  X xplicit X , whereas the relations with no discourse connective are an-notated as  X  X mplicit X . The  X  X ltLex X  category is used when a non-connective expression conveys the relation. Table 1 gives the distribution of the relation categories in the corpus.

Some connectives are labeled with multiple re-lations when it was difficult to pinpoint exactly one exact discourse relation for it. We follow Asr and Demberg (2013) and treat these cases as if there are multiple instances of the connective, each with one of the labels it received. This gives us a total of 35,870 relation instances.
 Table 1: Relation category counts for the Penn Discourse and Chinese Discourse Treebanks.
 Chinese Discourse Treebank The Chinese Dis-course Treebank (CDTB, Zhou and Xue 2014) fol-lows the PDTB annotation style and has annota-tions for 164 documents from Xinhua News. The main difference between CDTB and PDTB is that CDTB has a flat structure of only ten relations compared to the hierarchical relation structure in PDTB. Table 1 gives the distribution of the rela-tion categories. To quantify the conceptual difficulty of dis-course relations, Asr and Demberg (2013) propose an information-theoretic measure  X  X arkedness X , which tells us how tightly and uniquely a relation is associated with a connective. The measure uses normalized point-wise mutual information: to get the markedness of a discourse relation: markedness ( r ) = where r is a relation and c is a discourse connec-tive. Asr and Demberg (2013) propose this mea-sure in the surprisal framework of Levy (2008), and restrict the scope of the data to only Explicit relations in PDTB. We will call this measure with only explicit relations  X  X -exp X . Since surprisal is defined as the probability of a word given previous words and context (3), this restriction on the scope of relations does not seem reasonable. Surprisal is defined as surprisal  X  X  X  log p ( w i | w 1 ...i  X  1 , CON T EXT )
It can be argued that at the current word w i  X  1 , the distribution of upcoming discourse relations, available in CONTEXT, should play a role in de-termining the probability of the upcoming word w . In the surprisal model, the domain for w i should be the same as w i  X  1 , which is all possible words. However, if we only calculate the distri-bution of explicit connectives as proposed by Asr and Demberg (2013), the candidates for w i will change according to the prediction of whether an explicit relation is coming up or not. If the upcom-ing relation is an implicit relation, one then has ac-cess to a distribution of words without the connec-tives, whereas if one predicts an explicit relation, then one predicts the next word using a distribu-tion of all the connectives as in M-exp. However surprisal should not be a model of deterministic decision making. It is more likely the case that given CONTEXT, one assigns probabilities to all words given the preceding context, which includes the case where no connective, in other words a zero or null connective, is predicted. The null connective may also be viewed as the probability mass for all the non-connective words predicted by CONTEXT where the connective is predicted to be omitted (Asr and Demberg, 2015).

The markedness measure can be analyzed in terms of point-wise mutual information ( pmi ), in-dicating the amount of information one relation has for the distribution of the words that follow it (Hume, 2011). Because pmi is proportionate to npmi , we can rewrite (2) as We also have the mutual information measure: For the mutual information of y i in Y : Therefore, the markedness measure can be under-stood as the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the univariate distribution of X from the conditional distribution of X given y i (a discourse relation in our case). This shows the influence a relation has on the unigram distribution of words. Discourse relations strongly associated with certain connec-tives will have larger values of this measure than the ones with a weak association. In the previ-ous discussion of surprisal, we have seen that one may treat the implicit cases as predicting a null connective, which will then expand the domain of X from explicit cases to all implicit and explicit cases. With this setup, we calculate  X  X -all X  using all explicit and implicit relations, with a null con-nective accompanying all the implicit relations.
Continuity hypothesis has been linked with cog-nitive difficulties in discourse processing in previ-ous studies (Segal et al., 1991; Murray, 1997). The markedness measure can also be linked to process-ing difficulties through surprisal theory. Surprisal theory proposes that processing difficulty during sentence processing can be seen as the work in-curred by resource allocation during parallel dis-ambiguation (Levy, 2008). If a relation has a high markedness value, it indicates that this relation has a strong influence on the distribution of upcoming candidate words. The stronger the influence is, the higher the resource allocation cost will be for the relation, thus more difficult to process. Figure 1 compares the markedness of the PDTB level 1 relations as computed by the M-exp and M-all measures. According to the continuity hy-pothesis, the TEMPORAL relation is discontinu-Figure 1: Comparison of markedness measures for PDTB level 1 relations. ous (see Table 2 which gives the classification of discourse relations according to the continu-ity hypothesis). It should therefore have a high markedness value. However, M-exp assigns a low markedness to TEMPORAL , which Asr and Dem-berg (2013) note is unexpected. They ascribe this to the fact that temporal discourse connec-tives are often used to mark CONTINGENCY rela-tions. However because of the high counts of Ex-plicit connectives in TEMPORAL , whenever there is a connective that can indicate CONTINGENCY or TEMPORAL , one is more likely to predict TEM -PORAL because of fewer null connective cases for TEMPORAL . In surprisal terms, whenever one pre-dicts that there is a TEMPORAL relation next, one will more likely predict that there is an explicit dis-course connective signaling the relation.

EXPANSION is the least marked of all the rela-tions in Figure 1 with M-all. An analysis of the level 2 relations explains this fact. Figure 2 com-ing M-all, it is easy to see that discontinuous re-lations and ambiguous relations are more marked than the continuous ones. In the case of EXPAN -SION , the level 2 continuous relations are among the least marked ones, which are keeping the over-all markedness low. Also, the ones which are dis-continuous, especially Exception , are rare, so their influence to the overall score for EXPANSION is small. The most frequent relation, Conjunction , can be viewed as sometimes continuous and some-times discontinuous, therefore the overall marked-ness rating for it is in the middle. All these fac-tors contribute to the lowest markedness for EX -classified as continuous or discontinuous, and it is highly marked, thus driving the overall score high. However if Condition is removed, then CONTIN -GENCY will be the least marked relation at the level 1.

At the level 3, there are two discontinuous rela-tions of interest: precedence (e.g. I had a cup of coffee before I took a bath ) and succession (e.g. I took a bath after I had a cup of coffee ) under the TEMPORAL .Asynchronous relation. Table 3 compares the markedness measures for both rela-tions. Asr and Demberg (2013) mention that there is no significant markedness distinction for them and we can see that precedence is slightly more marked than succession in M-exp, but the differ-Table 3: Precedence and Succession Markedness. Table 4: Counts for different argument orders of Precedence and Succession. ence is small. M-all however shows that succes-sion is more marked than precedence , reflecting the fact that precedence is easier to understand.
For precedence , the arguments can be in a nor-mal temporal order, i.e. a forward temporal or-der (Arg1-Conn-Arg2, e.g. I had some coffee be-fore I went out. ) or in a backward temporal order (Conn-Arg2-Arg1, e.g. Before I went out, I had some coffee. ). For succession , the temporal or-der and the argument order are reversed. Table 4 gives the counts in PTDB for both precedence and succession with different argument orders, show-ing that Arg1-Conn-Arg2 is the most frequent con-struction for both relations, which is forward tem-poral order for precedence and backward tempo-ral order for succession , despite the fact that both of the relations can follow a forward temporal or-der. Therefore the results from M-all match the continuity hypothesis prediction that events in for-ward temporal order are easier to understand, thus less marked, than events in backward temporal or-der. Asr and Demberg (2012) explain that the rel-atively high count of Conn-Arg2-Arg1 construc-tions in succession is due to the fact that this con-struction actually places the events in the forward temporal order. We also notice that precedence has a lot more implicit occurrences than succession , meaning that inferring a normal temporal relation is much easier than inferring a reversed temporal relation. Figure 3: Markedness comparison for CDTB.

The results for CDTB, in Figure 3, shows the same trends as for English: overall, the marked-ness computed by M-all better fits the continuity hypothesis. EXPANSION is considered by M-exp as the second highest marked relation, whereas the continuity hypothesis predicts it to be one of the lowest marked relation, which is correctly cap-tured by M-all. The reason for it to be low may be that discontinuous relations included by EXPAN -SION are rare so the frequent continuous relations dominate, just as for English. Using M-exp, CAU -SATION is around the middle, but M-all correctly lowers it to the third least marked relation. TEM -PORAL is now the second highest marked relation among all relations, as opposed to the second least marked one. Importantly, M-all correctly shows that discourses relations in English and Chinese behave similarly in terms of markedness, which indicates that the continuity hypothesis is valid across languages.

Sanders (2005) proposes the causality-by-default hypothesis, claiming that CAUSATION is the default discourse relation when processing dis-course. However, looking at M-all scores for both languages, it is clear that CAUSATION is not the least marked relation in either language. In fact, EXPANSION can actually be seen as the least marked common relation in both languages, which may indicate that EXPANSION is the default dis-course relation cross-linguistically, yet more in-vestigations are needed to decide which one in among the least marked relations in Chinese, with 89% of its instances being implicit, but in English, CONJUNCTION has an average markedness score. This shows that there are also differences among languages on judgments of continuity of specific relations. The continuity hypothesis predicts that discontinu-ous discourse relations are less expected than con-tinuous relations and should be more marked. We expand Asr and Demberg (2013) X  X  measure from explicit relations only to explicit and implicit re-lations. We show that the results from that expan-sion fit the predictions of the theory very well, and such evidence demonstrates that discontinuous re-lations are indeed cognitively more difficult to pro-cess. Further we show that such difficulty is con-sistent across languages, indicating that discourse relations may not be influenced by idiosyncrasies of specific languages. Apart from the markedness measure, Asr and Demberg (2012) proposed an  X  X mplicitness X  measure, modeling the continuity of a relation using the ratio of implicit cases to all cases. Incorporating explicit and implicit relations into the markedness measure has the advantage of not only providing a single measure but also one which better fits the continuity hypothesis and sur-prisal theory.
