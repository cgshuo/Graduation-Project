 Barn owls, the champions of sound localization, show system atic errors when localizing sounds. Owls localize broadband noise signals with great accuracy f or source directions near the center of with an underestimate of the source direction [1]. Behavior al experiments show that the barn owl ral level difference (ILD) for localization in the vertical dimension [2]. Direct measurements of the are associated with very similar localization cues. Specifi cally, there is a similarity between ILD and ITD cues for directions near the center of gaze and direct ions with eccentric elevations on the vertical plane. How does the owl resolve this ambiguity in th e localization cues to produce accurate localization for sound sources near the center of gaze? Theories regarding the use of localization cues by the barn o wl are drawn from the extensive knowl-edge of processing in the barn owl X  X  auditory system. Neurop hysiological and anatomical studies show that the barn owl X  X  auditory system contains specializ ed circuitry that is devoted to extracting spectral ILD and ITD cues and processing them to derive sourc e direction information [2]. It has been suggested that a spectral matching operation between I LD and ITD cues computed from audi-tory inputs and preferred ILD and ITD spectra associated wit h spatially selective auditory neurons underlies the derivation of spatial information from the au ditory cues [3 X 6]. The spectral matching models reproduce aspects of neural responses, but none repr oduces the sound localization behavior of the barn owl. In particular, the spectral matching models do not describe how the owl resolves am-from the auditory input signals. These two approaches to sou nd localization can be formalized using the language of estimation theory as maximum likelihood (ML ) and Bayesian solutions, respectively. Here, I examine two models for the barn owl X  X  sound localizat ion behavior in order to further evalu-ate the spectral matching model and to test whether a Bayesia n model with a prior that emphasizes directions near the center of gaze can reproduce the owl X  X  lo calization behavior. I begin by viewing the sound localization problem as a statistical estimation problem. Maximum likelihood and max-imum a posteriori (MAP) solutions to the estimation problem are compared with the localization behavior of a barn owl in a head turning task. To define the localization problem, we must specify an observ ation model that describes the infor-mation the owl uses to produce a direction estimate. Neuroph ysiological and behavioral experiments suggest that the barn owl derives direction estimates from I LD and ITD cues that are computed at an array of frequencies [2, 7, 8]. Note that when computed as a fu nction of frequency, the ITD is given by an interaural phase difference (IPD).
 Here I consider a model where the observation made by the owl i s given by the ILD and IPD spectra derived from barn owl head-related transfer functions (HRT Fs) after corruption with additive noise. For a source direction (  X ,  X  ) , the observation vector r is expressed mathematically as where the ILD spectrum ILD trum IPD quencies. The ILD and IPD cues are computed directly from the HRTFs as and where the left and right HRTFs are written as  X  h  X  h The noise corrupting the ILD spectrum is modeled as a Gaussia n random vector with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components,  X  ILD (  X  is assumed to have i.i.d. components where each element has a von Mises distribution with parame-ter  X  . The von Mises distribution can be viewed as a 2  X  -periodic Gaussian distribution for large  X  and is a uniform distribution for  X  = 0 [9]. I assume that the ILD and IPD noise terms are mutually independent.
 With this noise model, the likelihood function has the form where the ILD likelihood function is given by and the IPD likelihood function is given by where I have peaks at directions where the expected spectral cues ILD I evaluate maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori meth ods for estimating the source direc-tion from the observed ILD and IPD cues by computing an expect ed localization error and compar-ing the results to an owl X  X  behavior. The performance of each estimation procedure at a given source measure of estimation error is directly compared to the beha vioral performance of a barn owl in a head turning localization task [1]. The expected absolute angular error is approximated through Monte Carlo simulation as where the r i are drawn from p {  X  polar coordinates. The maximum likelihood direction estimate is derived from t he observed noisy ILD and IPD cues by finding the source direction that maximizes the likelihoo d function, yielding This procedure amounts to a spectral cue matching operation . Each direction in space is associated with a particular ILD and IPD spectrum, as derived from the HR TFs. The direction with associated interest because of the claim that salience in the neural map of auditory space in the barn owl can be described by a spectral cue matching operation [3, 4, 6].
 The maximum likelihood estimator was unable to reproduce th e owl X  X  localization behavior. The performance of the maximum likelihood estimator depends on the two likelihood function parame-ters  X  and  X  , which determine the ILD and IPD noise variances, respectiv ely. For noise variances large enough that the error increased at peripheral directi ons, in accordance with the barn owl X  X  is not consistent with the performance of the barn owl in the h ead turning task [1]. Additionally, directions near the center of gaze were often confused with d irections in the periphery leading to a high variability in the direction estimates, which is not se en in the owl X  X  behavior. In the Bayesian framework, the direction estimate depends o n both the likelihood function and the prior distribution over source directions through the post erior distribution. Using Bayes X  rule, the posterior density is proportional to the product of the like lihood function and the prior, The prior distribution is used to summarize the owl X  X  belief about the most likely source directions before an observation of ILD and IPD cues is made. Based on the barn owl X  X  tendency to underes-timate source directions [1], I use a prior that emphasizes d irections near the center of gaze. The prior is given by a product of two one-dimensional von Mises d istributions, yielding the probability density function where I source direction estimate is computed for a given observati on by finding the source direction that maximizes the posterior density, yielding Figure 1: Estimation error in the model for the maximum likel ihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. HRTFs were used from owls 884 (top) and 880 ( bottom). Left column: Estimation error at 685 locations in the frontal hemisphere plotted in d ouble polar coordinates.

The box extends from the lower quart ile to the upper quartile of the sample. The solid line is the identity line. Like the owl, the MAP estimator underestimates the source direction.
 In the MAP case, the estimate depends on spectral matching of observations with expected cues for each direction, but with a penalty on the selection of periph eral directions.
 It was possible to find a MAP estimator that was consistent wit h the owl X  X  localization behavior (Figures 1,2). For the example MAP estimators shown in Figur es 1 and 2, the error was smallest in extremes. This pattern of error qualitatively matches the p attern of error displayed by the owl in a head turning localization task [1].
 The parameters that produced a behaviorally consistent MAP estimator correspond to a likelihood and prior with large variances. For the estimators shown in F igure 1, the likelihood function para-meters were given by  X  = 11 . 5 dB and  X  = 0 . 75 for owl 880 and  X  = 10 . 75 dB and  X  = 0 . 8 for owl 884. For comparison, the range of ILD values normally experi enced by the barn owl falls between  X  30 dB [10]. The prior parameters correspond to an azimuthal w idth parameter  X  880 and 0 . 2 for owl 884 and an elevational width parameter  X  884.
 The implication of this model for implementation in the owl X  s auditory system is that the spectral localization cues ILD and IPD do not need to be computed with g reat accuracy and the emphasis on central directions does not need to be large in order to produ ce the barn owl X  X  behavior. 6.1 A new approach to modeling sound localization in the barn owl The simulation results show that the maximum likelihood mod el considered here can not reproduce the owl X  X  behavior, while the maximum a posteriori solution is able to match the behavior. This result suggests that the standard spectral matching model w ill not be sufficient to explain sound lo-calization behavior in the barn owl. Previously, suggestio ns have been made that sound localization by the barn owl can be described using the Bayesian framework [11, 12], but no specific models have been proposed. This paper demonstrates that a Bayesian model can qualitatively match the owl X  X  localization behavior. The Bayesian approach descri bed here provides a new framework for analyzing sound localization in the owl. 6.2 Failure of the maximum likelihood model The maximum likelihood model fails because of the nature of s patial ambiguity in the ILD and IPD cues. The existence of spatial ambiguity has been noted i n previous descriptions of barn owl HRTFs [3, 10, 13]. As expected, directions near each other ha ve similar cues. In addition to sim-ilarity of cues between proximal directions, distant direc tions can have similar ILD and IPD cues. Most significantly, there is a similarity between the ILD and IPD cues at the center of gaze and at peripheral directions on the vertical plane. The consequen ce of such ambiguity between distant di-as seen in the ML estimate. The results of the simulations sug gest that a behaviorally accurate so-lution to the sound localization problem must include a mech anism that chooses between disparate directions which are associated with similar localization cues in such a way as to limit errors for source directions near the center of gaze. This work shows th at a possible mechanism for choosing between such directions is to incorporate a bias towards dir ections at the center of gaze through a prior distribution and utilize the Bayesian estimation fra mework. The use of a prior that emphasizes directions near the center of gaze is similar to the use of cen tral weighting functions in models of human lateralization [14]. 6.3 Predictions of the Bayesian model The MAP estimator predicts the underestimation of peripher al source directions on the horizontal and vertical planes (Figure 2). The pattern of error display ed by the MAP estimator qualitatively matches the owl X  X  behavioral performance by showing increa sing error as a function of eccentricity. Our evaluation of the model performance is limited, however , because there is little behavioral data for directions outside  X  70 deg [15, 16]. For the owl whose performance is displayed in Figure 1, the largest errors on the vertical and horizontal planes were le ss than 20 deg and 11 deg, respectively. The model produces much larger errors for directions beyond 70 deg, especially on the vertical plane. and the shape of the prior distribution. As discussed above, for broadband noise stimuli, there is a similarity between the ILD and IPD cues for central and perip heral directions on the vertical plane estimates for both central and peripheral directions to be c oncentrated near zero deg. Therefore, estimation errors are minimal for sources at the center of ga ze, but approach the magnitude of the source direction for peripheral source directions. Behavi oral data shows that localization accuracy is the greatest near the center of gaze [1], but there is no dat a for localization performance at the most eccentric directions on the vertical plane. Further be havioral experiments must be performed to determine if the owl X  X  error increases greatly at the most peripheral directions.
 band. It is well known that spatial ambiguity arises from the way that interaural time differences are processed at each frequency [17 X 19]. The owl measures the in teraural time difference for each fre-quency of the input sound as an interaural phase difference. Therefore, multiple directions in space consistent with the same interaural phase difference and ca n not be distinguished. Behavioral exper-iments show that the owl may localize a phantom source in the h orizontal dimension when the signal is a tone [20]. Based on the presence of a prior that emphasize s directions near the center of gaze, I predict that for low frequency tones where phase equivalen t directions lie near the center of gaze and at directions greater than 80 deg, confusion will always lead to an estimate of a source direction near zero degrees. This prediction can not be evaluated from available data because localization of tonal signals has only been systematically studied using 5 k Hz tones with target directions at  X  20 deg [19]. Because the prior is broad, the target direction of  X  20 deg and the phantom direction of  X  50 deg may both be considered central.
 The ILD cue also displays a significant ambiguity at high freq uencies. At frequencies above 7 kHz, the ILD is non-monotonically related to the vertical positi on of a sound source [3, 10] (Figure 3). Therefore, for narrowband sounds, the owl can not uniquely d etermine the direction of a sound multiple directions on the vertical plane that are confused with directions near zero deg. I predict that confusion between source directions near zero deg and e ccentric directions will always lead to estimates of directions near zero deg. There is no available data to evaluate this prediction. Figure 3: Model predictions for localization of tones on the vertical plane. (A) ILD as a function of elevation at 8 kHz, computed from HRTFs of owl 880 recorded by Keller et al. (1998). (B) Given an ILD of 0 dB, a likelihood function (dots) based on matching cues to expected values would be localization errors because of confusion with the other dir ections. If a prior emphasizing frontal space (dashed) is included, a posterior density equal to the product of the likelihood and the prior would have a main peak at 0 deg elevation. Using a maximum a pos teriori estimate, large errors would be made if the target is above or below. However, few err ors would be observed when the target is near 0 deg. 6.4 Testing the Bayesian model Further head turning localization experiments with barn ow ls must be performed to test predictions generated by the Bayesian hypothesis and to provide constra ints on a model of sound localization. Experiments should test the localization accuracy of the ow l for broadband noise sources and tonal signals at directions covering the frontal hemisphere. The Bayesian model will be supported if, first, localization accuracy is high for both tonal and broadband n oise sources near the center of gaze and, second, peripherally located sources are confused for targets near the center of gaze, leading points away from the horizontal and vertical planes, using a nonparametric prior [21, 22]. While the model presented here, using a von Mises prior, qualitativel y matches the performance of the owl, the performance of the Bayesian model may be improved by removin g assumptions about the structure of the prior distribution. 6.5 Implications for neural processing The analysis presented here does not directly address the ne ural implementation of the solution to the localization problem. However, our abstract analysi s of the sound localization problem has implications for neural processing. Several models exist t hat reproduce the basic properties of ILD, ITD, and space selectivity in ICx and OT neurons using a spect ral matching procedure [3, 5, 6]. These results suggest that a Bayesian model is not necessary to describe the responses of individual ICx and OT neurons. It may be necessary to look in the brainste m motor targets of the optic tectum to find neurons that resolve the ambiguity present in sound st imuli and show responses that reflect the MAP solution. This implies that the prior distribution i s not employed until the final stage of processing. The prior may correspond to the distribution of best directions of space-specific neurons in ICx and OT, which emphasizes directions near the center of gaze [23]. 6.6 Conclusion This analysis supports the Bayesian model of the barn owl X  X  s olution to the localization problem over the maximum likelihood model. This result suggests tha t the standard spectral matching model will not be sufficient to explain sound localization behavio r in the barn owl. The Bayesian model provides a new framework for analyzing sound localization i n the owl. The simulation results using the MAP estimator lead to testable predictions that can be us ed to evaluate the Bayesian model of sound localization in the barn owl.
