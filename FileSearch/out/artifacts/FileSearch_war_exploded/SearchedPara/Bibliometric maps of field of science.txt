 1. Introduction
Algorithmic classifications of sets of objects attracted researcher  X  s attention in the1970s ( Sparck Jones, 1971 ). It was hoped that classifications based on some algorithmic procedures on objects in a set would help might prove better suited to deal with ever-changing flow of information and thus a better tool to follow the texts, such as keywords, references to previous work, etc. The inductive character of those classifications makes it difficult to predict the results of an empirical study; the fact may seem a curse or a blessing, depending on the tastes of the researcher. One important benefit of that approach is the exclusion of sub-that classificatory algorithms in diachronic studies may become a useful addition to synchronous classifi-cations based on logical principles.

Various bibliometric methods fall into two major approaches. The first is based on the analysis of the
The second approach to the quantitative study of information has been gaining popularity since the early teristics of information processes are not considered here as final results of the analysis, they are used as tools to describe the ever-changing structure of science in general and of particular fields of knowledge.
The present paper is devoted to two directions in algorithmic classificatory procedures: the journal co-
What is common to those approaches is the general idea of normalization of deviations of the observed data from the mathematical expectation. The application of the same formula leads to discovery of statis-tically significant links between objects (journals in one case and keywords in the other). 2. Citation networks
From the mathematical point of view a citation network is a set of documents with the relation of citing imposed on it. In other words it is a union of a set of citing papers and a set of cited papers. A citation network is a potential base for various classification of papers. It was M. Kessler who in 1962 formulated the concept of  X  bibliographic coupling  X  as a measure of similarity of two documents based on the number of tion proposed in 1973 independently by H. Small in the USA and by the present author in the USSR ( Small, 1973; Marshakova, 1973 ). The similarity of two documents depends on the number of papers citing both documents. When a new paper appears it is not linked to any other paper until it starts to be cited in scientific literature. This connection was called prospective by the author for it is based on citations in future literature. When applied to a vast bibliographic material (primarily to the SCI or SSCI databases) co-citational analysis serves as a means of getting clusters in the citation nets which can be interpreted as elements of a complex hierarchical structure of science X  X aps of science with very broad fields of know-ledge at the top and many individual research fronts at the bottom.

Among numerous techniques covered by structural bibliometrics, the place of honor belongs to co-cita-tion analysis of papers and corresponding mapping of science in ISI similarly.The journal co-citation ana-lysis is aimed at monitoring of everchanging structure of science by means of algorithmic procedures.
The idea of co-citation may be concisely expressed by the following maxim: two papers are similar when they are simultaneously cited by other papers. Here (in case of the journal co-citation analysis) the maxim should be read as: two journal are similar when both of them are often cited in the same third journals. On mined by their co-citation. The raw citation figures are normalized to exclude the overwhelming influence of most popular highly-cited journals. The journal to journal weighted links form an intricate network of a field of knowledge with possible clusters discernible in the map. The algorithmic stage should be followed by an informal analysis and possible verification by other approaches. This method was first tested on the field of Information Science and Library Science ( Marshakova, 2003 ) and on the field of Women  X  s Studies ( Marshakova-Shaikevich, 2004 ).
 Methodology of the journal co-citation analysis is given shortly below.
 To facilitate the calculation the bottom part of the list of citing journals was excluded from the analysis.
The cut-off point was determined as The minimal cut-off point is arbitrarily set at 2.

The part of the list above this threshold will form the core of citing journals for the journal under ana-lysis (with self-citation excluded).

For each citing journal its citing capacity (CC) is calculated. Citing capacity of the given citing journal (CC) is defined as the sum of its frequencies in all the core lists of cited journals of the category.
Assuming (for time being) the null hypothesis of uniform distribution of cites in journals within the cat-journals ( p a ) by the citing capacity (CC) of the citing journal: P C a is the total cites for a journal  X  a  X  ;
The real frequency of journal  X  i  X  citing journal  X  a  X  may deviate from m . The magnitude of this deviation will be calculated as where x is the actual number of times that journal  X  a  X  was cited by journal  X  i  X  .
The ( 1) in the numerator is introduced to cut off unique experimental events which should not be used as evidence no matter how small is m .
 The resulting value of co-citation relatedness of two journals ( a and b ) will be calculated according to where n is the number of common o positive deviations (with S P 2) from mathematical expectation. The journal co-citation analysis was tested on the ISI Journal Citation Reports: 2001 Social Sciences
Edition categories Information Science and Library Science (IS&amp;LS) and Women  X  s Studies (WS). The cat-on average, but The Scientist claiming 249), in the number of cites (with an average figure of 252 and the record of 1916 of Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology ), in impact factor (with an average 0.5 and the record 2.02 of Journal of Documentation ). The total number of cites is 13850, each journal making a small portion ( p ) of this sum. The category  X  WS  X  in 2001 edition included 25 journals, differing widely in the number of articles (30 articles on average, but  X  J Women Health Gen X  X   X  claiming 88), in the number of cites (with an average figure of 289 and the record of 1877 of journal Sex roles ), in impact factor (with an average 0.4 and the record 2.28 of J Women Health ). The total number of cites is 7224, each journal making a small portion ( p ) of this sum.
 3. Discussion
The two fields under study differ considerably. The Women  X  s Studies field includes 25 journals, their co-citation relatedness is shown in Fig. 1 (a) and Table 1 . It would be more difficult to map the 55 journals, belonging to  X  Information Science and Library Science  X  field, here the results are given in tabular form which demands some spatial imagination on the part of the reader (for graphic representation see Marshak-ova, 2003 , and Fig. 2 (a), (b) and Fig. 3 where main co-citation links between journals are shown). 3.1. Women X  X  studies field
Seventeen journals of the field under study of the 25 journals belonging to Women  X  s Studies field showed positive values of R . The corresponding links are presented in Fig. 1 (a).

Three clusters are clearly seen in this map. This result is quite meaningful which is demonstrated by the analysis of keywords (supplied by the authors or editor). For each journal a frequency list of keywords was formed. Common keywords of a pair of journals (or of all journals of the cluster) show their thematic sim-ilarity. Let us turn to the three clusters in Fig. 1 (a).

Cluster 1 includes three journals ( Sex Roles , Psychology of Women Quarterly and Feminism and Psychol-ogy , rape , sex , students , women .
 the cluster, i.e., PSYCHOLOGY. The same conclusion is supported by keywords denoting methodological scale , students , validation , validity .

There are six journals in cluster 2: Gender and Society , Signs , Women Studies International Forum , Fem-inist Review , Journal of Gender Studies , Feminist Studies , but R values are low. Common keywords are few, show the thematic center of the cluster: SOCIOLOGY and POLITICS concerning women. A few more itics , Women &amp; Therapy . Those additional journals support the same thematic conclusion ( Fig. 1 (b)). Cluster 3 includes five journals: Women &amp; Health , Journal of Women Health &amp; Gender-Based , Women Health Issues , Journal of Women Aging , Journal of Women Health ; all devoted to the theme WOMEN  X  s
HEALTH. There are 145 keywords, common at least to one of pair of journals. They are often medi-cocaine , contraception , domestic violence , exercise , homeless , pregnancy , smokers , smoking , victims .
However, it should be kept in mind that there are a few keywords common to all three clusters ( gender , men , risk factor , sex , stress ). The keyword work is common to the second and third clusters. 3.2. Information and library science field
Table 3 and Fig. 3 clearly demonstrate the existence of a separate cluster of eight journals, in no way connected with the rest of our category. Among the citing journals of this cluster, many more journals can be found which are not part of JCR: Social Science Edition  X  Information Science and Library Science  X  category, but which appear on the list of JCR: Science Edition Computer Science, Information Systems cat-egory. These are: Decis Support Sys , Eur J Inform Syst , Inform Software Tech , Internet Res , J Comput In-form Syst , Wirschaftsing . This list may be extended by many journals in Social Science outside our category (Information and Library Science): Comput Educ , Comput Hum Behav , Int J Electr Co , Int J Hum-Comput , Int J Oper Prod M, IEEE T Eng. Manage , J Comput Assist L , Leadership Quart , J Bus Res , Omega-Int J Manag , Organ Sci .

As to Table 2 (a) and (b) (and Fig. 2 (a) and (b)) their analysis gives an opportunity to discuss some gen-in them as the final result of their study. Failure to attain such a picture seems a disappointment. However, another alternative to thinking in customary cluster terms may be suggested. Table 2 (a) and (b) (and Fig. 2 (a) and (b)) evoke a metaphor of space: the two tentative clusters, represented here, are not separated by any barrier X  X hey are bridged by Libr Quart, Libr Trends , (and to a certain degree X  X IBRI, Coll Res Libr and ASLIB Proc ).
 At the same time, the opposite poles: e.g., Libr J , Online , Electr Libr on the one hand, and JASIST , J
Inform Sci , Annu Rev Inform Sci , Inf Proc Man on the other are not mutually connected anywhere. The journals in the upper part of the combined picture ( Fig. 2 ) are mostly preoccupied with theoretical prob-lems, while the journals at the bottom part more often try to solve practical problems. Nevertheless, the composite character of this large combined cluster is evident. This conclusion is supported by journals with extent Can J Inform Libr Sci ) are in the upper part of the picture. Database , Interlend Doc , Supply , Libr
Collect Acquis , Online Inform Rev , J Scholarly Publ , Knowl Organ evidently belong to Library Science (the bottom part of the picture).

The ISI category of Information and Library Science comprises Social Science journals of which 30 are
NFD Inform-Wiss Prax , Z Bibl Bibl ) have so few citations to their credit that it is virtually impossible to place them anywhere on the map. An extension of the study in time-depth would probably make it possible to locate them with some precision.
 Much more interesting are those journals of the group that are extensively cited, but still fail to show any R values. They are Int J Geogr Inf Sci (with 531 cites), Scientist (462), Telecommun. Policy (247), Soc. Sci. Inform. (193), Restaurator (100), J Health Commun (91), Law Libr J (89), Soc Sci Comput Rev (86), JAm
Med Inform Ass (second best in popularity, with 1658 cites) should also be included in this group, for it has only one weak connection with B Med Libr Assoc (387), which has three very weak links with IS&amp;LS jour-nals. All these journals are obvious outsiders. Their inclusion in the category Information and Library Sci-journal ( Lect. Notes Comput. ) has some connection with our category, but it did not demonstrate any S -values. All these journals should be relegated to their corresponding fields of knowledge (geography, health studies, law, etc.).

The method of calculation of co-citation relatedness described in the present paper to some extent de-pends on the initial composition of the category to be analyzed. One may wonder what would happen nals, just discussed, were actually deleted from the category Information and Library Science. The total sum of CC would diminish by 8%, and the values of p would grow accordingly. This change would slightly lower co-citation relatedness R -values, without significant changes in the configuration of links. If the initial group is expanded considerably, one may expect greater changes in configuration. The JCR:
Science Edition category of Computer Science, Information Systems may serve as an example. As a pilot test the Social Science category was enlarged by eight journals with the highest impact rating from JCR: Science Edition. These were: (1) IEEE Netw (with 657 cites), (2) IEEE ACM T NETWORK (2150), (3)
ACMT Inform Syst (470), (4) IEEE Pers Commun (827), (5) IEEE T Inform Theory (1635), (6) Inform Syst (1062), (7) Med Inform Internet (363), (8) J Chem Inf Comp Sci (3561). The growth of overall cites to 30,500 diminished the p values of the former journal members with the corresponding growth of S -and R -values.
It seems that additional journal members will add new separate clusters, rather than change configuration of clusters in former Social Science category. The first two journals, for example, have a record R of 415 between them and are strongly connected to the fourth journal ( R = 67 and R = 45, respectively). This find-ing gives support to the supposition that good clusters will keep stable even under changes in initial com-position of a group. 4. The analysis of keywords in the titles and texts
The research of statistical dictionary of keywords showed that change in the frequency of keywords may be due to various factors. Sometimes it is a purely linguistic process, for example, a competition of terms, generation  X  . All these terms were very frequent in 1961 X 1963 (see The Soviet  X  Physics  X  abstracts journal, division of  X  Generators of stimulated radiation  X  ). At the same time, English abbreviations LASER and
MASER entered the field. The period of 1964 X 1965 was marked by lexical stabilization when only two absolute synonyms LASER and OKG (optical quantum generator) struggled for survival. The victory of entific Russian) (see Marshakova, 1974b ).

The technique of statistical analysis of keywords might be aimed at discovering new directions of sci-ence. In this sense it might prove important for monitoring development of science and for evalua-tion of science and programs. Many of such directions were manifested in Research Fronts on co-citation maps of science. Thus, analysis of keywords may be applied to any subject indexes of databases.
Possible objectives of analysis of keywords in the titles and texts may be classed in two main directions. 1. Document clustering on the basis of lexical similarity of titles. 2. Word clustering on the basis of co-occurrence of words in the same documents.

The details of the procedure of clustering documents on lexical similarity were given in the paper ( Mar-shakova, 1974a ). Only the second task will be considered here.

Late years witnessed the efforts of many researchers trying to develop methods of analysis of keywords in desdorf, 1997; Marshakova-Shaikevich, 2001; Noyons &amp; Van Raan, 1995; Zitt &amp; Bassecoulard, 1994 ) and many others.

Clustering based on co-occurrence of words in the documents is a formal technique for construction of lexical maps (this approach may be termed lexical bibliometric classification). Lexical maps may facilitate general orientation in the conceptual framework of science or in a given field of science. To solve this large and complex task, it seems necessary (1) to identify the list of lexical units used in the language of the given field of science and (2) to identify systemic relationships between these units. As a practical step in this direction, a study of secondary scientific literature was carried out, here information is rep-resented in a more compact form and lexical redundancy of the primary text has been eliminated appreciably.

The possibility of an accurate calculation of frequency values for all terms makes it easier to create a mathematical model for statistically significant character of co-occurrence of terms.
The application of lexical bibliometric methods in building up the terminological system provides for the solution of two tasks: (1) to follow the quantitative dynamics of groups of terms in some scientific field and (2) to discover specific links of terms both in static and dynamic states. From the development of science viewpoint, the general task can be formulated as producing the terminological map of science at the given time-point. Such terminology maps may help to solve two problems: monitoring dynamics of scientific terminology and to visualize the conceptual links between terms and accordingly between sci-ence fields. 4.1. Pilot study
An experimental attempt at establishing textual links between words was carried out on two samples from SSCI data base: (1) EDUCATION and (2) ETHICS. The EDUCATION file included 2180 docu-ments (of which 751 had abstracts); the ETHICS file included 807 documents (289 abstracts). The present paper deals mostly with the latter sample.
 Some linguistic remarks: Lexical analysis of a text corpus often calls for some pre-study editing.

The depth of pre-editing depends on the linguistic typology of the language under study. Slavic lan-guages demand extensive morphological procedures (lemmatisation). In the case of English, morphological treatment is minimal.

Here the following steps were taken: 1. Some mistakes due to translation effect were corrected (e.g., sometimes educational was changed to a more idiomatic education ). 2. With the help of some program tools in conjunction with manual editing the most frequent and least informative grammar words were excluded from the analysis (e.g., the , has , and , should , by , etc.). 3. New lexical items were created in the text. On the basis of a frequency dictionary of binary word com-binations, frequent collocations were changed into new lexical units (business ethics would become busi-ness-ethics, decision making would be turned to decision-making, etc.). The pre-editing stage was followed by a recalculation of word frequencies.

Formal discovery of textual links between lexical units to a great degree depends upon the size of the fragment (or  X  window  X  ), within which the co-occurrence of two words is studied, and the corresponding mathematical calculations are made. On every stage of the analysis, the factual co-occurrence is compared to mathematical expectation, calculated on the basis of some null hypothesis. If the size of the fragment is minimal (i.e., one adjacent word ), the results would be mostly grammatical and phraseological (colloca-mation obtained would become more semantically general and thematic. In the present study, the length of the fragment was 50 words, i.e., the corpus was divided into 50 word fragments.

The calculation of statistical significance of co-occurrence figures was made according to the same for-mula that was used for journal co-citation:
X , real frequency of co-occurrence of words i and j ; m , mathematical expectation of co-occurrence of words i and j
F , frequency of word i in the corpus; F j , frequency of word j in the corpus; and N , number of fragments in the corpus (EDUCATION file N = 2478, ETHICS file N = 883).

The 1, introduced in the numerator, cuts off the cases of single co-occurrence of two words. 4.2. Results
Some examples of the results of our pilot study are given below in tabular form. They include six lexical units with their links and corresponding S -values: ETHICS file

The binary links between words discovered in this way may form triplets or other groups with more than two member words. Here are some examples of the resulting clusters ( Fig. 4 ).

The scale of this pilot study was rather limited, some of the clusters listed depend on a single text in the database. But most links are so clear semantically, they are shure to hold in a larger database. The corre-sponding clusters would form parts of an intricate semantic networks of words.
 5. Conclusion (1) The journal co-citation analysis, carried out in this study, discovered three clusters of journals within the JCR:SSE category of Women  X  s Studies. Co-citation procedure provide its greater differentiating as com-pared to use of keywords. To be sure the keywords gender and women may be considered characteristic of the field as a whole. On the other hand, most keywords of singe clusters would unite them with psychology, sociology or medicine. Perhaps, a better solution for a thematic cluster would be to use a group of key-words, rather than single terms.

The journal co-citation analysis, carried out in study of Information and Library Science, discovered two clusters of journals within that category. The lesser of the clusters (Information Systems and Management) which did not show links to those clusters (Int J Geogr Inf Sci, Scientist, Telecommun. Policy, Law Libr and others), turned out to be outright mistakes and should be excluded from the category of Information and Library Science. (2) While constructing lexical maps of science, one encounters many obstacles. Perhaps, the most impor-tant prerequisite is a frequency dictionary of the texts of abstracts of a certain field of science.
Back in the 1960 X 1970s there was a widespread growth of statistical lexica and databases for information purposes. SCI / Permuterm Subject Index contains more than 7 million pairs of keywords, an American statistical dictionary of texts for schools is built on a corpus of 5 million words [Carroll J.B. e.a. WORD
FREQUENCY BOOK., Boston, 1971], the record corpus of French literary texts exceeds 70 million words [DICTIONNAIRE DES FREQUENCES Paris, 1971] After that the interest for statistical dictionaries de-clined considerably. While electronic corpora of texts (including secondary information literature) kept on of them should be mentioned. The statistical software is convenient and effective dealing with graphic words (chains of symbols between spaces). It is exactly that kind of information that made possible rela-tively large frequency dictionaries (such as Carrol  X  s) in the 1960s. However, you need more than that to build a lexical map: your graphic words should be lemmatized, which is not easy to do in a fully automatic manner. The relative share of manual processing is declining, but it still grows in absolute figures with the astounding growth of corpora to be treated.

The results of the present pilot study clearly showed that formal quantitative analysis of large collections of secondary documents may discover specific (semantic) links between words. This pilot study was only a first step in an attempt to build a semantic map of a field of science.
