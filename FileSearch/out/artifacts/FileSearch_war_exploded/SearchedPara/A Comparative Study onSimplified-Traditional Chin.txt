 st andard system of the M ainland is simplified Chinese , while i n Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, traditional Chinese is the norm . In addition, these two writing s ystems are widely used internationally. For instance, the BBC Chinese w ebsit e ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/simp/ ) is presented in both simplified and trad i-tion al versions, as shown in Figure 1.
 In addition to various documents, the user interfaces of popular software such as MS Windows, MS Office and Google also have their simplified and traditional Ch i-nese versions. That means there is a tremendous demand for translation between the two Chinese wri ting systems .

Computer tools for simplified -traditional Chinese translation or conversion are widely available (For simplicity purpose, we will normally use the term  X  X ranslation X  in the following). The ir performance has reached very high precision . Howeve r, b e-cause of the existence of one -to -many relationships between simplified and traditional Chinese characters there is no guarantee of 100% correct conversion [4] . For exa m-ple, character  X  in simplified Chinese corresponds to  X  (gan1) ,  X  (gan4) and  X  (gan 1) of different meanings in traditional Chinese, and traditional character  X  corr e-sponds to  X  (qian2) and  X  (gan1) of different meanings in simplified Chinese. In the following sections , we will introduce an experiment of simplified -traditional Chinese tran slation on three representative tools, make a comparative analysis and provide some ideas for further improvement.
 Our experiment wa s focused on simplified -to -traditional Chinese translation, which is more demanding than traditional -to -simplified translation and thus can better reflect the strength of modern technology in this area . A text in simplified Chin ese was car e-fully selected, which was then translated into traditional Chinese on three represent a-tive tools. 2.1 Selection of the testing text The testing text selected for the experiment is this year X  X  Government Work Report by Premier Li Keqiang [5] , which was presented to the annual meeting of the National People Congress of People X  X  Republic of China in early March . Its original version is in simplified Chinese.

The re are at least fo u r reason s for our selection: (a) The government work report is an import ant document with attention of people all over the world; (b) It s contents cover every aspect of people X  X  lif e in China ; (c) It was a brand new document not likely to have been used to help improve any translation tool before our experiment . (d) The length of the document, 17 , 670 characters including spaces, is appropri ate, because too short text may reveal few translation errors and too long text may require too much human proofreading. 2.2 Selection of translation tools T hree representative to ols , including Microsoft Word, Google Translate and JFJ , were selected for our experiment on simplified -traditional Chinese translation . MS Word has long been the most popular word processor in the world . And it s Chinese Translation is probably the most popular off -lined tool for simplified -traditional Chinese translation. We used Word 2010, the newest version of the sof t-ware available i n our labs. When started on MS Word , Chinese Translation presents some options for the user to select , as shown in Figure 2.
 For our experime nt, the Translation direction was set on  X  X implified Chinese to Traditional Chinese X . Normally, simplif ied -traditional Chinese conversion is pe r-formed in a character -to -character mode . For example, simplified  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (Chinese characters information processing) is converted to  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  . MS Word can also translate common terms, in which case the previous translation would b e-come  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , because in Taiwan and Hong Kong,  X  X nformation X  is more o f-ten translated into  X  X  X  than  X  X  X  . Because neither Google T ranslate nor JFJ support terms translation , this option was set off for a fair comparison among the three tool s . (As a matter of fact, MS Word sometimes translate s common terms incorrectly . E x-ample s will be presented in S ection 4 of this paper .) When button OK is clicked on , MS Word will translate the whole document (or a selected part i f it is highlighted b eforeh and) .

Google Translate is an independent tool on the WWW ( https://translate.google.com.hk/?hl=en ) . It is probably the most popular on -lined trans lation tool . For our experiment , the source language was set to  X  Chin ese (Simpl i-f ied) X  and the target language  X  Chinese (Traditional) X  , as shown in Figure 3.
JFJ ( acronym of Pinyin Jian -Fan -Jian, or Simplified -Traditional -Simplified) is a small tool developed at Hong Kong Polytechnic University [15, 17] . The version used for the experiment is available on the Web at http:// myweb.polyu.edu.hk/~ctxzhang/jfj30/ , as shown in Figure 4 .

The important features of JFJ include:  X  Simplified -traditional Chinese bi -directional conversion with 4 options: (a) simpl i-fied to Hong Kong traditional Chinese, (b) simplified to Taiwan traditional Ch i-nese, (c) simplified to high frequency traditional Chinese characters, and (d) trad i-tional to simplified Chinese.  X  Support for human proofre ading by (a) high -lighting all characters with one -to -many relationship between simplified and traditional Chinese, (b) providing rel e-vant dictionary information for reference, (c) correcting mistakes automatically by a single click.  X  Employment of standar d and frequently -used characters and punctuation marks in the target writing system. 2.3 The activities T he experiment was carried out in late March, 2014. W e performed the following tasks on each of the three translation tools. (a) Copy the text of the whole gov ernment report to the source text area of the (b) Translate the report from simplified Chin ese to traditional Chinese with the tool (c) Proofread the translation manually and write down all the errors; (d) Sort and categorize the errors o n a table and calculate the error rate s . The translation errors made by MS Word, Google Translate and JFJ are present ed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 . An error is an incorrect traditional Chinese translation of a simpl i-fied Chinese word . Word v ariants accept able to the standards of Taiwan or Hong Kong are counted as correct. For example, either  X  X  X  or  X  X  X  is a correct translation of simpli fied Chinese word  X  X  X  , while  X  X  can only be translated to  X  X  (u n-changed) , because b oth  X   X  and  X   X  are not acceptable in traditional Chinese .
The three tables above contained the combined results of 45 individual exper i-ments made by the author and a class of Chinese native students according to the requirements introduced in Section 2. In other words, the experiment was performed 45 times by diff erent people and the results were then checked and integrated into three tables. That means the data reported here s hould be very comprehensive and reliable, with all the translation errors made by each tool counted .

The first column of the tables presents all the words and phrases in the original text which have been incorrectly translated by MS Word , Google Translate or JFJ . The second column presents the error translations. Each error is caused by an incorrectly converted character , w h ich is presented with sufficient context to show its incorrect usage and to cause the mistake . For instance, Google can translate  X  X  X  correctly into  X  X  X  , but would translate  X  X  X  X  X  X  incorrectly into  X  X  X  X  X  X  . Hence  X  X  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  X  X  X  appear in the table. The third column presents the corrected expression s in traditional Chinese . A nd the final column shows the number of times each error o c-curs in the e ntire translation text. The rows are sorted by the first column in Puton g-against all characters in the source text is calculated by dividing the  X  X otal number of incorrectly -translated characters X  with  X  X otal number of characters in the text X  before converting into a percent age , the error rate against one -to -many characters is calcula t-ed by dividing the  X  X otal number of incorrectly -translated char acters X  with  X  X otal end of its translation , there are totally 17,670 characters (including spaces) in the source text , among which 912 have multiple counterparts in traditi onal Chinese .
The r eferences we used in human proofreading include  X  Dictionary of Commonly Used Words in Mainland and Taiwan ( Mainland ve r- X  Dictionary of Commonly Used Words in Mainland and Taiwan ( Taiwan version )  X  Lexical Items for Fundamental Chinese Learning in Hong Kong [2]  X  Revised Edition of the Dictionary o f the Chinese National Language [9]  X  Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese [1]  X  Corpus of Modern Chinese by the Nationa l Language Commission of China  X  Decoding the Standard List of Commonly -used Chinese Characters [13]. Generally speaking, the three tools all perform ed very well in translating the g ov er n-ment work r eport from simplified Chinese int o traditional Chin ese . The accuracy of 4.1 Error a nalysis
T otal ly the three tools made 24 different errors in their translation s , none of which is shared by all the tools. 6 errors were made by two tools, including 3 by Google and JFJ , 2 by Word and Google and 1 by Word and JFJ . 19 errors were made by a single tool, including 11 by Google , 5 by Word and 2 by JFJ . The wide distribution of errors means that the three tools employ quite different approaches in translation , and hence are good representatives of this area of language computing .

The errors listed in the tables are mostly self -evident . W e will discuss a few cases which are more interesting or informative . Errors in simplified -traditional Chinese translation normally happen in characters corresponding to more than one counter part in the target writing system. For example, character  X  in simplified Chinese corr e-spond s to  X  (pine tree) and  X  (loose, slack ) in traditional Chinese . In the original phrase s of  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  means  X  to set the hands loose (untied)  X  and  X  make the land loose (for farming)  X  , hence should be converted to  X  in traditional Chinese. On the other hand ,  X  X  X  X  is a river  X  X  name relevant to the pine tree, hence its correct translation is  X  X  X  X  .

Simplified Chinese c haracter  X  corresponds to  X  (zhi3) and  X  (zhi1) in trad i-tional Chinese. When used as a measure word, it should be converted into  X  . So the correct trans lation of  X  X  X ... X  X  X  in traditional Chinese is  X  X  X ... X  X  X  , not  X  X  X ...  X  X  X  .

Character  X  also has two counterparts in traditional Chinese,  X  ( to make, man u-facture) and  X  (system ) . Word  X  X  X  is the short form of  X  X  X  X  X  , or  X  X o manufa c-ture and sell (pro ducts) X .  X  X  X  means to make a copy. H ence the character  X  in both cases should be converted to  X  . On the other hand, words  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  all refer to some system s . H ence the ir embodied character  X  should remain unchanged in traditional Chinese.

I t is s urprising that MS Word translate s  X  X  X  X  to  X  X  X  X  , even when the option of  X  X ranslate common terms X  is turned off. According to Dictionary of Commonly Used Words in Mainland and Taiwan ( Taiwan version ) [8] , the standard translation is  X  X  X  X  . In fact, none of the many dictionaries we have consulted tells us that the traditional form of simplified  X  can be  X  .  X  X  is a less frequently -used word, and few Mainlanders can be confident about its c orrect translation in traditional Chinese. According to Dictionary of Commonly Used Words in Mainland and Taiwan (Taiwan version) again , the standard counte r-parts of simplified Chinese  X  X  are synonyms  X  X  and  X  X  , not  X  X  . A nd  X  X  X  X   X  appear s in an example sentence of the book . 
As for  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , the computer mistakenly considered  X  X  X  as a word and translated it into  X   X  . However the correct word segmentation is  X  X  X  /  X   X  /  X  /  X  X  /  X  X  X  /  X  X  X  , where  X  X  X  is a word and should be conve rted to  X  X  X  .  X  and  X  are different characters in traditional Chinese. 4.2 E rror solution In this section, we will discuss improvement of the three tools based on further anal y-sis of the errors they made in the experiment.

In the case of MS Word, the function of  X  X  onvert common terms  X  should not be a l lowed to interfere with translation when the user selects not to use it , such as inco r-rectly converting  X  X  X  X  to  X  X  X  X  . On the other hand , the function should be i m-proved. The facts that MS Word would translate  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  to  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X  X  X  to  X  X  X  X   X  and  X  X  X  X  X  to  X  X  X  X  X  X  shows that MS Word is not good enough at Chinese words segmentation and is quite confin ed to the domain of computer science. Word  X  X  X  in the first example means  X  X  X  X  X  X  or  X  seat /post vacant  X  . MS Word m istakenly considered character  X  as a word with the meaning of  X  bit  X  in information technology, and converted it into  X  X  X  .  X  X  X  X  is another strange expression in Chinese. And translating  X  X  X  X  X  into  X  X  X   X  X  X  is not acceptable ei ther, though in computer programming  X  X  often means  X  loop  X  and can be safely converted to  X  X  X  in a Taiwan style. Some people even co n-sider t erm conversion not worthwhile because of two reasons: loss of original  X  flavor  X  o f the source text, and introduc tion of new mistakes [12] .

Google Translate made 32 errors in the experiment , as shown in Table 2. W ord  X   X  appear s 33 times in the source document , among which 13 were incorrectly co n-verted to  X  X  X  , more than the total number of errors made by MS Word or JFJ . That means there is some thing serious ly wrong. A possible reason is that Google over r e-lies on corp ora and statistics MT , and paid insufficient attention to deep and compr e-hensive linguistic analysis [6] . In the n -gram algorithm, we pre -suppose the appea r-ance of a word to be independen t of other words in the context, which is not true in real -world natural languages. Another shortcoming of n -gram is in its implement a-tions, where n is often set to 2 or 3 due to limitation of computing resources . In nat u-ral languages, however, the correct analysis of a word often involve s a more remot e-ly -located word. For instance, in  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , the correct translation of  X  is dependent on its modifying relation with noun  X  , which is 5 characters away. It seems more reasonable to employ a fle x-ible context length in language analysis , not a fixed bigram or trigram for all cases.
It is surprising that JFJ clearly outperforms the two IT giants in simplified -traditional Chinese translation. And the six err ors made by JFJ can be eliminat ed by better use of context ual information . Let X  X  t ak e  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  as an example. Si m-plified Chinese  X  has two counterparts in traditional Chinese:  X  ( fa1: develop, grow) and  X  ( fa4: hair). And  X  X  is still ambiguous, considering  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X   X  X  X  X  an d  X  X  X  X  X  . How ever, putting the lengthy  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  and its correct translation into the conversion dictionary is not cost -effective. And if we do, its var i-ant expressions w ould not be dealt with as well, including  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (without  X  ) and  X   X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X   X  , etc . We turned to the m odern Chinese c orpus of the National Language Commission of Chi na [10 ] , and found that  X  X  X  X  appears 12 times , in  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  and  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  . In all of these cases,  X  X  X  X  can be safely converted to  X  X  X  X  . That means  X  X  X  X  is a mi n-imum translation segment to unambiguously convert  X  into  X  . It is more cost -effective to put  X   X  X  X  X  - X  X  X  X   X  in the computer X  X  conversion dictionary. And the possible appearances of  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  and so on will be covered as well. Simplified -tradit ional Chinese translation achieved an accuracy of 99% more than a decade ago [11, 14] . T he percentage has now been raised to 99.9% and beyond , as shown by o ur experiments on Google Translate, MS Word and JFJ . Notwithstand ing, for further progress , as discussed in the previous section .

In another aspect , because of the one -to -many relationships between simplified and traditional Chinese characters and the great complexities of natural languages , there is no guarantee of 100% correct translation in the foreseeable future . As we know, l i n-guistical ly, every rule leaks; s tatistically, even the most probable event may not ha p-pen. T hat means human proofreading is needed for machine translation , especially when high quality text output is required [15, 16] . Another lovely feature of JFJ is that it goes on to support human proofreading after automatically translating a text from simplified C hinese into traditional C hinese or vice versa. And this supporting function can be further improved as well. A newly revised version of JFJ taking into account of feedback from our exper iment is available for testing on the Web at http://www.acad.polyu.edu.hk/~ctxzhang/jfj/ .

Last but not least, the experiment reported in this article was performed on the si n-gle document of Premier Li X  X  government report. To be better representative of mo d-ern Chinese language , the testing text will be greatly enriched in our further research , both quantitatively and typologically . The author would like to thank his MA postgraduate students of subject  X  X odern Chinese Characters and Information Technology X  at Hong Kong Poly technic Unive r-mous reviewers, whose informative comments and constructive suggestions played an important role in the revision of the paper.
