 H.3.3[Information Search and Retrieval]: information filtering Design, Experimentation 
New event detection and tracking, news portal, Web 
Multi-source news portals, a relatively new technology, receive and gather news from several Web news providers. These systems can make the news more accessible, especially by providing event-oriented groupings by detecting and tracking the briefly demonstrate the first pe rsonalizable Turkish news portal following functionalities (see Figures 1 and 2).  X  New Event Detection and Tracking (NEDT): This component is based on our extensive experime nts with a test collection that we constructed by downlaoding all time-stamped news articles of the year 2005 from five Web Turkish news providers. It contains more than 200,000 news and 80 events annotated by 39 native speakers. In the system implementation, for the event detection sub-component we em ploy the time window concept [3] and some novel approaches such as combined similarity measures.  X  Information Retrieval (IR): Foundations of our IR implementation is described in [1]. In this part we extend the 
Lemur Toolkit (http://www.lemurproject.org/) for our purposes.  X  Information Filtering (IF): Registered users are allowed to choose news that match their interests. Up to ten most recent user-selected news are employed for the generation of each IF profile using a tf.idf based term selection approach. Users can have several IF profiles.  X  News Categorization (NC): Meta data obtained from the Web sources are used for news categorization.  X  Retrospective Incremental News Clustering (RINC) : News are clustered in a restrospective and incremental manner [2]. Users can browse the cluster that contains a selected news.  X  User Personalization (UP): In a ddition to personalized IF, users can save or send any news to the users in their friend list. 
Recently we get URLs from RSS feeds of five different sources to download articles (more than 1,000 per day). In the near
