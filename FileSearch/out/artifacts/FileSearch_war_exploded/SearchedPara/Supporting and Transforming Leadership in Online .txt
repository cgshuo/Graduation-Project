 Behind every successful online creative collaborati on, from Wikipedia to Linux, is at least one effective proje ct leader. Yet, we know little about what such leaders do and how t echnology supports or inhibits their work. My thesis investig ates leadership in online creative collaboration, focusing on the n ovel context of animated movie-making. I first conducted an empiric al study of existing leadership practices in this context. I am now designing a Web-based collaborative system, Sandbox, to underst and the impact of technological support for centralized ver sus decentralized leadership in this context. My expect ed contributions include a comparative investigation o f the effects of different types of leadership on online creative co llaboration, and a set of empirically validated design principles fo r supporting leadership in online creative collaboration.

 Animation, Leadership, Online Creative Collaboratio n. The success of online creative collaboration  X  i.e. , online collaboration with the purpose of creating new arti facts X  X s one of the big surprises of the 21 st century [1]. Groups of amateurs around the world collaborate over the Internet to v oluntarily contribute to a host of impressive and wide-reachin g projects. These include Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia boasting over 10 million user-created articles in over 250 l anguages; Apache, a Web server handling over half of the Web X  s page requests; and Linux, an operating system used by ne arly 40% of large American companies [8]. An emerging body of literature seeking to explain h ow online creative collaboration succeeds has emphasized the central importance of leadership [2,5,6,8]. Leadership, in various forms and to varying degrees, appears in online creative collaboration of every sort. Moreover, as projects grow in popularit y and scope, a corresponding influx of new volunteers requires mor e complex organizational structures. Without effective leader ship, it seems, there can be no successful online creative collabor ation. Despite the central importance of leadership in onl ine creative collaboration, little is known about it outside the contexts of Wikipedia and open source software (OSS) projects, and few studies have explored design opportunities for supp orting such leaders. To address this research gap, my thesis in vestigates online creative collaboration in a novel context X  X nimated movie-making X  X ith a focus on supporting and transforming leadership. My initial work has been an empirical study of exis ting leadership practices in this context, summarized in the next s ection. I am now designing a Web-based collaborative system, San dbox, based on these findings to understand the impact of leade rship centrality on online creative collaboration. To expand our knowledge of leadership in online cre ative collaboration, I conducted an empirical, mixed-meth ods study of leadership in 3 online communities whose members co llaborate over the Internet to produce computer-animated shor t movies called collabs [4]. This study produced 4 main findings: 1. Few collabs produce a completed animation. Less than 20% of collabs produce a completed animation, yet completi on is the ultimate goal for both collab participants and audi ences. 2. Collab leaders are crucial, but overburdened . Leaders do the bulk of the work in a collab, taking on numerous su b-roles. 3. Collab participants have little technological suppo rt. Collabs are organized in basic discussion forum threads, wh ich serve as the locus of activity from start to finish. 4. Collabs have different needs than Wikipedia or OSS projects. The context changes how people collaborate. My current work, outlined in the next section, inve stigates how we might design new technological support that resu lts in more successful collabs and eases the burden on leaders. Based on the findings from my previous study [4], I am designing a Web-based collaborative system, Sandbox, to suppo rt online creative collaboration within the context of animat ed movie-making. The main purpose of Sandbox is to make it e asy for groups of users to create, manage, and complete ani mated movie projects together. Sandbox is being developed as an open-source platfo rm that any online community can appropriate. When creating San dbox projects, creators choose from a set of 18 existing widgets (modular features) or, if they have programming abi lities, they can create their own. I designed these widgets to allev iate the challenges to leadership identified in my previous study [4]. They can be grouped into 4 categories:  X  Group awareness/coordination (5 widgets)  X  Project structure/vision (4 widgets)  X  Quality control/evaluation (6 widgets)  X  Member motivation/attribution (3 widgets) Additionally, when a Sandbox project is created, th e creator sets each widget to 1 of 3 mutually exclusive modes. In centralized leadership mode, the widget X  X  permissions are set such that t he project X  X  leaders have primary control over its fun ctionality. In decentralized leadership mode, control over the widget X  X  functionality is distributed equally across all mem bers of the project. Finally, in the disabled mode, the widget does not appear in the project, and has no effect on its production or outcome. In the group awareness/coordination category, the Activity Visualizer widget acts like a social dashboard [7] to make vis ible information about project members X  recent activity (e.g., last login times, latest contributions, etc.). If the Activity Visualizer widget is set to centralized leadership mode, only a proje ct leader can view it. If it is set to decentralized leadership m ode, however, any project member can see it. In the project structure/vision category, the Specs widget lists the technical specifications (e.g., frames per second, height and width in pixels, etc.) to which any animation submission must adhere. Any project member can adjust these details if the Specs widget is set to decentralized leadership mode. Otherwise, in centralized leadership mode, only a project leader can change t hem. In the quality control/evaluation category, the Competition widget enables members of the same project to compete for the same job or role in the project (e.g., a certain chapter of a story, a particular section of a song for a music video, etc.). If the Competition widget is set to centralized leadership mode, a pro ject leader decides which project member wins the competition. If it is set to decentralized leadership mode, then project members vote on the winner as a group. In the member motivation/attribution category, the Awards widget allows Sandbox users to give each other awards (e.g ., most helpful, most improved, etc.) as tokens of apprecia tion, similar to Wikipedia barnstars [3]. Only a project leader can grant awards to project members if the Awards widget is set to cent ralized leadership mode. In decentralized leadership mode, any project member can grant awards. My general research questions center on the impact of technology on supporting and transforming leadership in online creative collaboration. These include: 1. How do leaders of online creative collaboration ado pt new 2. How does leadership centrality affect online creati ve 3. How does leadership centrality affect online creati ve A mixed-methods evaluation will guide the design pr ocess of Sandbox and allow me to address these research ques tions. RQs 1 and 2 will be addressed with in-depth interviews, p articipant observation, and log file analysis of Sandbox proje ct members and their work. RQ 3 will be addressed with content ana lysis, expert review, and community review of completed Sandbox p rojects. For both qualitative and quantitative data, I will be able to compare existing leadership practices and Sandbox p rojects with varying degrees of leadership centrality across the 4 categories mentioned previously. These comparisons will allow me to understand the particular effects of technological support and different types of leadership on a project X  X  produc tion and outcome. Ultimately, this evaluation will address t he broader question,  X  X or what purposes is online creative col laboration most useful, and how can we best support the practices o f leaders and others who participate in it? X  My thesis will offer new insights into fundamental issues of online collaboration in creative contexts, both in terms of concrete design implications for socio-technical systems and a deeper theoretical understanding of how people work togeth er creatively. Specifically, I will contribute (1) a rich descript ion of existing practices surrounding online creative collaboration in the novel context of animated movie-making; (2) a comparative investigation of the effects of leadership centrali ty on online creative collaboration, focused on this context but connected to related literature in other contexts; (3) a set of empirically validated design principles for supporting online c reative collaboration in this context, organized by leaders hip type and collaboration pattern; and (4) a Web-based collabor ation system, Sandbox, released as OSS for anyone to use and modi fy. In the long term, I envision a multitude of studies in var ious contexts, gradually increasing our understanding of the poten tial and limitations of online creative collaboration. [1] Benkler, Y.
