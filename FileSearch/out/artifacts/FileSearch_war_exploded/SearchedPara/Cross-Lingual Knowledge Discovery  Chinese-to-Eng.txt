Chinese Wikipedia is a collaborative effort of contributors from different Chinese spoken geographic areas with different knowledge backgrounds and language varia-nese Wikipedia articles, it is necessary to break the Chinese text into separate words translation, and translation in general, is dependent on the quality of the segmentation [6]. 3.2 Article Linking For mono-lingual link discovery there are: the Link mining (ML) method [7] and the Page Name Matching (PNM) method [8]. In this paper, it was intended to make use of knowledge domains in different languages. can be computed (for pre-existing anchors). Based on the existing link information that puted. Note that the same anchor text may be linked to different destinations in differ-ent instances where it appears and so it is necessary to identify the most likely link. They then re-trawl the collection looking for the frequency of the anchor phrases used follows: the denominator is the document frequency ( df ) of anchor a in the corpus. 
To link documents within Wikipedia or any documents with Wikipedia, Mihalcea For a given document, a list of all possible n-gram substrings are built and then from targets are the documents with the given title. 
To use this in Chinese to English link discovery, it is necessary to first construct a The targets are the corresponding English documents. 4.1 Anchor Iden tification In this work, we use both the anchor weight [7] and the page name matching [8] me-thods to identify anchors. The reasons are: first, they are very efficient methods, and anchor weights (  X  scores) of all possible anchor candidates can be pre-mined and pre-linked by the human editors. 
With the anchor weighting method, for a new previously unlinked document all the  X  score is looked-up and the anchors sorted by these values. An arbitrary number (based on a threshold, or alternatively a density) of highly ranked links are then cho-sen. In the case of overlapping anchors, the longest anchor is chosen. 
Page name matching has a similar anchor identification process that from the doc-and but then sorted based on the length of title. The rationale for choosing the longer than shorter ones. segmentation anchors may be created for unrelated topics. For example, the following two sentences contain non-Chinese words (underscored) that could be mistakenly linked to the unrelated Chinese articles:  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  ters X   X  and  X  means  X  X n X  and  X  X oth X  separately, but together they (  X  X  ) are often used as place names (e.g. an old name for Beijing city). 4.2 Anchor Translation Triangulation. One way to use page name matching and link mining approaches is to language. 
To do this, a table of documents existing in both languages could be used. Such a table, T lang , can be generated from the page-to-page language links present in Wikipe-dia. This is similar to the translation memory approach that is commonly used in Ma-chine Translation. This is a form of triangulation. An English page is a good target to a Chinese anchor if there exists a link from the anchor to the Chinese document and from the Chinese document to the English document. The relationship of the triangu-lation is illustrated in Fig. 2. Machine Translation. As an addition to the translation with triangulation, Candidate anchors can be translated into English using Google Translate API 2 . Machine transla-incomplete set of the mapping of Chinese / English article titles in Wikipedia. 4.3 Link Recommendation Link recommendation is the final step of our link discovery approach. As in link min-two methods, once an anchor is identified, the target document is also determined. So lead to different discovered link sets. 5.1 Anchor / Link Specification document, a user will become overwhelmed if almost every term in an article is also an anchor. For evaluation purposes we impose a limit of 50 links per document. 5.2 Evaluation cluding  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( Hong Kong ten-dollar note )), then mine the remaining truth, the Precision-at-N and Link Mean Average Precision (LMAP) metrics em-ployed in NTCIR-9 Crosslink task [5, 11] are used to quantify the performance of the different cross-linking methods. 5.3 Experimental Runs lines in Table 2 . The segmentation approach proposed by Tang et al . [12] was used to complete the segmentation task. The LMAP and P@N sco r scored on the extracted W i recall curves are given in Fig. 3. All runs except PNM use the same anchor identifica-tion strategy. So, the difference in the performance of those runs can be attributed to best combination of strategies (and not a different method of choosing anchors). 6.1 Segmentation in CELD In all cases non-segmented runs out performed the segmented variant of the run. Con-the non-perfect performance of any segmentation algorithm, and the links themselves being unlikely to be ambiguous in context (because they are named-entities). granularity in segmentation will however cause the exact opposite problem. The extra step for Chinese segmentation in link discovery will increase the computational com-English link discovery if the goal is set to achieve ultimate linking performance. 6.2 Translation in CELD All runs that used machine translation performed worse than LinkProb and PNM . Run because the entity list cannot be closed. tive we did not test was a combination of the two approaches  X  using machine transla-tion if an entity could not be translated. 6.3 Chinese-to-English Document Linking scored using LMAP and P@N. Given that the number of candidate links in T lang used by link mining method the good performance of PNM is surprising but encouraging. 
Run LinkProbEn2 ranked third performing better than LinkProbEn . The difference between the two runs was the source of the link probability  X  score. In the former the probability came from the Chinese language corpus, but in the latter it came from the English corpus. This suggests that Chinese is a better predictor of which English doc-uments to link to than is English. So the link mining was the best algorithm we tested reported for solving the Chinese-to-English document linking problem, the LMAP and P@N scores of run LinkProb are the best results to date. English. The experimented Chinese-to-English Cross-linking approach included the use of Chinese word segmentation, Chinese to English translation, and link mining. Although Chinese segmentation and machine translation are two essential steps in needed for link discovery. This is because segmentation is implicit in the anchor min-ing and the translation is implicit in cross-language triangulation. 
The experimental results show that the implemented link discovery framework can effectively recommend Chinese-to-English cross-lingual links. This CELD frame-encyclopaedias.
