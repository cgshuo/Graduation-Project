 As the foundation of the Semantic Web [1], ontologies are initially defined as an explicit specification of a con ceptualization [2]. The use of ontologies for the explica-tion of implicit and hidden knowledge is a possible approach to describe the seman-tics of the information sources with the explicit content and overcome the problem of semantic heterogeneity of information sources in the Web. Recent advent of the Se-mantic Web has facilitated the incorporation of various large-scale on-line ontologies in different disciplines and application domains; e.g. UMLS 1 includes 975,354 con-cepts and 2.6 million concept names in it s source vocabularies, and Gene Ontology 2 includes about 17,632 terms, 93.4% with definitions. semantic-based applications; however, there also arise many new challenges for Web ontologies. Web ontologies are due to thei r complex nature far from being a commod-ity and require more support to assist users to utilize domain knowledge efficiently. a) To a large domain ontology like the Gene Ontology, problem-solving may only re-required portions of knowledge in exploring large-scale domain ontologies. This calls According to the Web ontology model, each concept and each relation in Web on-tologies can be a first class object by having a URI, or everything is a thing [3]. When we visualize Web ontologies as graphs, everything including relations is represented complex and it will be not intuitive to grasp the relations between concepts in explo-tance relation of super-concept and sub-con cept. For large-scale ontologies with mul-tidimensional relations, more types of information view than inheritance tree are re-quired to organize concepts and relations fo r more efficient knowledge exploration. human beings to learn and create knowledge meaningfully provides a visual language for organizing and representing knowledge of different disciplines and application domains. A remarkable characteristic of con cept maps is that the concepts are repre-plement the existing model of Web ontologies and propose an approach for analyzing, reorganizing and extending large-scale Web ontologies. In this paper, we analyze the structure of ontologies from the point of view of the graph theory and propose a visual interactive model on top of concept map theory. Our work will be complementary to the Web ontology model in that we expect to analyze the semantic structure of Web ontologies from a new perspective to unco ver some underlying characteristics, which may be helpful to Web ontology exploration. As OWL 3 has become the de facto stan-OWL ontologies in the literature. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We first give an overview of concept map and its applications in Section 2. Then, we explain some preliminary terms and definitions, and then describe a concept map model for Web ontologies, as well as main algorithms of the model in Section 3. Section 4 describes a use case of 5. Finally, a brief conclusion and future re search direction are presented in Section 6. Concept maps that provide a visual representation of knowledge structures and argu-ment forms have been widely used in many different disciplines and application do-mains. They provide a complementary alternative to natural language as a means of communicating knowledge in different domains. Concept mapping is the strategy employed to develop a concept map. The concept mapping technique was developed by Novak and Gowin [5] based on the theories of Ausubel [6]. Concept maps have been defined in a variety of ways using a wide range of names. Generally speaking, a concept map is a special form of a network diagram for exploring knowledge and arrow symbol. The labeled links explain the relations between the nodes and the ar-row describes the direction of the relation, which reads like a sentence (see figure 2). 
Concept maps are used most frequently in education as tools facilitating meaningful learning; however, the characteristics of concept map make it suitable to suitable for Web applications. Web Brain 4 , offers a graphical search engine and converts the users X  search-English learning. KMap [7] is an open architecture concept-mapping tool allowing dif-ferent forms of concept map to be defined and supporting integration with other applica-tions. Hall and Stocks in [8] proposed a multi-level hypermap interface for the display of World Wide Web pages relevant to an undergraduate class. Gram and Muldoon in [9] compared a concept map-based interface to a web page-based interface in terms of accu-interface resulted in better search performance. Concept mapping takes advantage of the remarkable capabilities of diagram-based information representation and embodies rich semantics of knowledge, so we can adopt concept map as a modeling method for analyzing, reorganizing and extending Web ontologies to support efficient ontology exploration. Besides, we expect to analyze large-scale Web ontologies from the graph theory perspective to uncover some underlying characteristics of Web ontologies. We will use BioPAX ontology (see figure 1) for illustration. 3.1 Preliminaries If we want to construct concept maps based on Web ontologies, what we should do at first is to establish a bridge from ontologies to maps. There is a direct mapping from OWL ontologies to concept maps: Definition 1 (Semantic Map). A semantic map  X  is the concept map representation for Web ontologies and consists of a triple (  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  ), where  X   X  is a link to the directed-arcs for relations. Each node v is associated with a concept c and in semantic maps a concept is always linked to several other concepts by arcs specifying the relations between two concepts. Each arc e is associated with one or more relations. The source of e denotes the domain of a relation and the target denotes the how many relations an arc represents we associate each arc with a relation weight rw . All weights are nonnegative in semantic maps. 
Similarly to the graph theory, as a semantic -based diagram, there are also some in-variants in semantic map, based on which we can analyze a semantic map. Definition 2 (Semantic Degree). The semantic degree of a node v in semantic map domain concepts, denoted by number of relations that take c as one of its range concepts, denoted by can see, semantic out-degree (semantic in-degree) is not always equal to the number of out-arcs (in-arcs) and maybe larger if there is more than one relation between two concepts. The semantic out-degree (semantic in-degree) at a specific relation p related to c is represented as ontology relation  X  rdfs:subClassOf  X . Then the number of sub-concepts of c is equal to 
An important step in constructing a good concept map is to identify the key con-tablished from the most general, most inclusive concept, for this particular problem or situation, to the most specific, least general concept. Although this rank order may be always approximate, it helps to identify the relative importance of concepts when exploring a large-scale Web ontology. rank order of concepts in a semantic map. The set of neighbors of a node v is denoted by adjacent nodes and can be computed by the following equation: original sw and its neighbor X  X  sw . If v has more than one neighbor, the  X  indicates the relations between v and i v . We assign rw to  X  if v is considered to have positive affection on v . We assign rw  X  to  X  if computing the overall and permanent sw s of a semantic map later in the literature. 3.2 Semantic-Based Graph Construction In this section we propose a simple algorithm to construct a semantic-based graph for a collection of concepts. The underlying structure of a Web ontology is a collection of illustrated by a node and directed-arc graph. Each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link in the graph. For a selected coll ection of concepts from a Web ontology, we can dynamically construct a graph based on semantic links. preserves arcs of relations taking the node concept as domain. The algorithm distinguishes relations according to whether they relate individuals to individuals graph is constructed based on Web ontology semantics. Definition 4 (Semantic Graph). A semantic graph  X  is a directed graph based on a selected collection of concepts from a We b ontology. A semantic graph holds basic attributes of a semantic map. Every semantic map is a semantic graph. 
For a collection of concepts ( control , entity , interaction , physicalEntityParticipant , xref , dataSource , openControlledVocabulary , catalysis , conversion , physicalEntity and complex ) from the BioPAX ontology, we can dynamically construct a semantic labels on the arc indicates arc weights. Arcs with dotted line represent denote external relations that link concepts within the coll ection with concepts outside (as the concept bioSource is not in the collection). 
During graph construction, concepts linked to only one other as a linked list are valid. According to algorithm 1, each arc in a semantic graph is stored twice: one in redundancy is useful for computing semantic weight, as we will see later. 3.3 Semantic Weight Propagation An important step in constructing a good concept map is to identify the key concepts that apply to the application domain and list them in a rank order, which is established from the most general, most inclusive concept, for this particular problem or situation, to the most specific, least general concept. This rank order can be determined by do-main experts, but it could imply subjective selection and filtration. So we propose an automatic approach to determine rank order based on sw s. As we have mentioned before, the sw computed by equation (1) is just a temporary value. The sw of a node v is affected by its neighbors. If there ar e still nodes not affecting its adjacent nodes stable. The following algorithm can be used to compute the overall semantic weights for a semantic graph. Definition 5 (Prenode). If u is an adjacent node of v and the semantic weight of v has been affected by u in semantic weight propagation, then u is a prenode of v . If added to u  X  X  prenode list. In equation 1, i v is one of v  X  X  prenodes. 
As each node maintain an out-arc list and an in-arc list, we can compute the semantic weight of any adjacent nodes of the focused node, in spite of the direction of arc, so it X  X  efficient for computing semantic weight. 
We can choose physicalEntityParticipant as starting concept, and then the final semantic weights (see table 2) for the semantic graph in figure 2 can be computed by concepts on bottom. 
The process of computing semantic weights for semantic graph is a dynamic propagation of semantic relations between concepts. The propagation of semantic weight is similar to the problem of graph traversal: visit each node following the se-mantic structure of the semantic graph. So the propagation of semantic weight can be and we can rewrite the algorithm based on depth first search (algorithm 3).
  X  is a stable semantic graph. A stable semantic graph is a semantic map, or a seman-tic graph evolves to a semantic map through the propagation of semantic weight com-putation. Although this rank order may be always approximate, it helps to identify the relative importance of concepts in a large-scale Web ontology. We can reorganize the structure of the portion of ontology knowledge based on the relative order of the se-mantic weights for users X  exploration, with the most relevant portions of the ontology with higher semantic weights on top. Users may locate most important and relevant knowledge quickly and efficiently in exploration. Besides, we can construct semantic graphs for different portions of the ontology to support specific explorations. 3.4 Concept Hierarchy Trees The concept hierarchy in Web ontologies is always organized based on the sub-concept/super-concept inheritance relation. Ho wever, for large-scale ontologies with multidimensional relations, it X  X  insufficient to organize concepts only based on inheri-tance and various of information view more than inheritance hierarchy tree are re-heritance a top concept doesn X  X  mean it X  X  important to exploration and for portions of an ontology there is no inheritance relatio n between any two concepts or individuals. For example, there are many kinds of therapies in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) ontology like Massage , Qigong , Physical Breath ing Exercises , etc, but there is no inheritance relation between any two therapies. Then, we may want to construct a with the therapies most effective to cure a kind of disease on top). 
The relations between ontology concepts fall into direct concept relations that di-rectly relate two concepts in Web ontologies (inheritance, disjoints, equivalents et al) and indirect concept relations (some user defined relations). Unlike inheritance ( rdfs:subClassOf ), indirect concept relations can X  X  be viewed as concept hierarchy trees evidently in most ontological tools traditionally. As we have mentioned before, a map and the more specific, less general concepts arranged hierarchically below, and special exploration preference. We can cons truct a multi-relational concept hierarchy tree for portions of a ontology based on semantic weights, rather than a single relation relational concept hierarchy tree using the algorithms in section 3.2 and 3.3. TCM is a medical science that embodies traditional Chinese culture and philosophical principles, which constitute the basis and essence of the simple and naive materialism in ancient China. As a kind of complex medical science, TCM knowledge system embodies many concepts and relations and each concept may be related to innumer-able individuals. In collaboration with the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (CATCM), we have been developing a domain ontology for TCM. Hun-dreds of TCM experts and software engineers have taken more than 5 years to build the world X  X  largest TCM ontology [10], which is now called the Traditional Chinese Medical Language System (TCMLS). More than 10,000 concepts and 100,000 indi-viduals are defined in current knowledge base (KB) and the ontology under develop-ment is still a small part of the complete ontology. 
According to our model, we have partially implemented a graphical Web ontology the TCMLS visually and interactively. In the Semantic Browser, portions of ontolo-gies are visualized as semantic maps base d on semantics. Users can navigate from concept to concept through semantic links to browse different aspects of TCM do-main knowledge. The Semantic Browser can reorganize the structure of a portion of TCM knowledge based on the relative order of the overall semantic weights com-puted in propagation, recommending relevant and important portions of the ontology parts. Although there have been a number of ontological tools (e.g. Prot X g X  6 and On-toRama 7 ) that can assist users explore ontologies visually, they mainly focus on graphical control of ontologies (e.g. depth co ntrol and layout control) rather semantics itself during exploration. There are also some related works about graph model for ontology in literatures. Gerbe and Mineau in [12] proposed a conceptual graph based Ontolingua, and Corbett in [13] described the semantic interoperability using concep-tual graph. A few researches have been done in proposing approaches to extract par-ticular aspects of an ontology. Noy and Musen in [14] described an approach to spec-ify self-contained portions of a domain ontology through traversal of concepts. Bhatt and Taniar in [15] proposed a distributed approach to sub-ontology extraction to ex-tract particular aspects of the whole ontology. In this paper, we propose a visual interactive concept map model to support efficient Web ontology exploration. We demonstrate that concept map can capture users X  in-teractive requirements and complement Web ontologies in several aspects. We have proposed several algorithms for analyzing, reorganizing and extending Web ontolo-gies from the graph theory perspective. Por tions of Web ontologies can be represented as semantic maps and semantic weight propagation approach can be used to deter-mine overall semantic weights for semantic maps. 
We are going to conduct some experiments on the main algorithms of the model with several large local ontologies of the TCMLS to test performance. Currently, our model is based on single domain ontology, but we are planning to take our model into a distributed environment with multiple ontologies and integrate several Web ontolo-gies for efficient exploration.
