 present, it is just a collection of a few recent papers. Whereas it is fair to describe new ideas enthusiastically, the past published and recognized work in the field demands adequate importance. Ideally, a few chapters should have been devoted to describe past work on CBIR.
 This book, can in no way, be regarded as a detailed treatise of the current state-of-the-art concerning
CBIR technology. There is a significant amount of work done in the past few years that one book cannot capture. However, this book does provide a general overview of challenges involved in CBIR and proposes a few solutions and thus paves way for more detailed texts on this important subject.
 Knowledge Management: Lessons Learned, What Works and What Doesn X  X . By Michael E.D. Koenig and T. Kanti Srikantaiah (Eds.), Information Today, Inc., 2004, $44.50 ISBN 1-57387-181-8
Knowledge Management (KM) as a practice and as a scholarly interest has gone through several cycles in the years since the term first came into use. During the first phase in business, managers attempted to codify what employees knew and enter these knowledge representations in large databases for sharing across the organization. In the second phase, a variety of strategies were employed in order to make knowl-edge  X  X  X xplicit X  X  as numerous writers about knowledge and its management have discussed. Currently, many strategists continue to see knowledgeable employees as valuable, and consequently they are emphasizing learning and development and providing opportunities for expression and knowledge sharing along with incentives to form communities of practice and communication networks.

In Knowledge Management: Lessons Learned , the editors have assembled works by a group of writers from universities, business, government, and non-governmental organizations, some of whom are recog-nized leaders or scholars in the area. Following on from their first volume in the series, Knowledge Man-agement for the Information Professional (2000) the editors  X  intent is a practical one: to highlight knowledge management programs that have been successful, to warn of difficulties in KM efforts and how to overcome them, and to provide detail in implementing KM for those who have this responsibility.
The editors provide a  X  X  X oad map X  X  to help readers navigate through the sections and chapters, acknowledg-ing that few readers will absorb the text whole, cover to cover. Each chapter stands on its own, and, in fact, each one can be read in any order. The road map guide points to some new areas of knowledge manage-ment that were not covered in-depth in the first volume, for example, content management, competitive intelligence, communities of practice, etc.

There is a focus on the practical lessons that knowledge management professionals have learned, but this does not mean the text is narrow in focus. Just the opposite; the topics included are a broad array of strategic applications of KM, and case studies are provided to illustrate such applications. Over 30 chap-ters cover many aspects of KM that are given short shrift in other works, including cost analysis, infor-mation architecture, semantic web, taxonomies, text mining, corporate information gathering, learning and education related to knowledge management, and incentives for knowledge sharing. Well known names in knowledge management such as Yogesh Malhotra, who has a robust KM web presence, and Elisabeth Davenport, who has been conducting empirical research in KM sponsored by the European
Commission, present strong chapters. Davenport  X  s writing is particularly interesting as she discusses her research related to interpersonal knowledge and organization foresight, a creative approach to look-ing at how knowledgeable workers contribute to a networked organization  X  s ongoing ability to thrive and develop. The editors themselves contribute eight items, some of which are very brief reflections or arguments.

Notable in Knowledge Management: Lessons Learned is Leonard Ponzi  X  s paper on the  X  X  X irth of a Dis-cipline X  X  that examines publishing patterns in knowledge management as a way to describe the emergence of
KM, a field worthy or reflection and study. Ponzi presents the results of his doctoral study, a bibliometric analysis, identifying journals in which KM articles are published, listing the most cited authors, the most cited works, and the academic literature on knowledge management along with his original own particular analysis. Not surprisingly, Nonaka and Takeuchi  X  s classic work, The Knowledge Creating Company: How
Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation appears as the most cited academic KM publica-tion. Nonaka and Takeuchi are usually credited with creating de facto KM theory as it stands today. Pro-fessors and students are sure to find Ponzi  X  s findings instructive and helpful, especially when looking to develop reading lists and in designing courses.

The strength of this compilation is that the reader has a broad range of writers  X  works to sample. The case studies offer the real  X  lessons  X  to which the title refers, but other chapters have information of value too. Although many of the authors use the usual tacit/explicit knowledge dichotomy without offering any original insights into knowledge or knowledge acquisition, there are several chapters that stand out as especially well written and full of rich description and interesting concepts. The papers in this volume that focus on learning offer enlightened views of how organizations can become more knowledge-centered, namely by encouraging learning through better use of information, through organization, and through person to person interaction. David Bennet  X  s chapter  X  X  X earning and the Knowledge Worker X  X  builds on Senge  X  s ideas in The Fifth Discipline (1990) and offers an integrative approach to the role of systematic learning endeavors in improving and developing organizational knowledge. Alex Bennet has an equally well written paper on implementing knowledge management in the US Department of the Navy. Bennet avoids jargon (for the most part) and, instead, talks about information literacy, learning objectives, and the process of  X  X  X nowing X  X  in great detail. Roland Droitsch  X  s equally revealing piece on how knowledge management was implemented at the US Department of Labor is an interesting read that contains useful references.

One wonders who the audience is for this book because the chapters are inconsistent in quality, style, and approach. Some seem aimed at an academic audience; the authors speak with a scholarly voice, and the references are from academic journals. Other sections without references are clearly popular in style and read as if they are lifted from an Internet based KM business magazine. To be fair most of the writers do include information on challenges they or others have faced in KM implementation, elevating the case studies a step higher than the common genre of  X  X  X ow we did it right X  X . Perhaps Knowledge Management:
Lessons Learned is meant to offer something for everyone, and in that case, it succeeds fairly well. The edi-tors are wise to be producing a follow-up volume to their first knowledge management work, because the field changes rapidly, and they and the book  X  s readers will quickly realize that most of the chapters here are very much based in the  X  X  X ere and now X  X  and will be dated quickly. Perhaps Koenig and Srikantaiah are already at work on volume three.
