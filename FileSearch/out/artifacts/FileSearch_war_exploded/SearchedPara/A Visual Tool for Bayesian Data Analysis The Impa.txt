 Na  X   X ve Bayes (NB) classifiers are simple probabilistic clas-sifiers still widely used in supervised learning due to their tradeoff between efficient model training and good empiri-cal results. One of the drawbacks of these classifiers is that in situations of data sparsity (i.e. when the size of train-ing set is small) the maximum likelihood estimation of the probability of unseen features in these situations is equal to zero causing arithmetic anomalies. To prevent this undesir-able behavior, a number of smoothing techniques have been proposed [4]. Among these, the Bayesian approach incor-porates smoothing in terms of prior knowledge about the parameters of the model usually called hyper-parameters . Our research question is: can a visualization tool help re-searchers to quickly assess the goodness of the performance of NB classifiers by setting optimal smoothing parameters?

Our demo aims to record and visualize the effect of differ-ent combinations of choices of NB classifiers and smoothing approaches. Inspired by the work of [2, 3, 4], this tool ad-dresses researchers who want to (i) compare different smooth-ing variants with a manual optimization of the parameters by means of the two-dimensional visual approach [1] and (ii) investigate the differences between Bayesian prior smoothing and the fixed coefficient interpolation method [4]. Moreover, the graphical visualization may be helpful for educational purposes or research projects that consider to employ NB classifiers.

Three NB classifiers  X  multivariate Bernoulli model, Multi-nomial model, Poisson model  X  can be selected and the rel-ative priors X  hyper-parameters (Beta, Dirichlet, and Gamma prior respectively) can be tuned to produce different smooth-ing effect on different standard test collection (Reuters, 20-Newsgroups, Oshumed). The visualization tool allows the user to (i) direct input the values of the hyper-parameters to compare standard smoothing variants, (ii) recall specific
