 The panel session, Data Driven Science discusses application and use of knowledge discovery, machine learning and data analytics in science disciplines; in natural, physical, medical and social sci-ence; from physics to geology, and from neuroscience to population health.

Knowledge discovery methods are finding broad application in all areas of scientific endeavor, to explore experimental data, to dis-cover new models, to propose new scientific theories and ideas. In addition, the availability of ever larger scientific data sets is driving a new data-driven paradigm for modeling of complex phenomena in physical, natural and social sciences.

The purpose of this panel is to bring together users of knowledge discovery, machine learning and data analytics methods across the science disciplines, to understand what tools and methods are prov-ing effective in areas such as data exploration and modeling, to un-cover common problems that can be addressed in the KDD commu-nity, and to explore the emerging data-driven paradigm in science.

The Ice-Cube detector encompasses a cubic kilometer of south-polar ice and searches for nearly massless subatomic par-ticles called neutrinos. It measures about 275 million cosmic rays every day, which amounts to about one terabyte of unfiltered data every day. In this vast amount of data, the project aims at finding information to probe the most violent astrophysical sources: events like exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts, and cataclysmic phenom-ena involving black holes and neutron stars using methods from data mining.
 Professor M X ller is full professor of Geophysics at the School of Geosciences at the University of Sydney. He received his under-graduate degree from the Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel in Germany, followed by a Ph.D in Earth Science from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, in 1993. Af-ter joining the University of Sydney as a Lecturer in Geophysics in 1993, he established the University of Sydney Institute of Ma-rine Science and built the EarthByte e-research group. In 2013 he started a project working together with the data-mining experts at NICTA and SIRCA to tackle grand scientific challenges of geo-sciences and earth dynamics in completely new ways.
 Dr. Berger-Wolf is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and an Adjunct Associate Professor at the De-partment for Bioengineering at the University of Illinois, Chicago. She received her undergraduate degrees in computer science and mathematics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1995 and her Ph.D in computer science at the University of Illinois, Ur-bana-Champaign in 2002. In 2005 she started her position at the University of Illinois, Chicago. Her research focuses on the de-velopment and application of qualitative algorithmic methods to problems in population biology of plants, animals, and humans, from genetics to social interactions. She brings together data min-ing methods from computer science and problems from biology.
