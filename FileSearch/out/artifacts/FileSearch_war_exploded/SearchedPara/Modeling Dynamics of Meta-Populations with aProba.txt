 Increasingly, diverse online social networks are locally and globally interconnected by sharing information in the Web ecosystem. Accordingly, emergent macro-level phenomena have been observed, such as global spread of news across different types of social media. Such real-world diffusion is hard to define with a single social platform alone since dy-namic influences between heterogeneous social networks are not negligible. Also, the underlying structural property of networks is important, as it drives the diffusion process in a stochastic way. In this paper, we propose a macro-level diffu-sion model with a probabilistic approach by combining both heterogeneity and structural connectivity of social networks. As real-world phenomena, we take cases from news diffusion across News, social networking sites (SNS), and Blog media using the ICWSM X 11 Spinn3r dataset which contains over 386 million Web documents covering a one-month period in early 2011. We find that influence between different media types is varied by context of information. News media are the most influential in the Arts and Economy categories, while SNS and Blog media are in the Politics and Culture categories, respectively. Also, controversial topics such as political protests and multiculturalism failure tend to spread concurrently across social media, while entertainment top-ics such as film releases and celebrities are likely driven by internal interactions within single social platforms. We ex-pect that the proposed model applies to a wider class of diffusion phenomena in diverse fields including the social sciences, marketing, and neuroscience, and that it provides a way of interpreting dynamics of meta-populations in terms of strength and directionality of influences among them. H.3.4 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Systems and Software X  Information networks Dynamic influence; meta-populations; social media
Continuous digital streams are being generated by hetero-geneous online social networks in the Web ecosystem. These streams are both locally and globally interconnected across different types of social media including News, social net-working sites (SNS), and Blog. Every connection between documents can be defined with hyperlinks [8, 11, 15, 20], shared quotes [19], similar keywords [3, 12], or specific ac-tions such as retweets and hashtags [13, 18, 23, 27]. Under-lying diffusion mechanisms govern the reach of these connec-tions possibly ranging from a single social platform such as Twitter [13, 18, 23, 27] or blogosphere [3, 12, 20] to multiple different kinds of social networks [8, 11, 15, 19].
Diffusion Process: The diffusion of information has been commonly believed to consist of two phases: (1) emer-gence of information by external influence such as mass me-dia (e.g., triangles in Fig.1(a)), and (2) cascading spread of the information through internal influence such as inter-personal communications (e.g., edges in Fig.1(a)) [7, 16, 19, 21, 23]. Previous studies have mostly focused on diffusion within single social platforms. However, for a better un-derstanding of spreading behaviors, it is not negligible to consider the effects of interactions between different social networks on diffusion. In this study, we ask the question  X  X f we do not limit a diffusion space to a single social platform (e.g., squares in Fig.1(a)) but extend it to interconnected social media such as News, SNS, and Blog, then how would it affect the diffusion process? X  This research question is an attempt to reveal underlying mechanisms of global diffu-sion across heterogeneous social networks, which requires to resolve the following main challenges.

Main Challenges and Approaches: First, it is hard to define external and internal influences in interconnected social media. Global diffusion breaks the walls between di-verse social networks, which changes the view of external influence within a single social platform into internal influ-ence between different networks with a bird X  X  eye view (gray triangles in Fig.1(b)). Details are discussed in Section 3. Second, topologies across multiple social networks are hid-den, and also it is difficult to obtain local structures due in part to privacy issues and lively changing interactions between online users. Third, global diffusion necessarily in-cludes different types of numerous social networks, which requires the consideration of meta-population schemes [5]. outside of the interconnected networks).
 That is, the way of classifying social networks gives a differ-ent interpretation of dynamics of diffusion across heteroge-neous social networks. Finally, diffusion patterns would be varied by context of information [8, 23, 27].

In order to resolve the first issue, we propose a new con-ceptual framework for diffusion across heterogeneous social networks (Dynamic Influence) as shown in Fig.1(b) where influences by contact networks (internal influence) are again separated from confounding factors (external influence) [4, 23]. Based on the conceptual design, we deal with the second and third challenges by modeling macro-level diffusion with a probabilistic approach which incorporates heterogeneity and structural connectivity of networks into the simple and robust mass-action Bass model [6, 7]. Finally, for compre-hensive context of diffusion, we focus on noteworthy real-world news by using the Wikipedia Current Events [2] which covers representative topics of conventional news outlets.
Experimental Results: As real-world diffusion phe-nomena, we take cases from news diffusion across News, SNS, and Blog media. In this regard, we investigate the ICWSM X 11 Spinn3r dataset [1] which contains over 386 mil-lion Web documents covering a one-month period in early 2011. We interpret global spread of news in social media with categorical differences, namely, Politics, Business &amp; Economy, Disasters, Science &amp; Technology, Arts &amp; Culture, and Sports. As a result, we find that influence between dif-ferent media types is varied by context of information, which leads to different diffusion patterns. For instance, News me-dia are the most influential in the Arts and Economy cat-egories, while SNS and Blog media are in the Politics and Culture categories, respectively. Controversial topics such as political protests in the Middle East and multiculturalism failure tend to drive concurrent and synchronized diffusion across all social media, while entertainment topics such as film releases and celebrities exhibit internal diffusion within single social platforms. Such macro-level observations, to the best of our knowledge, are seen for the first time.
Main Contributions: The main contributions of this paper are providing a new conceptual design for diffusion across heterogeneous social networks, and accordingly mod-eling a macro-level diffusion by combining the two main fea-tures of real-world networks (heterogeneity and connectiv-ity), which has not been studied in previous research. This can improve the accuracy of a diffusion model because re-lated work has mostly focused on single social platforms. Fi-nally, we interpret global diffusion in terms of strength and directionality of influences among meta-populations. We ex-pect that the proposed model applies to a wider class of dif-fusion phenomena such as dynamic interactions across local communities/countries and functional brain networks in the social sciences, marketing, and neuroscience.
 In the rest of this paper, Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 explains a conceptual framework for diffusion across heterogeneous social networks, and accordingly Section 4 proposes a macro-level diffusion model reflecting dynamic influences across meta-populations. Section 5 describes data preparation and fundamental statistics of news diffusion in social media. Section 6 presents experimental results, and finally Section 7 concludes this study.
News Media as Online Social Networks: Tradition-ally, mass media has been regarded as external and offline out-of-network sources such as radio, TV, and newspapers. However, today mass media is moving from offline into the Web ecosystem, which provides researchers with benefits to quantify the effect of external influence in more accurate level than before [23]. Moreover, online news media have formed their own networks, such as proactive citations to relevant news articles of other competitive news agencies for more reliable and prompt reports [15]. This enables news media to be frequently exposed and connected to other on-line social networks such as SNS and Blog. In this study, we consider News media as online social networks rather than separate and independent information sources.

Context of Diffusion: Significant variations in diffu-sion patterns have been observed between different topics [23, 27]. For instance, diffusion of political issues is con-siderably driven by external influence, while entertainment topics spread through internal communications [23]. The authors of [27] showed that political topics are relatively persistent compared to non-controversial subjects. However, these studies have focused on a single social platform such as Twitter, so the dynamics of external and internal influences is limited to the local observations. Our study examines global spread across different social media with comprehen-sive topics using the Wikipedia Current Events [2], not lim-ited to site-specific trending topics.

Bass Model as Fundamental Framework: In the marketing literature adopting behavior was mathematically represented with a conditional likelihood of adoption by the Bass model [6]. This model consists of likelihoods of  X  X n-novation X  and  X  X mitation X  which correspond to the external and internal influence, respectively. It has provided realistic and robust estimation of new product growth patterns, and thus it has been one of the influential diffusion models across diverse areas such as marketing, computer science and eco-nomics [7, 16, 21, 29]. Its fundamental assumption is that a population is homogeneous and fully connected in the same way as the traditional macro-level diffusion models [21, 24]. This simplicity has enabled intuitive interpretation and has led to a wide range of extensions of the model [16, 21, 26]. Heterogeneity and Structures of Social Networks: Regarding heterogeneity of social networks, one extension of the Bass model allows mixed populations such as multi-national diffusion of a product. For example, the adoption rate of a consumer product in one country indirectly influ-ences that in another country [16, 26]. However, this exten-sion disregards the effect of network topologies on diffusion. The authors of [25] integrated different layers of single social networks into a weighted composite network scheme such as Bluetooth proximity networks, call log networks, affiliation networks, and friendship networks for 55 university students. This diversity of networks are for one singe social networks, not for heterogeneous social networks.

In terms of network structures, there has been interest in the effect of structures of networks on the diffusion such as cluster density and reachability [17, 28], and degree distribu-tions [21]. The authors of [21] incorporated degree distribu-tions into the Bass model, but their assumption of a linear influence of the number of neighboring adopters does not guarantee the probabilistic constraint. Details are discussed in Section 4.2.3. All these studies are still limited to single social networks. The authors of [11] inferred hidden directed networks of real diffusion based on the maximum directed spanning tree of a graph, which requires at least informa-tion about weighted network structures. However, it is not only hard to obtain network structures for whole heteroge-neous populations, but the structures are also dynamically changing. Our study aims at inferring a macro-level trend of influence flow across heterogeneous social networks without such micro-level topologies.

In this paper, we model macro-level diffusion by combin-ing heterogeneity and structural connectivity of social net-works with a probabilistic approach. This is a generalization of the simple mass-action Bass model into dynamics of meta-populations by covering local and global influences within and between multiple social networks in a probabilistic way.
Global spread of information across different social net-works makes it challenging to uncover its underlying mech-anisms of diffusion because of two fundamental issues: (1) hidden structures and (2) diversity of multiple social net-works. For a better understanding of macro-level diffusion processes, we propose a new conceptual design for diffusion across heterogeneous social networks as shown in Fig. 1.
Dichotomous View: Fig.1(a) illustrates different types of isolated social networks. From the aspect of a single so-cial platform, the world is divided into inside and outside of each platform, and thus it does not distinguish the types of social networks outside. External influence of a single social platform has recently been quantified by [23] as exogenous out-of-the-network effects. Interestingly, it was shown that almost 30% of diffusion regarding some trending topics in Twitter is attributed to external influence. This is ten times larger than the typical value of external influence (0.03), and it is rather similar to the average value of internal influence (0.38) in the marketing literature [22]. Such a large propor-tion of out-of-the-network effects supports the fact that the influence outside of a single social platform is not ignorable. Thus, it is meaningful to outline diverse social networks with a bird X  X  eye view, away from the dichotomous view.
 Dynamic Influence: We define a framework of Dynamic Influence in which different types of social networks directly interact with each other as if they were in the same net-works, as shown in Fig.1(b). Due to the collapse of diffu-sion boundaries of single social platforms, external influences in original social platforms (red/dark triangles in Fig.1(a)) are redefined as internal influences (gray/light triangles in Fig.1(b)) between different types of individuals by their hid-den interactions (dashed lines in Fig.1(b)) and external in-fluences (red/dark triangles in Fig.1(b)) from outside of the interconnected heterogeneous social networks. This frame-work interprets influence between different types of social networks as direct and simultaneous effects on diffusion.
In real-world situations, more and more users come across various news contents through multiple social networks with the help of Web technologies such as RSS news feeds, social media aggregators (e.g., TweetDeck, HootSuite), and mis-cellaneous mobile applications, without the need to jump from one to another. This enables users to obtain infor-mation from their preferred media sources (e.g., Facebook friends, Google news, journals in Blogspot) in a direct way, not depending on the exposures to information brought by their own contact networks. These collective user behaviors consequently make heterogeneous online social networks in-terconnected rather than separated.
In this section we propose a macro-level diffusion model reflecting dynamics of heterogeneous social networks as dis-cussed in the previous section. We first describe the Bass model as a fundamental framework and then propose our Dynamic Influence Model.
Let A ( t ) be the number of cumulative adopters at time t , a ( t )(= d A ( t ) / d t ) be the number of new adopters, given n whole population. Accordingly, we denote the proportion of the cumulative adopters by F ( t ) = A ( t ) /n and the propor-tion of new adopters by f ( t ) = d F ( t ) / d t = a ( t ) /n . Then, the ratio of new adopters to potential adopters at time t is called the hazard function h ( t ) in the Bass model [6],
The Bass model assumes the hazard function to be a linear form of the proportion of the cumulative adopters [6, 7],
The parameter p is called coefficient of innovation since it does not interact with the cumulative adopter propor-tion F ( t ), and q is called coefficient of imitation because it represents the internal influence of previous adopters [7]. Equation (2) has a closed form solution,
As the Equation (2) shows, the model assumes a homo-geneous and completely connected population. We incor-porate heterogeneity and structural property of real-world networks into the simple and robust mass-action Bass model at a macro level. This improves the accuracy of a diffusion model dealing with either single social networks or hetero-geneous but unstructured populations. We now formally describe the problem and extend the Bass model in a probabilistic way.
In reality, the network structures of the whole population are hidden, but dynamic influences among different types of populations are not ignorable. Thus, the goal is to infer the macro-level influence between different types of populations based on a real-world network property in a probabilistic ap-proach without knowing the network structures. In more de-tail, given the number of cumulative adopters for each of m populations at time t from 1 to T , { A i ( t ) } T t =1 , i = 1 ,...,m , we aim to infer unobservable influence between populations, c i , which denotes the probability that an individual of type i adopts when it is exposed to a previous adopter of type i Particularly, we use the power-law distribution as one of the real-world network properties [10, 24].
For modeling diffusion in heterogeneous social networks, we begin with interpreting the Bass model in a probabilistic point of view. Since the proportion of adopters in the Bass model is in fact its expectation in the mean-field mass-action kinetics of the model, it can be thought of as an adoption probability that an average individual adopts at time t , where adopt is a binary random variable for the event of an individual X  X  adoption, and it will be abbreviated to  X  a  X  in the rest of the paper for brevity. Similarly, we can view the hazard function as a new adoption probability P ( a | X  a,t ), where  X  t denotes the partial derivative with respect to t , and  X  stands for the opposite. Therefore, P ( a |  X  a,t ) in-dicates the probability that an average individual, who has not adopted before, adopts at time t .

By separating external and internal influences and ap-plying the probability of union of two independent events ( P ( A  X  B ) = P ( A ) + P (  X  A ) P ( B )), we get where P ext ( a | X  a,t ) and P int ( a | X  a,t ) denote the new adop-tion probabilities by external and internal influences, respec-tively.

Heterogeneity of Meta-Populations: To deal with heterogeneity of populations, we introduce a random vari-able, i = 1 ,...,m for different types of m meta-populations and thus construct m different equations of new adoption probabilities for each type as
Like the coefficient of innovation in the Bass model, we consider the new adoption probability by external influence as where p i  X  [0 , 1].

Structural Connectivity: Now, let us focus on the in-ternal new adoption probability by considering the struc-tural connectivity of contact networks. Suppose that an in-dividual of type i has k neighbors in which j = ( j 1 ,...,j neighbors of each individual type have already adopted. Then, from the sum rule and Bayes X  theorem, the internal new adoption probability is factorized by where n = P m i =1 n i and n i is the population of type i .
The distribution of an individual X  X  exposures to previous adopters in its neighbors is modeled as a binomial distribu-tion, which is consistent with prior diffusion models [21, 23]. Thus, each contagion is a Bernoulli trial, and the probability that an individual adopts after j = ( j 1 ,...,j m ) T contacts is where c i 0 i  X  [0 , 1] denotes the probability that an individual of type i adopts when it is exposed to a previous adopter of type i 0 . Note that it is the probability that an individual is affected by at least one of its adopting neighbors, i.e. one minus the probability of the complementary event that it is not affected by any of the previous adopters in its neighbors. More detailed comparison with the linear influence model of [21] will follow later in Section 4.2.3.

From a macro point of view, the probability distribution of having j adopters in k neighbors is a multinomial distri-bution, where j = P m i =1 j i and P = P m i =1 P ( a | i,t ).
Finally, we assume that the degree distribution of an in-dividual follows a power law since real-world networks are scale-free networks exhibiting power-law distributions [8, 10, 15, 18, 20, 24], where  X  is the power law coefficient, and  X  (  X  ) = P n  X  1 Substituting Equation (10), (11), and (12) into Equation (9) gives the internal new adoption probability,
P int ( a | X  a,i,t )=1  X  1 Note that the neighboring adopters j in Equation (9) is marginalized out in Equation (13) by the mutinomial the-orem. Therefore, our macro-level diffusion model does not require micro-level information such as local structures of contact networks.

Again, by substituting Equation (8) and (13) into Equa-tion (7), we obtain the system of partial derivative equations for the Dynamic Influence Model. It is not mathematically tractable, and thus we need to solve it numerically to get the adoption probabilities { P ( a | i,t ) } m i =1 . Before finishing this subsection, it is worth comparing our Bernoulli influence model in Equation (10) with the linear influence model of [21]. The authors of [21] only consid-ered diffusion in homogeneous networks, and thus the corre-sponding linear influence model in heterogeneous networks would be where c i 0 i  X  0 is the influence coefficient that an adopter in the neighbors of type i 0 affects an individual of type i . Note that the influence increases linearly with the number of previous adopters in neighbor.

Technically, it is not a probability distribution because an individual has many adopters in its neighbors. Therefore, it is not an appropriate assumption for a probabilistic model. The benefit of the linear influence model is that it helps simplify the internal new adoption probability in Equation (9) as a linear form of the adoption probabilities,
However, Equation (15) is just the first-order Taylor ap-proximation of Equation (13). This is verified by letting x = 1  X  P m i 0 =1 c i 0 i P ( a | i 0 ,t ) and f ( x ) = P tion (13) and expanding Talyor series for f ( x ) at x = 1. Thus, the linear influence model is a linear approximation of our Bernoulli influence model around when there exist no previous adopters (  X  i,P ( a | i,t ) = 0  X  x = 1). Therefore, our Bernoulli influence model is more sophisticated than the linear influence model, and because it is based on a prob-ability distribution, it naturally guarantees the probability constraint, 0  X  p ( a | j ,k,  X  a,i,t )  X  1.

In this section, we modeled macro-level diffusion based on the conceptual design for diffusion across heterogeneous so-cial networks, which is a generalization of the mass-action Table 1: Identified users in social media from 60 mil-lion English documents covering a one month period in early 2011 (an entity in each media is considered as a user in this paper).
 Bass model into dynamics of meta-populations in a proba-bilistic way by combining the two essential features, hetero-geneity and structural connectivity of social networks.
In order to reveal underlying mechanisms of real-world diffusion at a macro level, we take cases from global spread of news in social media. In this section, we first describe our dataset collection and examine fundamental statistics of diffusion patterns in social media.
We investigate the ICWSM X 11 dataset [1] which is freely available to research communities. This dataset consists of over 386 million Web documents such as blog posts, news articles, microblog contents, and forum posts covering a one-month period in early 2011 (Jan. 13 to Feb. 14). It was collected by a licensed social media crawler, Spinn3r, and each record of collected documents mainly consists of a title, a posting time, a written language, and a full HTML body.
Target Documents: We focus on analyzing News, SNS, and Blog documents (98.37% of the dataset), since these are not only the most relevant to real-world news, but we can also observe dynamic interactions among representative social media. We extracted nearly 60 million English doc-uments from the dataset of the three media types by filter-ing out duplicate documents for their unique identity. We discovered 4.1 million non-isolated documents (containing at least one hyperlink) by extracting hyperlinks or written URLs in their main text. Also, to obtain the true identity of hyperlink destinations, we expanded all shortened URLs.
User Identification: There is no universally valid user information, due to the diverse sources that the dataset draws from. As shown in Table 1, we chose five major SNS and Blog domains for each media type as we can write reg-ular patterns for extracting user identity. We also regard the second-level domain of news sites (e.g., cnn.com, ny-times.com) as the unique identifier of a mainstream news agency by using the publisher type of each document, pro-vided by the dataset. As discussed in Section 2, we con-sider News media as online social networks, and thus we Figure 2: Hyperlink cascade distributions. Red cir-cles indicate the distribution of connected document count for all 60 million English posts, blue squares are for documents created by identified users, green crosses are for documents related to selected top 63 largest news diffusion, and black dots are for doc-uments which are related to the selected news and also created by identified users. examined the existence of News media networks by con-structing document networks of news articles. We finally extracted about 9K news sites which constitute the largest strongly connected network. This strong connection implies that each news site can reach every other news site, which provides news media with more frequent chances to be con-nected with each other and further to be exposed to other types of social media such as SNS and Blog.

We eventually identified 6.4 million users in social me-dia from the 60 million target documents. The identified users generated 57% (34 million) of the target documents and 41% (1.7 million) of non-isolated documents. Fig. 2 shows the hyperlink cascade distributions of all target doc-uments (red circles) and ones created by the identified users (blue squares). The other two plots in Fig. 2 are explained in the following subsection. As the figure illustrates, the ma-jority of hyperlink cascades are attributed to the documents created by the identified users. This means that major News, SNS and Blog domains likely contribute to a wide diffusion in social media, and these identified users are meaningful to study the mechanisms of global spread in social media. Figure 3: User and document distributions of the top 63 largest news diffusion by social media types.
The next step is to identify real-world news stories during the dataset period. As a pertinent reference of notewor-thy real-world news, we use Wikipedia Current Events [2] which provides chronologically organized event profiles, con-tinuously updated and discussed by volunteers. Despite po-tential selection bias of volunteers, this is a good reference considering geographical bias of traditional news agencies, inaccessibility of retroactive crawling from news aggregation sites, and the coverage of representative topics of conven-tional news outlets.

Real-world News Identification: We parsed the page of Wikipedia events corresponding to our dataset period and built a real-world news registry along with relevant keywords of each news story. Keywords are collected by crawling reference hyperlinks on the event page and then conduct-ing named entity recognition and resolution [9] with the crawled pages, and finally by extracting key terms from the brief summary of each news on that event page. Using the extracted keywords, we labeled the documents for tracing news diffusion in social media. As a result, we chose the top largest diffusion of 63 news stories, each of which has more than 150 adopters. Table 2 shows these selected news topics with their categories based on the Wikipedia event page.
Spread of News across Social Media: We labeled 3.1 million documents with the identified news and 56% of them (1.7 million) are created by the identified users, which are shown as green crosses and black dots in Fig. 2. This tells Figure 4: Dynamic relations among three different types of meta-populations; all graphs include self-loops (interactions within meta-populations) which are omitted for brevity. us that over 50% of the largest diffusion of 63 news topics is led by the identified users, which reconfirms the validity of our real dataset to reveal underlying diffusion mechanisms.
As shown in Fig. 3, we examined which media types are involved in the top 63 largest news diffusion in terms of user and document volume by media types. SNS users consti-tute the largest proportion of the top 20 news diffusion (in Fig.3(a)), but they produced smaller documents than Blog users (in Fig.3(b)). Overall, Blog users generate more doc-uments than SNS users and unsurprisingly much less than News media. Interestingly, the  X  X gyptian protests X  news led to much more documents, compared to other news topics having similar user volume (in Fig.3(b)). This means that an increasing number of documents does not always bring in new adopters into diffusion, and rather there exist active users generating new documents for some trending topics.
From these fundamental statistics, large diffusion of news is attributed to collective behavior of all media types, not limited to a specific type. In this regard, we will further analyze the underlying dynamics of diffusion across all me-dia types in more detail by conducting experiments on both synthetic and real datasets in the next section.
We evaluate our proposed model using both synthetic and real datasets and compare the results with the Bass model as a baseline. We fit the models by minimizing the sum of squared errors in an iterative way until the error converges. As evaluation metrics, model fitting errors and parameter er-rors are used [16, 21, 23]. After verifying parameter recovery with synthetic datasets, we interpret real-world news diffu-sion with the inferred parameter values on the real dataset.
In Section 4, we generalized the Bass model with a prob-abilistic approach into the model of diffusion over both het-erogeneous and connected social networks. This general-ization enables us to uncover hidden interaction patterns in global diffusion only from the demographics of emergent behaviors such as sales growth of consumer products and increasing adopters of new technologies.

Now, the goal of this section is to recover the hidden diffu-sion mechanisms, i.e. how different types of individuals have interacted with each other, given the cumulative number of adopters at every time step as an input. Particularly, two kinds of measures are evaluated in the experiments; model fitting errors and parameter errors. The former describes how closely our model predicts the cumulative number of adopters, while the latter shows how correctly our model infers the ground truth parameters.

Synthetic Data Generation: In order to reflect real-world scenarios of diffusion in interconnected social media such as News, SNS and Blog, we first consider all possible dynamic relations among three different meta-populations as shown in Fig. 4. The dynamic structures include 13 mo-tifs (1-13) and additional three disconnected graphs (14-16), which represent unique structures among three nodes. Each graph has three self-loops which indicate interactions within meta-populations, but they are all omitted for brevity. The 16th graph reflects the isolated social networks like Fig.1(a), in which there are no interactions between different types of individuals. In each graph, the direction and strength of an edge between two nodes correspond to the direction and strength of influence between two different meta-populations. In our model, they are denoted as c i 0 i  X  [0 , 1] which is the probability that an individual of type i adopts when its neighbor of type i 0 has adopted (in Equation 10).
By varying the strength of dynamic relations in Fig. 4, we generated 48 (= 16  X  3 variants) datasets of cumulative adopters for the diffusion model as { ( A n ( t ) ,A s ( t ) ,A where T =30 and the subscript n , s , and b stand for News, SNS and Blog, respectively. The length of time step T is chosen as one month to reflect our real dataset period.
Evaluation Metrics: Let us denote the model param-eters by  X  i = { n i ,  X  i } , i = n,s,b , where n i ( i = n,s,b ) denotes the population size of each media type i , and the definitions of  X  i are different in each diffusion model. For example,  X  n = { p n ,q n } in the Bass model, while  X  { p n ,c nn ,c sn ,c bn } in the Dynamic Influence Model. To fit each model to datasets, we apply the Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) [14] which minimizes the normalized root mean squared errors (RMSE), where P ( a | i,t,  X  i ) is the estimated adoption probability of each population at time t , given the model parameters  X  i Note that due to the parameter identification problem, where the same results are produced with different settings of pa-rameters, we fix the power law coefficient  X  to be 2 . 5, whose value is typically in the range 2 &lt;  X  &lt; 3 [10].

Table 3 shows the averages and standard deviations of model fitting errors (RMSE) of two diffusion models, Bass Model (BM) and Dynamic Influence Model (DM) with the generated datasets. DM outperforms BM with more accept-able standard deviation, but this is not surprising since DM has more degree of freedom due to more parameters than BM. Therefore, we compared the prediction errors between the two models as shown in Table 4. During a one month period of diffusion, we used 60 and 80 percent of prior cu-mulative adoption history in each dataset and estimated the remaining 40 and 20 percent with the learned parameters. As the table shows, still DM outperforms BM by one or-der of magnitude. The estimated parameter errors (Mean and STD in Table 5) are also acceptable when compared to typical values of parameters in BM ( p  X  0 . 03, q  X  0 . 3 and m  X  3000) [22], showing the feasibility of our model to reproduce parameters from the datasets.
In Section 5.1, we described the data collection. From the constructed hyperlink cascades, we selected 63 news topics which has driven adoptions of at least 150 identified users across social media. We grouped the selected news into six categories as shown in Table 2 for discovering meaningful context of diffusion and comparing diffusion patterns be-tween them. With the 63 real datasets, we reveal how real-world news spreads across social media at a macro-level.
There are no ground truth of parameter values in real data, so we fit the models using NLS as in the experiments on the synthetic datasets, and evaluate model fitting errors and prediction errors as shown in Table 6. Overall, due to noise in the real datasets, the performances of model fitting and prediction decreased by at least one order of magnitude, compared with those on the synthetic datasets in Table 3 and Table 4. However, our proposed model still performs better than BM with more acceptable standard deviations in all cases. This result can be interpreted that information diffusion is influenced by different social networks, and thus the proposed model can improve the accuracy of a diffusion model dealing with single social networks.

Concurrent Diffusion across Social Media: We ex-amine different diffusion patterns by context of information. Fig. 5 shows three example cases of model fitting results Figure 5: Example cases of model fitting results with real datasets from  X  X rts &amp; Culture X  and  X  X oli-tics X  Categories (BM:Bass Model, DM:Dynamic In-fluence Model, A :cumulative adopters up to time t ). from the Arts &amp; Culture and Politics categories. As Fig.5(a) and Fig.5(b) demonstrate, topics in the same category do not necessarily exhibit similar diffusion patterns. In Fig. 5(a), the news about the film  X  X lack Swan X  rapidly spreads in News media first, and then it continues to spread to other social media (more rapidly in SNS than Blog). On the other hand, in the case of  X  X ulticulturalism X  issues in Fig.5(b), the growth rate was not rapid from the beginning, but the diffusion begins to grow sharply and simultaneously across all media types after 23 days when UK Prime Minister, D. Cameron, stated the failure of multiculturalism. Similarly, such concurrent behaviors are observed in the diffusion of political movements in Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, and Yemen. As shown in Fig.5(c), the  X  X emen protests X  demonstrates synchronous diffusion patterns after 15 days.

Without direct interactions across social media, such si-multaneous growth unlikely happens. As the figure shows, BM cannot follow these concurrent growth patterns without information of hidden interactions between multiple social networks. Therefore, dynamic influences between heteroge-neous social networks are not negligible for a better under-standing of diffusion processes.
 Dynamic Influence in Social Media by Context of Information: In order to reveal dynamic influence between different media types, we analyzed inferred parameter val-ues with the real datasets. By categorizing news topics, we attempt to distinguish different diffusion patterns in terms of strength and directionality of influence. Fig. 6 shows the distributions of estimated parameter values; c ij shown in the x -axis indicates influence of media type i on other media type j , and the y -axis represents the probability that the influence of type i on j is equal to or greater than c
Fig.6(a) shows overall trends of interactions among three media types by aggregating parameter values of all news contents. In general, News media are influenced by all media types in a balanced way, while SNS and Blog in order exhibit stronger internal interactions within the same media types. Considering the characteristics of News media, it seems to be required to monitor and reflect the trends of other media types narrowing the gaps with them.

As discussed earlier, the Arts &amp; Culture topics demon-strate different diffusion patterns as shown in Fig.6(b) and 6(c). News media are the most influential in diffusion of Arts topics such as Academy Award, film releases, and celebrities. However, regarding the Culture category, Blog media tend to show strong influence on News and SNS media. Contro-versial subjects such as multiculturalism failure and female education in Afghanistan seem to lead to longer discussions representing personal opinions, and thus Blog media can be a more suitable space compared to other micro blogs or un-biased News media.

Like the Arts topics, News media occupied influential po-sitions in Economy topics. Exact statistics or facts about economic status can be well described in News media with F igure 7: Averages and standard deviations of cu-mulative adoption rates for all 63 news contents by media types. reliability. Interestingly, regarding political topics, SNS me-dia exhibit the highest influence on all media types, while the influence of Blog media are insignificant. Political news generally have great social repercussions such as the Middle East X  X  protests, the Tuscon shooting, and Wikileaks. In this respect, the micro-blogging space can be a better medium to distribute urgent issues rapidly, and their prompt prolif-eration affects News media to focus on the issues. In the Science &amp; Technology category, internal buzz in SNS media is predominant in contrast to Blog media.
 In summary, News media are the most influential in the Arts and Economy topics, while SNS and Blog media are in the Politics and Culture topics, respectively. SNS media show strong internal interactions regarding the Science &amp; Technology category unlike Blog media. However, the char-acteristics of topics are more important than the categories as we observed the cases of the Arts &amp; Culture category.
Diffusion Rate of Social Media: Fig. 7 shows the av-erages and standard deviations of cumulative adoption rates for 63 news contents by media types. In general, News me-dia spread information most rapidly, and SNS media follow next. SNS media show almost similar patterns with News, and thus they tend to be very responsive to the diffusion trends of News media. However, the diffusion rate in Blog media grows more slowly compared to the other types.
By conducting experiments on both synthetic and real data sets, we showed a way of interpreting real-world diffu-sion phenomena across different types of meta-populations such as News, SNS, and Blog. As a result, we found that there are dynamics of diffusion in social media in accordance with the context of news which governs the strength and di-rectionality of influence across the three media types.
We proposed a new conceptual design for diffusion across heterogeneous social networks. Accordingly, we incorpo-rated this concept into the simple mass-action Bass model with a probabilistic approach by combining heterogeneity and structural connectivity of social networks at the same time. This generalization enables us to uncover hidden dy-namic influence across meta-populations from cumulative adopters over time.

Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets showed the feasibility of the proposed model. From the experiments, we found that dynamic influence between different social networks is not ignorable, and thus such unobservable influ-ence helps to better describe diffusion within a single social platform. Supportive evidences can be found in diffusion of news regarding political protests and culturalism failure since they tend to drive concurrent and synchronous diffu-sion across different types of social media. Such phenomena unlikely happen without direct interactions between differ-ent social networks. We also found that there are different diffusion patterns by different news categories. News media are the most influential in the Arts and Economy categories, while SNS and Blog media are in the Politics and Culture categories, respectively.

We expect that the proposed model applies to a wider class of diffusion phenomena in diverse areas including the social sciences, marketing, and neuroscience. As future work, possible topic is to predict collective behaviors of heteroge-neous social networks based on their interdependence. [1] ICWSM X 11 Dataset. http://www.icwsm.org/data/ .
