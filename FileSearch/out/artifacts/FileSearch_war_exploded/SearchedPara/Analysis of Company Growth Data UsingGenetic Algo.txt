 Data mining is concerned with the development of tools and techniques to au-tomate the extraction of information from data [1]. In recent years, a multitude of data mining techniques have been developed. For a detailed overview we refer to [2].
 Interaction Detector (AID) technique, originally developed by [8, 13]. AID was developed to solve some of the shortcomings of statistical regression by building a classification tree , of which the leaves represent classes in which the observations are classified by repeated binary splits. Classification tree methods have been used in machine learning (e.g. ID3 and C4.5 [10, 11]).
 The AID technique mimics the steps taken by an experienced data analyst to de-termine the relationship between a set of binary independent (predictor) variables and a continuous dependent variable . Given a set of observations, the variance of the dependent variable is explained by classifying the observations according to a binary classification tree . Such trees classify a set of observations into a finite number of classes, represented by the leafs (or terminal nodes) of the tree. Non-terminal nodes are labeled with a predictor variable, and the edges ema-nating from a given node represent the possible values for this predictor value. Observations are classified by following a path from the root to a leaf, taking the path determined by the value of the predictor variables that correspond to the observation.
 tor variables that have a good explanatory power. A predictor variable splits a (sub)group in two parts, labeled + and  X  respectively. AID works by a recursive exhaustive search of all predictor variables. In a first step, every possible predic-tor variable x is tested to see which one has the strongest predictive power. This is measured by eq. 1.
 where  X  x 1 and  X  x 2 are the averages in subgroups 1 and 2, n 1 and n 2 are the number of subjects in subgroups 1 and 2,  X  x is the population average, n is the total number of subjects in the population, s 2 is the population variance. The population is then split into two classes according to this predictor variable. Both subsets of observations that result are then split again according to the best predictor variable for that subset. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is satisfied.
 some of its deficiencies [3, 4] by combining it with statistical hypothesis testing methods [5]. Notwithstanding this fact, the AID technique only ever reports a single tree. To solve some of the shortcomings of AID, genAID was developed by [14]. This technique uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to develop a diverse population of AID classification trees. It uses a set of specifically constructed tree-based genetic operators, borrowed from genetic programming [6] and the work of [15]. The fitness of a tree in the genAID population is determined by a formula that borrows from one-way ANOVA: where A is the tree, n i is the number of observations in class i , K is the number  X  x is the overall sample mean. Calculating the fitness of a classification tree is a computationally difficult process because each subject in the population has to be classified into one of the resulting classes. lored genetic operators to combine parent trees into new (and hopefully better) offspring trees. GenAID uses two types of operators: macro-operators exchange entire subtrees in and between trees, micro-operators do not operate on subtrees, but on labels only. For a complete description of genAID, we refer to [14]. The analysis uses data obtained both from quantitative financial statement data and from qualitative data from a large-scale survey executed in April 2001. This data set includes about 18% of all incorporated Flemish companies (1997) and proved to be representative for the whole population of Flemish companies in terms of size, economic activities and location.
 which can be seen as a very important measure of firm performance. In this paper, growth is measured by the average growth rate of total assets over the period 1993-1999. The use of growth rate of total assets as a measure for firm growth has already been used in previous research on Belgian companies [7, 9]. An average growth over a number of years is preferred to a growth percentage of a single year because growth percentages may fluctuate strongly from one year to another.

 This is a result of the fact that the data were col-lected from a survey, asking the respondents to an-swer on a scale of varying size (e.g. totally agree  X  agree  X  indifferent  X  disagree  X  strongly disagree).
 AID classifies a set of observations of a continuous dependent variable based on a number of binary in-dependent (predictor) variables. This implies that all independent variables have to be binary encoded.
 Ordinal variables are encoded using the so-called thermometer coding [12]. For a variable x that can take n values, n  X  1 binary variables are created. A binary variable x i issetto1if x&gt;i + 1. E.g. if x can take 5 values, 4 variables are created. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.
 e.g. splits the observations in a low and a high group: those having x&lt; 3and those having x  X  3. 4.2 Results and Discussion In an experiment, genAID is run for 1000 generations with a constant population size equal to 50. genAID creates perfect binary trees of height three. This means that seven (not necessarily different) variables can be used to define splits in order to partition the population. During the process of subsequent generations in the genetic algorithm the best 50 solutions in terms of predictive power are kept in memory. The trees are presented to the user-analyst to choose a tree which suits him best. The user-analyst may use secondary objective criteria to make his choice, or he can use subjective knowledge to prefer one tree above another. For each case, we work out an example.
 sent a main effect. If the same variables appear only in one branch they are considered to represent an interaction effect. The user-analyst might, for exam-ple, be interested in finding as many main effects as possible and not too many interactions, of which some might be spurious and, at least, maybe difficult to interpret. A tree of height three, as we are using in the experiment, can involve at maximum seven variables, while the tree in Fig. 2 involves only five. In this reasoning minimizing the number of different variables in a tree could serve as a secondary objective criterion. exploring structures of trees in order to retrieve those who represent a confir-mation of some theories with a high level of predictive power. Figure 2 shows the tree preferred by such an analyst. This tree provides an interesting interpre-tation of enablers and disablers of the growth process in companies and sheds some new light on possible growth strategies.
 cause it has been found to be an important factor in previous research [7]. It re-flects the general perception of the CEO about the environment being either be-nign or hostile. After this first split in the tree, companies with strong growth can still be found in both branches, but depending on different conditions (variables). more defensive, conservative strategy as opposed to being a prospector, a reactor or an analyst (variable HFDSTRAT). The highest growth is found in companies which have (or need) a rather limited follow-up of the company-policies that are been carried out. In terms of performance they indicate in the survey a lim-ited use of quantitative performance indices (variable OND.IND1). On the other hand, if the environment is hostile, strong growing companies have to watch their financial performance intensively by using various financial ratios (variable FIN.KEN2) and by applying more aggressive strategies. This latter strategy allows for more than half of the sample (340) to realize a higher than average growth figure. The best five growing companies in a hostile environment however operate in a good labour market, where they can find suitable labour forces (vari-able VINDWN). These companies spend less effort in monitoring financial ratios. In this paper, the genAID technique is applied to a set of company growth data to be explained by subjective assessments from the presidents of companies through a large survey. While the genAID technique uses binary splits on variables and produces a binary classification tree, it is shown, through the right encoding technique, how this data mining technique can be used if variables are categorical but not binary.
 benign environment and they can afford to apply a defensive strategy. The best performing companies (7) carry out their policies by following up a limited num-ber of indices in their balanced scorecard. If the environment is hostile, offering less business opportunities, at least the labour market and labour climate should be friendly. If not so, growth can only be realized through a more aggressive strategy and by a good follow-up of financial performances.
