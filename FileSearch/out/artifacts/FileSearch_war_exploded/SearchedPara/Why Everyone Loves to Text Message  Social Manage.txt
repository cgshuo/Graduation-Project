 This poster presents a study of SMS use among young adults and how they manage their social lives by SMS. It focuses on three features: overcoming shyness, facilitating  X  X ppropriate behavior X  and how users exploit the conciseness of messages. In conclusion we discuss the surprising value of this modest medium in people X  X  everyday lives. K.4.3 [ Organizational Impact ]: Computer-Supported Collaborative Work Human Factors Mobile phones, SMS, qualitative studies. In addition to making voice communication mobile, the mobile phone brought to light a new form of communication: SMS (short message service) or text messaging. Some researchers even argue that it is SMS  X  rather than voice calls -that has been the major force in the adoption of mobile phones [5]. Early research on SMS use suggested that SMS X  X  popularity, especially among teenagers, was due to the controlled cost that SMS provides [2], but later research has pointed away from this, emphasizing the efficiency of its asynchronous communication model [5]. Moving beyond asking why SMS has become popular, we here focus on how text messages fits into users X  everyday lives, supports existing and creates new social practices. Instead of wondering why users use  X  X edious X  texting rather than  X  X wift X  phone calls, which previous research has attempted to uncover [2, 7], we approach the medium with the view that mobile phones are now being bought and used as much for SMSing as for voice calls, especially in the Nordic Countries where our study took place. We explore how users manage their mundane activities by way of SMS and gain insight into how this seemingly simple communication medium is powerful enough to add new structures to the users X  lives, however without dominating their daily life. Although most previous research has been part of broader studies into mobile phone use with SMS considered as an alternative to voice communication, several recent studies have looked specifically at the use of  X  X ext-messaging X , such as [2, 7]. Both of these studies emphasize the  X  X eisure and fun X  aspects of the medium amongst their teenage user groups, although [6] emphasizes how (virtually) all age groups use text messages for  X  X icro-coordination X  and organizational practicalities. Another recent exploration of research of SMS as a separate communication medium is found in [3], which focuses solely on SMS communication. However, many of the chapters still focus on comparing texting to voice calls. A common finding from previous research is that text messaging increases  X  X d-hoc X  coordination [1, 5, 6], and to a lesser degree that it is a tool for social up-keeping and control of relationships [4, 6]. In our study, social expectations from others manifest themselves from other parts of their social life and create new social behavior, a finding that has rarely been pointed out before. We find that indirect social regulations such as social relationship principles also affects the use of SMS. The study took place in Denmark, where mobile phones were used by over 85 percent of the population around the time of the study [8]. It was carried out over two weeks; 21 participants filled in a journal each evening describing their received and sent messages from that day. Participants described their messages in terms of their location when messages were sent/received and what the motivation for initiating SMSing had been. After the two weeks we conducted more in-depth interviews with seven of the participants, elaborating on specifics of their SMS habits. Participants Diary study Interviews Number 21 7 Males (females) 9 (12) 3 (4) 
Age range (av. age) 21-36 (25.8) 21-32 (25.7) Generally, our participants used their SMSes for coordination of their social life, with some use of SMSes for work coordination. The more SMSes they wrote per day, the more different relationships were facilitated by SMS. The bar-graph in figure 1 draws out the average number of messages they sent and received each day according to relationship. SMS was, for our participants, valuable because it supported subtlety and spontaneity and thereby fostering new social practices. We found three distinct social facilitations that SMS contributed to: the assistance in overcoming shyness, the facilitation of appropriate social behavior and the control of communication because of SMS X  conciseness. Many of our participants commented that they sent an SMS rather than calling to avoid talking in public. In crowded public spaces a voice call were considered to be intruding on the surrounding people. Five of our interview participants confesse d to be shy about talking on the phone in public and used SMS a s one way of overcoming this. SMS thus offers advantages in how it can support communication without bring attention to an individual. Another aspect of shyness concerned the social rela tionship between sender and recipient  X  in a number of cases participants would not have called as readily as they SMSed them . One male participant, aged 21 explains: SMS enabled this participant to contact a friend wh ere it would have been awkward to call her. SMS supports communi cation without the commitment and immediate reply required in a telephone call. One can send a one line message wi thout having to commit to a spoken conversation. SMS did not jus t help users who were shy, it also allowed users to carefully ma nage their interactions turn by turn. This way, new interactio n became possible through careful consideration from the sen der X  X  part. A key use of SMS was how it supported  X  X ppropriate social behavior X -23 percent of the messages in the diary were characterized as  X  X ocial up-keeping X , messages that had no planning or information aim but merely an aim to ke ep up socially. Ling describes these messages as a form o f social grooming [6]. We take the concept a step further th ough and point to the fact that very few of these messages would h ave been delivered if SMS had not been available. This was u nderlined by our participants as a feature of the effort-less me dium. One example is a male interview participant who sen t a message asking how his friend X  X  exam went. He explained tha t was not something he would have called his friend about, bu t because he knew the friend had just had an important exam, he sent the SMS as part of  X  X roper social behavior X . Other messages included  X  X oodnight X  messages and people wishing friends a g ood holiday. Motivations for using SMS might seem straight forwa rd: participants themselves underlined the simplicity, discreteness and time-shifting aspects of using SMS. However, lookin g closer at our interviews, the conciseness which the medium le ans itself to, is utilized to the maximum in the creation of messa ges. Both the actual phrasing and the situation that the sender k new (or supposed) the receiver found him/herself in was con sidered during message sending. One female participant, for example, describes a message in her diary: This participant sent a message that from her point of view was a question to where the other person was, but in the form of a message about where she herself was. This allowed h er to avoid appearing impatient. This conciseness often made SM S preferred for situations in which it was important messages n eed to get across. While SMS are used for fun and non-essentia l information, such as indicated by other research [2 , 6], they are also incredibly valuable in supporting this subtlet y of communication and respect for social relations. We have described how SMS is used on an everyday ba sis by a group of young adults; how it is used to their soci al advantage and how it assists in facilitating their social identit y. SMS is an integrated part of our participants X  lives, used to manage their social lives by allowing them to for example contro l self-representation and overcome shyness. Its advantages are in the conciseness of the communication (limited size and asynchronicity), which users use to create powerful messages. SMS provides the flexibility young adults require i n their social communications. Where many researchers have highlig hted SMS as a medium weighed by information exchange and mes sages of coordination matter, we have showed how relationshi ps are built, maintained and sometimes directly facilitated by th is seemingly simple communication medium.
