 nology and information systems, provides the structure of the text and explains the aims and target applica-tions of the book. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with importance of information in business and ethics and privacy issues, respectively. In modern societies information is growing in an exponential form meaning that we have to find a form of controlling such data flood. Chapter 4 discusses data management solutions to that problem.
However, the student reading this chapter will have a poor understanding of data management issues due to the fact that the matter is too much condensed, and important topics such as relational databases and data warehousing systems are only briefly resumed.

In the next two chapters, the authors discusses communications, networks, including internet, and e-busi-ness and e-commerce. This last chapter is very well focused and provides the student with a solid background in those issues. Chapter 7 explores the wireless communications impact on information systems.
Chapters 8 X 10 provides a lot of material about the role of information systems in modern organizations, decision support tools and the development or acquiring of new computer applications.

Finally, the last part of the book comprehends two technology guides, the first one about hardware and the second provides a look to software. These two components are the foundation of any information system and the text, although somehow short in those two matters; nevertheless provide to the student the essential basics on those two topics.

There are two very interesting aspects in this text: one is the so called online supplements , which includes the instructor and student companion sites, test bank, on-line quizzes and PowerPoint presentations. The second feature that I particularly liked is the set of cases studies; the cases are organized around a concrete subject and shows how information technology and information systems can be used to help businesses improve and sur-vive. Taking in consideration all these aspects this book is a wonderful teaching resource for an lower level graduate or undergraduate course.

Guide to Library and Information Agency Management, Charles Curran, Lewis Miller. Scarecrow Press (2005). $45, ISBN: 0810851156
Various social, economic, political, and technological factors continue to impact on the ways that organi-zations are staffed, structured, and financed. How to effectively manage in such a world of driving forces and uncertain changes, presents a series of unrelenting challenges for all mangers including those in library and information services.
 The Guide to Library and Information Agency Management co-authored by Charles Curran and Lewis
Miller, two professors of Library and Information Science, is both a field guide and textbook that is aimed at a broad range of library and information mangers, from the inexperienced to the experienced. As outlined by the authors, the emphasis is on the term field since guides of that nature, have four identifiable functions: to define or explain; to identify opportunities; to help avoid errors; and to help plan resources. As such this guide-book by Curran and Miller attempts to direct library and information managers on how to successfully man-age the day to day opportunities and problems that so often materialise without warning.

How then is this particular guide any different from countless other library management guides? The answer is provided in the introduction where the authors list eight distinguishing features that involve a mixture of stated positions and aims. For Curran and Miller the aim is not to re-create advice already on offer from other recognised management texts. The main aim is to fill in, what is perceived to be visible information gaps be-tween the managerial principles and the necessary implementation processes.

Since the guide also aims to trigger discussion, its tone is intentionally casual and sometimes irreverent. Its detailed content is divided into 14 chapters and an index.

The first chapter describes the nature of today X  X  information place and introduces various types of infor-mation places from a managerial perspective. The next chapter on interpersonal communication places special importance on certain elements such as feedback, body language, listening, managing meetings and making presentations. Chapter three discusses some major issues between leadership and management and their inter-twined relationship. It also treats with specific primary management functions like training; coaching; mentor-ing; supervising; and evaluating, as well as another critical managerial function: dealing with interpersonal workplace conflicts.

An overview of organizational thought is provided in chapter five since the authors feel this could be very useful background knowledge for new managers. The next chapter that focuses on human resour-ces and the importance of trained staff, offers several pointers on staff selection, training supervision, and reward. This chapter also touches on some hard issues like employee termination meetings and one X  X  own dismissal. Chapter six tackles the sensitive issue of political behaviour within the organization, a subject that the authors contend is scarce in library literature. As well outlining and discussing the issue, the chap-ter also cites examples of both appropriate and inappropriate political behavior. The chapter also exam-ines the influence of technology (e.g., e-mail) and its potential as a powerful tool for effecting political behaviour.

Budgeting, the subject of chapter seven, reviews some basic principles of the overall process and concludes by proposing some practical budget management tips. Chapter eight presents a series of exercises based on principles and suggestions offered in the previous chapters while chapter nine addresses how to manage suc-cessful working relationships with external bodies.

The following chapter focuses on learning from mistakes. It presents several examples of reported real life managerial mistakes that are cited under key management responsibilities such as planning; organizing; staff; directing; coordinating; reporting; budgeting; representing; and communicating.

In chapter eleven, the authors consider how best to minimise some negative effects of some typical library contradictions or paradoxes involving people, collections; statistics; bureaucracy; and change. In the subse-quent chapter, the authors stress the critical importance of an information policy and summarize some signi-ficant issues requiring such a policy. Knowledge management is dealt with in chapter thirteen. Holding the view that knowledge management plays a key survival role for today X  X  library and information professionals, the authors urge that these professionals stay in touch with their users X  expressed needs to acquire, create and deliver targeted products and services. In the final chapter, contending that most library management guides normally avoid certain topics, the authors examine and discuss some sensitive workplace issues such as sex with a co-worker; cliques; and image.

Overall, the approach of The Guide to Library and Information Agency Management is refreshingly honest and provocative. Embracing all  X  X  X nformation places X  X , the authors must be commended for not restricting their guide to one type of library organization. Moreover, as mentioned in the foreword, the guide does not depend solely on library literature but draws heavily from the literature of administration and management.

The interwoven pieces in each chapter labelled  X  X  X our Turn X  X  add an element of interactivity and also serve as very functional and valuable training or continuing education devices. Unable to cover all managerial issues and concerns, the guide X  X  scope does however include a wide selection of decision making issues in infor-mation places. There is though, one slight drawback to the guide. Its index though satisfactory lacks comprehensiveness.
Still, the candid and realistic look taken at certain managerial as well as sensitive issues along with the many practical alternatives on how to achieve success and avoid mistakes, makes this work a valuable resource tool for all ranges of managers in today X  X  information places.
 The Craft of Research, 2nd edition (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing) (Paperback) by Wayne
C. Booth, Joseph M. Williams, Gregory G. Colomb. Paperback: 336 pages. University of Chicago Press; 2nd edition. ISBN: 0226065685
The Craft of Research is a really good reference book for both novice and experienced researchers. The book skillfully addresses several possible reader demographics. First, it is an instruction manual for getting the novice academic researcher from topic to outline to notes to thesis. Second, for mid-level researchers, the book illustrates the complex, sometimes illogically process that is research. Finally, for the experienced researcher, The Craft of Research is a refreshing revisit on how research should be done and what should be its impact. I liked the book a lot.

The book is packed with information, insight, and knowledge about research, why we do it and how it is done. The examples actually make sense and contribute greatly to understanding the theoretician aspects of the text. The book is very well written, with no grammar errors that I keyed in on. The prose is clear, and the authors insert their own personal experiences in the book, which helps make it a pleasant read. The book is composed of five sections. First, there is a two chapter section on starting a research project.
Second, a four chapter section deals with planning a research project. Third, the five chapter section on fram-ing ones argument is very well done. I found it very helpful in working on my research papers. Fourth, a sec-tion of five chapters addresses the issues of writing. Finally, a one chapter section ends the book with some potpourri on ethics, teaching research, and sources. The book is 324 pages of text, but it is a quick read.
There were certain chapters that captured my interest. Chapter 2 on connecting with the reader was done nicely, with the authors highlighting that a research paper should develop a relationship with the reader. Not rocket science, but something that we researchers often forgot or forego. Chapter 7 addressed the important issue of making good arguments, outlining reasons, evidence, and relevance. Chapter 11 on warrants was a really fascinating adventure in the underlying assumptions that ground most research. A difficult topic for researchers, because we are so ingrained in our fields that we take the assumptions for granted. However, those outside our field do not. Therefore, we must always be ready to articulate the warrants of our research.

The book does have at least two shortcomings. One, it is tailored for those researchers who publish academic articles. There are a significant number of researchers for which publishing is not their primary goal.
Certainly The Craft of Research will be of help to them, but not as much as the  X  X  X raditional X  X  academic researcher. Two, the lack of familiarity by the authors with (or at least coverage of) the technological aids available to modern researchers was almost embarrassing. For example, the discussion of note taking and bib-liography construction with no mention of applications such Endnote is a serious omission. Another example is Chapter 15, Communicating Evidence Visually , which was a fine presentation at the design level. However,
