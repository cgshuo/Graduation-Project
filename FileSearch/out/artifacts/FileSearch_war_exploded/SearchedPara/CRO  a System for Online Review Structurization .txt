 In this paper, we present a system called CRO (Chinese Review Observer) for online product review structurization. By Structurization, we mean iden tifying, extracting and summarizing information from unstructured review text to a structured table. The core tasks include review collection, product feature and user opinion extraction, and polarity analysis of opinions. Existing research in this area is mainly E nglish text oriented. To deal with Chinese effectively, we propose several novel approaches for fulfilling the core tasks. Then we integrated these approaches and implement the whole procedure of review structurization in the system CRO . Running results for reviews of real products show its performance is satisfactory.

Feature extraction; opinion mining, polarity analysis With the development and popularization of Internet, Web has largely changed the way consum ers publish information. They can post reviews about products at e-commerce web site and express their views on almost anything in Internet forums, discussion groups, blogs, etc. Th ese reviews provide valuable information and sufficient resources for online market research. Potential consumers can also have these reviews as an important reference. However, due to the decentralized, massive, unstructured feature of web pages, it is very difficult for a person to collect and summarize reviews manually, which motivates the research of Opinion Mining. Most existing research in this area is English expression oriented, which makes the approaches proposed not very suitable for Chinese. As you may know, about 1.4 billion people in the world speak Chinese. So seeking approaches to analyze Chinese text is important. In this demo, we will present a system, CRO (C hinese R eview O bserver), which integrates several novel approaches we proposed to deal with Chin ese reviews effectively. CRO can automatically collect reviews a bout a user-specified product from the Internet, then analyze and summarize these reviews, and finally output the results to the us er. The results will show various kinds of features of the product on which user expressed their opinions, and different sentiment orientations of the opinions expressed for the corresponding feature. The sentiment orientation of an opinion is either positive (commendatory) or negative (derogatory) in our system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will present the main function modules of the system. In Section 3, we will describe the techniques used in each module further. Finally, we will conclude the paper in Section 4. CRO has four major modules: Data Collection, Feature &amp; Opinion Extraction, Polarity Analysis and Output Visualization, as shown in Figure 1. When user inputs a product name a nd/or its type, Data Collection module will send a query to a search engine like Google, and then extract the main body of each page returned by the search engine, pick the product reviews from them and store them into a database. For each review in the database, we use Feature &amp; Opinion Extraction module to get feature and opinion pairs, and to merge synonym features in the meantime. For the set of feature-opinion pairs, Polarity Analysis module identifies their sentiment orientation by analyz ing their context relationship, clustering them based on the re lationships between them and propagating the polarity of context-independent opinions to context-dependent opinions. Finally, CRO output the results by two main formats. One is a cross-tab format. Review sentences are displayed by feature and by opinion polarity. Detail reviews can also be seen by linking to the website where the reviews are published. The other format is gr aph, which gives the statistic information of feature and opinion. Data Collection can be regarded as a preprocessing procedure of the whole text mining. To search online product reviews, we transfer the user-specified product name and type into one of existing search engines such as Google. For each webpage returned, we extract the main body of each page based on some heuristic rules. Two such rule s are label-based rule [8] and Chinese-based rule. Label-based rule means extracting contents rule means extracting Chinese characters only. In this way, HTML label and hyperlink will be filtered out. We also set a length threshold in order to prune short navigation type texts. The remaining noise will be further pruned by opinion-based feature extraction method which will be described in the following section. Only part of the remaining texts is really review about certain product. Many supervised learni ng methods have been proposed to do genre classification [9-11]. In our system, in order to increase the identification precision, we use some heuristic rules. For example, title of the text contains some keywords like  X  (review, comments) X ,  X   X  X  X  (experience) X ,  X   X  X  X  (feeling) X . Or, the URL has some words like BBS, Forum, Blog in it. Before going to next function m odule, each review is processed by word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging software. We use ICTCLAS3.0 proposed by Chin ese academy of sciences [12] to do these tasks. Existing methods [1-7] for product feature and opinion extraction are mainly English text oriented, which are not suitable for dealing with Chinese text. After studying Chinese expressions of 500 pieces of product reviews, we found one particular opinion expression pattern: 91% of adjectives following an adverb are opinions and 81% opinion words are adjective words following adverbs in sentences. Based on this observation, we develop an opinion-based feature extraction method. Accordingly, we call most traditional feature and opinion extraction methods feature-based opinion extraction method. By the new method, opinion words are extracted based on adverbs first, and then features around opinions are identified and extracted. The reason why we extract opinions based on adverbs first is based on one of our observations. We found that there are usually some adverbs used before opinion words in Chinese language, which are used to describe the strength of opinion expression in review sentences. To verify this observation, we examined a review sentences set containing 500 reviews of five ki nds of products. We found that 91% of adjectives following an adverb are opinions and 81% opinion words are adjective words following adverbs in sentences. Features are pruned by their occurring frequency then. After that, more opinions can be found based on extracted features, and more features based on opinions. Recu rsively, the feature list and opinion list can be expanded mutua lly. Experimental study shows that this method can improve precision and recall of feature and opinion extraction from Chinese reviews. In the meantime, it also provides a method to find implic it features, and can eliminate some non-review sentences from further analysis. Features extracted by the above-mentioned method may be too many for user to browse. Some of these features describe the same thing of a product. But diffe rent consumer uses different words. We call these words synonym features . So how to identify them is a key issue. Based on the characteristics of Chinese, we propose a similarity measurement for any pair of feature f as shown in formula (1). similarity In formula (1), f i and f j are two features. Usually, a product feature consists of several Chinese characters. So, string ( f common characters shared by them, and length ( ) means the number of the common characters. Feature f i and f share the same opinions. So count (opinion ( f i , f number of opinions shared by them. Usually, same features will not occur repeatedly in the same review. So, concurrence ( f represents the number of times they appear in the same reviews. This formula means that more common characters shared by two features, more opinions shared by them, and less times of concurrence they have, the higher similarity they have. Based on this similarity measur ement, given a user-specified threshold  X  , those features which have higher similarity than  X  will be regarded as synonym features . Experiment results show this method is effective. By Feature &amp; Opinion Extraction module, we can get a set of feature-opinion pairs. In Polarity Analysis module, the sentiment orientation of these pairs will be determined. Most of existing polarity analysis methods depend on WordNet[13] and conjunction words to do this, while WordNet is not applicable to Chinese. Though HowNet[14] is sim ilar to WordNet, it cannot be used to determine context-depende nt opinions X  polarity. Therefore, we propose a new method called cluster-based polarity identification method. To clearly describe the algorithm, we divide the reviews into three levels. Review level: the whole review from one reviewer. Co-Sentiment Sentence level: each review will be cut into several pieces by adversative conjunctions such as  X  X ut X , and each piece is a Co-Sentiment Sentence. Sub-Sentence level: each Co-Sentiment Sentence will be cut into several pieces by any punctuation, and each piece is a sub-sentence. Each sub-sentence of a sentence has a unique number, SN , for identification. For two adjacent sub-sentences in one review sentence but in different Co-Sentiment sentences, they are an ti-sentiment sentences to each other. 
As the polarity of a context-dependent opinion is relates to the feature and the count of privative words used in the corresponding sub-sentence, we define an occurrence of a feature-opinion pair in sub-sentence as a triple(feature, opinion, SN) , which will be used as the unit of clustering. How do we measure the similarity of triples ? Firstly, we use following rules to initialize a similarity matrix. For any two triples : 1) If they have the same feature-opinion and both have even or 2) If they have the same feature-opinion, but one has even 4) If their sub-sentences are anti-sentiment sentence to each 5) 0, otherwise. With above rules, we could get the initial similarity values of any pair of triples. Between different reviews, th ey may have common feature-opinion pairs. Through these pair s more relationships between feature-opinion pairs can be dedu ced. The similarity between any two feature-opinion pairs can be recursively calculated by the following formula (2). 
Similarity i j Max Similarity i k Similarity k j Where similarity[i][j] means the similarity of feature-opinion pair i and j. Representing the similar ity of every two feature-opinion pairs in a matrix, the above formula (2) can be done by matrix multiplication. Initially, the matrix only has information about direct relationships between feature-opinion pairs we just mentioned. By matrix multiplication, indirect relationships can be derived. By this way, we get the similarities between every two feature-opinion pairs. Based on this similarity measurement, using clustering algorithm like K-medoids , feature-opinion pairs can be clustered into two clusters. The polarity of each cluster can be determined according to the orientations of context-independent opinion words in one cluster by majority voting method. Then the polarity of each cluster can be propagated to those context-dependent opinions in the same cluster. This cluster-based polarity identification method is different from existing methods. It can solve polarity collision problem and polarity missing problem, which may occur by using existing methods. Polarity collision means an opinion word may get different sentiment orientations according to an identification rule such as identification based on conjunction words. Polarity missing means that some opinion words cannot get their polarities by any kind of rules. Given a user-specified product name and/or its type as shown in Figure 2, CRO output the mining results in two ways. One is a cross-tabular format, which is show n in Figure 3, and the other is a bar chart as shown in Figure 5. column, positive reviews about this feature will be displayed in the middle column, and negative reviews will be shown in the right column. Corresponding opinion words in each review are column, features are separated into two categories: explicit features and implicit features. Implicit features are represented by opinion words. If you want to read the original reviews published on the internet, you can click one of the reviews listed. For example, when you click the last positive review show n in Figure 3, web page shown in Figure 4 will be opened. If you click the button  X  X tatistic chart X  in Figure 3, a bar chart will be displayed in Figure 5. In Figure 5, the horizontal axis shows the features extracted from online reviews, and the vertical axis shows the number of reviews which expressed opinions about the corresponding feature. The red bars represent the number of positive reviews, and the blue bars represent the number of negative reviews. In this demo, we will demonstrate a system called CRO (Chinese Review Observer), which is designed and implemented for Chinese online product review structurization. It can collect reviews about a user-specified product through internet, extract opinions and product features from the reviews, identify implicit and synonym features, and conduct polarity analysis for each feature-opinion pair. The results can be shown in both tabular format and chart format. This system integrates several novel methods we propose to deal with Chinese free text. We implemented the CRO system on a Dell Workstation, and the operating system is Windows XP. It has been tested on online reviews about several kinds of cosmetic products. Running results prove its effectiveness and efficiency. In the demo session of KDD X 08, we will demonstrate the functions of this system.
