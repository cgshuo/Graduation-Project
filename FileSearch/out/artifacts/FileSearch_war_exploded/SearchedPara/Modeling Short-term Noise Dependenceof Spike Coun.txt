 Understanding neural coding is at the heart of theoretical n euroscience. Analyzing spike counts of a population is one way to gain insight into neural coding pro perties. Even when the same stimulus siderable number of studies (see [1] for a review). However, these studies always assumed Gaussian noise. Thus, correlated spike rates were generally modeled by multivariate normal distributions with a specific covariance matrix that describes all pairwise lin ear correlations.

However, several experimental findin gs suggest that noise correlations as well as sensory information processing predominantly take plac e on a shorter time scale, on the order of an appropriate approximation and if the results of studies b ased on Gaussian noise apply to short time intervals and low firing rates. 100 ms time bins. Dark squares represent a high number of occurre nces of corresponding pairs of spike counts. One can see that the spike counts are correlate d since the ratios are high near the diagonal.

Especially for low rates, this can become a major issue, sinc e the probability of negative values whereas spike counts of short time bins can have a bulb-shape d dependence structure (see Fig. 1 b ). (3) The multivariate normal distribution does not allow hig her order correlations of its elements. Instead, only pairwise correlations can be modeled. It was s hown that pairwise interactions are they are insufficient for subsequent cortex areas in vivo [5]. We will show that our data recorded in prefrontal cortex suggest that higher order interactions ( which involve more than two neurons) do play an important role in the prefrontal cortex as well.
 In this paper, we present a method that addresses the above sh ortcomings of the multivariate normal distribution. We apply copulas [6] to form multivariate distributions with a rich set of dep endence previously applied to model the distribution of continuous first-spike-latencies [7]. Here we apply this concept to spike counts. We give an informal introduction to copulas and apply the con cept to a pair of neurons from our data are many families of copulas, each with a different dependen ce structure. Some families have an possible to use completely different dependence structure s which are more appropriate for the data at hand.
 As an example, consider the modeling of spike count dependen cies of two neurons (Fig. 1). Spike counts is higher than at high counts. This is called lower tail dependence .
 The density of a typical population model based on the multiv ariate normal (MVN) distribution investigate noise correlations also uses the continuous di stribution [1]. The mean and covariance matrix of the MVN distribution correspond to the sample mean and the sample covariances of the well to the empirical distribution in Fig. 1 b .
 The modeling of spike count data with the help of a copula is do ne in three steps: (1) A marginal distribution of the individual neurons. (2) The counts are t ransformed to probabilities using the cumulative marginal distributions are coupled with the hel p of a so-called copula function. As an example, consider the Clayton copula family [6]. For two var iables the copula is given by where p r (i.e. p Section 3.2). The function C ( p pling the margins and thereby introduces correlations of se cond and higher order between the spike counts P ( X Suppose that  X  is positive. Since p probabilities. Thus, the copula generates correlations wh ose strengths depend on the magnitude of probability using the difference scheme as described in Sec tion 3.4. Care must be taken whenever copulas are applied to form discrete distributions: while f or continuous distributions typical mea-sures of dependence are determined by the copula function C only, these measures are affected by the shape of the marginal distributions in the discrete case [8]. We will now describe the formal aspects of the multivariate n ormal distribution on the one hand and to spike counts. 3.1 The discretized multivariate normal distribution The MVN distribution is continuous and needs to be discretiz ed (and rectified) before it can be ap-(cdf) of the spike count vector ~ X is then given by where  X  .  X  denotes the floor operation for the discretization,  X  tribution with mean and correlation matrix  X  , and d denotes the dimension of the multivariate distribution and corresponds to the number of neurons that a re modeled. Note that is no longer the mean of ~ X . The mean is shifted to greater values as  X  This deviation grows with the dimension d . According to the central limit theorem , the distribution of spike counts approaches the MVN distribution only for lar ge counts. 3.2 Copula-based models F holds [6]. There are many families of copulas with different dependence shapes and different num-bers of parameters, e.g. the multivariate Clayton copula fa mily with a scalar parameter  X  : Thus, for a given realization ~r , which can represent the counts of two neurons, we can set u F a multivariate distribution with specific margins F In the case of discrete marginal distributions, however, ty pical measures of dependence, such as the linear correlation coefficient or Kendall X  X   X  are effected by the shape of these margins [8]. Note interactions.
 Another copula family is the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (F GM) copula [6]. It is special in that it cdf takes the form subject to the constraints  X  , the correlations that the FGM copula can model are small in t erms of their absolute value. Nev-ertheless, this is not an issue for modeling noise dependenc ies of spike counts of a small number of 3.3 Marginal distributions Copulas allow us to have different marginal distributions. Typically, the Poisson distribution is a the margins take the form where  X  binomial distribution as a generalization of the Poisson di stribution: where  X  is the gamma function. The additional parameter  X  the smaller the value of  X  binomial distribution converges to the Poisson distributi on. 3.4 Inference for copulas and discrete margins Likelihoods of discrete vectors can be computed by applying the inclusion-exclusion principle of Poincar  X  e and Sylvester. For this purpose we define the sets A = { X A i = { X 1  X  r 1 , . . . , X d  X  r d , X i  X  r i  X  1 } given by denote the univariate margins of log likelihoods. Note that we assume independent time bins. Fur-ther, let called inference for margins (IFM) method proceeds in two steps [10]. First, the marginal likelihoods are maximized separately: Then, the full likelihood is maximized given the estimated m argin parameters: The estimator is asymptotically efficient and close to the ma ximum likelihood estimator [10]. 3.5 Estimation of mutual information knowing the neural response ~r provides about the stimulus. It can be written as where S is the stimulus random variable, M function for the stimuli. The likelihood P Thereby, I ( ~ X ; S ) can be estimated by the Monte Carlo method. We now apply our parametric count models to the analysis of sp ike data, which we recorded from the prefrontal cortex of an awake behaving macaque, using a 4  X  4 tetrode array. Experimental setup. Activity was recorded while the monkey performed a visual ma tch-to-presented for approximately 650 ms each. After an initial presentation ( X  X ample X ) a test sti mulus ( X  X est X ) was presented with a delay of 3 seconds and the monkey had to decide by differential button press whether both stimuli were the same or not. Correct resp onses were rewarded. Match and non-match trials were randomly presented with an equal prob ability.
 the principal sulcus. Recordings were performed simultane ously from up to 16 adjacent sites with an array of individually movable fiber micro-tetrodes (manu factured by Thomas Recording). Data were sampled at 32 kHz and bandpass filtered between 0 . 5 kHz and 10 kHz. Recording positions of individual electrodes were chosen to maximize the recorded activity and the signal quality. The recorded data were processed by a PCA based spike sorting method. The method provides automatic cluster cutting which was manually corrected by s ubsequent cluster merging if indicated by quantitative criteria such as the ISI-histograms or ampl itude stability.
 Data set. To select neurons with stimulus specific responses, we calcu lated spike counts from their spike trains. No neuron was accepted in the dependence analy sis that shifted its mean firing rate averaged over the time interval of the sample stimulus prese ntation by less than 6 . 5 Hz compared processing of the stimulus information.
 Spike trains were separated into 80 groups, one for each of the 20 different stimuli and the four Afterwards, the trains were binned into successive 100 ms intervals and converted to six-dimensional between 224 and 1793 count vectors. A representative example of the empirical di stribution of a pair of these counts from the stimulus presentation interva l is presented in Fig. 1 b . were fitted to the data. For each of the 80 groups we selected randomly 50 count vectors (test set) for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the likelihoods. We tr ained the model on the remainder of each group (training set).
 A commonly applied criterion for model selection is maximum entropy [4]. This criterion selects a certain model with minimal complexity subject to given con straints. It thereby performs regular-ization which is supposed to prevent overfitting. Copulas on the other hand typically increase the complexity of the model and thus decrease the entropy. Howev er, our evaluation takes place on a separate test set and hence takes overfitting into account.
 Parameter inference for the discretized MVN distribution ( see Section 3.1) was performed by com-puting the sample mean and sample covariance matrix of the sp ike counts which is the standard maximum likelihood solution for the discretized distribut ion.
 The following copula families were used to construct noise d istributions of the spike counts. The Clayton (see Section 3.2), Gumbel-Hougaard, Frank and Ali-Mikhail-Haq copula families as ex-amples of families with one parameter [6] and the FGM with a va riable number of parameters (see Section 3.2).
 We applied the IFM method for copula inference (see Section 3 .4). The sample mean is the max-imum likelihood estimator for  X  maximum likelihood estimates for  X  on whether the copula parameters were constrained, either t he Nelder-Mead simplex method for Poisson margins, and the best fitting copula-based model wit h negative binomial margins averaged over the 20 different stimuli.

 Results for different distributions. Fig. 2 shows the evaluation of the IFM estimates on the test set. The likelihood for the copula-based models is significa ntly larger than for the discrete MVN model (p = 2 10  X  14 , paired-sample Student X  X  t test over stimuli). Moreover, the likelihood for the negative binomial margins is even larger than that for the Po isson margins (p = 0 . 0003 ). We computed the difference between the likelihood of the mod el with dependence and the corre-sponding model with independence between its counts. Fig. 2 b shows this difference for several copulas and negative binomial margins evaluated on the test set. The model based on the Clayton copula family (p = 0 . 0014 ).

 Copula coding analysis. Fig. 2 c shows the Monte Carlo estimate of the mutual information bas ed on the Clayton-based model with negative binomial margins a nd IFM parameters determined on the training set for each of the intervals. For the test stimulus interval, the estimation was performed twice: for the previously presented sample stimulus and for the test stimulus. The Monte Carlo method was terminated when the standard error was below 5 10  X  4 . The mutual information is higher during the stimulus presentation intervals than dur ing the delay interval. We estimated the information increase due to the dependence structure by computing the mutual in-formation for the Clayton-based model with negative binomi al margins and subtracting the (smaller) mutual information for the corresponding distribution wit h independent elements. Fig. 2 d shows this information estimate  X  I stimulus interval it carries almost twice as much informati on about the test stimulus as about the previously presented sample stimulus.
 Another important measure related to stimulus decoding whi ch is currently under debate is  X  I/I [12]. The measure provides an upper bound on the information loss for stimulus decoding based on for the Clayton-based model. We developed a framework for analyzing the noise dependence of spike counts. Applying this to our data from the macaque prefrontal cortex we found that: (1 ) Gaussian noise is inadequate to model spike count data for short time intervals; (2) negativ e binomial distributed margins describe are present and play a substantial role in terms of model fit an d information content. imentalists. The complexity of taking all higher order inte ractions into account grows exponentially with the number of neurons, known as the curse of dimensional ity. Based on our findings, we con-In summary, one can say that the copula-based approach provi des a convenient way to study spike too demanding for higher numbers of neurons.

Directions for future re-that were obtained on the assumption of Gaussian noise.
