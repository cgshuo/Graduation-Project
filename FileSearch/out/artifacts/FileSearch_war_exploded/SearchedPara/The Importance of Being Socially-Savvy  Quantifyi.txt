 Social media users create virtual connections for various rea-sons: personal and professional. While significant research efforts have been spent on exploring the dynamics of cre-ation of social network connections, little is known about how those connections influence the content generated by social media users. In this work, we quantitatively evalu-ate the influence of social networks on social media content providers. Additionally, we propose several document ex-pansion methods, which leverage the content generated by the social networks of the authors of social media documents and compare their effectiveness. Experimental results on a large sample of Twitter data indicate that retrieval mod-els discriminatively leveraging social network content for document expansion outperform both traditional, socially-unaware retrieval models and retrieval models that indis-criminatively utilize all social connections.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Retrieval models Microblog Retrieval, Social Networks, Document Expansion
Retrieval from large collections of short social media doc-uments (e.g. microblogs) is a very challenging task. Mi-croblog posts are often shorter than queries, which exacer-bates the problems of vocabulary and semantic mismatch between the queries and documents compared to retrieval from traditional document collections. On the other hand, social media provides different types of metadata, which can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of retrieval results. In this work, we explore how social metadata in the form of the content generated by the social networks of the authors of social media documents can be leveraged for document ex-pansion in the context of Twitter, a popular microblogging platform.

Studying the influence of social networks on content gen-eration from qualitative perspective has recently attracted attention of many social media researchers. Most notably, boyd et al. [2] identified different ways, in which the con-tent generated by Twitter users can be transformed through re-tweets. In this work, however, we are focusing on quanti-tative and information retrieval aspects of this problem and experimentally verify two assumptions. The first assump-tion is that the posts generated by social media users (in our case, microbloggers) are to a large extent influenced by the content produced by their social networks or, in the context of Twitter, by the users who the microbloggers follow (i.e. followees). The second assumption is that the documents authored by followees can be effectively used for expansion of the language models (LMs) of microblog posts, ultimately translating into better retrieval results. Introducing addi-tional terms that are semantically related to the LMs of potentially relevant, but short microblog posts, which may not contain some or all of the query terms, can improve their position in the ranked list of retrieval results.
First, we propose to characterize the influence of social networks on social media users (microbloggers) in terms of different similarity measures between all the documents (posts) generated by the microbloggers and their followees. Then we propose and experiment with several microblog post expansion strategies that discriminatively and indis-criminatively utilize textual content from social networks. In particular, we propose two types of discriminative expan-sion strategies: high-level and low-level. Low-level strategies are based on using some finite number of posts from the so-cial network that are most similar to a given post to form its expansion LM. High-level strategies are based on using some finite number of LMs of the followees that are most similar to the LM of the author of a given post. Indiscrim-inative strategies utilize the entire social context for social media document expansion. More specifically, after a brief overview of relevant work in Section 2, we provide answers to the following research questions:  X  To what extent do social networks influence the content produced by microbloggers? (Section 4.2)  X  How to leverage social networks for microblog posts ex-pansion: selectively use LMs of the most similar posts au-thored by the followees (or LMs of the followees themselves) or all posts authored by the followees? (Section 3)  X  What is the optimal number and the best criteria for selecting the LMs of social network posts (followees) for ex-pansion of microblog posts? How to optimally combine the original microblog post LM and expansion LM? (Section 4.3)
I t is generally believed that microblog and traditional in-formation retrieval are fundamentally different [10]. While query [6] and document [9] expansion have both been suc-cessfully employed to address the vocabulary mismatch prob-lem in traditional document collections, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work examining the util-ity of social network content for social media document ex-pansion. Tao et al. [9] demonstrated that semantically rel-evant documents from the same collection selected using a simple similarity metric can be used for traditional docu-ment expansion and that such expansion is particularly ef-fective for shorter documents. In this work, we compliment their study by examining the effectiveness of document ex-pansion at different levels of granularity and by taking into account the inherent social network structure of the collec-tions of microblog posts.

Other types of metadata provided by social media have also previously been shown to improve retrieval. Kotov et al. [5] proposed a method leveraging geographical metadata in combination with topic modeling and Efron et al. [3] proposed a pseudo-feedback method for short document ex-pansion based on temporal metadata. While socially-aware topic modeling has been explored in itself in previous stud-ies (e.g. [8]), in this work, we employ topic modeling as dimensionality reduction technique to more robustly deter-mine semantically similar short documents (followees).
In this work, we follow the language modeling approach to retrieval and use the KL-divergence based ranking func-tion [11], which involves estimating the query LM,  X  Q , for a given keyword-based query Q = { q 1 , q 2 , . . . , q N document LM,  X  D i , for each document D i in the collection C = { D 1 , . . . , D M } . The documents in the collection are scored and ranked according to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (further referred to as KL-DIR ): Rank ( Q, D i )  X  KL( X  Q ||  X  D i ) = X where  X  D i is normally smoothed, for example, using the Dirichlet prior smoothing: where p ML ( w |  X  D i ) and p ( w |C ) are the probabilities of w in the maximum likelihood estimate of document LM and collection LM, respectively, and  X  is the Dirichlet prior.
In a language modeling based retrieval framework, doc-ument expansion is typically performed by first deriving a document expansion LM,  X   X  D i , for each document D i  X  C and then updating the original document LM,  X  D i , through linear interpolation with coefficient  X  :
Our approach is based on deriving  X   X  D i from social meta-data provided by microblogging services. In particular, the followees of the author of D i and the posts that the followees have produced. We propose two conceptually different ap-proaches to deriving  X   X  D i :  X  A microblog post D , authored by a user U can be in-spired by another post D  X  (or a set of posts) authored by some user U  X  in the social network S = { U 1 , . . . , U U . In other words, D can be viewed as a sample from  X  D  X  a language model of D  X  . Following this view, a document expansion LM,  X   X  D i , can be derived by aggregating one or several LMs of the documents authored by the followees of U ;  X  Alternatively, a microblog post D , authored by a user U can be viewed as a sample from  X  U  X  , a language model of some user (or a set of users) U  X   X  S .

Therefore, both approaches to deriving  X   X  D i are based on ranking all documents (users) according to sim ( D, D  X  ), a measure of similarity between D and D  X  or sim ( U, U  X  ), a measure of similarity between U and U  X  . Since microblog posts are very short, content based document similarity mea-sures (e.g. cosine similarity explored in [9]) may not be a good choice for sim ( D, D  X  ). Therefore, we utilize topic modeling and determine document similarity based on sym-metrized Kullback-Leibler divergence, SKL( X  D ||  X  D  X  ), be-tween topical distributions  X  D and  X  D  X  for D and D  X  re-spectively:
SKL( X  D ,  X  D  X  ) = 1 where: is the KL-divergence between topical distributions over T topics for D and D  X  . This approach is further referred to as DTOP .

Since aggregated user documents are larger, there is a broader choice for sim ( U, U  X  ). In addition to utilizing topi-cal distributions for each user document: where D U is a user document obtained by aggregating all microblog posts authored by U . In addition to calculating symmetrized KL divergence for topical distributions of user documents, we can also apply it directly to user LMs  X  U If we only consider W D U and W D D
U and D U  X  , then we can calculate similarity between the users as Jaccard coefficient (i.e., normalized term overlap) between W D U and W D
In summary, in this work we experimented with the fol-lowing conceptually different approaches for deriving  X   X 
ALL : create LMs for all followees of the document author by aggregating all their microblog posts and use LMs of all followees for expansion of the original document;
ALL-RT : create a LM for each re-tweeted followee of the document author by aggregating all her microblog posts and use only the LMs of re-tweeted followees weighted by the number of re-tweets for expansion;
RANK-DIV and RANK-JAC : create and rank LMs for all followees based on two different similarity functions: symmetrized KL divergence ( RANK-DIV ) and Jaccard co-efficient ( RANK-JAC ) and use LMs of the top-ranked fol-lowees for expansion;
RANK-UTOP : run a topic model on a collection of user documents and rank all followees according to the similarity of their topical distribution to the topical distribution of the author of the microblog post being expanded;
RANK-DTOP : run a topic model on a collection of mi-croblog posts and rank all the posts authored by followees according to the similarity of their topical distribution to the topical distribution of the post being expanded.
We used 2011 TREC Microblog track [7] corpus as the base dataset for all experiments in this work. Since the orig-inal TREC corpus does not include any information about the followees of the authors of the tweets, we randomly sam-pled 10,000 users from all the authors in TREC corpus and accessed their Twitter profiles to extract their followees and for each followee we crawled 20 most recent microblog posts. After sampling about 5% of all relevant posts in TREC cor-pus had social context. The extended TREC corpus ( EXT-TREC ) has been post-processed to exclude all user men-tions, URLs and remove #-signs from all hashtags. Since collections of microblog posts have been known for having very large vocabularies, which negatively affect the quality of topics, we created two additional corpora with restricted vocabularies based on the post-processed extended TREC corpus. The first corpus ( TMOD-DOC ) was obtained from EXT-TREC by excluding all non-English terms (terms that are not in the dictionary of the aspell spell-checking program) but retaining all capitalized non-stopwords. This corpus was used to obtain the topical distribution for each microblog post through LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) [1], a popular topic model. The second corpus ( TMOD-USER ) was obtained by aggregating all microblog posts of each user into a single document and used to obtain the topical distribution for each user, also through LDA. Such pre-processing scheme for collections of small documents has been demonstrated [4] to result in topics of better quality, however it was not known whether this would translate into better retrieval results. From both TMOD-USER and TMOD-DOC we excluded all rare terms (that occurred in less than in 20 documents) and all documents that are too short (had less than 5 terms). Various statistics of experi-mental datasets used in this work are presented in Table 1.
In order to estimate the degree of influence of social net-works on social media content generation, for each user in our dataset we first calculated the user LM,  X  U , by aggregat-ing all the documents authored by U and the social LM,  X  S by aggregating all the documents authored by all followees of U . We quantified the degree of influence of social networks using two similarity metrics: KL-divergence and Jaccard co-efficient between the user and social LMs and plotted the distribution of values across the entire set of users in Fig-ure 1. As follows from Figure 1, the degree of simple term Figure 1: Distribution of values for Jaccard coeffi-cient and KL-divergence between the user LM and social LM for all users in the dataset. overlap (without taking into account term probabilities) be-tween the user and social LMs, as measured by Jaccard coef-ficient, is fairly substantial (5%-10%), while KL-divergence is small. This can be interpreted as the fact that the proba-bilities of overlapping terms are similar, which indicates that there exist a set of core terms shared by microbloggers and their followees and that there is a significant degree of social network influence on social media content providers.
In the first model parameter optimization experiment we set  X  to 0.7 and varied the size of the expansion context, measuring P@20 (precision at top 20 retrieved documents averaged over the entire TREC query set) for each con-text size. P@20 is a more natural performance metric for microblog retrieval tasks, since there is generally very few potentially relevant tweets for each query and users don X  X  want to examine long list of retrieval results. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 2. Since our goal was to focus on examining the effect of social metadata on the quality of retrieval results, we filtered all the documents for which we did not have a social network context from the re-trieved results before measuring the retrieval performance, which explains low values for all the methods. The first interesting observation based on Figure 2 is that user LM based document expansion significantly outperforms docu-ment LM based expansion. Secondly, all user based ex-pansion methods follow the same pattern and achieve op-timal performance when top 6 followees are used for ex-pansion. Using only a few most similar users or using too many users degrades the performance. This has an intuitive explanation, since each additional user may cover the miss-Figure 2: P@20 of different similarity-based doc-u ment expansion methods by varying the size of the expansion context (number of LMs of top most similar users for RANK-JAC, RANK-DIV, RANK-UTOP and number of top most similar documents for RANK-DTOP) ing query aspect of a short microblog post, however, the marginal effect of adding more users decreases, and even-tually using too many user LMs may cause topic drift. At the same time, content based method for selecting similar users based on normalized set overlap measured by Jaccard coefficient ( RANK-JAC ) is more effective than both topic model based method ( RANK-UTOP ) and content based method using symmetrized KL divergence ( RANK-DIV ). This can be explained by the fact that the vast majority of terms occur only once [3] per microblog post, therefore exact probabilities of terms in LMs are much less important than in retrieval from traditional document collections.
In the next experiment, we used the optimal expansion context size for each method and varied the value of  X  , the interpolation coefficient between the original and expansion LMs. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 3. As follows from Figure 3, the best performance is again Figure 3: P@20 of different similarity-based docu-m ent expansion methods by varying the interpola-tion coefficient  X  achieved by RANK-JAC . However, when the interpolation coefficient is optimized, the difference between user and doc-ument LM based expansion methods decreases. Note that the performance of all expansion methods when  X  = 1 . 0 corresponds to the baseline performance of KL-DIR . As follows from Figure 3, all social-network based expansion methods significantly improve the performance of standard socially-unaware retrieval model. Table 2: Comparison of the best performance of s ocially-unaware retrieval model (KL-DIR) with in-discriminative (ALL and ALL-RT), discriminative (RANK-JAC, RANK-DIV and RANK-UTOP) user LM based social expansion and discriminative doc-ument LM based social expansion (RANK-DTOP).

As follows from Table 2, leveraging social metadata through document expansion translates into substantial improvement in retrieval quality over standard socially-unaware retrieval models.
This paper quantitatively characterizes the influence of social networks on the content generated by microbloggers and experimentally demonstrates that it is fairly strong. It also presents experimental results indicating that leveraging social context for microblog posts expansion translates into significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and that se-lecting a small number of most similar followees based on simple term overlap-based metric is the most effective strat-egy for social network based expansion of microblog posts.
