 The spoken term detection task arises as a key sub-task in applying NLP applications to spoken con-tent. Tasks like topic identification and named-entity detection require transforming a continu-ous acoustic signal into a stream of discrete to-kens which can then be handled by NLP and other statistical machine learning techniques. Given a small vocabulary of interest (1000-2000 words or multi-word terms) the aim of the term detection task is to enumerate occurrences of the keywords within a target corpus. Spoken term detection con-verts the raw acoustics into time-marked keyword occurrences, which may subsequently be fed (e.g. as a bag-of-terms) to standard NLP algorithms.
Although spoken term detection does not re-quire the use of word-based automatic speech recognition (ASR), it is closely related. If we had perfectly accurate ASR in the language of the corpus, term detection is reduced to an exact string matching task. The word error rate (WER) and term detection performance are clearly corre-lated. Given resource constraints, domain, chan-nel, and vocabulary limitations, particularly for languages other than English, the errorful token stream makes term detection a non-trivial task.
In order to improve detection performance, and restricting ourselves to an existing ASR system or systems at our disposal, we focus on leverag-ing broad document context around detection hy-potheses. ASR systems traditionally use N-gram language models to incorporate prior knowledge of word occurrence patterns into prediction of the next word in the token stream. N-gram mod-els cannot, however, capture complex linguistic or topical phenomena that occur outside the typical 3-5 word scope of the model. Yet, though many language models more sophisticated than N-grams have been proposed, N-grams are empirically hard to beat in terms of WER.

We consider term detection rather than the tran-scription task in considering how to exploit topic context, because in evaluating the retrieval of cer-tain key terms we need not focus on improving the entire word sequence. Confidence scores from an ASR system (which incorporate N-gram prob-abilities) are optimized in order to produce the most likely sequence of words rather than the ac-curacy of individual word detections. Looking at broader document context within a more limited task might allow us to escape the limits of N-gram performance. We will show that by focusing on contextual information in the form of word repe-tition within documents, we obtain consistent im-provement across five languages in the so called Base Phase of the IARPA BABEL program. 1.1 Task Overview We evaluate term detection and word repetition-based re-scoring on the IARPA BABEL training tonese, Pashto, Turkish, Tagalog and Vietnamese (Harper, 2011). The BABEL task is modeled on the 2006 NIST Spoken Term Detection evaluation (NIST, 2006) but focuses on limited resource con-ditions. We focus specifically on the so called no target audio reuse (NTAR) condition to make our method broadly applicable.

In order to arrive at our eventual solution, we take the BABEL Tagalog corpus and analyze word co-occurrence and repetition statistics in detail. Our observation of the variability in co-occurrence statistics between Tagalog training and develop-ment partitions leads us to narrow the scope of document context to same word co-occurrences, i.e. word repetitions .

We then analyze the tendency towards within-document repetition. The strength of this phe-nomenon suggests it may be more viable for im-proving term-detection than, say, topic-sensitive language models. We validate this by develop-ing an interpolation formula to boost putative word repetitions in the search results, and then inves-tigate a method for setting interpolation weights without manually tuning on a development set.
We then demonstrate that the method general-izes well, by applying it to the 2006 English data and the remaining four 2013 BABEL languages. We demonstrate consistent improvements in all languages in both the Full LP (80 hours of ASR training data) and Limited LP (10 hours) settings. We seek a workable definition of broad docu-ment context beyond N-gram models that will im-prove term detection performance on an arbitrary set of queries. Given the rise of unsupervised la-tent topic modeling with Latent Dirchlet Alloca-tion (Blei et al., 2003) and similar latent variable approaches for discovering meaningful word co-occurrence patterns in large text corpora, we ought to be able to leverage these topic contexts instead of merely N-grams. Indeed there is work in the literature that shows that various topic models, la-tent or otherwise, can be useful for improving lan-guage model perplexity and word error rate (Khu-danpur and Wu, 1999; Chen, 2009; Naptali et al., 2012). However, given the preponderance of highly frequent non-content words in the compu-tation of a corpus X  WER, it X  X  not clear that a 1-2% improvement in WER would translate into an im-provement in term detection.

Still, intuition suggests that knowing the topic context of a detected word ought to be useful in predicting whether or not a term does belong in that context. For example, if we determine the context of the detection hypothesis is about computers, containing words like  X  X onitor, X   X  X n-ternet X  and  X  X ouse, X  then we would be more con-fident of a term such as  X  X eyboard X  and less con-fident of a term such as  X  X heese board X . The dif-ficulty in this approach arises from the variabil-ity in word co-occurrence statistics. Using topic information will be helpful if  X  X onitor, X   X  X ey-board X  and  X  X ouse X  consistently predict that  X  X ey-board X  is present. Unfortunately, estimates of co-occurrence from small corpora are not very consis-tent, and often over-or underestimate concurrence probabilities needed for term detection.

We illustrate this variability by looking at how consistent word co-occurrences are between two separate corpora in the same language: i.e., if we observe words that frequently co-occur with a key-word in the training corpus, do they also co-occur with the keywords in a second held-out corpus? Figure 1, based on the BABEL Tagalog corpus, sug-gests this is true only for high frequency keywords. Figure 1: Correlation between the co-occurrence counts in the training and held-out sets for a fixed keyword (term) and all its  X  X ontext X  words.
Each point in Figure 1 represents one of 355 Tagalog keywords used for system development by all BABEL participants. For each keyword k , we count how often it co-occurs in the same con-versation as a vocabulary word w in the ASR training data and the development data, and des-ignate the counts T ( k,w ) and D ( k,w ) respec-tively. The x -coordinate of each point in Figure 1 is the frequency of k in the training data, and the y -coordinate is the correlation coefficient  X  k be-tween T ( k,w ) and D ( k,w ) . A high  X  k implies that words w that co-occur frequently with k in the training data also do so in the search collection.
To further illustrate how Figure 1 was obtained, consider the high-frequency keyword bukas (count = 879 ) and the low-frequency keyword Davao (count = 11 ), and plot T ( k,  X  ) versus D ( k,  X  ) , as done in Figure 2. The correlation coefficients  X  bukas and  X  Davao from the two plots end up as two points in Figure 1.

Figure 1 suggests that ( k,w ) co-occurrences are consistent between the two corpora (  X  k &gt; 0 . 8 ) for keywords occurring 100 or more times. However, if the goal is to help a speech retrieval system de-tect content-rich (and presumably infrequent) key-words, then using word co-occurrence informa-tion (i.e. topic context) does not appear to be too promising, even though intuition suggests that such information ought to be helpful.

In light of this finding, we will restrict the type of context we use for term detection to the co-occurrence of the term itself elsewhere within the document. As it turns out this  X  X urstiness X  of words within documents, as the term is defined by Church and Gale in their work on Poisson mix-tures (1995), provides a more reliable framework for successfully exploiting document context. 2.1 Related Work A number of efforts have been made to augment traditional N-gram models with latent topic infor-mation (Khudanpur and Wu, 1999; Florian and Yarowsky, 1999; Liu and Liu, 2008; Hsu and Glass, 2006; Naptali et al., 2012) including some of the early work on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis by Hofmann (2001). In all of these cases WER gains in the 1-2% range were observed by interpolating latent topic information with N-gram models.

The re-scoring approach we present is closely related to adaptive or cache language models (Je-linek, 1997; Kuhn and De Mori, 1990; Kneser and Steinbiss, 1993). The primary difference between this and previous work on similar language mod-els is the narrower focus here on the term detec-tion task, in which we consider each search term in isolation, rather than all words in the vocabulary. Most recently, Chiu and Rudnicky (2013) looked at word bursts in the IARPA BABEL conversational corpora, and were also able to successfully im-prove performance by leveraging the burstiness of language. One advantage of the approach pro-posed here, relative to their approach, is its sim-plicity and its not requiring an additional tuning set to estimate parameters.

In the information retrieval community, cluster-ing and latent topic models have yielded improve-ments over traditional vector space models. We will discuss in detail in the following section re-lated works by Church and Gale (1995, 1999, and 2000). Work by Wei and Croft (2006) and Chen (2009) take a language model-based approach to information retrieval, and again, interpolate latent topic models with N-grams to improve retrieval performance. However, in many text retrieval tasks, queries are often tens or hundreds of words in length rather than short spoken phrases. In these efforts, the topic model information was helpful in boosting retrieval performance above the baseline vector space or N-gram models.

Clearly topic or context information is relevant to a retrieval type task, but we need a stable, con-sistent framework in which to apply it. To this point we have assumed an implicit property of low-frequency words which Church and Gale state concisely in their 1999 study of inverse doc-ument frequency : The typical use of Document Frequency ( DF ) in information retrieval or text categorization is to emphasize words that occur in only a few docu-ments and are thus more  X  X ich in content X . Close examination of DF statistics by Church and Gale in their work on Poisson Mixtures (1995) resulted in an analysis of the burstiness of content words.
In this section we look at DF and burstiness statistics applying some of the analyses of Church and Gale (1999) to the BABEL Tagalog corpus. We observe, in 648 Tagalog conversations, simi-lar phenomena as observed by Church and Gale on 89,000 AP English newswire articles. We proceed in this fashion to make a case for why burstiness ought to help in the term detection task.

For the Tagalog conversations, as with En-glish newswire, we observe that the document fre-quency, DF w , of a word w is not a linear function of word frequency f w in the log domain, as would be expected under a naive Poisson generative as-sumption. The implication of deviations from a Poisson model is that words tend to be concen-trated in a small number of documents rather than occurring uniformly across the corpus. This is the burstiness we leverage to improve term detection.
The first illustration of word burstiness can be seen by plotting observed inverse document fre-quency, IDF w , versus f w in the log domain (Fig-ure 3a). We use the same definition of IDF w as Church and Gale (1999): where N is the number of documents (i.e. conver-sations) in the corpus.

There is good linear correlation (  X  = 0 . 73 ) be-tween log f w and IDF w . Yet, visually, the rela-tionship in Figure 3a is clearly not linear. In con-trast, the AP English data exhibits a correlation of  X  = 0 . 93 (Church and Gale, 1999). Thus the devi-ation in the Tagalog corpus is more pronounced, i.e. words are less uniformly distributed across documents.

A second perspective on word burstiness that follows from Church and Gale (1999) is that a Poisson assumption should lead us to predict: Figure 4: Difference between observed and pre-dicted IDF w for Tagalog unigrams.
 For the AP newswire, Church and Gale found the largest deviation between the predicted d IDF w and observed IDF w to occur in the middle of the fre-quency range. We see a somewhat different pic-ture for Tagalog speech in Figure 3b. Observed IDF w values again deviate significantly from their predictions (2), but all along the frequency range.
There is a noticeable quantization effect occur-ring in the high IDF range, given that our N is at least a factor of 100 smaller than the number of AP articles they studied: 648 vs. 89,000. Figure 4 also shows the difference between and observed IDF w and Poisson estimate d IDF w and further il-lustrates the high variance in IDF w for low fre-quency words.

Two questions arise: what is happening with in-frequent words, and why does this matter for term detection? To look at the data from a different perspective, we consider the random variable k , which is the number of times a word occurs in a particular document. In Figure 5 we plot the fol-lowing ratio, which Church and Gale (1995) define as burstiness : as a function of f w . We denote this as E [ k ] and can interpret burstiness as the expected word count given we see w at least once.
 In Figure 5 we see two classes of words emerge. A similar phenomenon is observed concerning adaptive language models (Church, 2000). In general, we can think of using word repetitions to re-score term detection as applying a limited form of adaptive or cache language model (Je-linek, 1997). Likewise, Katz attempts to capture these two classes in his G model of word frequen-cies (1996).

For the first class, burstiness increases slowly but steadily as w occurs more frequently. Let us label these Class A words. Since our corpus size is fixed, we might expect this to occur, as more word occurrences must be pigeon-holed into the same number of documents
Looking close to the y -axis in Figure 5, we ob-serve a second class of exclusively low frequency words whose burstiness ranges from highly con-centrated to singletons. We will refer to these as Class B words. If we take the Class A concentra-tion trend as typical, we can argue that most Class B words exhibit a larger than average concentra-tion. In either case we see evidence that both high and low frequency words tend towards repeating within a document . 3.1 Unigram Probabilities In applying the burstiness quantity to term detec-tion, we recall that the task requires us to locate a particular instance of a term, not estimate a count, hence the utility of N-gram language models pre-dicting words in sequence.

We encounter the burstiness property of words again by looking at unigram occurrence probabili-ties. We compare the unconditional unigram prob-ability (the probability that a given word token is w ) with the conditional unigram probability, given the term has occurred once in the document . We compute the conditional probability for w using frequency information. Figure 6: Difference between conditional and un-conditional unigram probabilities for Tagalog
Figure 6 shows the difference between con-ditional and unconditional unigram probabilities. Without any other information, Zipf X  X  law sug-gests that most word types do not occur in a partic-ular document. However, conditioning on one oc-currence, most word types are more likely to occur again, due to their burstiness.

Finally we measure the adaptation of a word, which is defined by Church and Gale (1995) as: When we plot adaptation versus f w (Figure 7) we see that all high-frequency and a significant number of low-frequency terms have adaptation greater that 50%. To be precise, 26% of all to-kens and 25% of low-frequency ( f w &lt; 100 ) have at least 50% adaptation. Given that adaptation val-ues are roughly an order of magnitude higher than the conditional unigram probabilities, in the next two sections we describe how we use adaptation to boost term detection scores. We summarize our re-scoring of repeated words with the observation: given a correct detection, the likelihood of additional terms in the same doc-uments should increase . When we observe a term detection score with high confidence, we boost the other lower-scoring terms in the same document to reflect this increased likelihood of repeated terms. Figure 7: Tagalog word adaptation probability
For each term t and document d we propose in-terpolating the ASR confidence score for a partic-ular detection t d with the top scoring hit in d which we X  X l call b t d .

We will we develop a principled approach to se-lecting  X  using the adaptation property of the cor-pus. However to verify that this approach is worth pursuing, we sweep a range of small  X  values, on the assumption that we still do want to mostly rely on the ASR confidence score for term detection. For the Tagalog data, we let  X  range from 0 (the baseline) to 0.4 and re-score each term detection score according to (6). Table 1 shows the results of this parameter sweep and yields us 1 to 2% ab-solute performance gains in a number of term de-tection metrics. Table 1: Term detection scores for swept  X  values on Tagalog development data
The primary metric for the BABEL program, Ac-tual Term Weighted Value (ATWV) is defined by NIST using a cost function of the false alarm prob-ability P (FA) and P (Miss) , averaged over a set of queries (NIST, 2006). The manner in which the components of ATWV are defined: implies that cost of a miss is inversely proportional to the frequency of the term in the corpus, but the cost of a false alarm is fixed. For this reason, we report both ATWV and the P (Miss) component. A decrease in P (Miss) reflects the fact that we are able to boost correct detections of the repeated terms. 4.1 Interpolation Weights We would prefer to use prior knowledge rather than naive tuning to select an interpolation weight  X  . Our analysis of word burstiness suggests that adaptation , is a reasonable candidate. Adaptation also has the desirable property that we can esti-mate it for each word in the training vocabulary directly from training data and not post-hoc on a per-query basis. We consider several different es-timates and we can show that the favorable result extends across languages.

Intuition suggests that we prefer per-term in-terpolation weights related to the term X  X  adapta-tion . But despite the strong evidence of the adapta-tion phenomenon in both high and low-frequency words (Figure 7), we have less confidence in the adaptation strength of any particular word.
As with word co-occurrence, we consider if es-timates of P adapt ( w ) from training data are con-sistent when estimated on development data. Fig-ure 8 shows the difference between P adapt ( w ) measured on the two corpora (for words occurring in both).

We see that the adaptation estimates are only consistent between corpora for high-frequency words. Using this P adapt ( w ) estimate directly ac-tually hurts ATWV performance by 4.7% absolute on the 355 term development query set (Table 2).
Given the variability in estimating P adapt ( w ) , an alternative approach would be take c P w as an upper bound on  X  , reached as the DF w increases (cf. Equation 9). We would discount the adapta-tion factor when DF w is low and we are unsure of Figure 8: Difference in adaptation estimates be-tween Tagalog training and development corpora Interpolation Weight ATWV P (Miss) None 0.470 0.430
P adapt ( w ) 0.423 0.474 b  X  = 0.20 0.483 0.416 Table 2: Term detection performance using vari-ous interpolation weight strategies on Tagalog dev data the effect.
This approach shows a significant improvement (0.7% absolute) over the baseline. However, con-sidering this estimate in light of the two classes of words in Figure 5, there are clearly words in Class B with high burstiness that will be ignored by try-ing to compensate for the high adaptation variabil-ity in the low-frequency range.

Alternatively, we take a weighted average of  X  w  X  X  estimated on training transcripts to obtain a single b  X  per language (cf. Equation 10). Using this average as a single interpolation weight for all terms gives near the best performance as we observed in our parameter sweep. Table 2 contrasts the results for using the three different interpolation heuristics on the Tagalog develop-ment queries. Using the mean b  X  instead of indi-vidual  X  w  X  X  provides an additional 0.5% absolute improvement, suggesting that we find additional gains boosting low-frequency words. Now that we have tested word repetition-based re-scoring on a small Tagalog development set we want to know if our approach, and particu-larly our b  X  estimate is sufficiently robust to apply broadly. At our disposal, we have the five BABEL languages  X  Tagalog, Cantonese, Pashto, Turk-ish and Vietnamese  X  as well as the development data from the NIST 2006 English evaluation. The BABEL evaluation query sets contain roughly 2000 terms each and the 2006 English query set con-tains roughly 1000 terms.

The procedure we follow for each language condition is as follows. We first estimate adap-tation probabilities from the ASR training tran-scripts. From these we take the weighted aver-age as described previously to obtain a single in-terpolation weight b  X  for each training condition. We train ASR acoustic and language models from the training corpus using the Kaldi speech recog-nition toolkit (Povey et al., 2011) following the default BABEL training and search recipe which is described in detail by Chen et al. (2013). Lastly, we re-score the search output by interpolating the top term detection score for a document with sub-sequent hits according to Equation 6 using the b  X  estimated for this training condition.

For each of the BABEL languages we consider both the FullLP (80 hours) and LimitedLP (10 hours) training conditions. For the English sys-tem, we also train a Kaldi system on the 240 hours of the Switchboard conversational English cor-pus. Although Kaldi can produce multiple types of acoustic models, for simplicity we report results using discriminatively trained Subspace Gaussian Mixture Model (SGMM) acoustic output densi-ties, but we do find that similar results can be ob-tained with other acoustic model configurations.
Using our final algorithm, we are able to boost repeated term detections and improve results in all languages and training conditions . Table 3 lists complete results and the associated estimates for b  X  . For the BABEL languages, we observe improve-ments in ATWV from 0.7% to 1.3% absolute and reductions in the miss rate of 0.8% to 1.9%. The only test for which P (Miss) did not improve was the Vietnamese Limited LP setting, although over-all ATWV did improve, reflecting a lower P (FA) .
In all conditions we also obtain  X  estimates which correspond to our expectations for partic-ular languages. For example, adaptation is low-est for the agglutinative Turkish language where longer word tokens should be less likely to re-peat. For Vietnamese, with shorter, syllable length word tokens, we observe the lowest adaptation es-timates.

Lastly, the reductions in P (Miss) suggests that we are improving the term detection metric, which is sensitive to threshold changes, by doing what we set out to do, which is to boost lower confi-dence repeated words and correctly asserting them as true hits. Moreover, we are able to accomplish this in a wide variety of languages. Leveraging the burstiness of content words, we have developed a simple technique to consis-tently boost term detection performance across languages. Using word repetitions, we effectively use a broad document context outside of the typi-cal 2-5 N-gram window. Furthermore, we see im-provements across a broad spectrum of languages: languages with syllable-based word tokens (Viet-namese, Cantonese), complex morphology (Turk-ish), and dialect variability (Pashto).

Secondly, our results are not only effective but also intuitive, given that the interpolation weight parameter matches our expectations for the bursti-ness of the word tokens in the language on which it is estimated.

We have focused primarily on re-scoring results for the term detection task. Given the effective-ness of the technique across multiple languages, we hope to extend our effort to exploit our hu-man tendency towards redundancy to decoding or other aspects of the spoken document processing pipeline.
