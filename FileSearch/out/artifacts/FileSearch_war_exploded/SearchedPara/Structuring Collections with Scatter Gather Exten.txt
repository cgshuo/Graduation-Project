 A major component of sense-making is organizing X  X rouping, labeling, and summarizing X  X he data at hand in order to form a useful mental model, a necessary precursor to identifying missing information and to reasoning about the data. Previous work has shown the Scatter/Gather model to be useful in exploratory activities that occur when users encounter unknown document collections. However, the topic structure communicated by Scatter/Gather is closely tied to the behavior of the underlying clustering algorithm; this struct ure may not reflect the mental model most applicable to the information need. In this paper we describe the initial design of a mixed-initiative information structuring tool that leverage s aspects of the well-studied Scatter/Gather model but permits the user to impose their own desired structure when necessary. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Clustering. H.5.2 [ User Interfaces ]: Prototyping. Scatter/Gather, sense-making, cl ustering, text summarization. Given the enormous growth rate of information available from the Web and other sources, many authors have argued that the primary challenge for users changes from finding information to making sense of it. A typical information access tool provides a simple interaction model where the user enters a query and the engine returns results composed of title, snippet, and URL. This is sufficient for retrieving specific information, but not for building a holistic understanding of the info rmation space. In the case of clustering search engines or Scatter/Gather [1], the system automatically imposes additional hierarchical structure on the search results. In Scatter/Gather , in particular, this additional structure has been shown to ai d the development of a user X  X  mental model [3]. However, this structure is directly determined by the underlying clustering algorithm. We believe that this is not sufficient. In this paper, we consider the ge neral scenario of a user given a collection of documents which must be collectively understood and navigated. Specific examples of such scenarios are: a finance analyst identifying emerging trends from a collection of news stories or an intelligence analyst assessing the consistency of newly discovered information with an existing corpus of accepted knowledge. To effectively work with large document collections, the user must create a mental model of th e contents of and relationships between elements of the collection. This organization is often task specific and it may encode significant domain knowledge. For this reason we believe it is helpful to explore tools that help users impose their own structure on the document collection while still enabling well-understood e xploration techniques. Our approach is an extension to the Scatter/Gather model in which the hierarchy of clusters is explicitly exposed to the user. We provide a small set of tools which allow the user to directly change the generated hierarchy. We further allow the user to add notes to the hierarchy and to incorporate automatically generated summaries into the hierarchy. The main contributions of our research are: Scatter/Gather is a technique for browsing a collection of documents. Static and runtime cl ustering produces a small set of document clusters. The user na vigates through the collection selecting (gathering) a subset of the clusters, based on keyword summaries. Then the user can regenerate the cluster set (scattering) using only those documen ts in the selected clusters [1]. In this way the user can quickly narrow in on an interesting set of documents. Later research found that the Scatter/Gather model is effective in helping users build a  X  X ore coherent conceptual image of a text collection X  [2], [3]. This fact makes Scatter/Gather a good basis for an information structuring tool. The main extension is the additi on of exposed hierarchical tree view that is incrementally bu ilt as the user explores the collections. The root node re presents the entire document collection. Other nodes represent other clusters of documents produced by the Scatter/Gather operations. When a single node is selected, the user can scatter the node X  X  documents. This operation inserts new child nodes into the tree containing the new document clus ters. (Scattering can also be done when multiple nodes are selected, in which case the selected nodes are automatically combined before the scattering occurs.) In the spirit of a faceted search interface, we provide multiple dimensions along which the user can scatter documents (e.g. standard term frequency clusteri ng, grouping by publication date, by author, etc.). This permits th e user to quickly explore common organizations of the documents. By selecting multiple nodes in the tree and combining them, a user can gather the correspondi ng clusters. Unlike standard Scatter/Gather, the user is free to combine clusters from anywhere in the tree. This permits the user to correct incorrect automatic clustering where conceptual groups are split across multiple clusters. Additionally, the user can use di rect manipulation to move nodes around in the tree. This implicitly moves the corresponding documents around as well, updating th e ancestors of the affected nodes. Finally, we provide a mech anism to discard nodes. This permits the user to hide any document clusters that may be irrelevant to the current inform ation task. Discarded nodes can be retrieved at any time. The use of the tree view introduces the challenge of selecting appropriate labels for the nodes in the tree. Space in the tree does not permit the use of extended keyword collections (as in [5]). We adapt a two-pronged approach. First, in a separate view we present extended summaries of just the currently selected nodes. Our tool generates a cluster summary at runtime that summarizes some simple heuristics (based on the scattering dimension) to generate a potentially meaningful label and then permit users to edit the labels as they desire. Th is allows users to capture the be used as an in-context note-taking system. We encourage this use by allowing the user to copy portions of document summaries or titles into tree labels. Depending on the user X  X  task, the resulting tree can end up looking like a hierarchical textual outline of the document collection. Figur e 1 shows a schematic view of our proposed model. 
Figure 1: User interaction with Scatter/Gather with extensions We have implemented a prototype, called Napoli, of the organizational interaction extensi ons presented in this paper. Figure 2 shows Napoli used on a collection of papers from the SIGGRAPH conference. The left pane shows the current hierarchical organization of the document collection as captured by the tree view. The right pane shows the cluster summary for the currently selected node. The user initially scattered the entire collection by publication date. Automatic labels containing the year ranges (since they were scattered by date) were generated for the clusters. The user then scattered the 1985-1989 cluster by topic and then scattered the first child cluster by topic again (k-means clustering of tf-idf vectors). The user has added a note  X  X apers about rendering X  to the first child cluster capturing st ructure important to the user X  X  information task. The cluster summary contains the most common words and number of documents. The bulleted list is an automatic summary of the most important sentences in the cluster computed using a TextRank-based implementation [4]. We have described a number of interaction extensions to Scatter/Gather that provide func tionality to capture user-centric, meaningful structure in docum ent collections. Future work includes a user evaluation of the system. [1] D. Cutting, D. Karger, J. Pedersen, and J. Tukey. [2] P. Pirolli. Information Foraging Theory . Oxford University [3] P. Pirolli, P.
