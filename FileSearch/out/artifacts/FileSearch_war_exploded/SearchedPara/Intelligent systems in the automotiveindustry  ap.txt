 REGULAR PAPER Oleg Gusikhin  X  Nestor Rychtyckyj  X  Dimitar Filev Abstract There is a common misconception that the automobile industry is slow to adapt new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and soft computing. The reality is that many new technologies are deployed and brought to the pub-lic through the vehicles that they drive. This paper provides an overview and a sampling of many of the ways that the automotive industry has utilized AI, soft computing and other intelligent system technologies in such diverse domains like manufacturing, diagnostics, on-board systems, warranty analysis and design. Keywords Intelligent systems  X  Artificial intelligence  X  Soft computing  X  Automotive industry 1 Introduction Since the introduction of the moving assembly line, the automotive industry has become one of the leading innovators and a powerful incubator of new advanced technologies. The exponentially increasing sophistication of modern vehicles, seemingly, is accompanied by a growing complexity within product development, manufacturing, supply chain and logistics processes that are the lifeblood of the modern automotive company. Therefore, it is not surprising that numerous ap-plications of methodologies generally known as  X  X ntelligent X ,  X  X oft computing X ,  X  X omputational intelligence X ,  X  X rtificial intelligence X  (AI) can be found in prac-tically all spheres of the automotive industry, starting from vehicle on-board sys-tems through the value chain and including vehicle design, manufacturing and after-market service. The focus of most of those technologies is to find more ef-fective alternatives to conventional engineering methods.
 methodologies (fuzzy logic, neural networks, evolutionary computation, machine learning, knowledge representation, probabilistic/possibilistic reasoning) as build-ing blocks of intelligent automotive engineering systems. We use terms, such as computational intelligence, soft computing and AI as synonyms of tools that pro-vide intelligence to all aspects of automotive industry although they are defined slightly differently in the technical literature [14]. Our goal is to highlight sev-eral relatively mature areas of applications that belong to the class of intelligent systems and have a significant impact on the automotive industry. These exam-ples are drawn from published sources with credible evidence of either successful vehicle design, production implementation or research sponsored by automotive enterprises. This paper does not provide an exhaustive bibliographical review, but limits the number of references that are necessary to illustrate relevant examples of applications of intelligent technologies.
 motor vehicle itself, including fuzzy logic and neural net-based controls, speech technologies, active warning systems and on-board diagnostics (OBDs). Sect. 3 reviews automotive design focusing on knowledge-based engineering (KBE) methodology. Next, in Sect. 4, we review intelligent systems applications in man-ufacturing and supply chain management, where we concentrate on vehicle as-sembly planning, assembly sequencing and certain aspects of production control. Sect. 5 reviews AI in service diagnostics and highlights data mining in warranty analysis. Sect. 6 addresses the emerging area of corporate knowledge manage-ment. Finally, Sect. 7 summarizes the paper and presents our conclusions. 2 In-vehicle intelligence 2.1 Fuzzy-neural vehicle systems control Fuzzy logic and neural networks were the first AI techniques implemented in the vehicle as viable alternatives to the classical control methods where the latter ones are infeasible, inefficient or non-economical. The first commercial applications of fuzzy logic for speed control and continuous variable transmission date back to 1988 [66, 67].
 behavior. The control is described through the collection of rules in the form of  X  X f-Then X  statements. In a fuzzy logic controller, the crisp sensor inputs are converted to the fuzzy variables that are processed against a rule base. A combined result is then converted back into a specific crisp control value.
 mentations of fuzzy logic in control of different vehicle systems [4, 71], including anti-lock breaking systems (ABS), engine control, automatic transmissions, anti-skid steering and climate control. In recent years, the proliferation of hybrid vehi-cles (e.g. vehicles that combine combustion engines and electric motors) identified the potential for a new application area of fuzzy logic control of vehicle subsys-tems [58]. An example of an application of fuzzy logic in a hybrid electric vehicle control system is the gain scheduling algorithm proposed by Syed et al. [65] and implemented in a power-split hybrid electric vehicle. It automatically adjusts the proportional and integral parameters of a conventional proportional integral (PI) controller in the feedback battery power component of the engine power control algorithm. The role of the fuzzy logic component is to appropriately adjust the PI parameters to different operating conditions. The result is smooth control of the engine speed and battery power with reduced overshooting and rise time that is comparable to that of a conventional PI controller. These examples demon-strate that incorporating expert rules expressed through fuzzy logic can signifi-cantly simplify complex control algorithms while accomplishing satisfactory per-formance.
 fuzzy logic simplifies complex control models.
 as driver behavior in efficient and effective way. Exploring this feature of fuzzy logic, Takahashi [67] presents the concept of vehicle control, where the driver plays the role of the human sensor for the control system. In this case, the driving environment and driver intentions might be predicted by analyzing the operations executed by the driver, such as pedal inputs and steering maneuvers. Furthermore, this control system makes it possible to infer driver classification (for example  X  X efensive X ,  X  X edium X ,  X  X porty X  [72]) and adjust the characteristics of the engine, transmission and other vehicle subsystems to the driver preferences. 2.2 Neural-network-based virtual sensors The efficient control of the vehicle subsystems depends on the accuracy and com-pleteness of the feedback data from the system parameters. However, in many cases, the direct measurement of such system parameters is impractical due to complexity, noise and the dynamic nature of the system. Marko et al. [40] demon-strate that neural networks could be trained to emulate  X  X irtual X , ideal sensors that enhance diagnostic information from existing sensors on production vehicles. on-line diagnostics of engine combustion failures, featured in the Aston Martin DB9 engine control system [1]. The importance of this application is enhanced by the fact that engine misfires are the leading contributors to excessive vehicle emis-sions and fuel consumption. In general, the identification of engine misfires can be done through the observation of crankshaft dynamics. However, the complexity of these dynamics can easily lead to the misinterpretation. Neural networks, trained by artificially inducing a combustion failure, can classify a misfire with a high level of accuracy based on indirect data, such as engine speed, load, crankshaft acceleration and phase of the cylinder firing sequence [39, 53]. 2.3 Speech recognition Speech technology is another important type of an in-vehicle AI application. The importance of in-vehicle speech interface is related to requirements for non-destructive hands-free control of the ever-increasing number of auxiliary functions offered in vehicles, such as telephones, entertainment, navigation and climate con-trol systems.
 troduced by Mercedes-Benz in their S-class car line in 1996 [30]. The speech recognizer used in Liguatronic is speaker-independent and based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) combined with the dynamic time warping (DTW) word recognizer for a user definable telephone directory [7].
 and control paradigm. Such systems typically require the memorization of all commands from the manual that are often expressed in an artificial (non-natural) language. To address these limitations, the automotive companies and suppliers have been actively pursuing the research and development of the next generation of in-vehicle intelligent dialog systems [42, 51]. For example, Pieraccini et al. [51] present a multimodal conversational interface prototype that was implemented on the Ford Model U Concept Vehicle shown at the 2003 North American Inter-national Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. This system adopts a conversational speech interface coupled with a touch screen display. The speech recognition en-gine makes use of dynamic semantic models that keep track of the current and past contextual information and dynamically modify the language model in order to increase accuracy of the speech recognizer. 2.4 Intelligent vehicle technologies (next-generation vehicle safety systems) Bishop [3] defines  X  X ntelligent vehicle systems X  as systems that sense the driving environment and provide information or vehicle control to assist the driver in op-timum vehicle operation. They are seen as the next generation of vehicle safety systems.
 any combination of sources such as on-board video cameras, radars, lidars (light detecting and ranging, the laser-based analog to radar), digital maps navigated by global positioning systems, communication from other vehicles or highway sys-tems. The on-board system analyzes this data in real time and provides a warning to the driver or even takes over control of the vehicle. Examples of intelligent ve-hicle technologies existing today include lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and the parallel parking assistant. Bishop [3] provides an extensive cov-erage of the intelligent vehicle applications pursued by the automotive industry, academia and government agencies around the world.
 facilitate or even enable the implementation of many of the intelligent vehicle functionalities. For instance, analysis of images from video cameras calls for the application of traditional AI techniques such as machine vision and pattern recog-nition. The fusion of the disjointed data from multiple sources would benefit from the application of neural networks in a similar fashion to the virtual sensor de-velopment in engine control. The implementation of real-time response to the changes in driving conditions may take advantage of fuzzy logic. For example, Tascillo et al. [68] describe the prototype of a system that identifies and classifies objects in close proximity using a neural net approach to select the best course of action to avoid an accident. Nigro and Rombaut [49] propose a rule-based sys-tem incorporating linguistic variables to recognize driving situations. Engstrom and Victor [17] developed real-time recognition of the driving context (e.g. city, highway, suburban driving) using neural networks. Miyahara et al. [43] present vision-based target-tracking system based on the range window algorithm and pattern matching. Those are only few examples from the vast on-going research using AI technologies to address intelligent vehicle functionality. 2.5 On-board fault diagnostic and prognostics Another emerging application area of AI deals with OBDs. Each new vehicle cur-rently contains a large number of processors that control the operation of various automotive subsystems, such as the engine, lights, climate control, airbags, ABS, traction control, transmissions, stereo systems and others. Each of these processors runs software that deals with faults and abnormal behavior in various subsystems. This software has three main goals:  X  detection of faults,  X  ability to operate when a fault has been triggered,  X  provide diagnostic information that can be used to locate the fault by a service dard component of every modern vehicle. The fault-detection algorithms (pre-dominantly model based) provide input to the OBD that are used to evaluate the health of individual vehicle subsystems for on-board monitoring and to support off-line diagnostic maintenance systems. There has also been considerable work done to apply model-based systems and qualitative reasoning to support OBDs [64]. This work included the development of the Vehicle Model-Based Diagnosis (VMBD) project in Europe. This project involved running model-based diagnosis on demonstrator vehicles to analyze problems with emissions in a diesel engine. In this case, a model was developed that represented the turbocontrol subsystem in the engine and a solution to a problem was found using a consistency-based diagnosis system. The model of the system is not a single model of the entire system, but instead, contains a library of component models. Qualitative models capture the interdependencies and physical effects of the airflow and pressure that is present in the engine. The concept of model-based diagnostics is further re-fined and developed by combining it with a dynamic Bayesian network [59 X 61]. The network model is applied to approximate the fault dynamics, interpret the residuals generated by multiple models and to determine fault probabilities. This approach was piloted for on-board diagnosis of the ABS and Electronic Stability Program (ESP) of a Daimler Chrysler pilot vehicle and demonstrated an effective way to of detect faults from multiple model residuals.
 goal of this technology is to continually evaluate the diagnostics information over time in order to identify any significant potential degradation of vehicle subsys-tems that may cause a fault, to predict the remaining useful life of the particular component or subsystem and to alert the driver before such a fault occurs. Most of the work in this direction is inspired by the recent progress in Condition-Based and Predictive Maintenance [16]. Presently available on selected military vehicles [23], prognostic capability is envisioned as becoming a substantial extension of OBD systems and vehicle telematics [5]. als between the measured and model predicted features, estimate the measure of degradation and to evaluate the remaining useful life of the component. Model-based prognostics use the advantages of first principle models and provide an ac-curate representation of the particular vehicle subsystems [36, 37]. Alternatively, learning-based prognostic techniques are data-driven and employ black box type models, e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, fuzzy models, statistical models and other approximators to identify the trend of change in the features, and can consequently predict fault scenarios [23, 24].
 able Integrated Diagnostic/Prognostic System (IDPS) architecture for real-time diagnostics and prognostics. Diagnostics is performed by a fuzzy inference engine and static wavelet neural network that is capable of recognizing the occurrence of a fault mode and identifying the fault. Prognostic functionality includes a virtual sensor to provide fault dimensions and a prediction module employing a dynamic wavelet neural network for fault trending and estimation of remaining useful life of bearings. As the complexity of vehicles increases, the need for intelligent diag-nostics tools, such as the ones described above becomes more critical. 3Design The use of AI for automotive design is focused around the idea of KBE. KBE can be defined as follows: The use of computer tools to enhance the design process by bringing engineering design, manufacturing engineering, consumer-related and other appropriate knowledge up front in the geometry-creation process, and wher-ever possible, to automate the process. In others words, KBE brings knowledge about the design process right to the engineer who is actually creating the design. Cooling System Design Assistant (Coolsys) [22]. The goal of this application was to develop and support an integrated set of tools that would assist an engineer in the cooling system domain. A KBE application, such as Coolsys, needs to address two types of problems: 1. It needs to model the reasoning process used by the design engineer and eval-2. It also needs to integrate symbolic and numeric computation.
 sign solutions based on its heuristic knowledge coupled with the input parameters provided by the design engineer. These design proposals were generated using a combination of general domain knowledge and of knowledge specific to the prob-lem case at hand.
 transmissions. The TRANS-FORM system [47] utilized a constraint-based ex-pert system approach to design automobile transmissions. This goal of TRANS-FORM was to discover new transmission design based on the existing constraints that were put into the knowledge base. This system discovered several new viable transmission designs as well as many already well-known existing commercial designs.
 lem of trying to estimate the cost of automotive part manufacturing plans. Ford Motor Company X  X  Computer Aided Parts Estimating System (CAPE) [15] was built by Ford of Europe to manage the cost component related to the purchase of automotive parts from outside suppliers. This process was handled manually by personnel who were experienced in the manufacturing process and could estimate the cost of procuring a certain part. CAPE was developed as a centralized knowl-edge base that captured the knowledge localized within certain parts of the com-pany, reduced the time required to develop a detailed estimate, provided a more accurate model of manufacturing costs and facilitated simultaneous engineering between purchase cost estimators and designers. Different process models such as metal pressing, injection molding, surface finishing, drilling, milling and oth-ers were integrated into the CAPE knowledge base. CAPE was an example of an integrated knowledge-based system that was developed to handle a wide range of different problem domains. However, the maintenance and support of such diverse knowledge bases in a dynamic problem environment such as auto-manufacturing frequently leads to long-term maintenance issues.
 These types of systems were developed to handle specific design applica-tions and they combined knowledge-based processing with the Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems that the design en-gineers are familiar with. A KBE system assists the engineer in the design process by utilizing both knowledge-based and heuristic reasoning with geometric and 3D imagery. There are a host of such KBE applications currently being used at au-tomotive companies and they include the following domains: decklid and hood closures, joint structures, ground clearance, pedal packaging, occupant accommo-dation and engine roll.
 based reasoning for Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) [64]. The goal of FMEA is to identify the failure behavior of a system in the presence of any possible component failure. The complexity of modern vehicles makes it very dif-ficult for engineers to examine the interaction caused by different possible com-binations of input on the expected behavior of the entire system. Model-based simulation provides a tool for detecting potential design problem in these com-plex types of cases. One such example is the AUTOSTEVE system used by Ford. AUTOSTEVE is a commercially available FMEA generator that is used for analysis of electrical systems within an automobile. The reasoning performed by AUTOSTEVE works at three different levels of simulation: functional level, component level reasoning and qualitative reasoning. The qualitative reasoning is done at the lowest level and it simulates the current flow in a network of re-sistors. The component level reasoning allows engineers to specify the models that are mapped to electrical and electronic components. At the functional or top level, AUTOSTEVE allows engineers to develop a description of the over-all behavior of the entire system and determine if it is achieving its desired functions.
 velop several applications to improve and speed up the design on new vehicle con-figurations. These include a tool to assist in the design of hood stiffening panels and a headlight design tool. Jaguar has also designed a KBE mannequin that ex-ists in the automotive envelope to determine how it interacts with its environment. This mannequin can perform instructions that allow it to use the radio, heater and air-conditioning controls as well as work with the clutch, brake and accelerator pedals to verify that the cabin is ergonomically sound.
 is Kansei Engineering. Kansei (Japanese word for  X  X eeling X ) engineering is a tech-nique to translate consumer X  X  feelings and perceptions about the product into con-crete design elements. Automotive companies (particularly Japanese) are among the pioneers in the application of this design technique. According to Nagamachi [48], automakers that have already introduced Kansei engineering/ergonomics in-clude Mazda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Ford and Hyundai. The imple-mentation of Kansei Engineering is based on various techniques of physiological assessment, AI and computer graphics such as virtual reality [34]. Specifically, Matsubara et al. [41] present a Kansei Engineering approach as an AI system. As an example of Kansei Engineering system application in automotive industry, Nagamachi [48] cites the Nissan design of a new steering wheel for a passenger car. 4 Vehicle production There is a considerable use of AI within the modern automobile assembly plant. In this section, we will discuss several applications that deal with using AI for pro-cess planning and labor management, ergonomics analysis and vehicle scheduling. 4.1 Vehicle assembly process planning The critical need to reduce cost and improve efficiency within vehicle assembly at Ford has led to the development of an AI-based system as the core for the entire manufacturing process planning system. The Global Study Process Allocations System (GSPAS) was developed to incorporate a standardized methodology and a set of common business practices for the design and assembly of vehicles to be used by all assembly plants throughout the world. GSPAS contains an embed-ded AI component, known as the Direct Labor Management System (DLMS) [54] that was developed to improve assembly process planning at Ford by achieving standardization within the vehicle process build description and provide a tool for applying standardized labor times required for vehicle assembly. In addition, DLMS provides the framework for allocating the required work among operators at the plants and builds a foundation for automated translation of the process de-scriptions into other languages.
 sheet X , is the primary vehicle for conveying assembly information from the ini-tial process planning activity to the assembly plant. A process sheet contains the detailed instructions needed to build a portion of a vehicle. A single vehicle may require thousands of process sheets to describe its assembly. A process engineer creates the process sheet utilizing a restricted subset of English known as Stan-dard Language. Standard Language allows an engineer to write clear and concise assembly instructions that are machine-readable. These instructions are read and interpreted by the AI system to create a set of work operations and associated times that are needed by the operators at the assembly plants. Other factors, such as knowledge about ergonomics, are used by the AI system to prevent processes that will cause ergonomic problems for the operators on the assembly line from being written. In addition, a machine translation system has been developed to translate vehicle assembly instructions from English to Spanish, German, Dutch and Portuguese to support assembly plants in Europe, South America and Mexico [55].

Final assembly comprises several hundred workstations, where operators assemble all subsystems and components received from 1st tier suppliers to a painted vehicle body. A typical assembly plant produces around 1200 vehicles per day (or one vehicle per minute) that vary in body style (e.g. sedan, wagon), color and options set (e.g. engine type, moon roof, spoilers, etc.). The sequence in which vehicles are produced is extremely important to the efficiency of the entire sup-ply chain. In general, the desirable sequence is one where all options are equally distributed throughout the sequence, while vehicles of the same color are grouped together. The spacing requirement allows for the smoothing out of the delivery of different components to the line and balancing the workload of operators. Color blocking minimizes the number of paint purges. It is virtually infeasible to satisfy all the requirements simultaneously. The traditional approach relies on finding a sequence that minimizes the number of violations of different constraints that are weighted in accordance with their level of importance for production. For exam-ple, spacing options would be significantly more important than is color blocking, since having two subsequent high-content options vehicles might critically over-load the operator and prevent them for completing their work on the next vehicle. The complexity of the problem as well as the qualitative nature of the decision criteria makes it a desirable target for the application of AI-based search tech-niques. Constraint programming and genetic algorithms are the techniques that have been cited in the literature on this subject. ILOG solver is the most common commercial tool that uses constraints programming. ILOG-based sequencing has been successfully implemented at DaimlerChrysler (case publicized at Ilog Web site) and Nissan [62].
 sequencing. In this application, the authors developed an evolutionary approach, utilizing genetic algorithms that provide a robust search mechanism that allow for the efficient management of complex sequencing constraints. This system has been successfully deployed at a Ford North American assembly plant. 4.3 Production control There are many examples of successful implementation of AI technologies in production control in automotive assembly as well as component manufacturing. These applications are very diverse in terms of the problems being addressed and the AI methods used. We present some examples covering different aspects of production control.
 oped the Paint Quality Control System [20] that utilizes fuzzy reasoning. This algorithm, known as the RBIC Intelligent Control System, combines the con-ventional indirect adaptive control approach with a Rule Base of Initial Condi-tions (RBIC). The RBIC works as an associative memory that periodically re-initializes the adaptive control algorithm by using a fuzzy reasoning inference mechanism. This algorithm is applied to Ford X  X  Integrated Paint Quality Control System (IPQCS); IPQCS is an automatic spray boot control system that integrates paint applicators and paint film thickness measurements into a closed loop feed-back control system that reduces the variability of the paint processes and pro-duces high-quality paint finishes. The RBIC Intelligent Control Algorithm au-tomatically calculates the adjustments required to keep the paint film thickness uniform and as per the specifications.
 Phosphate Bath Control System that was developed at Ford Motor Company as a means for automating the anticorrosion phosphate-coating process in automotive assembly plants. From a control perspective, the phosphate bath (a 70,000 gal-lon tank where car bodies are immersed and a chemical reaction between an acid replenisher and the vehicle body occurs) is a nonlinear process with significant time delays. A fuzzy logic controller was successfully applied to control the metal concentration in the bath and to maintain phosphate coating with a constant thick-ness. The embedded fuzzy controller algorithm blends 15 control rules with a PI controller resulting in a robust control system that is capable of maintaining the desired concentration of the chemicals in the bath under a wide range of variable operating conditions and disturbances.
 floor data implemented for Ford X  X  bumper production. This system integrates data from multiple disjoint plant-floor automation devices and compensates for possi-ble inaccuracy and incompleteness through a model of the material flow combined with a rule-based system. The system has been implemented using an object-oriented real-time expert system product called G2 from Gensym Corporation. with the objective of minimizing the changeover cost was addressed in one of the earliest applications of biologically inspired AI algorithms. Morley and coworkers [45, 46] associated an agent with each paint booth that implemented four market-based-type rules: (i) Try to take another truck the same color as the current color. (ii) Take particularly important jobs. (iii) Take any job to stay busy. (iv) Do not take another job if paint booth is down or queue is full. assignment leading to minimal cost for painting and time delay. The system was implemented in a General Motors plant and demonstrated a 10% reduction of paint usage. Campos et al. [9] demonstrated through simulation that a similar result can be obtained if an ant colony optimization algorithm based on division of labor-type rules is assigned to the booth agents.
 manufacturing control at DaimlerChrysler. This paper described an auction-based approach to manufacturing control. In this application, the various components of the manufacturing process, such as workpieces, machines and switches, are all represented by agents. The workpiece agents auction off their current tasks while the machine agents bid to accept tasks. This type of architecture is very flexible as the dynamic nature of the manufacturing task allows the agents to deal with unpredictable events such as resource disturbances and product changes. ning of car engine manufacturing is described by Pechoucek et al. [50]. Mass pro-duction planning in a high-volume Skoda AUTO powertrain plant is decomposed into a long-term schedule and adaptive short-term scheduling tasks. The long-term schedule is derived through LP optimization. Short-term daily schedules are ne-gotiated between intelligent agents associated with production lines, store buffers and conveyors. Each agent implements a simple greedy optimization algorithm. 4.4 Supply chain management In the last decade, the attention of automotive industry has been drawn to the efficiency and agility of supply chain management as one of the main elements that defines the competitive position of the company. In particular, extensive research has been done in the area of the application of AI technologies to the different aspects of automotive supply chain design and management.
 techniques in the context of the automotive supply chain to solve the problem of cooperative supply chain configuration. The use of virtual enterprise systems [75] using agent coordination also has many applications in the automotive supply chain-management process.
 tunities for reducing supplier X  X  material requirement variation [10]. The goal of this application is to analyze historical data in order to improve the stability of supplier releases. The  X  X tability of supplier releases X  can be defined as the ability of material requirements for a specified date to remain constant over time as that date approaches. This improves the operational efficiency of the assembly process and reduces manufacturing costs. The utilization of data-mining techniques [74] allows Ford to identify opportunities for increasing material release stability. 5 After-sales service and warranty management 5.1 Service diagnostic and prognostics One of the earliest applications of AI in the automobile industry was in the area of machine diagnostics. The process by which a trained technician diagnoses a problem with a machine requires a set of special skills and knowledge that are difficult and time-consuming to learn. Consequently, people with this type of spe-cialized knowledge become very valuable and difficult to replace. The need for specialized AI-driven tools, equipment and decision support systems was ampli-fied by the increased level of complexity and sophistication of modern vehicle systems and subsystems. The effort to retain and utilize  X  X xpert X  knowledge led to the creation of the first  X  X nowledge-based X  or  X  X xpert X  diagnostics systems. One such system was developed by General Motors and was called  X  X harley X  [2]. This system utilized a knowledge base that was used to diagnose a wide range of problems that occurred in manufacturing and assembly equipment. These in-clude issues like unbalance, misalignment, structural weakness and host of other problems that require immediate attention in order to keep the machinery running. Diagnostic System X  (SBDS) [35]. SBDS is a tool that was developed to assist the service technicians at the dealership to diagnose problems or potential problems with customer vehicles. This core of the SBDS system was a knowledge base that could be maintained easily and modified to incorporate information about new ve-hicles and diagnostic procedures. The reasoning about the knowledge contained in the system was done using a Diagnostic Interpreter. Essentially, the SBDS system was an electronic manual implementing an FMEA mapping between measured ve-hicle parameters (symptoms) and related root causes allowing for an easy search through multiple fault scenarios.
 from FMEA documents was proposed in [19]. The diagnostics model is composed of a set of multiple input, multiple output IF ... THEN rules relating fuzzy root cause predicates mapped to a set of deterministic symptom consequents. Model structure and initial parameter values are estimated by back-propagation from the FMEA mappings. For a given set of symptoms, the potential root cause is calcu-lated by pseudoinverting the diagnostic rule base.
 able to interact with their users; the system must have the capability to accept data input from the vehicle as well as to ask the users to take certain measurements and answer questions about the problem that is being diagnosed. These systems must also be reliable enough to work in repair facility. Traditional expert systems utilized a heuristic approach where empirical domain knowledge was elicited from subject matter experts, and then, codified into a knowledge base. Expert-based automotive diagnostic systems have some fundamental limitations associated with the nature of the expert system approach for it is generally infeasible to identify in advance all possible fault scenarios and to develop/maintain/update rules relating the symptom/root cause relationships that are associated with them.
 dealerships throughout Italy [57]. The Integrated Diagnostic Expert Assistant Sys-tem (IDEAS) helps diagnose faults in a variety of different automotive electronic subsystems. The IDEAS system differs from the earlier diagnostic systems in its approach to solving a particular problem. The approach used in the IDEAS sys-tem is a model-based approach that relies on task-independent description of the device that is being diagnosed. The system developers built a model that describes the system X  X  structure, components, function and relationships between these com-ponents. This knowledge is then used by a reasoning engine that can perform diag-nosis on problems with the machine without having to build an explicit diagnostic rule base. 5.2 Warranty management After vehicles have been sold to customers, warranty management is among the top priorities for automakers. First of all, warranty costs constitute a sizeable por-tion of automotive operating expense. According to AMR Research, the auto in-dustry in the United States pays out US$8.5 billion per year in warranty claims. These costs amount to about US$700 on an average vehicle and amount to about 1 X 3% of automotive profits, according to IBM. Warranty history provides criti-cal insights for the improvement of vehicle design and manufacturing. The abil-ity to identify the problems early enough might allow avoiding costly and brand damaging recalls. In November 2000, the U.S. Congress passed the Transporta-tion Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act that mandates communication of the data about potential defects in motor vehicles, tires and motor vehicle equipment to National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-tration. The TREAD act puts additional pressure on automakers for an accurate and timely collection and analysis of relevant warranty information.
 electronics and software, the introduction of new technologies, such as hybrid drive-trains, more stringent safety requirements and the competitive pressure to bring new vehicles to market quicker than ever before. This situation can easily lead to increases in warranty costs unless the auto manufacturers can get a better handle on this problem. In order to reduce warranty costs, it is imperative to reduce amount of data that needs to be properly analyzed to identify warranty claims and to prevent future warranty issues and recalls.
 the following:  X  vast amount of data to be analyzed,  X  free-form text statements,  X  complex product structure. data mining technologies [33, 69]. One such example of using data mining for warranty analysis has been implemented at DaimlerChrysler. In [31], an applica-tion called Warranty Planning System (WAPS) is described. The goal of WAPS and warranty planning, in general, is threefold:  X  the need to calculate planning figures for cash reserves required for warranty  X  the complexity faced by a global manufacturer that has assembly plants build- X  different warranty requirements for different markets.
 from more than 50 tables and included over 110 million rows that needed to be analyzed. The system utilized a measure known as  X  X arranty and goodwill X  rate as base for predictive modeling; this rate contains the costs that are caused by the repair and replacement of faulty vehicle parts. The predictive model itself utilizes regression analysis as the technique warranty cost analysis.
 known as REVI-MINER, developed at DaimlerChrysler to help the detection and analysis of deviations in warranty and goodwill cost statements. The system is based on the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, combined with machine learning and statistics approaches for data cleaning in the preprocessing phase. A critical component of any data-mining sys-tem is the process to validate that the data is correct. Problems with data qual-ity will make it impossible to extract any valid knowledge from the system. The REVI-MINER system utilizes several approaches, based on statistical analysis, to analyze and clean the source data. This system supports the DaimlerChrysler auditing department in detecting and preventing fraudulent activities within the repair shop organization.
 as the Quality Insight Solution, to address the auto warranty cost-reduction prob-lem. In conjunction with International Truck and Engine Corp, IBM has used data mining, along with a common language and dictionary of terms and synonyms, to search for and identify similar problems in existing warranty claim databases and other external data sources, such as Internet chat rooms and Web blogs. The Inter-net has created new methods for instant feedback and this information, if properly analyzed, can provide auto manufacturers with important knowledge about their products.
 how to deal with unstructured data that is composed of free-form text and includes abbreviations, acronyms, misspellings, slang terms and other automotive-specific terminology. Any system that can successfully process such data requires some type of knowledge base or ontology that allows the system to properly understand both the context and meaning of the data. Future progress in this area will depend on the development of more complete automotive ontologies and more accurate algorithms for text processing and understanding.
 6 Corporate knowledge management The automotive industry needs to deal with a large amount of corporate knowl-edge that is spread among many sources such as databases, documents, Web sites, spreadsheets and other areas. This knowledge is only useful if it can be used by the appropriate people at the appropriate time. The problem of dealing with all of this knowledge is a serious challenge and we would like to discuss how this issue is being addressed currently.
 and retrieving  X  X est practices X . The term  X  X est practice X  is actually a misnomer, as there is usually no single best way to handle a particular issue, but in this case, the automotive companies need to leverage specific knowledge about some pro-cess that provides a competitive advantage in the business environment. One such example of this is  X  X lectronic Best Practice Replication X  (eBPR) that is being uti-lized at Ford Motor Company [73]. This application is based on using a company-wide Web-based approach for the collection, communication and management of these  X  X est practices X . An individual that has an idea that will add value to a par-ticular business practice will approach an assigned person who is responsible for interacting with the eBPR system. This person will enter the practice in a draft form and the practice will be reviewed by a screening committee from the appro-priate business community. If the practice is approved, the system will be updated and emails will be sent out to the members of that community describing the new process. They can then review the process and decide if it should be replicated. Valid business reasons must be given for processes that are not accepted. The re-ports generated by the system are reviewed periodically by management to ensure that the process is being utilized correctly. Other users may search the library of best practices either by keyword or by searching a particular user community. This system has proven to be extremely successful at Ford and has been licensed to other companies.
 on the role that ontologies play in the entire automotive supply chain cycle. An  X  X ntology X  can be described as a knowledge-representation model that contains specific knowledge about a problem domain. This knowledge can, in turn, be uti-lized by different applications that deal with different aspects of the automotive business. Knowledge bases and ontologies have been used within particular prob-lem domains, such as manufacturing or KBE X  X he challenge now is to integrate and use these ontologies across the entire automotive supply chain. This will re-quire the development of ontology standards and tools as well as significant work in developing automotive terminology dictionaries.
 been described in a case study based on the product life cycle management (PLM) process at Audi [38]. The goal of this case study was to analyze how an ontology-based approach could assist in the integration of data from different sources including databases, spreadsheets, email programs, documents that are spread out in different organizations across the company. This work included the develop-ment of an automotive ontology through the importation of data descriptions from various data sources as well the mapping between the concepts and relations from these sources. The last step includes the modeling of the business rules, logic and inference strategies that describe how the processes functions in each problem domain.
 oped at General Motors [44] to support quality improvements for assembly line processes. The Variation-Reduction Advisor (VRA) was originally developed as a case-based reasoning (CBR) system for management of  X  X est practices X  and did not achieve the expected results. This was mostly due to social reasons with the application usage. In this case, the developers added an ontology-guided search facility into the VRA system that allowed the users to access relevant information about manufacturing best practices in a timely and efficient manner. The VRA system is in use at about 12 GM assembly centers.
 Web-based repository system that has been designed to support distributed auto-motive component development [6]. The goal of this application is to develop a model of the component development process that can then be accessed across a distributed network and efficiently retrieved for subsequent re-use. This Virtual Repository (VR) will be used as the main knowledge source for component de-velopment data for various applications that require this information. It will also provide a framework for using data mining to search for patterns of knowledge within the repository and to provide a method for storing and retrieving  X  X est practices X .
 free-form text. One method for dealing with unstructured text has been devel-oped at Ford Motor Company within the manufacturing engineering environment [12]. This application contains a mechanism for the automated creation of rules that are then utilized to deliver targeted unstructured information. In this case, the  X  X ule X  contains a chunk of meaningful unstructured knowledge that describes spe-cific manufacturing requirements related to a relevant manufacturing process. This system reduces the amount of time that must be spent by manufacturing engineers who are responsible for maintaining manufacturing engineering knowledge. 7Conclusion In this paper, we have reviewed the major areas of intelligent system applications that are utilized in the automotive industry. There are two different approaches that can be taken when reviewing technological advances in a given industry. We could use a technology-centric approach, where the focus is on the technology or we could utilize a function-centric approach, where the focus is on different ap-proaches that can be used to address a given problem. Here, we made an attempt to combine both the technology and functional approaches to describe the myr-iad of intelligent systems in various areas of the automotive industry. Our goal in writing this paper is twofold. First, we would like to identify opportunities where advanced technologies successfully adopted in one business domain can then be leveraged across other functional areas in the company. For example, building successful applications within manufacturing can lead to the development of sim-ilar systems in product development. Further, we also hope that this discussion will demonstrate how diverse intelligent technologies can be integrated into the business model to improve both customer satisfaction and the quality of the end product.
 more prevalent than we could discuss in one paper. There are numerous examples of other applications and uses of this technology that have not been publicized yet due to novelty and/or competitive pressures. For example, advancements in the wireless communication infrastructure have opened a new avenue of poten-tial automotive applications of intelligent computing, such as location-based [25] information services, or more generally, context-aware information services. We also left out other automotive domains that use AI such as marketing, finance and strategic planning [18]. In many cases, these applications are based on proprietary information that cannot be publicized.
 that has many important uses in the automotive industry. The use of intelligent systems and technologies results in applications that provide many benefits to both the auto manufacturers and their customers. We believe that this trend will increase into the future as we move toward the age of intelligent vehicles and transportation systems.
