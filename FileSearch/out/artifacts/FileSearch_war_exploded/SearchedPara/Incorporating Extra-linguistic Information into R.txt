 The task of identifying reference relations includ-ing anaphora and coreferences within texts has re-ceived a great deal of attention in natural language processing, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Recently, research trends for refer-ence resolution have drastically shifted from hand-crafted rule-based approaches to corpus-based ap-proaches, due predominately to the growing suc-cess of machine learning algorithms (such as Sup-port Vector Machines (Vapnik, 1998)); many re-searchers have examined ways for introducing var-ious linguistic clues into machine learning-based models (Ge et al., 1998; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Iida et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2008; Poon and Domingos, 2008, etc.). Research has contin-ued to progress each year, focusing on tackling the problem as it is represented in the annotated data sets provided by the Message Understanding Con-ference (MUC) 1 and the Automatic Content Ex-traction (ACE) 2 . In these data sets, coreference re-lations are defined as a limited version of a typ-ical coreference; this generally means that only the relations where expressions refer to the same named entities are addressed, because it makes the coreference resolution task more information extraction-oriented. In other words, the corefer-ence task as defined by MUC and ACE is geared toward only identifying coreference relations an-chored to an entity within the text.

In contrast to this research trend, investigations of referential behaviour in real world situations have continued to gain interest in the language generation community (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Foster et al., 2008; Spanger et al., 2009), aiming at applica-tions such as human-robot interaction. Spanger et al. (2009) for example constructed a corpus by recording dialogues of two participants collabo-ratively solving the Tangram puzzle. The corpus includes extra-lingustic information synchronised with utterances (such as operations on the puzzle pieces). They analysed the relations between re-ferring expressions and the extra-linguistic infor-mation, and reported that the pronominal usage of referring expressions is predominant. They also revealed that the multi-modal perspective of refer-ence should be dealt with for more realistic refer-ence understanding. Thus, a challenging issue in reference resolution is to create a model bridging a referring expression in the text and its object in the real world. As a first step, this paper focuses on incorporating extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based approach, taking Spanger et al. (2009) X  X  REX-J corpus 3 as the data set. In our problem setting, a referent needs to be identified by taking into account extra-linguistic informa-tion, such as the spatiala relations of puzzle pieces and the participants X  operations on them, as well as any preceding utterances in the dialogue. We particularly focus on the participants X  operation of pieces and so introduce it as several features in a machine learning-based approach.

This paper is organised as follows. We first ex-plain the corpus of collaborative work dialogues in Section 2, and then present our approach for identifying a referent given a referring expres-sion in situated dialogues in Section 3. Section 4 shows the results of our empirical evaluation. In Section 5 we compare our work with exist-ing work on reference resolution, and then con-clude this paper and discuss future directions in Section 6. For investigating dialogue from the multi-modal perspective, researchers have developed data sets including extra-linguistic information, bridging objects in the world and their referring expres-sions. The COCONUT corpus (Di Eugenio et al., 2000) is collected from keyboard-dialogues be-tween two participants, who are collaborating on a simple 2D design task. The setting tends to en-courage simple types of expressions by the partic-ipants. The COCONUT corpus is also limited to annotations with symbolic information about ob-jects, such as object attributes and location in dis-crete coordinates. Thus, in addition to the artifi-cial nature of interaction, such as using keyboard input, this corpus only records restricted types of data.

On the other hand, though the annotated corpus by Spanger et al. (2009) focuses on a limited do-main (i.e. collaborative work dialogues for solving the Tangram puzzle using a puzzle simulator on the computer), the required operations to solve the puzzle, and the situation as it is updated by a series of operations on the pieces are both recorded by the simulator. The relationship between a referring expression in a dialogue and its referent on a com-puter display is also annotated. For this reason, we selected the REX-J corpus for use in our em-pirical evaluations on reference resolution. Before explaining the details of our evaluation, we sketch
Figure 1: Screenshot of the Tangram simulator out the REX-J corpus and some of its prominent statistics. 2.1 The REX-J corpus In the process of building the REX-J corpus, Spanger et al. (2009) recruited 12 Japanese grad-uate students (4 females and 8 males), and split them into 6 pairs. All pairs knew each other previ-ously and were of the same sex and approximately the same age. Each pair was instructed to solve the Tangram puzzle. The goal of the puzzle is to construct a given shape by arranging seven pieces of simple figures as shown in Figure 1. The pre-cise position of every piece and every action that the participants make are recorded by the Tangram simulator in which the pieces on the computer dis-play can be moved, rotated and flipped with sim-ple mouse operations. The piece position and the mouse actions were recorded at intervals of 10 msec. The simulator displays two areas: a goal shape area (the left side of Figure 1) and a work-ing area (the right side of Figure 1) where pieces are shown and can be manipulated.

A different role was assigned to each participant of a pair: a solver and an operator . Given a cer-tain goal shape, the solver thinks of the necessary arrangement of the pieces and gives instructions to the operator for how to move them. The op-erator manipulates the pieces with the mouse ac-cording to the solver X  X  instructions. During this interaction, frequent uttering of referring expres-sions are needed to distinguish the pieces of the puzzle. This collaboration is achieved by placing a set of participants side by side, each with their own display showing the work area, and a shield screen set between them to prevent the operator from seeing the goal shape, which is visible only on the solver X  X  screen, and to further restrict their interaction to only speech. 2.2 Statistics Table 1 lists the syntactic and semantic features of the referring expressions in the corpus with their respective frequencies. Note that multiple fea-tures can be used in a single expression. This list demonstrates that  X  X ronoun X  and  X  X hape X  features are frequently uttered in the corpus. This is be-cause pronominal expressions are often used for pointing to a piece on a computer display. Expres-sions representing  X  X hape X  frequently appear in di-alogues even though they may be relatively redun-dant in the current utterance. From these statistics, capturing these two features can be judged as cru-cial as a first step toward accurate reference reso-lution. Before explaining the treatment of extra-linguistic information, let us first describe the task defini-tion, taking the REX-J corpus as target data. In the task of reference resolution, the reference res-olution model has to identify a referent (i.e. a piece on a computer display) 4 . In comparison to conventional problem settings for anaphora reso-lution, where the model searches for an antecedent out of a set of candidate antecedents from pre-ceding utterances, expressions corresponding to antecedents are sometimes omitted because refer-ring expressions are used as deixis (i.e. physically pointing to a piece on a computer display); they may also refer to a piece that has just been manip-ulated by an operator due to the temporal salience in a series of operations. For these reasons, even though the model checks all candidates in the pre-ceding utterances, it may not find the antecedent of a given referring expression. However, we do know that each referent exists as a piece on the display. We can therefore establish that when a re-ferring expression is uttered by either a solver or an operator, the model can choose one of seven pieces as a referent of the current referring expres-sion. 3.1 Ranking model to identify referents To investigate the impact of extra-linguistic infor-mation on reference resolution, we conduct an em-pirical evaluation in which a reference resolution model chooses a referent (i.e. a piece) for a given referring expression from the set of pieces illus-trated on the computer display.

As a basis for our reference resolution model, we adopt an existing model for reference res-olution. Recently, machine learning-based ap-proaches to reference resolution (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.) have been developed, particularly focussing on identifying anaphoric re-lations in texts, and have achieved better perfor-mance than hand-crafted rule-based approaches. These models for reference resolution take into ac-count linguistic factors, such as relative salience of candidate antecedents, which have been modeled in Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) by rank-ing candidate antecedents appearing in the preced-ing discourse (Iida et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003; Denis and Baldridge, 2008). In order to take ad-vantage of existing models, we adopt the ranking-based approach as a basis for our reference resolu-tion model.

In conventional ranking-based models, Yang et al. (2003) and Iida et al. (2003) decompose the ranking process into a set of pairwise compar-isons of two candidate antecedents. However, re-cent work by Denis and Baldridge (2008) reports that appropriately constructing a model for rank-ing all candidates yields improved performance over those utilising pairwise ranking.

Similarly we adopt a ranking-based model, in which all candidate antecedents compete with one another to decide the most likely candi-date antecedent. Although the work by Denis and Baldridge (2008) uses Maximum Entropy to create their ranking-based model, we adopt the Ranking SVM algorithm (Joachims, 2002), which learns a weight vector to rank candidates for a given partial ranking of each referent. Each train-ing instance is created from the set of all referents for each referring expression. To define the par-tial ranking of referents, we simply rank referents referred to by a given referring expression as first place and other referents as second place. 3.2 Use of extra-linguistic information Recent work on multi-modal reference resolution or referring expression generation (Prasov and Chai, 2008; Foster et al., 2008; Carletta et al., 2010) indicates that extra-linguistic information, such as eye-gaze and manipulation of objects, is one of essential clues for distinguishing deictic reference from endophoric reference.

For instance, Prasov and Chai (2008) demon-strated that integrating eye-gaze information (es-pecially, relative fixation intensity, the amount of time spent fixating a candidate object) into the conventional dialogue history-based model im-proved the performance of reference resolution. Foster et al. (2008) investigated the relationship of referring expressions and the manupluation of ob-jects on a collaborative construction task, which is similar to our Tangram task 5 . They reported about 36% of the initial mentioned referring ex-pressions in their corpus were involved with par-ticipant X  X  operations of objects, such as mouse ma-nipulation.

From these background, in addition to the in-formation about the history of the preceding dis-course, which has been used in previous machine learning-based approaches, we integrate extra-linguistic information into the reference resolution model shown in Section 3.1. More precisely, we introduce the following extra-linguistic informa-tion: the information with regards to the history of a piece X  X  movement and the mouse cursor po-sitions, and the information of the piece currently manipulated by an operator. We next elaborate on these three kinds of features. All the features are summarised in Table 2. 3.2.1 Discourse history features First,  X  X ype of X  features are acquired from the ex-pressions of a given referring expression and its antecedent in the preceding discourse if the an-tecedent explicitly appears. These features have been examined by approaches to anaphora or coreference resolution (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.) to capture the salience of a can-didate antecedent. To capture the textual aspect of dialogues for solving Tangram puzzle, we ex-ploit the features such as a binary value indicating whether a referring expression has no antecedent in the preceding discourse and case markers fol-lowing a candidate antecedent. 3.2.2 Action history features The history of the operations may yield important clues that indicate the salience in terms of the tem-poral recency of a piece within a series of opera-tions. To introduce this aspect as a set of features, we can use, for example, the time distance of a candidate referent (i.e. a piece in the Tangram puz-zle) since the mouse cursor was moved over it. We call this type of feature the action history feature . 3.2.3 Current operation features The recency of operations of a piece is also an im-portant factor on reference resolution because it is directly associated with the focus of attention in terms of the cognition in a series of operations. For example, since a piece which was most re-cently manipulated is most salient from cognitive perspectives, it might be expected that the piece tends to be referred to by unmarked referring ex-pressions such as pronouns. To incorporate such clues into the reference resolution model, we can use, for example, the time distance of a candidate referent since it was last manipulated in the pre-ceding utterances. We call this type of feature the current operation feature . In order to investigate the effect of the extra-linguistic information introduced in this paper, we conduct an empirical evaluation using the REX-J corpus. 4.1 Models As we see in Section 2.2, the feature testing whether a referring expression is a pronoun or not is crucial because it is directly related to the  X  X eictic X  usage of referring expressions, whereas other expressions tend to refer to an expression ap-pearing in the preceding utterances. As described in Denis and Baldridge (2008), when the size of training instances is relatively small, the models induced by learning algorithms (e.g. SVM) should be separately created with regards to distinct fea-tures. Therefore, focusing on the difference of the pronominal usage of referring expressions, we separately create the reference resolution models; one is for identifying a referent of a given pro-noun, and the other is for all other expressions. We henceforth call the former model the pronoun model and the latter one the non-pronoun model respectively. At the training phase, we use only training instances whose referring expressions are pronouns for creating the pronoun model, and all other training instances are used for the non-pronoun model. The model using one of these models depending on the referring expression to be solved is called the separate model .

To verify Denis and Baldridge (2008) X  X  premise mentioned above, we also create a model using all training instances without dividing pronouns and other. This model is called the combined model hereafter. 4.2 Experimental setting We used 40 dialogues in the REX-J corpus 6 , con-taining 2,048 referring expressions. To facilitate the experiments, we conduct 10-fold crossvalida-tion using 2,035 referring expressions, each of which refers to a single piece in a computer dis-play 7 .

As a baseline model, we adopted a model only using the discourse history features. We utilised SVM rank 8 as an implementation of the Ranking SVM algorithm, in which the parameter c was set as 1.0 and the remaining parameters were set to their defaults. 4.3 Results The results of each model are shown in Table 3. First of all, by comparing the models with and without extra-linguistic information (i.e. the model using all features shown in Table 2 and the baseline model), we can see the effectiveness of extra-linguistic information. The results typi-cally show that the former achieved better perfor-mance than the latter. In particular, it indicates that exploiting the action history features are signifi-cantly useful for reference resolution in this data set.

Second, we can also see the impact of extra-linguistic information (especially, the action his-tory features) with regards to the pronoun and non-pronoun models. In the former case, the model with extra-linguistic information improved by about 22% compared with the baseline model. On the other hand, in the latter case, the accuracy improved by only 7% over the baseline model. The difference may be caused by the fact that pro-nouns are more sensitive to the usage of the ac-tion history features because pronouns are often uttered as deixis (i.e. a pronoun tends to directly refer to a piece shown in a computer display).
The results also show that the model using the discourse history and action history features achieved better performance than the model using all the features. This may be due to the duplicated definitions between the action history and current
Table 4: Weights of the features in each model operation features. As we can see in the feature definitions of CO1 and AH1, some current opera-tion features partially overlap with the action his-tory features, which is effectively used in the rank-ing process. However, the other current operation features may have bad effects for ranking refer-ents due to their ill-formed definitions. To shed light on this problem, we need additional investi-gation of the usage of features, and to refine their definitions.

Finally, the results show that the performance of the separated model is significantly better than that of the combined model 9 , which indicates that separately creating models to specialise in distinct factors (i.e. whether a referring expression is a pronoun or not) is important as suggested by Denis and Baldridge (2008).

We next investigated the significance of each Table 5: Frequencies of REs relating to on-mouse feature of the pronoun and non-pronoun models. We calculate the weight of feature f shown in Table 2 according to the following formula. where SVs is a set of the support vectors in a ranker induced by SVM rank , w x is the weight of the sup-port vector x , z x ( f ) is the function that returns 1 if f occurs in x , respectively.

The feature weights are shown in Table 4. This demonstrates that in the pronoun model the ac-tion history features have the highest weight, while with the non-pronoun model these features are less significant. As we can see in Table 5, pronouns are strongly related to the situation where a mouse cursor is over a piece, directly causing the weights of the features associated with the  X  X n-mouse X  sit-uation to become higher than other features.
On the other hand, in the non-pronoun model, the discourse history features, such as DH6 and DH2, are the most significant, indicating that the compatibility of the attributes of a piece and a re-ferring expression is more crucial than other ac-tion history and current operation features. This is compatible with the previous research concerning textual reference resolution (Mitkov, 2002).
Table 4 shows that feature AH3 (aiming at cap-turing the recency in terms of a series of oper-ations) is also significant. It empirically proves that the recent operation is strongly related to the salience of reference as a kind of  X  X ocus X  by hu-mans. There have been increasing concerns about ref-erence resolution in dialogue. Byron and Allen (1998) and Eckert and Strube (2000) reported about 50% of pronouns had no antecedent in TRAINS93 and Switchboard corpora respectively. Strube and M  X  uller (2003) attempted to resolve pronominal anaphora in the Switchboard corpus by porting a corpus-based anaphora resolution model focusing on written texts (e.g. Soon et al. (2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002)). They used specialised features for spoken dialogues as well as conventional features. They reported relatively worse results than with written texts. The reason is that the features in their work capture only in-formation derived from transcripts of dialogues, while it is also essential to bridge objects and con-cepts in the real (or virtual) world and their expres-sions (especially pronouns) for recognising refer-ential relations intrinsically.

To improve performance on reference resolu-tion in dialogue, researchers have focused on anaphoricity determination, which is the task of judging whether an expression explicitly has an antecedent in the text (i.e. in the preceding ut-terances) (M  X  uller, 2006; M  X  uller, 2007). Their work presented implementations of pronominal reference resolution in transcribed, multi-party di-alogues. M  X  uller (2006) focused on the determina-tion of non-referential it , categorising instances of it in the ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) into six classes in terms of their grammatical cat-egories. They also took into account each charac-teristic of these types by using a refined feature set. In the work by M  X  uller (2007), they conducted an empirical evaluation including antecedent identifi-cation as well as anaphoricity determination. They used the relative frequencies of linguistic patterns as clues to introduce specific patterns for non-referentials. They reported that their performance for detecting non-referentials was relatively high (80.0% in precision and 60.9% in recall), while the overall performance was still low (18.2% in precision and 19.1% in recall). These results indi-cate the need for advancing research in reference resolution in dialogue.

In contrast to the above mentioned research, our task includes the treatment of entity disambigua-tion (i.e. selecting a referent out of a set of pieces on a computer display) as well as conventional anaphora resolution. Although our task setting is limited to the problem of solving the Tangram puz-zle, we believe it is a good starting point for incor-porating real (or virtual) world entities into coven-tional anaphora resolution. This paper presented the task of reference reso-lution bridging pieces in the real world and their referents in dialogue. We presented an imple-mentation of a reference resolution model ex-ploiting extra-linguistic information, such as ac-tion history and current operation features, to cap-ture the salience of operations by a participant and the arrangement of the pieces. Through our empirical evaluation, we demonstrated that the extra-linguistic information introduced in this pa-per contributed to improving performance. We also analysed the effect of each feature, showing that while action history features were useful for pronominal reference, discourse history features made sense for the other references.

In order to enhance this kind of reference res-olution, there are several possible future direc-tions. First, in the current problem setting, we exclude zero-anaphora (i.e. omitted expressions refer to either an expression in the previous utter-ances or an object on a display deictically). How-ever, zero-anaphora is essential for precise mod-eling and recognition of reference because it is also directly related with the recency of referents, either textually or situationally. Second, repre-senting distractors in a reference resolution model is also a key. Although, this paper presents an implementation of a reference model considering only the relationship between a referring expres-sion and its candidate referents. However, there might be cases when the occurrence of expressions or manipulated pieces intervening between a refer-ring expression and its referent need to be taken into account. Finally, more investigation is needed for considering other extra-linguistic information, such as eye-gaze, for exploring what kinds of in-formation is critical to recognising reference in di-alogue.
