 In this paper, we aim to identif y different types of knowledge that needs to be conveyed during a conceptual design task. We hypothesize that different ty pes of knowledge has different transferability in a partially distributed team setting, and thus influences team members X  comm unication behaviors. The impacts due to different transferability of design knowledge are discussed. Is it always beneficial to have a video channel for distant communication? Many theories in the field of computer-mediated communication, such as media richness and social presence theories support the notion that increasing communication bandwidth will enhance co mmunication experience and performance. Despite the wide usage of those theories [8], the empirical studies yielded inconclu sive results [1, 7]. One of the reasons may be due to different ta sks utilized in the experiments, as different types of task ma y require different types of communication technology. The task-media fit theory [9] highlights the match between communication technologies and tasks, based on the task taxonom y [2]. However, the predictive accuracy of the task-media fit theo ry resulted a limited support [3]. In contrast, we hypothesize th at communication technology must be selected based on knowledge ty pes associated with a task. A task may consist of many differe nt types of knowledge, and the transferability of those different types of knowledge may differ based on the communication technol ogy. The transferability can be defined as the amount of effort required to successfully convey knowledge to distant partners. In this paper, we examined partially distributed conceptual design teams. Partially distributed team can be defined as a team that consists of two or more sub-teams that are geographically distributed [6]. It is one of the most frequently utilized formation in nowadays organizations, yet very little empirical research exists [4]. In such setting, communication becomes more complicated because of the co-existence of face-to-face and technology-mediated communications. Communi cation in conceptual design is also complex, due to the ambiguity of the task. The ambiguity is attributed to the open-ended and ill-defined problem and solution spaces [5]. Different types of design knowledge are required, and there are many phases as well as sub-tasks within a conceptual design process. In this regard, the study objectives are (i) to identify different types of knowledge that are communicated during conceptual design task, and (ii) to examine the transferability of different types of knowledge within and across sub-groups. Participants were drawn from a large mid-Atlantic land-grant university. A total of 16 (8 fema les and 8 males, mean age=21.6, SD=1.2) junior or senior undergra duate students were recruited to form four four-person groups. There was no restriction in participants X  majors to simulate a multidisciplinary team, yet at least one engineering student was included in each team. Each group was divided into two dyad sub-groups to simulate a partially distributed team. Each sub-group was separated in two different rooms and collaborated on a conceptual design task. Upon completion of the experiment, a monetary compensation of $20 was awareded to each participant. The research protocol was approved by the university X  X  internal review board. Each group had to design an add-on device to an existing hand or arm-powered wheelchair so that it allows paraplegic users to traverse standard roadside curb s without any assistance. Groups were instructed to follow three distinct design phases, which were initiation, concept generation, and concept evaluation. This was to identify the different types knowledge associated in each design phase. Each team was required to submit one design solution, which included a detailed conceptual sketch, and a description of a use case scenario. The design task lasted approximately 2.5~3 hours, and the entire session was video recorded. During the design task, a video conferencing tool was used. Participants were able to see and hear each another. A shared whiteboard was available that allowed participants to simultaneously sketch or type. In addition, participants were also able to use paper and pen to sketch or write.
 The purposes of individual semi-s tructured interview were to understand the communication difficulties as well as reasons behind participant X  X  communicative actions during the design task. The questions were developed based on video analysis of the design sessions. The first few questions focused on participant X  X  general communication experience, while the remaining questions focused on specific of communication difficulties occurred during the task. A total of 14 out of 16 participants participated the individual semi-structured interv iew, which lasted about 30-50 minutes each. The interview sessions were audio recorded and transcribed. A total of six types of knowledge were identified as described in Table 1. The subsequent sections aim to define, explain, and provide examples with interview excerpts regarding each type of design knowledge. Design function refers to the objective of a design solution or components of the design. The overa ll design function is usually discussed in the beginning of a design session. However, the design knowledge of function also refers to the purpose of each component of a design. For instan ce, team 2 designed a ski-like ramp that requires simple assembly of the inner and outer rods to the ramp before using it. As illust rated in figure 1, the storage sack attached at the back of the seat has its purpose of storing the inner and outer rods. Therefore, storing can be considered as the functionality of the storage sack. Based on the observation of video recordings and interview, participants did not experience much difficulty in transferring the design knowledge of function, and more frequent inter communication between two sub-groups was observed. Design structure refers to the stru ctural components and properties synthesized, and evaluated to achieve the design objective. Structural components are the constituting parts that are integrated to complete the design. As illustrated in figure 1, there are seven components that work accordingly to achieve the design objective. Each component has different shap e, size, and wei ght, as well as property. For instance, there are triangular shaped rubber grip attached at the bottom end of the ramp. Because of the property of rubber as well as its triangular sh ape, it serves its own purpose of preventing the ramp from sliding. In most cases, participants di d not have much difficulty in explaining or understanding the sh ape, weight, and parts suggested by other members. Yet, they frequently had difficulty when pointing out the exact location of an attachment of a part. For instance, members in group 4 sp ent extensive amount of time clarifying the lever attachment (fi gure 3-a) as described in the interview excerpt below.  X  X 19: Well, for me I couldn't understand because the way I saw it was the lever was attached to the chair... But the problem I was wheel, and if it's attached to... if it's attached to the wheel that won't help you at all. X  In such case, participants showed a tendency of explaining only to their co-located partner. They re ported that because it was difficult to convey the information to their distant partners, they wanted to practice or get verification of their explanation from their co-located partner before explaining to their distant partners. Design behavior refers to th e movement of a design or components of the design. In concept design phase, a design does not usually have a physical fo rm. Therefore, engineers or designers must go through a mental simulation of the behaviors associated with each component. In general, participants reported that they had the most difficulty in explaining the behavioral aspect of a design. In group 1, P8 who had an idea of hand controlled ramp, tried to explain her idea by actually showing the movement of the ramp in accordance with the wheelchair, to her distant partners over the webcam (figure 2).  X  X 8: Yeah. I mean I feel like I awkwardly rolled my chair back and showed them what I was trying to say... and tried to show them like physically, visually I tr ied to use the drawings, try to explain it so I used the three major ways to tell someone... X  
Figure 2. Participant 8 trying to explain the behavior of hand P8 used her chair to describe the wheelchair movement, and two pens to describe the ramp moveme nt. Similar incident occurred in team 4. P17 came up with a lever idea, yet his partners were all confused of how it would actuall y work. All of the members in team 4 pointed out that explaini ng or understanding the lever idea was the most difficult problem during the task.  X  X 17: The lever... I feel like maybe I wasn't able to convey the concept of the lever... but the lever is where we got stuck up big time and we wasted like a whole hour on that. X  After a long discussion regarding the movement of a lever, P20 used a wheelie example to assure whether he accurately understood the idea. P20 demonstrated a jerking backwards motion while pulling his hands towards himself to simulate the lever and wheelchair movement (figure 3-b). P20 later responded in the interview that he intended to describe that the back wheels are stationary, the lever can be moved back and forth (figure 3-a), and as a consequence, the wheelchair tilts backwards. As seen in the examples above, be havioral explanation of a design is difficult and requires longer tim e and more effort to convey, especially to distant partners. It frequently requires physical demonstration of an e xpected behavior of a design, and adequate example that has a similar behavioral characteristic. Similar to what occurred in conveying the design knowledge of structure, participants inclined to communicate only to their co-located partner for similar reasons. Participants also reported that small and low screen resolution aggravated the communication across sub-groups. Design procedure refers to a series of associated movements of a design or a design component in relation to user actions. The distinction between behavioral and procedural knowledge in design is that user actions or behaviors are included. Thus, it is an integration of design behaviors as a consequence of user actions. Additionally, procedural knowledge describes more integral movement of the overall design , whereas behavioral knowledge only focuses on a behavior of one structure. Therefore, the communication of procedural knowle dge usually occurs after each structure and its corresponding behavior are determined in concept generation phase. Figure 4 is an example of procedural knowledge produced by team 3. In most cases, diagrams and verbal descriptions were used to externalize or communicate pro cedural knowledge. Participants seemed to have less difficulty because the constituting behaviors of structures were already discussed and determined. The use of electronic shared drawing space that allows participants to watch the drawing process of their distant partners may promote better communication of the procedural knowledge. Design concept refers to a theoretical principle or mechanism that engineers or designers apply to their design. In case of the wheelchair design brief, one way of interpreting the design objective in terms of design concept would be  X  X ift the wheelchair with minimum amount of for ce. X  Team 3 applied a lever mechanism so that the paraplegic users can effectively apply their upper extremity force to tilt the wheelchair. Other teams used different types of ramps so that the users can apply their upper extremity force gradually to move the wheelchair up the curb. Communicating design concepts required less visual communication or physical demonstration. Participants generally understood the essence of the concept that was brought up by their partners. However, th ere were few non-engineering majors who reported that they had difficulty in understanding the concepts. In such cases, their co-located partne rs usually provide d an additional explanation regarding the concept. Design value refers to an individual perception of the quality of a design. Most of the discussions regarding design values occurred in concept evaluation phase. Alt hough participants reported that they had less difficulty in communicating their opinions regarding different design values (e.g., safety, aesthetics, ergonomics, production, and cost), many conflic ting situations were observed. For instance, P12, a human nutrition, foods, and exercise major claimed to have an extensive experience of taking care of paraplegic patients, emphasized the safety aspect of their design. However, P9 who is an industr ial design major emphasized more on the simplicity and aesthetics aspect of the design. It took quite a while to resolve the discussion between safety and aesthetics, yet again no participant reported di fficulty of sharing opinions regarding design values. Different types of knowledge ar e communicated in different design phases. This does not mean that certain type of design knowledge never occurred in a specific design phase, since design is an iterative process in nature. However, based on our observation, certain types of knowledge dominated in each design phase. In initiation phase, partic ipants mostly communicated the design knowledge of function. In concept generation, the design knowledge of structure and beha vior were mostly discussed followed by the design knowledge of concept and procedure. In concept evaluation, values were the most actively discussed. All of the participants pointed out that communication in concept generation was the most difficult comp ared to other design phases.  X  X 14: It's definitely the concept generation. It's hard to explain what we were talking about, what ea ch of our ideas were, unless it was very simplistic. X  One of the major reasons of such difficulty was due to the difficulty of transferring the design knowledge of structure and behavior in concept generation phase. Unlike other types of design knowledge, structure and behavioral description require visual information, such as illustratio n, body movement, hand gestures, as well as any objects that a spea ker intends to use to describe her idea. Different types of de sign knowledge require varying amount of communication efforts for successf ul transfer. More importantly, knowledge transferability ch anges people X  X  communicative behavior. When a type of knowledge was difficult to transfer, participants naturally communicated only to their co-located partner. This may create inform ation silo betwee n two sub-groups, and may further transpire to in-group dynamics. Based on the identified design k nowledge, we aim to demonstrate the transferability of these design knowledge in different communication settings. A combination of a fully immersive tele-presence system, laptops, and mobile devices will be utilized to further investigate the relationship between communication technology and knowledge types associated with a task. 1.
