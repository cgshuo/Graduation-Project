 Plagiarism, the unacknowledged reuse of text, has increase d in recent years due to the large amount of texts readily avail -able. For instance, recent studies claim that nowadays a hig h rate of student reports include plagiarism, making manual plagiarism detection practically infeasible.

Automatic plagiarism detection tools assist experts to ana l-yse documents for plagiarism. Nevertheless, the lack of sta n-dard collections with cases of plagiarism has prevented ac-curate comparing models, making differences hard to ap-preciate. Seminal efforts on the detection of text reuse [2] have fostered the composition of standard resources for the accurate evaluation and comparison of methods.

The aim of this PhD thesis is to address three of the main problems in the development of better models for automatic plagiarism detection: ( i ) the adequate identification of good potential sources for a given suspicious text; ( ii ) the detec-tion of plagiarism despite modifications, such as words sub-stitution and paraphrasing (special stress is given to cros s-language plagiarism); and ( iii ) the generation of standard collections of cases of plagiarism and text reuse in order to provide a framework for accurate comparison of models.
Regarding difficulties ( i ) and ( ii ) , we have carried out preliminary experiments over the METER corpus [2]. Given a suspicious document d q and a collection of potential source documents D , the process is divided in two steps. First, a small subset of potential source documents D  X   X  D is retrieved. The documents d  X  D  X  are the most related to d q and, therefore, the most likely to include the source of the plagiarised fragments in it. We performed this stage on the basis of the Kullback-Leibler distance, over a sub-sample of document X  X  vocabularies. Afterwards, a detailed analysis is carried out comparing d q to every d  X  D  X  in order to identify potential cases of plagiarism and their source. This comparison was made on the basis of word n -grams, by considering n = { 2 , 3 } . These n -gram levels are flexible enough to properly retrieve plagiarised fragments and thei r sources despite modifications [1]. The result is offered to th e user to take the final decision. Further experiments were done in both stages in order to compare other similarity measures, such as the cosine measure, the Jaccard coefficient and diverse fingerprinting and probabilistic models.
