 Wavelet analysis is thus capable of revealing some hidden aspects possible drawback of WT is that the frequency resolution is quite poor in the higher frequency region. The wavelet packet trans-form (WPT) is an extension of the WT, which provides a complete packets are alternative bases formed by the linear combinations Therefore, the WPT enables the extraction of features from the signals that contain both the stationary and non-stationary components with an arbitrary time-frequency resolution. More-over, each wavelet packet decomposition frequency band has component energies which are more sensitive to damage and thus can better describe structure damage feature.

The artificial neural network (ANN) model is robust, adaptive and with quality and uncertainty, making it highly promising for detecting structural damage. The feasibility of applying ANN and WPT to detect structural damage has received considerable attention ( Sun and Chang, 2002; Yam et al., 2003; Yuen and Lam, limited partial signals about the structures can be collected and Signals from different sensors may provide complementary data in addition to the redundant information content. Merging of redun-dant data can help improve the imprecision; and data fusion of complementary data can create a more consistent recognition of required task is to train the ANN in advance using a set of known damage feature proxy and damage physical parameters of the structures to be detected.

Recent studies show that a three-layer neural network can be applied to implement damage assessment ( Luo and Hanagud, 1997; Zeng, 1998 ). In this research the topology of the neural network is a feedforward three-layer neural network which means the weighted interconnections feed activation only in the
A typical three-layer feedforward neural network is schema-i hidden nodes, and l output nodes. The input, output and target is the weight between the input node j and the hidden layer j . the next layer.

Back-propagation (BP) algorithm based on gradient decent method is suitable for multiplayer neural network to train under supervision. The training process of BP algorithm can be divided each neuron is obtained by calculating the input information in each hidden layer. In the second phase (back-propagation), the difference between actual output and target output can be computed layer by layer in recursion and the weights are adjusted in the out layer. BP algorithm is adopted by most ANN in actual applications in structural damage identification. 3. Damage diagnosis procedure
A data fusion technique can combine data from several information sources as well as information from relative data-bases, to achieve a higher accuracy and more specific inferences than that could be achieved by a single source alone ( Telmoudi yield stress 300 MPa (42.6 kpsi). The excitation is low-level ambient wind loading at each floor in the y direction. To take the uncertainty of environmental loads into account, the wind loading is modeled as filtered Gaussian white noise processes passed through a sixth order low-pass Butterworth filter with a C8; there are 16 sensors in all. Signals to be analyzed are the the column 4 respectively, which is on node 13, 22, 31 and 40 in is 16384. 4.1. Extract feature
Battle X  X emarie as a basis function is employed to decompose the acceleration responses with 7 as the decomposition level. 128 frequency bands in total are generated, the width of which is 3.91 Hz. These component energies are sorted first according to their magnitude, 95% of the WPRE is mainly distributed below 100 Hz frequency bands after calculating, which are both therefore the first 16 component energies of WPT are selected as damage indices. Fig. 3 shows the measured vibration responses for different damage conditions. The distribution map of the WPRE about different damage conditions are shown in Fig. 4 , all seen that the distributions of WPRE are obviously different when detection nodes and damage conditions are different. Therefore the WPRE is capable to serve as a feature vector to describe structure damage conditions. 4.2. Damage diagnosis
The output of BPNN is damage status including occurrence, location and degree of damage. However, if the three levels of damage are required to be identified at one time in one neural other hand, the damage identification can be more accurate and faster due to alleviated burden of network and simplicity of problem if the damage statuses are identified step by step using different neural networks, i.e. firstly, damage occurrence and damage location is detected and then damage extent is identified, especially, when the damage case is complicated, damaged substructure with the same materials and approximate dynamic
Damage patterns are as follows: (1) single floor damage: 4 4  X  16; (2) two floors damage: 4 6  X  24; (3) three floors damage: 4 4  X  16; (4) four floors damage: 4 1  X  4.

Along with the case of no damage, there are 61 damaged cases totally. Considering the effect of noise of the environment, -10 0 10 -10 0 10 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 for a single node that the number of hidden neurons is 25 is more appropriate, for a four-node fused that the number of hidden neurons is 43 is more appropriate.

Table 1 show that the damage detection accuracy (DDA) of single sensor is above 90%. However this result depends on the detection node selected and is based on lots of experience, which is very inconvenient for many damage detection researchers. In contrast, The DDA of multi-sensor feature fusion is 100% with a much faster convergence speed and smaller system error than that of single sensor. Also it has a higher degree of independence, which enhances the operating reliability and performance. 4.2.2. Damage extent
From 4.2.1 the floor on which the damage occurred can be first floor in y direction is used as samples. Damage patterns includes removing 4 braces, 3 braces, 2 braces and 1brace, a one-there are 6 damage cases totally. Select different seed number randomly and add to noises of different levels, 162 samples are used in simulation of damage extent identification, including 54 testing samples and 108 training samples. They are also named as test samples.

The output numerical value indicates that the extent of the
Table 2 is the detection results of damage extent of signals from both single sensor and multi-sensor fusion. The training process of ANN is stopped when the average mean square error is smaller than 1 10 4 or when the number of iterations reaches 10,000. Similarly, for a single node that the number of hidden neurons is 22 is more appropriate, for a four-node fused that the number of hidden neurons is 25 is more appropriate.

Results in Table 2 shows that, the damage detection accuracy (DDA) of multi-sensor feature fusion is also higher than that of single sensor. Fig. 5 shows that the comparison of the output of the neural network between node 13 and fused feature, we can also see that the fused neural network is able to predict the damage extent.

Signals from different sensors may reflect different aspects of structure damage; a multi-sensor information fusion technique can combine data from several information sources and relative information from associated databases to achieve improved accuracies and more specific inferences. Multi-sensor, due to redundancy area provided by other sensors, overcomes the shortcomings of single sensor employed individually. Reference
