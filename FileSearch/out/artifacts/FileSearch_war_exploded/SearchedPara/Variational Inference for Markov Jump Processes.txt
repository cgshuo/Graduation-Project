 Markov Jump Processes (MJP): stochastic processes for integer X valued ran dom variables in continuous time. They are common in many applications: single cell biology, ecological models, telecommunications, etc. They are widely studied through simulation (Gillespie's algorithm); inference however is a long standing problem. We propose a novel mean X field algorithm that allows practical inference. We demonstrate the method on two exam ples, the classic Lotka X Volterra predator X prey model and a gene auto X reg ulatory network.
