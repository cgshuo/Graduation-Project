 Although modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) takes several cues from the biological per-ception of speech, it rarely models its biological production. The result is that speech is treated as a surface acoustic phenomenon with lexical or phonetic hidden dynamics but without any phys-ical constraints in between. This omission leads to some untenable assumptions. For example, speech is often treated out of convenience as a se-quence of discrete, non-overlapping packets, such as phonemes, despite the fact that some major dif-ficulties in ASR, such as co-articulation, are by definition the result of concurrent physiological phenomena (Hardcastle and Hewlett, 1999).

Many acoustic ambiguities can be resolved with knowledge of the vocal tract X  X  configuration (O X  X haughnessy, 2000). For example, the three nasal sonorants, /m/ , /n/ , and /ng/ , are acousti-cally similar (i.e., they have large concentrations of energy at the same frequencies) but uniquely and reliably involve bilabial closure, tongue-tip elevation, and tongue-dorsum elevation, respec-tively. Having access to the articulatory goals of the speaker would, in theory, make the identifica-tion of linguistic intent almost trivial. Although we don X  X  typically have access to the vocal tract during speech recognition, its configuration can be estimated reasonably well from acoustics alone within adequate models or measurements of the vocal tract (Richmond et al., 2003; Toda et al., 2008). Evidence that such inversion takes place naturally in humans during speech perception sug-gests that the discriminability of speech sounds de-pends powerfully on their production (Liberman and Mattingly, 1985; D X  X usilio et al., 2009).
This paper describes the use of explicit models of physical speech production within recognition systems. Initially, we augment traditional models of ASR with probabilistic relationships between acoustics and articulation learned from appropri-ate data. This leads to the incorporation of a high-level, goal-oriented, and control-based theory of speech production within a novel ASR system. The use of theoretical (phonological) features of the vocal tract has provided some improvement over traditional acoustic ASR systems in phoneme recognition with neural networks (Kirchhoff, 1999; Roweis, 1999), but there has been very little work in ASR informed by direct measure-ments of the vocal tract. Recently, Markov et al. (2006) have augmented hidden Markov models with Bayes networks trained to describe articula-tory constraints from a small amount of Japanese vocal tract data, resulting in a small phoneme-error reduction. This work has since been ex-panded upon to inform ASR systems sensitive to physiological speech disorders (Rudzicz, 2009). Common among previous efforts is an interpre-tation of speech as a sequence of short, instanta-neous observations devoid of long-term dynamics. 2.1 Articulatory phonology Articulatory phonology bridges the divide be-tween the physical manifestation of speech and its underlying lexical intentions. Within this disci-pline, the theory of task dynamics is a combined model of physical articulator motion and the plan-ning of abstract vocal tract configurations (Saltz-man, 1986). This theory introduces the notion that all observed patterns of speech are the result of overlapping gestures , which are abstracted goal-oriented reconfigurations of the vocal tract, such as bilabial closure or velar opening (Saltzman and Munhall, 1989). Each gesture occurs within one of the following tract variables (TVs): velar open-ing ( VEL ), lip aperture ( LA ) and protrusion ( LP ), tongue tip constriction location ( TTCL ) and de-gree ( TTCD ) 1 , tongue body constriction location ( TBCL ) and degree ( TBCD ), lower tooth height (LTH ), and glottal vibration ( GLO ). For example, the syllable pub consists of an onset ( /p/ ), a nu-cleus ( /ah/ ), and a coda ( /b/ ). Four gestural goals are associated with the onset, namely the shutting of GLO and of VEL, and the closure and release of LA. Similarly, the nucleus of the syllable consists of three goals, namely the relocation of TBCD and TBCL, and the opening of GLO. The presence and extent of these gestural goals are represented by filled rectangles in figure 1. Inter-gestural timings between these goals are specified relative to one another according to human data as described by Nam and Saltzman (2003).
 Figure 1: Canonical example pub from Saltzman and Munhall (1989).

The presence of these discrete goals influences the vocal tract dynamically and continuously as modelled by the following non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equation: Here, z is a continuous vector representing the in-stantaneous positions of the nine tract variables, z  X  is the target (equilibrium) positions of those variables, and vectors z 0 and z 00 represent the first and second derivatives of z with respect to time (i.e., velocity and acceleration), respectively. The matrices M , B , and K are syllable-specific coef-ficients describing the inertia, damping, and stiff-ness, respectively, of the virtual gestures. Gener-ally, this theory assumes that the tract variables are mutually independent, and that the system is criti-cally damped (i.e., the tract variables do not oscil-late around their equilibrium positions) (Nam and Saltzman, 2003). The continuous state, z , of equa-tion (1) is exemplified by black curves in figure 1. 2.2 Articulatory data Tract variables provide the dimensions of an ab-stract gestural space independent of the physical characteristics of the speaker. In order to com-plete our articulatory model, however, we require physical data from which to infer these high-level articulatory goals.

Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is a method to measure the motion of the vocal tract during speech. In EMA, the speaker is placed within a low-amplitude electromagnetic field pro-duced within a cube of a known geometry. Tiny sensors within this field induce small electric cur-rents whose energy allows the inference of artic-ulator positions and velocities to within 1 mm of error (Yunusova et al., 2009). We derive data for the following study from two EMA sources:  X  The University of Edinburgh X  X  MOCHA  X  The University of Toronto X  X  TORGO
For the following study we use the eight 2D po-sitions common to both databases, namely the up-per lip (UL), lower lip (LL), upper incisor (UI), lower incisor (LI), tongue tip (TT), tongue blade (TB), and tongue dorsum (TD). Since these po-sitions are recorded in 3D in TORGO, we project these onto the midsagittal plane. (Additionally, the MOCHA database provides velum (V) data on this plane, and TORGO provides the left and right lip corners (LL and RL) but these are excluded from study except where noted).

All articulatory data is aligned with its associ-ated acoustic data, which is transformed to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Since the 2D EMA system in MOCHA and the 3D EMA system in TORGO differ in their recording rates, the length of each MFCC frame in each database must differ in order to properly align acoustics with articulation in time. Therefore, each MFCC frame covers 16 ms in the TORGO database, and 32 ms in MOCHA. Phoneme boundaries are de-termined automatically in the MOCHA database by forced alignment, and by a speech-language pathologist in the TORGO database.

We approximate the tract variable space from the physical space of the articulators, in general, through principal component analysis (PCA) on the latter, and subsequent sigmoid normalization on [ 0 , 1 ] . For example, the LTH tract variable is in-ferred by calculating the first principal component of the two-dimensional lower incisor (LI) motion in the midsagittal plane, and by normalizing the resulting univariate data through a scaled sigmoid. The VEL variable is inferred similarly from velum (V) EMA data. Tongue tip constriction location and degree (TTCL and TTCD, respectively) are inferred from the 1 st and 2 nd principal components of tongue tip (TT) EMA data, with TBCL and TBCD inferred similarly from tongue body (TB) data. Finally, the glottis (GLO) is inferred by voic-ing detection on acoustic energy below 150 Hz (O X  X haughnessy, 2000), lip aperture (LA) is the normalized Euclidean distance between the lips, and lip protrusion (LP) is the normalized 2 nd prin-cipal component of the midpoint between the lips. All PCA is performed without segmentation of the data. The result is a low-dimensional set of contin-uous curves describing goal-relevant articulatory variables. Figure 2, for example, shows the degree of the lip aperture (LA) over time for all instances of the /b/ phoneme in the MOCHA database. The relevant articulatory goal of lip closure is evident. We now turn to the task of speech recognition. Traditional Bayesian learning is restricted to uni-versal or immutable relationships, and is agnos-Figure 2: Lip aperture (LA) over time during all MOCHA instances of /b/ . tic towards dynamic systems or time-varying rela-tionships. Dynamic Bayes networks (DBNs) are directed acyclic graphs that generalize the power-ful stochastic mechanisms of Bayesian represen-tation to temporal sequences. We are free to ex-plicitly provide topological (i.e., dependency) re-lationships between relevant variables in our mod-els, which can include measurements of tract data.
We examine two baseline systems. The first is the standard acoustic hidden Markov model (HMM) augmented with a bigram language model, as shown in figure 3(a). Here, W t  X  W t + 1 represents word transition probabilities, learned by maximum likelihood estimation, and Ph t  X  Ph t + 1 represents phoneme transition probabilities whose order is explicitly specified by the relation-ship W t  X  Ph t . Likewise, each phoneme Ph con-ditions the sub-phoneme state, Q t , whose transi-tion probabilities Q t  X  Q t + 1 describe the dynam-ics within phonemes. The variable M t refers to hidden Gaussian indices so that the likelihoods of acoustic observations, O t , are represented by a mixture of 4, 8, 16, or 32 Gaussians for each state and each phoneme. See Murphy (2002) for a fur-ther description of this representation.

The second baseline model is the articulatory dynamic Bayes network (DBN-A). This augments the standard acoustic HMM by replacing hidden indices, M t , with discrete observations of the vo-cal tract, K t , as shown in figure 3(b). The pattern of acoustics within each phoneme is dependent on a relatively restricted set of possible articulatory configurations (Roweis, 1999). To find these dis-crete positions, we obtain k vectors that best de-scribe the articulatory data according to k -means clustering with the sum-of-squares error function. During training, the DBN variable K t is set ex-plicitly to the index of the mean vector nearest to the current frame of EMA data at time t . In this way, the relationship K t  X  O t allows us to learn how discretized articulatory configurations affect acoustics. The training of DBNs involves a spe-cialized version of expectation-maximization, as described in the literature (Murphy, 2002; Ghahra-mani, 1998). During inference, variables W t , Ph t , and K t become hidden and we marginalize over their possible values when computing their likeli-hoods. Bigrams are computed by maximum like-lihood on lexical annotations in the training data. Figure 3: Baseline systems: (a) acoustic hidden Markov model and (b) articulatory dynamic Bayes network. Node W t represents the current word, Ph t is the current phoneme, Q t is that phoneme X  X  dy-namic state, O t is the acoustic observation, M t is the Gaussian mixture component, and K t is the dis-cretized articulatory configuration. Filled nodes represent observed variables during training, al-though only O t is observed during recognition. Square nodes are discrete variables while circular nodes are continuous variables. Our first experimental system attempts speech recognition given only articulatory data. The true state of the tract variables at time t  X  1 constitutes a 9-dimensional vector, x t  X  1 , of continuous val-ues. Under the task dynamics model of section 2.1, the motions of these tract variables obey crit-ically damped second-order oscillatory relation-ships. We start with the simplifying assumption of linear dynamics here with allowances for random Gaussian process noise , v t , since articulatory be-haviour is non-deterministic. Moreover, we know that EMA recordings are subject to some error (usually less than 1 mm (Yunusova et al., 2009)), so the actual observation at time t , y t , will not in general be the true position of the articulators. As-suming that the relationship between y t and x t is also linear, and that the measurement noise , w t , is also Gaussian, then the dynamical articulatory system can be described by
Eqs. 2 form the basis of the Kalman filter which allows us to use EMA measurements di-rectly, rather than quantized abstractions thereof as in the DBN-A model. Obviously, since artic-ulatory dynamics vary significantly for different goals, we replicate eq. (2) for each phoneme and connect these continuous Kalman filters together with discrete conditioning variables for phoneme and word, resulting in the switching Kalman fil-ter (SKF) model. Here, parameters D t and v t are implicit in the relationship x t  X  x t + 1 , and param-eters C t and w t are implicit in x t  X  y t . In this model, observation y t is the instantaneous mea-surements derived from EMA, and x t is their true hidden states. These parameters are trained using expectation-maximization, as described in the lit-erature (Murphy, 1998; Deng et al., 2005). Our goal is to integrate task dynamics within an ASR system for continuous sentences called TD-ASR. Our approach is to re-rank an N -best list of sentence hypotheses according to a weighted like-lihood of their articulatory realizations. For ex-ample, if a word sequence W i : w i , 1 w i , 2 ... w has likelihoods L X ( W i ) and L  X  ( W i ) according to purely acoustic and articulatory interpretations of an utterance, respectively, then its overall score would be given a weighting parameter  X  set manually, as in section 6.2. Acoustic likelihoods L X ( W i ) are ob-tained from Viterbi paths through relevant HMMs in the standard fashion. 5.1 The TADA component In order to obtain articulatory likelihoods, L  X  ( W i ) , for each word sequence, we first generate artic-ulatory realizations of those sequences according to task dynamics. To this end, we use compo-nents from the open-source TADA system (Nam and Goldstein, 2006), which is a complete imple-mentation of task dynamics. From this toolbox, we use the following components:  X  A syllabic dictionary supplemented with  X  A syllable-to-gesture lookup table. Given  X  A component that produces the continuous The result of the TADA component is a set of N 9-dimensional articulatory paths, TV i , neces-sary to produce the associated word sequences, W i for i = 1 .. N . Since task dynamics is a prescrip-tive model and fully deterministic, TV i sequences are the canonical or default articulatory realiza-tions of the associated sentences. These canonical realizations are independent of our training data, so we transform them in order to more closely re-semble the observed articulatory behaviour in our EMA data. Towards this end, we train a switch-ing Kalman filter identical to that in section 4, ex-cept the hidden state variable x t is replaced by the observed instantaneous canonical TVs predicted by TADA . In this way we are explicitly learning a relationship between TADA  X  X  task dynamics and human data. Since the lengths of these sequences are generally unequal, we align the articulatory be-haviour predicted by TADA with training data from MOCHA and TORGO using standard dynamic time warping (Sakoe and Chiba, 1978). During run-time, the articulatory sequence y t most likely to have been produced by the human data given the canonical sequence TV i is inferred by the Viterbi algorithm through the SKF model with all other variables hidden. The result is a set of articulatory sequences, TV  X  i , for i = 1 .. N , that represent the predictions of task dynamics that better resemble our data. 5.2 Acoustic-articulatory inversion In order to estimate the articulatory likelihood of an utterance, we need to evaluate each trans-formed articulatory sequence, TV  X  i , within proba-bility distributions ranging over all tract variables. These distributions can be inferred using acoustic-articulatory inversion. There are a number of ap-proaches to this task, including vector quantiza-tion, and expectation-maximization with Gaussian mixtures (Hogden and Valdez, 2001; Toda et al., 2008). These approaches accurately inferred the xy position of articulators to within 0 . 41 mm and 2 . 73 mm. Here, we modify the approach taken by Richmond et al. (2003), who estimate proba-bility functions over the 2D midsagittal positions of 7 articulators, given acoustics, with a mixture-density network (MDN). An MDN is essentially a typical discriminative multi-layer neural network whose output consists of the parameters to Gaus-sian mixtures. Here, each Gaussian mixture de-scribes a probability function over TV positions given the acoustic frame at time t . For exam-ple, figure 4 shows an intensity map of the likely values for tongue-tip constriction degree (TTCD) for each frame of acoustics, superimposed with the  X  X rue X  trajectory of that TV. Our networks are trained with acoustic and EMA-derived data as de-scribed in section 2.2. 5.3 Recognition by reranking During recognition of a test utterance, a standard acoustic HMM produces word sequence hypothe-ses, W i , and associated likelihoods, L ( W i ) , for i = 1 .. N . The expected canonical motion of the tract variables, TV i is then produced by task dynamics Figure 4: Example probability density of tongue tip constriction degree over time, inferred from acoustics. The true trajectory is superimposed as a black curve. for each of these word sequences and transformed by an SKF to better match speaker data, giving TV  X  i . The likelihoods of these paths are then eval-uated within probability distributions produced by an MDN. The mechanism for producing the artic-ulatory likelihood is shown in figure 5. The overall likelihood, L ( W i ) =  X  L X ( W i ) + ( 1  X   X  ) L  X  ( W then used to produce a final hypothesis list for the given acoustic input. Experimental data is obtained from two sources, as described in section 2.2. We procure 1200 sentences from Toronto X  X  TORGO database, and 896 from Edinburgh X  X  MOCHA. In total, there are 460 total unique sentence forms, 1092 total unique word forms, and 11065 total words uttered. Ex-cept where noted, all experiments randomly split the data into 90% training and 10% testing sets for 5-cross validation. MOCHA and TORGO data are never combined in a single training set due to dif-fering EMA recording rates. In all cases, models are database-dependent (i.e., all TORGO data is conflated, as is all of MOCHA).

For each of our baseline systems, we calcu-late the phoneme-error-rate (PER) and word-error-rate (WER) after training. The phoneme-error-rate is calculated according to the proportion of frames of speech incorrectly assigned to the proper phoneme. The word-error-rate is calculated as the sum of insertion, deletion, and substitution er-rors in the highest-ranked hypothesis divided by the total number of words in the correct orthogra-phy. The traditional HMM is compared by vary-ing the number of Gaussians used in the modelling System Parameters PER (%) WER (%)

 Table 2: Average log likelihood of true tract vari-able positions in test data, under distributions pro-duced by mixture density networks with varying numbers of Gaussians. of acoustic observations. Similarly, the DBN-A model is compared by varying the number of dis-crete quantizations of articulatory configurations, as described in section 3. Results are obtained by direct decoding. The average results across both databases, between which there are no significant differences, are shown in table 1. In all cases the DBN-A model outperforms the HMM, which highlights the benefit of explicitly conditioning acoustic observations on articulatory causes. 6.1 Efficacy of TD-ASR components In order to evaluate the whole system, we start by evaluating its parts. First, we test how accurately the mixture-density network (MDN) estimates the position of the articulators given only information from the acoustics available during recognition. Table 2 shows the average log likelihood over each tract variable across both databases. These re-sults are consistent with the state-of-the-art (Toda et al., 2008). In the following experiments, we use MDNs that produce 4 Gaussians. W i produced by standard acoustic techniques. Table 3: Average difference between predicted tract variables and observed data, on [ 0 , 1 ] scale. (*) Nasals are evaluated only with MOCHA data, since TORGO data lacks velum measurements.

We evaluate how closely transformations to the canonical tract variables predicted by TADA match the data. Namely, we input the known orthography for each test utterance into TADA , obtain the pre-dicted canonical tract variables TV , and transform these according to our trained SKF. The resulting predicted and transformed sequences are aligned with our measurements derived from EMA with dynamic time warping. Finally, we measure the average difference between the observed data and the predicted (canonical and transformed) tract variables. Table 3 shows these differences accord-ing to the phonological manner of articulation. In all cases the transformed tract variable motion is more accurate, and significantly so at the 95% con-fidence level for nasal and retroflex phonemes, and at 99% for fricatives. The practical utility of the transformation component is evaluated in its effect on recognition rates, as described below. 6.2 Recognition with TD-ASR With the performance of the components of TD-ASR better understood, we combine these and study the resulting composite TD-ASR system. Figure 6: Word-error-rate according to varying  X  , for both TORGO and MOCHA data.
 Figure 6 shows the WER as a function of  X  with TD-ASR and N = 4 hypotheses per utterance. The effect of  X  is clearly non-monotonic, with articula-tory information clearly proving useful. Although systems whose rankings are weighted solely by the articulatory component perform better than the ex-clusively acoustic systems, the lists available to the former are procured from standard acoustic ASR. Interestingly, the gap between systems trained to the two databases increases as  X  approaches 1 . 0. Although this gap is not significant, it may be the result of increased inter-speaker articulatory varia-tion in the TORGO database, which includes more than twice as many speakers as MOCHA.
 Figure 7 shows the WER obtained with TD-ASR given varying-length N -best lists and  X  = 0 . 7. TD-ASR accuracy at N = 4 is significantly better than both TD-ASR at N = 2 and the base-line approaches of table 1 at the 95% confidence level. However, for N &gt; 4 there is a noticeable and systematic worsening of performance. Figure 7: Word-error-rate according to vary-ing lengths of N -best hypotheses used, for both TORGO and MOCHA data.

The optimal parameterization of the TD-ASR model results in an average word-error-rate of 8 . 43%, which represents a 10 . 3% relative error re-duction over the best parameterization of our base-line models. The SKF model of section 4 differs from the HMM and DBN-A baseline models only in its use of continuous (rather than discrete) hid-den dynamics and in its articulatory observations. However, its performance is far more variable, and less conclusive. On the MOCHA database the SKF model had an average of 9 . 54% WER with a standard deviation of 0 . 73 over 5 trials, and an average of 9 . 04% WER with a standard deviation of 0 . 64 over 5 trials on the TORGO database. De-spite the presupposed utility of direct articulatory observations, the SKF system does not perform significantly better than the best DBN-A model.
Finally, the experiments of tables 6 and 7 are repeated with the canonical tract variables passed untransformed to the probability maps generated by the MDNs. Predictably, resulting articulatory likelihoods L  X  are less representative and increas-ing their contribution  X  to the hypothesis rerank-ing does not improve TD-ASR performance sig-nificantly, and in some instances worsens it. Al-though TADA is a useful prescriptive model of generic articulation, its use must be tempered with knowledge of inter-speaker variability. The articulatory medium of speech rarely informs modern speech recognition. We have demon-strated that the use of direct articulatory knowl-edge can substantially reduce phoneme and word errors in speech recognition, especially if that knowledge is motivated by high-level abstrac-tions of vocal tract behaviour. Task dynamic the-ory provides a coherent and biologically plausible model of speech production with consequences for phonology (Browman and Goldstein, 1986), neu-rolinguistics (Guenther and Perkell, 2004), and the evolution of speech and language (Goldstein et al., 2006). We have shown that it is also useful within speech recognition.

We have overcome a conceptual impediment in integrating task dynamics and ASR, which is the former X  X  deterministic nature. This integration is accomplished by stochastically transforming pre-dicted articulatory dynamics and by calculating the likelihoods of these dynamics according to speaker data. However, there are several new av-enues for exploration. For example, task dynamics lends itself to more general applications of con-trol theory, including automated self-correction, rhythm, co-ordination, and segmentation (Fried-land, 2005). Other high-level questions also re-main, such as whether discrete gestures are the correct biological and practical paradigm, whether a purely continuous representation would be more appropriate, and whether this approach general-izes to other languages.

In general, our experiments have revealed very little difference between the use of MOCHA and TORGO EMA data. An ad hoc analysis of some of the errors produced by the TD-ASR system found no particular difference between how sys-tems trained to each of these databases recognized nasal phonemes, although only those trained with MOCHA considered velum motion. Other errors common to both sources of data include phoneme insertion errors, normally vowels, which appear to co-occur with some spurious motion of the tongue between segments, especially for longer N -best lists. Despite the relative slow motion of the ar-ticulators relative to acoustics, there remains some intermittent noise.

As more articulatory data becomes available and as theories of speech production become more refined, we expect that their combined value to speech recognition will become indispensable.
