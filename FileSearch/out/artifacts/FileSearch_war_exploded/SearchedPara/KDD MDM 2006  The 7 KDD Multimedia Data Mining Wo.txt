This report ou tlines the motiv ations to hold the workshop, the response we have receiv ed in terms of paper submissions an d participations , as well as th e post-workshop events. Th e cen tral th eme of th is year X  X  MDM workshop is to merge m ultim edia and dat a m ining rese arch tog ether to explo it th e synerg y between the two areas to advan ce and promote the research and d evelopm ent in multim edia da ta m ining. Th e workshop was extremely su ccessf ul. Th e f eedback we hav e received during and after the workshop was overwhelmingly positive, which indicat es th e em erging int erest an d enthusi asm on the topi c of m ultim edia d ata mining in the relat ed rese arch com munities. Due to th is fac t, w e pl an to con tinu e this seri es next year. Multim edia D ata Mining, Multim edia , Da ta Min ing. The 7 th Workshop on Multimedia Data Mining was held in Philadelph ia, P A, USA, on 20 August 2006 in con junction with ACM KDD 2006. The pr evio us six workshops were h eld in conjunction with KDD 2000 (Bos ton, MA), KDD2001 (San Francisco, CA), KDD 2002 (E dmonton, Canada), KDD 2003 (Washington, D C), KDD 2004 (S eattle, WA), and KDD 200 5 (Chicago , IL), r espectiv ely . Th ese workshops b rought togeth er num erous exper ts in the fo llow ing fi elds: spa tial d ata an alysis, digita l m edia, m ultim edia info rmation r etrieval , dat a m ining and knowledge discover y in multime dia d atab ase s ystems, and anal ysis of da ta in co llabor ativ e virtual env ironm ents. Pa rticipan ts were p leased with th e workshops and th ere was consensus about the n ecessit y to continue th is an nual meeting , w here res ear chers , both from the acad em ia and industr y, cou ld exchang e an d compare both relatively m ature and green house theor ies, methodologies, algorithm s and fram eworks for m ultim edia dat a mining. This year X  X  w orkshop focused on the th eme of mergin g multim edia and data m ining research toget her to explo it th e synerg y between the two areas to promote and adv ance the research on m ultim edia d ata m ining. Multimedia and data mining are two v ery interdiscip linar y and m ultidisc ipli nary areas with independ ently and simultan eously rapid dev elopm ents in re cen t years . M any succes sful ex am ples hav e be en s een to addr ess a series of pr essing issues, in exploring and explo iting th e s ynerg y between both ar eas. This ph eno menon is par ticu larly true in many applic ations tha t ca ll for efforts tha t com bine the res earch from both areas under the them e of Multim edia Data Min ing. Thi s workshop aims at d edicating to the research on this theme with the purpos e to advance and disseminate th e m ost r ecen t res earch under th is theme. It is wel l known that m ultim edia inform ation is ubiquitous and is often requ ired , if not essent ial, in m any applica tions. This phenom enon has m ade m ultim edia reposi tories widespread and extrem ely large . Th ere ar e tool s for m anag ing and sear ching useful knowled ge em bedded within m ultim edia coll ect ions is becoming pres sing and central for man y decision-making applic ations . F or ex am ple, it is highly desirable fo r dev eloping the tools n eeded tod ay for discoveri ng relationships between obj ect s or segm ents within im ages, classif ying images based on their content, extr acting patterns in sound, categor izing speech an d music, and recog nizing and tra cking objects in vid eo streams. Data mining r esearch today has been advanced far bey ond the data coll ected in fields such as ar t, des ign, h ypermedia and d igit al media production, case-b ased reasoning an d computational modeling of cr eativity , includ ing evolutionar y computation , an d medical m ultim edia dat a. These exotic f ields use a vari ety of data sources and s tructures , int errelat ed b y th e nature of th e phenomenon that th ese structures de scribe. As a result there is an increasing interest in new technique s and tools that can detect an d discover pattern s that lead to new knowledge in the prob lem dom ain where the da ta hav e b een coll ected. There is als o an incre asing int erest in the an alysis of m ultim edi a data genera ted by differen t dis tributed appli cat ion s, s uch as co llaborativ e v irtu al environm ents, vi rtual com muniti es, and m ulti-ag ent s ystem s. Th e data collected f rom such envir onm ents include a re cord of the actions in th em, a variety of doc um ents th at ar e part of th e business process, as ynchronous thread ed discussions, trans cripts from sy nchrono us communications and other data r ecords. These heterog eneous multim edia d ata records requ ire sophisti cated preprocessing, s ynchronization and oth er tr ansformation procedures befor e ev en m oving to the an alysis stage. On the oth er han d, rese arch ers in multim edia infor mation s ystem s, in the search of techn iques f or improving the index ing an d retrieval of multimedia info rmat ion, ar e look ing f or new methods for discover ing indexing informati on. Variety of techniqu es from machine l earn ing, stat istics , da tabases, knowledge acqu isition , data vis ualiza tio n, im age anal ysis, high perform ance com puting , and knowledg e-based s ystems, ha ve been used mainly as a research h andcr aft activi ty. Th e d evelopm ent of m ultim edia datab ases and their qu ery int erfaces re cal l again the id ea of incorpora ting multim edia dat a m ining m ethods for d ynam ic indexing . Th e em erging int ernationa l stand ard for m ultim edi a content descr iption (MPEG-7) promis es to fos ter the coll aborat ion in th e field givin g a un iform data represen tation. The n ext step for successful KDD applicatio ns will certainly involve both fiel ds (Multim edia and Dat a Minin g). Actual ly, it is well known that r eal world applic ations often hav e data with multiple m odal ities, from m ultipl e sour ces and in m ultipl e form ats . F or ex am ple, in hom eland s ecur ity app lica tions , we m ay patterns , photo pictures , and vid eotapes from surv eillance cameras in th e airpor t. In the m anufa cturing domains, b usiness processes can be improved if, for example, part draw ings , part descrip tio ns and p art flow can be mined in an integrated way instead o f separately. In me dicine, a disease might be pred icted mor e accur ately if the M RI (m agnetic res onanc e im aging) im ager y is mined together with oth er information abo ut th e patient's multiple form ats . W hile m ining on struc tured da ta or each type of modalit y of m ultim edia da ta suc h as tex t data, imager y da ta, and video data has been broad ly add ressed, ther e has not b een much effort focusing on integrated approaches to mining info rmatio n from m ultiple m odalit ies, m ultipl e sources and m ultipl e form ats. Consequently , it is important to ha ve this workshop to dedicate to this em erging th em e as a venu e to advance and disseminate the most recent res earch on this the me. At the beg inning , we were v ery aggr essive to ad vertise this yea r X  X  workshop in soliciting pap er submissions. In order to furth er promote the paper submissions to this workshop, we secur ed a special issue [1] of IE EE Tr ansac tions on Multim edia on the sam e topic of Multim edia D ata Min ing open for the best pape rs from the workshop. A s a result, we rece ived 22 submissions in total for this workshop relevant to the cen tral theme o f th e workshop. In order to s ecure a h igh q ualit y rev iew, we form ed an interna tiona l pro gram com mittee consisting of 25 int erna tiona lly renowned exp erts with strong ex per tise in th e r elated area. Since this was a wor kshop instead o f a well-estab lished confer ence, during th e review process we pa rticul arl y p aid att ention to encourag ing papers with nov el ideas (ev en w ithout ex tensive evalu ation d ata). E ach p aper r eceiv ed as leas t two anon ymous reviews. As a r esult, we accep ted 9 p apers as long pap ers, 7 papers as short papers, and 2 papers as posters. Two pap ers withdrew for various reasons and two oth er p apers were declined based on n egativ e rev iews. The participatio n into th e works hop this year was overwhelming. The workshop r oom was always almost full d uring th e whole program , and w as com pletel y full with m any atten dees standing in the ba ck durin g the inv ited speech . W e re ceived in tota l 6 8 registrations for this workshop. This is a record-breaking number over th e whole workshop series which indicates th e emergin g interest and enthusiasm on the t opic of multimedia data minin g am ong the r elated resear ch com munities. The program consists of three oral presen tation sessions, on e poster presen tation session, and an invited speech session. The first oral ses sion was on vi deo mining. Th is s ession had thr ee long presen tatio ns: Mining motion patterns using color motio n map clustering , Mining app earance models directly from compre sse d v ideo , a nd A no vel video annotation method b y integrating visual featur es and frequent patterns , and two shor t presentations: Counting p eople using video cameras an d Ontologies for video dig ital libra ries . The second or al session was on mi ning methods. This session had two long pr esen tations: Adaptive offset subs pace self organizin g map with an ap plicat ion to han dwritten d igit recognition and A spatial semi-su pervised learni ng method for classification of multi-spectral remote sensin g imagery and thr ee short presenta tions: Discovery o f latent pa tterns with hierarchical Bayesian mixed membership models and the issue of model choice , Clustering by random projec tions: app lication to image segmentation , and Visual data mining: integ rating machin e learning with information visualization . The third or al session was on image mining. The session had fou r long pr esentatio ns: Improving image anno tations using fuzzy pruning and association rule mining , A probabilistic model with multi-modal reinforcement fo r outli er det ection in image database , Image classifi cation b y a probabilist ic model learned from imperfect training data on the W eb , and Document image retrieval using symbolized b ounding box and two short presenta tions: Integrating hyp erbolic imag e browsing towards an integrated multimedia na vigato r and An hybrid approach for semantic information retri eva l u sing multimedi a data . Due to th e tigh t program sched ule, th e poster session was held during the lunch hour and consisted of two pr esentations: Using closed captions and visual featu res to classify movies b y genr e and App lica tion of the MACLAW algorithm for b ands selection in hyperspectral im ages . Major Am y Magnus, PhD, from US Ai r Force Of fice of Scien tific Research kind ly accepted our inv itation to speak in the workshop. She gave the inv ited pr esenta tion at the workshop enti tled Mining for landmarks: introducing n ew lo cal environments to a g lobal network . The pr esentat ion wen t extr em ely we ll with the who le workshop room full with th e aud ience. Th is b ecame the h ighligh t of the workshop. We gratefully th ank Am y for her time and effor t to deliver ing th is wonderful speech.
