 Nowadays the Web represents a huge heterogeneous data source. The rapid growth of and gives the seed for the data of the schema; then writes extracting rules to indicate and web pages relevant to the schema by crawling. SESQ provides a highly efficient data can be further analyzed by some analytical tools (such as OLAP) . 
There are a number of approaches in the literature that have similar objectives. For example, Lixto [1] , Araneus [ 2 ], Object-Web wrapper [ 3 ], Xyleme [4],etc. Comparing search engine, the tasks of searching, extracting and querying can be configured with one uniform script language [ 6 , 7 ]. the system, then give the methods to model, find and extract data, followed by a de-proposal with our plan of demonstration. As shown in Figure 1, SESQ consists of four major parts: Search Agent, Data Extrac-data from the Web automatically and format them as XML file. The Storage Manager gives an efficient access interface for the data. The Query Processor provides a n inner query engine for the data, and allows end users to present query through an interactive interface. cepts, attributes and relationships between the concepts. Herein, we use an example schema constructed for the domain of research paper. posed by concept instance, attributes and re lations between concept instances. Given a limited amount of seeds, the crawler will expand to all related instances ideally. how to extract the information from these pages. specific topic according to content analysis, for example, using vector space model to corresponding extractor works successful. We adapt a method that mixing the meta-search engine and query expansion to locate the proper pages from the web[7]. data sources. SESQ system has the ability to build both data-source orient wrapper for our approach is to provide a graph model language called GQML (Graph Query and Manipulate Language) for users to present the required data schema and providing a powerful, easy-to-use and flexible facility to describe the extraction rules [6]. interactive interface for end user to represent the complex query requests over a tree like view simplified from the concept schema. 
The initial query screen shown in Figure 3, provides the user with a list of concepts in the system. Assume the query is "To find papers that reference a paper written by Mendelzon", in this example, the attribut e AuthorName of the second concept PAPER will be chosen, and the constraint, AuthorName contains "Mendelzon" is entered. 
Because of the data collected from the Web are under a specified schema, SESQ can customize advanced analysis, such as OLAP analysis. For example, the system is able to show the trend of a research area in terms of number of published papers in the area, or the changing of a researcher X  X  interests, etc. demonstration, we will demonstrate the main functions of the system, including:  X 
The construction of domain specific search engine. We will demonstrate the rules.  X 
The Concept Expansion Process. We will demonstrate how the number of con-cepts grows from one seed by sequence of concept expansion.  X 
User query formation and execution . We will show how the user represents request through the interactive interface by several examples.  X  development and change of researchers X  interests along time lines.
