 The bottleneck for dictionary-based cross-language information re-trie val is the lack of comprehensi ve dictionaries, in particular for man y dif ferent languages. We here introduce a methodology by which multilingual dictionaries (for Spanish and Swedish) emer ge automatically from simple seed lexicons. These seed lexicons are automatically generated, by cognate mapping, from (pre viously man-ually constructed) Portuguese and German as well as English sources. Le xical and semantic hypotheses are then validated and new ones iterati vely generated by making use of co-occurrence patterns of hypothesized translation synon yms in parallel corpora. We evalu-ate these newly deri ved dictionaries on a lar ge medical document collection within a cross-language retrie val setting.

Cross-language information retrie val can broadly be divided into dictionary-based and corpus-based approaches [12] to find rele vant documents from dif ferent languages. Although dictionaries pro-vide explicit lexical links within and between the natural languages Cop yright 2005 ACM 1-59593-034-5/05/0008 ... $ 5.00. involv ed, for lar ge-scale retrie val purposes at least, manually built dictionaries often lack suf ficient coverage. Therefore, we propose a mechanism by which comprehensi ve dictionaries can be auto-matically set up relying on simple techniques and ready-to-use re-sources.

Our methodology emplo ys seed lexicons and parallel corpora, thus unifying once competing efforts. The seed lexicons for Span-ish and Swedish are automatically generated from (pre viously man-ually constructed) Portuguese and German as well as English lexi-cons. This step relies on cognate mapping, i.e., string-pattern-based transformations of orthographically very similar lexical forms from the source language into the tar get language (cf. Section 3). This seed is then thro wn onto parallel corpora in order to filter out valid lexical and semantic hypotheses. For this step, we focus on co-occurrence patterns of hypothesized translation equi valents in the parallel corpora. Subsequently , valid cognates contrib ute to fur -ther dictionary upgrades by iterati vely incorporating non-cognates into the lexical assimilation process (cf. Section 4). To estimate the value of dictionaries deri ved this way we test their performance on a lar ge medical document collection within a cross-language re-trie val setting (cf. Sections 5 and 6).

At the core of this approach lies the M ORPHOSAURUS 1 text pro-cessing engine (an acron ym for M ORPH eme The SAURUS ). Its in-dexing technique is particularly sensiti ve towards cross-language morpho-semantic regularities (cf. Section 2). The system is cen-tered around a new type of dictionary , in which the entries are sub-words, i.e., semantically minimal, morpheme-style units. Language-specific subw ords are link ed by intralingual as well as interlingual synon ymy and grouped in terms of concept-lik e equi valence classes at the layer of a language-independent interlingua. Our claim that this interlingual approach is useful for the purpose of cross-lingual text retrie val and cate gorization has already been experimentally supported [7, 11].
Our work starts from the assumption that neither fully inflected nor automatically stemmed words  X  such as common in man y text retrie val systems  X  constitute the appropriate granularity level for lexicalized content description. Especially in scientific sublanguages, we observ e a high frequenc y of domain-specific suf fix es (e.g.,  X -itis X  ,  X -ectomia X  in the medical domain) and numerous occurrences of comple x word forms such as  X  X seudo hypo par a thyr oid ism X  or  X  X luco corticoid s X  . 2 To properly account for these particu-larities of  X  X edical X  morphology , we introduced the notion of sub-words [20] i.e., self-contained, semantically minimal units and mo-tivated their existence by their usefulness for document retrie val rather than by purely linguistic arguments.

Subw ords are assembled in a multilingual dictionary and the-saurus, which contain their entries, special attrib utes and semantic relations between them, according to the follo wing considerations:
Compared to relationally richer , e.g., W ORD N ET -based, inter -linguas as applied for cross-language information retrie val [6, 17], we, obviously , use a rather limited set of semantic relations and pursue a more restricti ve approach to synon ymy . In particular , we restrict ourselv es to the specific language usage in the conte xt of the medical domain. We also refrain from introducing hierarchical relations between MIDs, because such links can be acquired from domain-specific vocab ularies, e.g., the Medical Subject Headings (M E SH [18, 11]).

Figure 1 depicts how source documents (top-left) are con verted into an interlingual representation by a three-step morpho-semantic inde xing procedure. First, each input word is orthographically nor -malized in terms of lower case characters and according to language-specific rules for the transcription of diacritics (top-right). Ne xt, words are segmented into sequences of subw ords or left unchanged when no subw ords can be decomposed (bottom-right). The seg-mentation results are check ed for morphological plausibility using 2  X   X  denotes the concatenation operator . 3 For instance, f head g ) f zephal,k opf ,caput,cephal,cabec,cefal OR f leader ,boss,lider ,chef g 4 For instance, f myalg g ) f muscle ,musk el,muscul g f schmerz, pain,dor g a finite-state automaton which rejects invalid segmentations (e.g., segmentations without stems or ones beginning with a suf fix). Fi-nally , each meaning-bearing subw ord is replaced by a language-independent semantic identifier , its MID, thus producing the inter -lingual output representation of the system (bottom-left). In Fig. 1, MIDs which co-occur in both document fragments appear in bold face. A comparison of the original input documents (top-left) and their interlingual representation (bottom-left) already reveals the degree of (hidden) similarity unco vered by the overlapping MIDs.
The manual construction of a trilingual dictionary and the the-saurus has consumed three and a half person years. The combined subw ord dictionary contains 59,288 entries, 5 with 22,041 for En-glish, 22,385 for German, and 14,862 for Portuguese. In an effort to further expand the language coverage of M ORPHOSAURUS by Spanish and Swedish, we wanted to reuse these already available resources for Portuguese, English, and German in order to speed up and to ease the lexicon acquisition process. This procedure can be divided into three separate steps. First, cognate pairs for sim-ilar languages such as Portuguese-Spanish, English-Swedish and German-Swedish are generated. Second, the generated lexical hy-potheses are check ed for validity considering simple corpus statis-tics. Ne xt, we use the list of already  X  X ppro ved X  cognates in order to augment, step by step, the tar get dictionaries by processing parallel corpora in terms of co-occurrence patterns of hypothesized transla-tion equi valents which are not cognate pairs. Table 1 lists the resources we used for the generation of cognates:
It is well kno wn that typologically related languages reveal sim-ilarities both at the lexical and grammatical level. With these con-siderations in mind, we pursued the idea that already available re-sources from one language might be reused to build up correspond-ing resources for another typologically related one. The language 5 Just for comparison, the size of W ORD N ET assembling the lexemes of general English in the 2.0 version is on the order of 152,000 entries ( http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/ wnstats.7WN , last visited on May 13, 2005). Linguistically speak-ing, the entries are basic forms of verbs, nouns, adjecti ves and ad-verbs. pairs we dra w on in our study are Portuguese/Spanish and En-glish/Swedish as well as German/Swedish. From the Portuguese (alternati vely , English and German) dictionary , identical and simi-larly spelled Spanish (Swedish) subw ord candidates are generated. As an example, the Portuguese word stem  X  X stoma g X  [ X  X tomac h X  X  is identical with its Spanish cognate, while  X  X ulher X  [ X  X oman X  X  (Por -tuguese) is similar to  X  X ujer X  (Spanish). Similar subw ord candi-dates are generated by applying a set of string substitution rules, some of which are listed in Table 2. In total, 44 rules for the Portuguese-Spanish pair , 19 rules for German-Swedish and 6 for English-Swedish had been formulated by medical linguists based on introspection, also using various dictionaries for heuristic guid-ance. Some of these substitution patterns cannot be applied to start-ing or ending sequences of characters in the source subw ord. This constraint is captured by a wildcard ( X  +  X  in Table 2), which stands for at least one arbitrary character .

Based on these string substitution rules and the already available (Portuguese, English, German) dictionaries, for each entry (exclud-ing affix es) from these sources, all possible Spanish and Swedish variant strings were generated. This led, on the average, to 8.8 Spanish variants per Portuguese subw ord (ranging from 2.7 for high-frequent four -character words to 355.2 for low-frequent 17-character words). Since the rule set is much smaller for German-Swedish and English-Swedish, their average is far less than for Portuguese-Spanish (cf. Table 3).

All generated Spanish and Swedish variants were subsequently compared with the tar get language word frequenc y list, pre viously compiled from the Spanish and Swedish text corpora. Where ver a (purely formal) prefix string match (in the case of stems) or an ex-act match (for invariants) occurred, the matching string was listed as a potential Spanish (Swedish) cognate of the Portuguese (alter -nati vely , English and German) subw ord it originated from. When-ever several substitution alternati ves for a source subw ord had to be considered that particular alternati ve was chosen which had the most similar lexical distrib ution in the corpora considered. Table 3: Variant Generation: For each language pair (first column),
Similarity was measured as follo ws: Let S be the source lexical item, C S the source language corpus containing n tok ens and V , ::: , V p the hypotheses generated from S that match the tar get language corpus C T , containing m tok ens. With f ( x; y ) the frequenc y of a word x in a corpus y , that particular j p ) was chosen for which was minimal. All other candidates were discarded.

As a result, we obtained a list of tentati ve Spanish (Swedish) sub-words each link ed by the associated MID to their grounding source cognate in the Portuguese (alternati vely , English and German) dic-tionary . We refer to these lists of cognate candidates as Spanish and CC SW E for Swedish.

In numbers, starting from 14,004 Portuguese, 21,705 German and 21,501 English subw ords (cf. Table 1), a total of 123,235 Span-ish subw ord variants were created using the string substitution rules. For Swedish, 145,423 variants were deri ved from German, and, additionally , 68,803 from English (cf. Table 3). Matching these variants against the Spanish and Swedish corpora and allo wing for a maximum of one candidate per source subw ord (by , possibly , applying the similarity criterion from abo ve), we identified 8,644 tentati ve Spanish and (combining English and German evidence) 6,086 tentati ve Swedish cognates (cf. Table 4). Spanish candidates are link ed to a total of 6,036 MIDs from their Portuguese corre-lates (hence, 2,608 synon ym relationships were also hypothesized), whilst Swedish candidates are associated with 4,157 MIDs from their German and English correlates (cf. Table 4).
We took adv antage of the availability of lar ge parallel corpora in the biomedical domain in order to identify false friends , i.e., sim-ilar words in dif ferent languages with dif ferent meanings. In our experiments, we found, e.g., the Spanish subw ord candidate * X  X ri-anz X  for the Portuguese  X  X rianc X  [ X  X  hild X  X  (the normalized stem of  X  X rianc  X a X  ). The correct translation of Portuguese  X  X rianc X  to Span-ish, howe ver, would have been  X  X in X  (the stem of  X  X i  X  no X  ), whilst the Spanish  X  X rianz X  refers to  X  X riac X  [ X  X r eed X  X  (stem of  X  X riac  X   X  ao X  in Portuguese).

In order to more adequately deal with such problems we incorpo-rated the Metathesaurus of the Unified Medical Langua ge System (UMLS) [19]. It contains about one million concepts (from dif-ferent biomedical terminologies) and over two million terms from various languages. (Quasi-) synon yms and translations can easily be identified as the y share the same concept identifier . Terms are phrased as single words but may also surf ace as (very) comple x noun phrases. The latter are especially pre valent in vocab ularies for disease encoding and literature inde xing. In our frame work, the Metathesaurus can thus be considered as a valuable parallel corpus. Examples for typical English-Spanish alignments it con-tains are  X  X ell Gr owth X  aligned with  X  X r ecimiento Celular X  , or  X  X eart transplant, with or without recipient car diectomy X  aligned with  X  X  rasplante car diaco, con o sin car diectomia en el receptor X  .
We use English as the pivot language for our experiments, since it has the broadest lexical coverage in the UMLS. The linkage to other languages is considerably poorer , both in qualitati ve as well as quantitati ve terms. The size of the corpora deri ved from the link-ages of the English UMLS to other languages amounts to 60,526 alignments for English-Spanish and 10,953 alignments for English-Swedish. 6 In order to determine the false friends in the set of the already generated cognate candidate pairs, CC SP A and CC the parallel corpora of the aligned UMLS expressions were then morpho-semantically processed as described in Section 2. When-ever the same equi valence class identifier (MID) occurred on both sides after this simultaneous bilingual processing, the appropriate Spanish (Swedish, alternati vely) subw ord entry that led to this par -ticular MID is tak en to be a valid entry . We think that this approach is reasonable, since it is quite unlik ely that a false friend occurs within the same translation conte xt.

Those cognates which never matched in this validation proce-dure were rejected from the candidate set. As a result, 37% of the Spanish and 26% of the Swedish hypotheses are kept (cf. Table 5). These then serv ed as the seed dictionary (in the follo wing, for acquiring additional entries, which are not cognates to elements of any of the source dictionaries.
The parallel corpora deri ved from the UMLS and the dictionaries with appro ved cognates both serv e as starting points for an iterati ve continuation of the lexical acquisition process, as described in Al-gorithm 1. In order to illustrate this process, assume the Swedish subw ord  X  X lod X  is identified as being a true cognate to the English subw ord  X  X lood X  (and, therefore, is included in L (0) ). Then, the yet unkno wn Swedish word  X  X lodtryc k X  , which has the English translation  X  X lood pressur e X  in the UMLS Metathesaurus, gets seg-mented into [ST : blod j UK: t j SF: r j UK: yck ], with ST being a mark er for a stem, SF for a suf fix and UK for an unkno wn sequence, thus satisfying the condition in line 12 of the algorithm. At the same time, the morpho-semantic normalization of  X  X lood pressur e X  leads to the sequence of MIDs [#blood #tense], whilst the normaliza-tion of  X  X lodtryc k X  leads to [#blood], since  X  X ryc k X  is not yet part of the Swedish dictionary . By comparing these two representa-tions, the condition in line 13 of the algorithm is satisfied, since there is exactly one more MID resulting from English, which can-not be found in the Swedish normalization result. The invalid seg-mentation is then reconstructed (  X  X  r yck X  ) by eliminating those substrings that led to a matching MID (  X  X lod X  ) in the aligned unit (  X  X lodtryc k X  ) (line 15). The supernumerary MID resulting from the English normalization is assigned to that remaining string (line 17 in the algorithm). After processing all UMLS alignments, this new entry is then incorporated in the Swedish dictionary as a stem, re-sulting in the dictionary L(1) (line 26).

In the next run, in which all UMLS alignments are processed once again, this newly deri ved dictionary entry may serv e for ex-tracting, e.g., the Swedish word  X  X uft X  with its identifier #aero from the UMLS entry  X  X ir Pressur e X  (English, inde xed by [#aero #tense]) 6 We focused only on the so-called preferr ed entries . link ed to  X  X ufttryc k X  (Swedish). When no new entries can be gen-erated using this method (quiescence), the algorithm stops.
Table 6 depicts the gro wth steps of the tar get dictionaries for the entire bootstrapping process (ne w entries in comparison to each pre vious step, , are in brack ets). In the first run, for Spanish, 3,587 new subw ords are added to the dictionary which leads to a size of 6,817, including those lexical entries already generated by the cognate identification routines (cf. Table 5). For Swedish, only 759 new subw ords were generated in the first step. Remarkably , these entries lead to the acquisition of 1,361 new subw ords in the next step. After 14 cycles, learning acti vities calm down with 7,154 subw ords generated for Spanish, while after 9 runs 4,148 dictionary entries for Swedish are acquired.

Our experiments were run on the O HSUMED corpus [8], which constitutes one of the standard IR testbeds for the medical domain. O
HSUMED is a subset of the M EDLINE database which contains bibliographic information (author , title, abstract, inde x terms, etc.) of life science and biomedicine articles. Because we only consid-ered the title and abstract field for each bibliographic unit, we ob-tained a document collection comprised of 233,445 texts. (115,121 out of all 348,566 documents contain no abstract and were there-fore ignored.) Our test collection is made of 41,924,840 tok ens, and the average document length is 179.6 tok ens (with a standard deviation of 76.4).

Since the O HSUMED corpus was created specifically for IR stud-ies, 106 queries are available (actually 105, because for one query no rele vant documents could be found), including associated rele-vance judgments. The average number of query terms is 5.1 (with a standard deviation of 1.8). The follo wing is a typical query:  X  X f-fectiveness of etidr onate in treating hyper calcemia of malignancy X  .
The O HSUMED corpus contains only English-language docu-ments (and queries). This raises the question of how this collection (or M EDLINE , in general) can be accessed from other languages as well. Such a consideration addresses a realistic scenario, since unlik e in sciences with English as a lingua franca , medical doc-tors adhere to their nati ve languages in their academic education and everyday practice. Hence, medical practitioners might resort to translating their nati ve-language search problem to English with the help of current Web technology , e.g., an automatic translation service available in a standard Web search engine. Its operation might be further enhanced by lexical resources such as the UMLS Metathesaurus introduced in Section 3.2. Relying on the quality of the translation, this procedure then reduces the cross-language 2: cur rent 0 3: quiescence false 4: while not quiescence do 5: the lexicon for MSI is set to L ( cur rent ) 6: the list of new entr ies is empty 8: AU 9: AU 10: MID 11: MID 13: if there is exactly one more MID in MID 14: mid supernumerary MID from MID 18: end if 19: end if 20: end for 21: if new entr ies is empty then 22: quiescence true 23: else 24: cur rent cur rent + 1 27: end if 28: end while Algorithm 1 : Bootstrapping Algorithm for Le xical Acquisition retrie val problem to a monolingual one. We tak e this approach as a frame of reference for the interlingua-based cross-language ap-proach. Both of them will then be evaluated on the same query and document set. As the baseline for our experiments, we pro-vide a retrie val system operating with the Porter stemmer [14] and language-specific stop word lists 7 so that the system runs on (orig-inal) English documents with (original) English queries.
The (human or machine) translation of nati ve-language queries (in the follo wing called QTR) into the tar get language of the docu-ment collection to be searched is a standard experimental procedure in the cross-language retrie val community [3]. In our experiments, the original English queries were first translated into Portuguese, German, Spanish, and Swedish by medical experts (nati ve speak-ers of those languages, with a very good mastery of both general and medical English). In the second step, the manually translated queries were re-translated into English using the G OOGLE LATOR . 8 Admittedly , this tool may not be particularly suited to translate medical terminology (in fact, 17% of the German, 16% of the Portuguese, and 14% of the Spanish query terms were not translated, while Swedish is not supported at all). Hence, we addi-tionally used bilingual lexeme dictionaries deri ved from the UMLS Metathesaurus with about 26,000 German-English entries, 14,200 entries for Portuguese-English, 62,687 for Spanish-English, and 7,619 for English-Spanish. 9 If no English correspondence could be found, the terms were left untranslated (this, finally , happened to 7% of the German, 5% of the Portuguese, 5% of the Spanish query terms and to 85% of the Swedish terms). Just as in the baseline condition, the stop words were remo ved from both the documents and the automatically translated queries. 7 We used the stemmer available on http://www.snowball. tartarus.org (last visited on January 2005). The incorporated stop word lists contained 172 English, 232 German, 220 Por -tuguese, 329 Spanish, and 114 Swedish entries. http://www.google.de/language tools , last visited on January , 2005 9 In contradistinction to the UMLS-deri ved parallel corpora de-scribed in Section 3.2, we here only consider word-to-w ord trans-lations.

As an alternati ve to QTR, we probed the morpho-semantic in-dexing (MSI) approach as described in Section 2. Unlik e QTR, the inde xing of documents and queries using MSI (after stop word elimination), yields a language-independent, semantically normal-ized inde x format (cf. Figure 1).
 For an unbiased evaluation, we ran several experiments with L
UCENE , 10 a freely available open-source search engine which com-bines Boolean searching with a sophisticated ranking model based on TF-IDF . Beside its ranking formula, which achie ves results that even can outperform adv anced vector retrie val systems [21], this search engine has another adv antage: it supports a rich query lan-guage, lik e multi-field search, including more than ten dif ferent query operators. In our experiments we mak e use of proximity search, which allo ws to find words within a specified windo w size. For example, given the query  X  X alar fractur e 3 X  , L UCENE documents containing the words  X  X alar X  and  X  X ractur e X  within three words distance to each other and allo ws word sw aps (e.g.,  X  X r ac-tur e of the talar bone X  ,  X  X alar bone fractur e X  ). In pre vious exper -iments, we found evidence that this feature increases the retrie val performance in any scenario, including the baseline condition [7]. Especially , the effect of considering a windo w of three items signif-icantly increases the score of clustered matches. This becomes par -ticularly important in the segmentation of comple x word forms. 11
Three dif ferent test scenarios can now be distinguished for our retrie val experiments: http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.htm l , last visited on January 2005 11 Otherwise, a document containing  X  X ppend ectomy X  and  X  X hyr oid itis X  , and another one containing  X  X ppend ic itis X  and  X  X hyr oid ectomy X  become indistinguishable after segmentation. We tak e several measurements in comparing the performance of QTR and MSI. The first one is the average of the precision values at all ele ven standard recall points (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0). These values are depicted in Figure 2 for all scenarios considered. We also cal-culate the average at the top two recall points (0.0 and 0.1). While this data was computed with consideration to the first 200 docu-ments under each condition, we also calculated the exact precision scores for the top five and top 20 rank ed documents.

As sho wn in Table 7 (first row), the English-English baseline reaches 0 : 2 precision on the 11pt average. We also ran an experi-ment where we MSI-inde xed the original O HSUMED corpus. This boosted the 11pt average to 0 : 22 . Clearly , this approach cannot be tak en as the baseline condition, since it confounds the notion of baseline with that of experimental conditions. It is interesting though, because it reveals some of the potential of MSI for (medi-cal) inde xing.

The German-English MSI result is almost on a par with the base-line (0.01 less (0.19)), whereas the German-English QTR result drops by 0 : 08 points ( 0 : 12 ). This means that the MSI approach achie ved 95% of the baseline performance (quite a high score given CLIR standards), whereas the QTR approach scored far lower (60%), resulting in a 35 percentage points dif ference between the two ap-proaches. This dif ference turns out to be less dramatic, but still noticeable, in comparing the Portuguese-English MSI and QTR re-sults with the baseline (78% for MSI and 52% for QTR, hence, 26 percentage points dif ference). Certainly , this result is not due to any particularities of the Portuguese language, but rather , to the une ven investment of effort in the dif ferent lexica (the size of the Portuguese subw ord dictionary has only two thirds of the corre-sponding German and English ones; cf. Section 2). For Spanish, QTR precision averages 40% of the monolingual baseline ( 0 : 08 whilst 69% of the baseline is reached for MSI ( 0 : 14 ). This is cer -tainly a significant win given that the Spanish dictionary was built in a fully automatic way.

The Swedish results, howe ver, are far less shin y. MSI achie ves 27% of the baseline for the 11pt measurement. Disappointing as this data might be, this can be explained by a lack of data and resources. The Swedish dictionary has less than 60% the size of the Spanish one (cf. Table 6). Moreo ver, the similarity between Swedish and English or German is much lesser than between Span-ish and Portuguese. Data sparseness is even more painful for the QTR condition because we were unable to find a Web tool for the translation of Swedish to English and relied on the English-Swedish UMLS entries only . Ho we ver, re-considering this out-come, the adv antages of the subw ord approach become even more evident. The Swedish subw ord dictionary for MSI was generated by the automatic morpho-syntactic transformation of the Swedish UMLS entries. On the other hand, the QTR scenario was com-pletely based on the UMLS without any transformation. Since Figur e 2: Pr ecision/Recall Graphs for the English-English baseline, (first) German-English (second), Portuguese-English (third), Spanish-English (fourth) and Swedish-English (fifth) Swedish (just as German) is a highly agglutinati ve language, trans-lating subw ords rather than comple x single-w ord compounds yields a much higher coverage. Hence, considering 2% of the baseline for Swedish QTR, even 27% constitute a solid figure of merit.
Interesting from a realistic retrie val perspecti ve is the average gain on the top two recall points. In Table 7 (second row), the German-English MSI condition achie ves a precision of 0 : 41 of the baseline), the Portuguese-English condition yields a preci-sion value of 0 : 36 (80% of the baseline). For Spanish, still 78% of the monolingual baseline precision is reached, whilst Swedish yields 30%.

Medical decision-mak ers are more often interested in a few top-rank ed documents. Thus, the exact precision scores for these docu-ments are more indicati ve of the performance of the two approaches in such a standard medical retrie val conte xt (see Table 7, third and fourth row). MSI exceeds QTR by 14-15 percentage points for Ger -man, 9-10 percentage points for Portuguese, even 21-25 percentage points for Spanish, and 13 percentage points for Swedish, consid-ering the top 5, as well as top 20 rank ed documents, respecti vely .
The success of dictionary-based CLIR depends on the cover-age of the dictionary , tools for conflating morphological variants, phrase and proper name recognition, as well as word sense disam-biguation [13]. For medical terminology , as well as for other sub-languages, non-specialized multilingual lexicons (based on W N
ET ) or commercial machine translation systems offer limited sup-port only [6, 16]. We optimize the lexical coverage by limiting the dictionary to semantically rele vant subw ords of the medical domain. This also helps us in dealing with morphological vari-ation, including single-w ord decomposition. The latter is a very common phenomenon, especially in German and Swedish (medi-cal) terminology and cannot be suf ficiently treated by dictionary-free techniques. This partially explains the poor results for Ger -man in the S APHIRE medical text retrie val system which uses the UMLS Metathesaurus for semantic inde xing [9]. The UMLS, to-gether with W ORD N ET , is also the lexical basis of the approach pursued by the (medical) M UCH M ORE project [22]. Here, concept mapping occurs after various steps of linguistic pre-processing, in-cluding lemmatization.
 Eichmann et al. [3] report on CLIR experiments for French and Spanish using the same test collection as we do (O HSUMED the UMLS Metathesaurus for query translation, achie ving 71% of baseline for Spanish and 61 % for French. With the vector space en-gine the y emplo y, their overall 11pt performance (0.24) is slightly abo ve the one for the search engine we use (0.20). This, howe ver, does not compromise our results since our experiments are aimed at comparing the performance of two dif ferent CLIR methods and not at comparing dif ferent search engine architectures. Moreo ver, the search engine we emplo y is more in line with current clinical and Web retrie val engines and the requirements the y have to fulfill.
We consider automatic lexicon acquisition techniques to be a key issue for any sort of dictionary-based efforts in IR, CLIR in partic-ular . Most approaches to multilingual lexical acquisition emplo y statistical methods, such as conte xt vector comparison [5, 15, 23, 2] or mutual information statistics [4] and require a seed lexicon of trusted translations. Koehn and Knight [10] deri ved a seed lex-icon from German-English cognates which were selected by using string similarity criteria.
 The second issue concerns the processing of suitable corpora. Whilst Widdo ws et al. [23] deal with parallel German-English cor -pora to enrich an existing multilingual lexicon (also tak en from the UMLS Metathesaurus), Fung and Yee [5], Rapp [15] and D  X  ejean et al. [2] propose methods that require only weak er comparable cor -pora (cf. also Fung [4] for a linguistically moti vated distinction be-tween both types of corpora). Furthermore, D  X  ejean et al. [2] incor -porate hierarchical information from an external thesaurus [18] for combining dif ferent evidence for lexical acquisition. Cheng et al. [1] as well as Zhang and Vines [24] propose co-occurrence-based methods to automatically extract word translations from mix ed-language texts which are dynamically made available trough com-mon Web search engines.

Our work dif fers from these precursors in man y ways. First of all, we propose a basically symbolic method for acquiring transla-tions of subw ords, instead of using statistics. This is made possible by the availability of relati vely lar ge and well aligned parallel cor -pora, as pro vided by the UMLS Metathesaurus. Finally , rather than acquiring bilateral word translations, our focus lies on assigning subw ords to interlingual semantic identifiers.
We have sho wn that a significant amount of Portuguese, English and German subw ords from the medical domain can be mapped to Spanish and Swedish cognates by simple string transformations. With these seeds, we further enlar ge the Spanish and Swedish cog-nate dictionaries by subw ords which are not cognates. For the lat-ter task, we used an aligned corpus, the UMLS Metathesaurus, and identified those non-cognates via bootstrapping.

In what concerns the generality of our approach, we rely on lar ge aligned thesauri. Fortunately , lar ge-co verage multilingual thesauri Thesaurus # Languages Subject Euro voc 13 European Communities GEMET 19 acti vities: science, UNESCO 3 politics, law, culture, OECD 4 economics, etc.

Table 8), both in terms of the number of languages being covered and the number of alignment units available (e.g., about 5 million for Eurodicau-tom). Hence, this approach bears high potential for CLIR tasks.
In order to assess the value of what we have done, we tested the usefulness of the newly deri ved dictionaries on a medical document collection. We achie ve a remarkable benefit for German documents by reaching 95% of the English baseline for German. The results for Portuguese are weak er (78%) but this can be attrib uted to the current underspecification of the Portuguese dictionary . Remark-ably , based on fully automatically generated dictionaries, the inter -lingua approach yields 69% for Spanish, while only modest 27% result for Swedish. Still, the limits we observ e can be attrib uted to the lack of data and resources (corpora, Web translation engines) rather than to the methodology we propose.
