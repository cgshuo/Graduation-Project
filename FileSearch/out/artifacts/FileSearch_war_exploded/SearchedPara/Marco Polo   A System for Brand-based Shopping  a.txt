 In today's world, brand based shopping is popular especially in product lines like clothing and shoes, appliances, and electronics. Because of the importance of brands while shopping, it has become important for online shopping portals to consider brand loyalty and brand preferences of user s. In this paper, we describe a system designed for brand-base d shopping and exploration. The system is built by analyzing a large query set consisting of 115M queries from eBay.com  X  a vibrant marketplace with more than 95M active users. The system a llows brand-pivoted exploration of inventory. It allows exploration and purchase of substitute branded goods (e.g. Sony camco rder for Canon camcorder) and complementary branded merchandise (e.g. Lego castle set for Lego train station set).

Brand based shopping, eComme rce, query log mining, recommender systems Brand based shopping is popular especially in product lines like clothing and shoes. There have been studies which show that even at brick and mortar stores like Wal-Mart and Costco, consumers expect brand-speci fic recommendations from sales personnel for merchandise like Te levision sets. Online shopping is a market worth billions of dollars and a signification portion of online sales are around branded merchandise. Some online shopping portals like shopping.com also have special interfaces to shop by brands. Because of the importance of brands while shopping in general, it has become important for online shopping portals to consider brand loyalty [2] and brand preferences of users. In CIKM 2008 [1], we described how query relationships can be inferred from user activity in a high volume industrial setting. We build upon this work to create a system for brand-based shopping and exploration. The sy stem combines principles from log analysis, information filtering and recommendation systems. We take this approach as it is si mple, scalable and allows us to capture interests for substitute and complementary branded merchandise. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such system that allows users to look at a large inventory collection of more than 175M items by pivoting on brand relationships. For a brand loyal user pivoting on the brand Guess, the system would show all the different Gu ess products on sale ranging from dresses to handbags and bags. The system would also show alternative brands related to handbags and bags like Bebe, Coach, Ralph Lauren and others. The architecture of our modular system is shown in Figure 1. The different components and implem entation techniques used to The user interface for brand-based shopping and exploration is described in section 4. In order to build the brand based explorer, firstly we need to create a set of brands for different domains. We refer to the top-level categories in the eBay category structure 1 like Clothing, Shoes &amp; Accessories, Electronics, etc. as domains. We start with a seed list that is created editorially and then apply data mining techniques to expand the seed list using distributional similarity measures [3] over query logs. Here we obtain a seed set of brands for each of the domains from automatically. Three sample categories for which such seed brands were obtained, and a few of those seed brands are shown in Table 1. http://listings.ebay.com/ This information was combined w ith other existing data sources like synonym dictionaries to map the brands to a possible list of its spellings (e.g. Dolce and Gabanna was mapped to D &amp; G). A handful of human editors are not able to provide the names of thousands of different brands whic h might be available for sale. Therefore, after the seed brand lists are obtained from the domain experts we mine more brand names using the seed list. We use a large corpus of user queries from click-stream logs for this purpose. 
Table 1 some top level domains and some sample brands as Category Name Some seed brands The query corpus includes queries with advanced operators in them. Users entering the queries could explicitly specify conjunction, disjunction, phrase match or negation in queries. Typically, brand queries involving multiple brands would specify brands through these operators. Entitie s that are of the same type tend to get queried through disjunctive queries. For brand mining we look at such queries. These queries would be of the form are interested in. Some example queries are shown below in Table 2. The disjunctive portion would be a disjunction of various terms. It can be described as terms and st i ' are the non brand name terms in the disjunctive query. We only look at disjunctions which have at least one seed brand in them and where

(gucci, seiko, pulsar) watch -paolo  X  X orus (callaway, ping, jones) hybrid iron 5 We find terms that occur together frequently with seed brands and these are candidates for expanding th e brand set. Two thresholds are determined heuristically; the minimum number of co-occurrences min Co and minimum co-occurrence percentage min Copct . Co-occurring terms found together less than min Co times are removed from the candidate list. Similarly if out of all disjunctions in which the terms were found, the percentage of disjunctions in which the terms co-occurred is less than min Copct then that candidate brand is not considered. After applying these thresholds, some examples of brands that we discovered in this way are shown in Table 3. 
Mining. Bold fonts indicate false positives. Italicized fonts Seed Brand Brands Discovered (Co-occurrence % with As shown above in Table 3 there might be some occasional false positives detected using this method. How we correct for those is described in the rest of section 2.1.4. For e.g. given a seed brand Coach, if we find queries of the form Coach shoes, Coach wallets... and also of the form Prada shoes, Prada wallets..., we could infer Pr ada as being a brand similar to Coach. We use distributional similarity techniques over such patterns to identify brand candidates. More details around the similarity measure used for pattern mining are omitted here because of space constraints. Some brands discovered by applying this algorithm are shown in Table 4. 
Table 4 Table indicating brands discovered through pattern mining in queries. Bold fonts indicate false positives and the Seed Brands Candidate Brands Discovered Each of the techniques described in section 2.1.3 and in this section 2.1.4 lead to some fals e positive brand names. However by using both techniques together and keeping only brands detected using both techniques we are able to expand the seed brand list with acceptable recall and precision as evaluated by domain experts. We mined cl ose to 1000 high quality brands using this method. We mine the intelligence of users from the query logs to infer relationships amongst queries. Th en we use the relationships amongst queries to understand asso ciations between brands and categories. Query relationship mining is described in section 2.2.1. Section 2.2.2 describes typical item categorization structure. In section 2.2.3 we de scribe how user queries could be mapped to the categorization structure of products on sale. As we describe in [1], Semantic Query Network Builder uses an ensemble of algorithms to find semantic relationships amongst queries and build a relationship graph. The relations are calculated mainly based on collaborative filtering of user searches. We use collaborative filtering over user search behavior and not transactional activity ( People who bought this also bought that) because looking at search behavior is indicative of preferences for substitutable as well as co mplementary goods, whereas complementary goods. (E.g. a person might search for Samsung TV and then search for Toshiba TV, LG TV and TV wall mounts, whereas a person who just bought a Samsung TV is less likely to buy another TV). On eBay, sellers are required to categorize the products they are domains of such a structure as meta-categories. We refer to the lowest level categories in the tree in which the items are put up categories on eBay. One such branch in the structure is Clothing, Shoes &amp; Accessories  X  Costumes &amp; Reenactment Attire  X  Costumes  X  Infants &amp; Toddlers. Here Infants &amp; Toddlers is the leaf category in which a seller can list an item for sale. Using user behavioral data we build a probabilistic query to category classifier M that can map any query q to a vector of categories and weights. As an example, the query  X  X pod X  might get mapped to MP3 Players = 70%, Chargers=10%, Batteries=10% and Other=10%. The brand indexer filters the semantic query network based on the mined brands. The resulting network ( N ) contains only query relationships pertaining to branded merchandise intent. 
N relates different queries associated with some brand B . We map all queries in their respective category vectors as described in section 2.2.3. As N only has relationships between brand intent queries and also as we map every query to its category vector, we thus transform a query  X  query relationship to a brand: category  X  brand: category relationship. For example, an edge between queries guess xs and bebe xs in Brand:Guess(Men X  X  Clothing:0.889, Women X  X  Clothing:0.458) Clothing:0.994). This gives us an index of rela tionships between different Brand vectors in category dimensions and the strength amongst them. We normalize these relationships to get linkage between different Brand: Category combinations. Some such relationships are shown in Table 5. 
Table 5 Brand &amp; Category Based Recommendations. Scores Relationship between Brand:Category pairs Score As seen in Table 5 above, the rela tionships could be for substitute brands in the same category or for the same brand but different categories of products. After pruning low quality relationships, the brand exploration inde x has around 1000 brands and 15000 brand relationships. The algorithms used to build Semantic Query Network and project it onto brands and categories are easily parallelizable as we show in [4] and hence scalable. For qualitative evaluation, the rela tionship data was validated by human experts. Highest ratings were obtained for domains like Clothing whereas average ratings were obtained for categories like Musical Instruments which have a lower query volume. recommendations to eBay users based on the brand exploration index. The recommendations were shown to around 500,000 users. Users were shown r ecommendations from alternative brands when they lost an auction on a branded item. This is similar to the preferred brand out-of-stock case in the offline shopping world. The CTR varied from 1% to 20% based on different categories. For e.g. in Toys &amp; Hobbies the CTR was around 10%. These CTR are much higher than baseline CTR of 0.5%. The interface was developed in Flex and allows relationship exploration for brands like Google Wonder Wheel does for http://labs.ebay.com/demos/brands/. The entry point for a user is selection of a domain she is inte rested in. Various domains like Baby Products, Camera &amp; Photo, Motors, Cell Phones &amp; PDAs, Clothing Shoes &amp; Accessories and many others are supported in this interface. Once the domain is selected, a set of relevant brands for the domain are shown to the user. Then, as shown in Figure 2, a user can pick a category (e.g. clothing, shoes and accessories) and a brand that she has in mind, and the system will show all the sub-categories (e.g. wallets, shoes, sweaters, bags, sunglasses) available on sale fo r that brand. The center node indicates the brand and other nodes in the star network indicate different kinds of products. In the exploration interface all nodes are color coded (yellow, green, red, blue) with yellow being the less popular nodes and blue being the most popular. A user can then proceed to buy the items (for e.g. Figure 4 highlights the items shown when a user browses for DKNY wristwatches) for a given brand and category or double click on any of the category nodes to explore further. The exploration could be for substitutable brands and also complementary branded merchandise. For example, a user could explore alternate brands for Handbags as shown in Figure 3 by double-clicking on the node. One demonstration scenario is desc ribed here. A user interested in buying a Marc Jacobs sweater can start by selecting the Clothing, Shoes &amp; Accessories domain and Marc Jacobs brand from the drop-down. It would bring up options to look at Marc Jacobs brand in the Sweaters category as well as related categories for which the Marc Jacobs brand is popular like bags, wallets, shoes, blazers and shirts. Once the user selects Marc Jacobs sweaters, the user can also explore alternate brands like J. Crew, Gap and Banana Republic as shown in Figure 5. During the demonstration, when the user is exploring brands, matching inventory from any of the 175M+ products on eBay site would be shown to the user. Purchases of branded products form a large part of Gross Merchandise Volume for online s hopping sites. Allowing users to shop by brands can be a big win fo r these sites. We demonstrate a novel brand exploration and shopping system built using collaborative filtering of user searches. thickness of the edges indicates the amount of similarity between
