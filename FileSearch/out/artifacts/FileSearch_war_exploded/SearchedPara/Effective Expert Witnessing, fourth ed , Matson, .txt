 Effective Expert Witnessing, fourth ed., Matson, Jack V., Daou, Suha F., Soper, Jeffrey G. CRC, 160 p., $99.95, ISBN: 0849313015
Certainly, today X  X  society, especially in the US, is litigious. Popular press articles are routinely pointing out the increase in lawsuits. Whether or not one agrees with the trend, it is now more common than ever that aca-demic researchers will be called upon to serve as expert witnesses for court cases, lawsuits, and other legal pro-cedures. This is especially true in the information technology areas, as more and more aspects of our life become dependent on or at least linked to technology.

As such, active academic researchers in the technical fields should expect to be an expert witness at some time during their career. Being an expert witness and providing expert testimony is drastically different than presenting research results at an academic conference or leading a session in a college course. As with other new adventures or challenges in life, one must prepare to be an effective expert witness.

Effective Expert Witnessing by Matson, Daou, and Soper is an excellent resource for the novice and more experienced expert witness. At 160 pages, the book is not daunting, and one can peruse it in a relatively short amount of time, which is good. If one is not familiar with the court system and legal process, a discussion of the same can get confusing. A thicker book on the US legal process may be too much to take for the non-lawyer.

The book is 160 pages divided into three sections. Section I, The Legal Environment and Expert Witness-ing , is 32 pages divided into three chapters. The first chapter lays the ground work of the current legal environment in the US. The second chapter presents a more detailed overview of the key cases and precedents affecting expert witnessing. The third chapter takes a closer look at the impact of the Daubert case. This section was interesting, but it was not a practical section for those just interested in being effective. However, it did lay the groundwork of what the court system is expecting of an expert witness.

Section II, The Litigation Process , is 52 pages consisting of three chapters. The first presents the pre-trail process. The second chapter concerns preparing for trial. The third chapter illustrates the drama of the court-room. This section was more helpful and down to earth. I found the discussion of the pre-trail process extre-mely helpful. I believe more  X  X  X eal X  X  examples would be even more helpful (i.e., example depositions, script for the discovery process, a pre-trail preparation checklist).

Section III, The Art , Business , and Future of Expert Witnessing , is 31 pages and is two chapters. The first discusses the art of expert witnessing and how to be effective. This chapter was also very good. The second chapter concerns the business aspect of expert witnessing, including fees and expenses. The business aspect of expert witnessing is a minefield in itself. Here again, some concrete examples would be a very good addition, such as sample invoice for billing.

There is an appendix of exert witness resources pointing to directories, newsletters, and listservs and a bio-graphy of just over 50 references.

The book contains a CD with a video, just less than one hour in length, of a  X  X  X ewbie X  X  involved in his first expert witnessing and the lead author responding to questions from the newbie. During the conversation with the newbie, the lead author presents video clips of  X  X  X ood X  X  and  X  X  X ot good X  X  dispositions from two expert wit-nesses. I was hesitant at first to view the video on the CD. One never knows the value of this supplementary material. However, I found it extremely beneficial. It fact, I believe it one of the most helpful portions of the book package.

Again, I would have liked even more supplementary material, including examples of written dispositions, invoices to clients, example fees, discovery process, etc. contained on the CD or within the book. I believe that this type of supplementary material would be extremely beneficial for new expert witnesses. Finally, more strategy and tactics on maneuvering the rather tricky initial negotiations with retainers, billings, and expecta-tions from the clients would add to the book X  X  value.

Overall, I found the material in the book very helpful and would recommend it for those involved in being an expert witness. Cryptography, Information Theory, and Error-Correction a Handbook for the 21st Century, Aiden A. Bruen, Mario A. Forcinito. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (2005). $95, ISBN: 0-471-65317-9
Cryptography is an exciting field of knowledge that deals with secure transmission of data on public chan-nels. It has found many applications in the digital era and has attracted some of the greatest minds of the world. Many good books on cryptography and cryptographic protocol are available and more are being writ-ten. The field of information theory is also very important and highly applicable area. As pointed out by
Thomas M. Cover and Joy A. Thomas in their famous book, Elements of Information Theory , that informa-tion theory is all about computing ultimate compression and computing maximum possible data rates on a communication channel. The theory of error-correcting codes deals with the error free transmission of messages on noisy channels. Therefore, all the three fields, obviously, deal with transmission of messages and are interrelated.

Cryptography, Information Theory and Error-Correction is an excellent introduction to the three interrelated fields. As pointed out in its preface, the book is intended to provide a complete but highly accessible account of the three subjects and their interconnection . The presentation of the material by Bruen and Forcinito is very attractive and easy to follow. It is infact highly accessible even for an undergraduate student. The book contains 24 chapters and is naturally divided into three parts, one each for the three main topics.
The first eight chapters discuss the basics of cryptography and constitute the first part of the book. The next nine chapters are devoted to the discussion of information theory and its applications and the last 7 chapters contain the theory of error correcting codes and the algorithm proposed by the authors.

Part I of the book starts with a brief introduction of cryptography and the biography of Claude E. Shan-non, and it then goes on describing the classical enciphering techniques (like Caesar and Vigenere ciphers), symmetric key and public key cryptosystems (like RSA, DES and AES), different security protocols (like
SSL, PGP and GPG), the ideas of digital signatures, hash functions, key exchange and key management sys-tems like Kerberos. Elliptic curve cryptography and different cryptanalysis techniques are also included in this part. This section ends with a brief discussion of some practical issues, including technical, commercial and legal aspects in the development of practical systems.

First 5 chapters in this part are very well written. The authors have demonstrated good presentation and teaching skills in these chapters. The description of RSA in chapter 3, DES rounds in chapter 4 and AES transformations in chapter 4 are interesting and easy to follow. Although a complete chapter is devoted for
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) but the treatment of various uses of ECC is not as detailed. Given that most of the resent research in mathematics went into the study of elliptic curves (as described by the authors in the book) the material given in this chapter is very brief. Most of the chapter is devoted to describing the group structure provided by the elliptic curves and in introducing the details of arithmetic operations defined on an elliptic curve.

Like ECC, a full chapter is devoted to the description of cryptanalysis techniques. Given that cryptanalysis is one of the most interesting parts of cryptography, the level of detail given in this chapter does not seem to be
