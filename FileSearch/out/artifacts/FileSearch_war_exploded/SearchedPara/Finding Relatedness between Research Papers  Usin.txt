 The problem which we need to solve is that we want to identify related documents by Similarity and dissimilarity factors are related to contents of research papers: such as Similarity can be defined on basis of concept discussed by Lin [1], according to which similarity between two documents can be represented on basis of three factors: commonality, difference and identity. Aslam et al. [2] have worked on pair wise object similarity using this information theoretic approach of similarity. 
Problem of detecting related documents is helpful in finding the documents which are similar to a document specified in a query provided by some user in an techniques focus on textual contents of documents and are further categorized as word based [3] and sentence based [4, 5, 7] similarities. Different methods used for content coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficien t which are used by Huang [3]. Lee et al. [6] evaluated different content based similarity measures with human way of finding similarity. between the documents. 
Key components of our proposed approach to find the relatedness between documents using pair wise similarity are described below: 1. Contents of research papers such as title and abstract of research papers were used. 2. Keywords/terms from contents of research papers were extracted. 3. Terms/keywords with exact match were found from two papers in comparison. 4. Synonyms were found for each keyword/term extracted from research papers in comparison. 5. Set of synonyms which were common to two research papers in comparison found. 6. Difference sets of synonyms for two research papers in comparison were found. 7. All these measures were normalized to compute a relatedness measure between two research papers in comparison. We have found that results of our technique were encouraging when compared to those of previously available content based similarity measuring techniques. Our proposed technique X  X  system architecture is shown in Fig. 1, according to which PaperA and PaperB represent two documents for which we need to compute document relatedness. Term extractor is used to extract terms from titles and abstracts of PaperA and PaperB. These terms are named as TermSetA and TermSetB. Synonym Finder is finding synonyms for each of terms in TermSetA and TermSetB by using a publicly available synonyms dataset, list of these synonyms are labeled as SynListA and SynListB respectively. CSS (Common Synonym Set) Finder and DSS (Difference Synonym Set) Finder is taking both SynListA and SynListB as input and provides SimMeasure (Similarity Measure) and DissimMeasure (Dissimilarity Measure) as output. These measures are passed to a normalization function NormF which provides document relatedness measure between PaperA and PaperB. DBLP. Results of proposed system were compared with document relatedness measures computed by human rators. These human rators were provided with a pre defined document relatedness rating criteria to provide a document relatedness measure in form of numeric values between 0 and 1, as shown in Table 1. 
Results computed by human rators for research papers used in our experiment were compared with results of our proposed technique. Fig. 2 shows these comparisons which were very encouraging for proposed technique. 
As is obvious from Fig. 2 that document relatedness computed by using proposed technique had some differences from the measures computed by human rators. Table that our proposed technique was producing results which were comparable with other techniques, specifically KLD (Kullback-Leibler Divergence). We have proposed a new approach for finding relatedness between the document by using similarity and dissimilarity factors in a combined way which represents novelty of our idea. We have found that our technique was encouragingly comparable to other previously available content based similarity measuring techniques. There was some limitation in our technique that it was based on word level analysis of text of research papers in comparison, not doing anything with sentence structure. 
In future, we are planning to work on identification of relationships between words occurring in a sentence or paragraph using co-occurrence relationships to improve the similarity measure accuracy of our technique.
