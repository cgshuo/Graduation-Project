 1. Introduction The Vaughan Williams Memorial Library (VWML) is a small specialist library hosted by the English Folk
Dance and Song Society (EFDSS) in their headquarters in North London. The library was established at the beginning of the 20th century and has developed an important archive based on unique collections of notebooks and manuscripts donated by members of the society including Ralph Vaughan Williams and Cecil phase of their ongoing digitisation programme by putting some of their catalogue online, accompanied by images and information on key collectors.

This study uses Nicholas X  X  (2000) framework to investigate the information needs of the current and poten-gests broad design requirements for future improvements to its digital library (DL) system. As well as relevance, which are discussed.

The Digital Library and Information Seeking and Retrieval literatures typically deal with academic or pro-to small, specialist libraries and their users. 2. Background 2.1. Information needs and human information behaviour
Wilson (1981) discusses the enormous problems of defining  X  X nformation need X  and how  X  X nformation X  (or olas (2000) , who recommended examining the following factors when investigating user needs: subject, func-digm (1986) in information retrieval (IR) research, and models of information need such as Belkin et al. X  X   X  X nomolous State of Knowledge X  (ASK) (1982) , which focuses predominantly on the user X  X  problem statement and does not take account of the context from which the user derives their need. More recent user-centred research focuses on human information behaviour (HIB) and cognitive approaches ( Chowdhury, 2004 ).
The influential models in HIB either focus on the problem itself ( Wilson X  X , 1994 , problem solving model) ISP).

Dervin and Nilan X  X  (1986) Sense-Making approach called for a focus on information seekers. They pro-individual may lead to discovery of more  X  systematic underlying features X  (2005, p. 63). are: Starting, Chaining, Browsing, Differentiating, Monitoring and Extracting. He found that generally this order is followed when individuals are seeking information although he stated that this may vary. Ingwersen not related to external causes and because the order of the characteristics cannot be predicted.
Kuhlthau (1991) examined thoughts and feelings during the  X  X nformation search process X  and found six relate to uncertainty caused by the information need, leading to doubt and confusion, which changes, as able for more complex than routine tasks.

Wilson (1999) combines the models of these key researchers to produce a  X  X lobal model X  of information behaviour. This model shows how information seeking is part of a context-based feedback loop and Ingwersen and Ja  X  rvelin (2005) find it to be  X  X  rich source of hypotheses X .

Ingwersen and Ja  X  rvelin (2005) propose a unified information seeking and retrieval model which aims to and places that model with various contexts which affect information behaviour. They propose nine variables rithms which concern indexing, representation and matching); IR interfaces; access and interaction.
These models and approaches focus on the problem itself, affective needs or the process of information seeking and user behaviour. Nicholas X  framework is used as the basis for this research because it proposes mation need in its own right. Butterworth and Davis Perkins (2005) observed and described information behaviour within Vaughan Williams Memorial Library, but it was felt that an understanding of need would give us a more fundamental picture. Although observing information behaviour within the library was inter-incarnation. The emphasis of Nicholas X  framework on need rather than behaviour makes it the appropriate conceptual tool for this research. Lastly, the broad nature of Nicholas X  X  framework makes it an ideal tool for identifying issues to be followed in further research. 2.2. MIR, evaluation and relevance
Like work in Information Retrieval generally, the work of the Music Information Retrieval community to date has focussed mainly on systems. In an attempt to change the paradigm in MIR research from systems-view of how the system would want them to form their requests, Cunningham (2002) recommends investigat-
MIR community is currently focussed on creating a TREC-like evaluation scenario to give credibility and focus to user studies in this area ( Lee &amp; Downie, 2004; Downie, 2003a; Downie, 2003b; Cunningham, 2002 ). Prompted by a number of important research questions, Downie (2003b) describes how he and col-leagues are building a MIR testing database so tests can be done on the same database to improve generalis-and answer session than a traditional TREC topic statement and he calls on the community to join this  X  X uman Use of Music Information Retrieval Systems X  (HUMIRS) research stream.

Some of the MIR community have followed the recommendations of Wilson and Belkin to use qualitative research methods when examining user needs. These studies have examined how music users have expressed their needs on the internet. Queries made to Google Answers were coded and grounded theory was used to reational users organise their music collections ( Cunningham, Reeves, &amp; Britland, 2003 ).
It is not easy to measure the effectiveness of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems because of the affective nature of the documents which are being sought. It is important that there is an agreement of the problems. Kuhlthau (1991) noted that relevance judgements change as users move through the process of oped knowledge. Some aspects of the challenging concept of musical relevance were examined in this study. 2.3. What is folk music?
It is important to show how folk music differs from other genres such as classical or popular music, as we
This definition was not ideal (many songs are more personal than communal) and owing to the commercial nature of music and entertainment there needed to be a reflection of this. During the 1960s Folk Revival in
Britain, Lloyd discussed the 1954 definition by the International Folk Music Council (IFMC):
This definition allowed the inclusion of popular songs that had been absorbed into communal tradition (as long as they have been changed over time) as well as music that springs from the community. The key is the tradition.
 ate to study this area as different issues may arise in information needs for folk music. 2.4. The Vaughan Williams Memorial Library
By making its catalogue and additional supplementary information available online the VWML is making rial, to aid preservation and improve accessibility. The bulk of the recordings are now digitised and cata-logued. However the recordings are not available online and users wishing to hear the digitised material efits the library more by preserving the collection than helping to increase the audience. firstly make the catalogue available for searching. One step on this path was made when the library website was launched in May 2006 as  X  X WML Online X  ( VWML Online, 2006 ). This service reflects the way the folk called the  X  X oud Folk Song Index X  after its creator Steve Roud ( VWML Online, 2006 ). Additional website biographies of the collectors, and numerous bibliographies. 3. Methodology
The core of our study is a set of intensive semi-structured interviews. The structure for the interviews is shown in Appendix A .

Observation and intensive interviews have been found to be the most valuable methods in user studies it was felt that user interviews (and not observation) were sufficient.
 interview them, and then analyse the interviews in line with Nicholas X  framework. 3.1. Selecting interviewees
The library and its hosting organisation hold several sources of information about actual and potential users. Library and organisational membership records were studied as well as previous library use surveys and the library visitors X  book. From this initial study four broad user groups were determined: Performer ( musician/singer/dancer/actor/student/composer ) Academic ( teacher/lecturer/student/school ) Professional ( journalist/ media researcher/record company/historian/concert promoter ) Enthusiast ( recreational user/shopper/music consumer )
These were as mutually exclusive as possible although crossover was inevitable owing to the fragmented
Ten users and potential users of VWML were interviewed. These users were selected in an attempt to rep-resent all user groups and some potential users. On consulting the EFDSS membership database it was found users. In order to reflect the user groups established above, the librarian was asked to recommend two Per-formers, two Academics, and two Professionals, and was also interviewed himself. The potential users were the Enthusiast criteria. 3.2. Conducting the interviews
The interviews, each of which lasted between 30 and 45 min, attempted to cover three key areas in the ses-sions: how the respondents define and solve their problem; what words the respondents use to describe the Why? X  X ,  X  X  X hat aspects do you learn about? X  X ,  X  X  X o you get this from one source or more than one? X  X ,  X  X  X escribe a problem you might have involving some aspect of folk music and how you would go about solv-ing it? X  X  3.3. Analysis
The answers were then transcribed directly into a table based on Nicholas (2000) framework for evaluating sidered: job, country/culture, personality, information awareness, gender, age, time availability, access, resources/costs, information overload.

There were therefore two avenues of investigation: the library X  X  records (including previous surveys), and method X  approach ensuring validity and reliability of results. 4. Results 4.1. Demographics
During the interviews some demographic characteristics were drawn out of the participants as these were 1 . Amongst the user group, there were two Performers, two Academics and three Professionals. The potential 4.1.1. Job
The job, whether it is Performer, Academic or Professional, partly determines whether or not the library is back along a path created by references made in interviews and sleeve notes. The Enthusiast then used local libraries and record shops until they had satisfied that ASK. Many of them went on to visit VWML. Subse-quently they became further involved, as Performers, Academics or Professionals. While potential users are more Enthusiasts than anything else, one of them had an ongoing regular professional interest in the disci-pline, working in live music. The other two were Enthusiasts who used this interest to develop small areas trated by the interviews in this study, determined by specificity. 4.1.2. Research experience
There was a wide level of Research Experience amongst the sample. This revealed a significant point. Those necessary on this level apart from social and conceptual.

Key areas for consideration in design of the online service, therefore, should be: variable search techniques, with online support; entry points reflecting the way Enthusiasts are  X  X ulled in X  by commercial recordings; contact with librarians; a forum for networking. 4.2. Nicholas X  framework
The main interest in our work comes from assembling the results of the interviews onto Nicholas X  (2000) framework and then using these results to propose design requirements for a DL system. 4.2.1. Subject in specifying the subject are all relevant to this part of the study.

There was found to be a comprehensive clear emphasis on the keywords: songs, tunes, texts, manuscripts, ballads, collectors, instrumentals, composers: songs and folk literature. One respondent stood out by solely naming interpreters of songs. Requests ranged from broad to specific:
While the more experienced users were happy to do their own searching based on their personal knowledge
Potential users sought additional information more specific to their work role, such as contact details of new groups, or specific sound recordings. 4.2.2. Function
Function is described by Nicholas as the use to which the information is put and can be fact-finding, cur-rent awareness, research, briefing, or stimulus. The overall function was found to be to aid the users in informed communication with others by teaching, performing, research for publication or proselytising. The users and the potential users therefore all act in some way as promoters of the discipline to the wider community. The performers use information for research and stimulus and stand out from the sample as not the information they seek. An example of this stimulus or inspiration came from one of the potential users:
Current awareness and briefing are not seen as being so important although a potential user said: 4.2.3. Nature/description formers required more methodological information, such as 4.2.4. Intellectual level between the users, who stated a need for specialist information: whereas the potential users seemed to require more general information on folk: 4.2.5. Viewpoint by the information provider or creator of the document will be a factor in whether or not the information haps their viewpoint could be described as  X  X raditional establishment X .

However the potential users all focused more on the performers, because they are closer to the Enthusiast entry point: point, which is expressed by the name of the service. 4.2.6. Quantity
Nicholas describes how the quantity of information required to solve a problem varies between groups, individuals and by type of need. While some needs can be satisfied by one document, other users may wish of as much information as possible to satisfy their needs:
It was noticeable that users wish to take the information home once they have got it, for reasons of timing and distance, or because of the need to spend quiet reflective time with songs for example. 4.2.7. Quality/authority
While Nicholas recommends a good understanding of the information producer is required in order to eval-understanding. Users want an  X  X fficial X  version or the unique artefact and rely on those they perceive as experts. on mainstream media, another focuses on the participants own points of view, while a third X  X  research will take him to many sources, often referring to the establishment: 4.2.8. Date/currency
The date the information originates, and how up-to-date it is, will vary with need. As this is partly a historical discipline some of the information held by the VWML dates back to the 17th century and it also has current materials such as recordings and magazines. Although this was not often discussed in any detail, the preferred date of information is implied by comments made by the subjects. For instance if they information must come from the beginning of the 20th Century although the sources would date back to the middle of the 19th so we place that at 1850  X  this would include the Performers, and Professional/jour-nalist, who are examining the material from 1850 onwards. The Academics refer to Shakespeare or Broad-sides and need information from the 17th Century onwards, as will the Professional/librarian. Referring to lapsed users) are in this group: one, from the live music industry, focuses mainly on the here and how and would most probably not be interested in any information for business purposes from before 2000, although if he were to decide to do some personal research he may find himself changing his needs to the 1850s or even earlier. Another, writing a book on folk music, concentrating on the 1960s folk revival, would focus mainly on the 1960s onward although he will look at 1850s onward in less detail. Others need recorded sound to proselytise or stimulate so are stuck at around 1900 when early sound recordings were possible. 4.2.9. Speed of delivery
The length of time the user expects to wait between requesting some information and being provided with it grows shorter with every new technological development and more specialist traditional services are slower than online services ( Nicholas, 2000 ).

While for some it does not appear to be an issue, speed of delivery for others is important:
Professionals and Academics stated they sometimes needed information quickly to meet deadlines:
The library seems to be flexible and able to respond to these requests: response to their requests for information. 4.2.10. Place/sources
Although Nicholas focuses on how user needs differ according to global sources of information, it was held
Archive (NSA) that although many say they are planning to use them they have not done so:
Other sources include social networks, and record sleeves and record shopping. Local libraries are men-tioned as a first port-of-call as interest in the subject develops:
Respondents start to build their own libraries when they know they are involved for the long term. Local records offices were mentioned as being invaluable sources, and the mainstream media ease of access was praised. For the users, the wide ranging sources all led back to the VWML. 4.2.11. Processing and packaging
Processing and packaging of information, or how the information is presented to the user, indicates a pref-erence amongst the current users of raw data over summarised and interpreted data, and physical documents over digital.

Potential users seem more open to digital information, but need some interpretation of the material to nation of physical (song texts in books and manuscripts) and digital information (photographs of singers, summary of biography of collectors). 4.3. Incorporating these findings into a digital library
Based on the above analysis of information need we propose the following design requirements for rede-veloping VWML X  X  digital library service. Broadly these requirements demonstrate a need for a shift in the design of VWML X  X  service from being collection-centred to user-centred. Also clear in the information need notate and recommend the online materials already available.

The challenge that VWML presents for social recommendation systems is the plethora of media in which it and intermediation by an information expert is strongly needed to help users navigate that space. the uses they can be put to, rather than a summary of their content (see also Section 4.2.2 ). suggested by Cunningham et al. (2003) .

Informed communication and stimulus would be aided by providing a digital forum which would allow ness would require some form of news page, noticeboard or RSS feed to members.
 if the library is to bring in new users it must provide general introductory information, or some graduated access in the style of  X  X raining wheels X  ( Carroll &amp; Carrithers, 1984 ) for digital libraries.
The VWML has an excellent reputation for quality and authority and this must be maintained in any digital 4.4. Other comments of interest
The two main factors for involvement were a combination of a strong emotional response to the words and moment when one stumbles across the music for the first significant time.
This leads to a need to explore this in order to find out more about it, particularly what its roots are: model whose six characteristics of information seeking (Starting, Chaining, Browsing, Differentiating, Monitoring and Extracting) are clearly discussed by one interviewee: potential user and new convert are more likely to be met. This means: providing background information (interviews, etc.); enabling browsing; providing links between sources; allowing access to sound files; providing links to other information sources.

There are three key issues raised by unsolicited user statements about their experiences of the VWML: further research. 5.1. Librarians librarian could or should be implemented is however open to speculation and is beyond the scope of this work.

Further research the library this is unlikely and should be examined in more detail in future studies.
Additionally it is felt that in particular the recommendations by Ingwersen and Ja  X  rvelin (2005) should be followed in more detail, improving the research base and connection between Information Seeking and Retrieval with particular focus on the context and examining organisational task dimension; the actor dimensions; the document dimension; the algorithmic dimensions and the access and interaction dimension.

Two other areas of particular interest would be further work on how a  X  X igital librarian X  could be imple-mented to reflect the supportive nature of a dispersed community which relies substantially on serendipity; and how information seeking and retrieval varies as a user becomes more knowledgeable and experienced in the folk discipline. 6. Conclusions
Nicholas X  (2000) framework has been used to develop a rich picture of the particular information needs of
Memorial Library. The outcome of this exercise have been positive in several ways. Firstly Nicholas X  frame-work has been shown to have value in describing the information needs of users whose motivations are some-which look at students or information professionals who tend to display a different type of enthusiasm for their subjects, and focus on the process of information seeking.

Secondly, this work supports the anecdotal evidence proposed by Butterworth and Davis Perkins (2005) forms of digital library systems to support them. This work has provided a much more detailed and clearer picture of what those forms of digital library provision are. Intermediation provided by the librarians and provision.
 of relevance, namely affective responses and  X  X ransmittability X .

Clearly many of the issues raised here could be expanded in further work. For example it would be valu-able to concentrate on performers and model their information needs in the process of developing a perfor-dipitous need.

There also needs to be work looking at the gap between the broad, high level requirements for digital library development suggested by this work and an actual development method to implement them. A longer are specifically aimed at developing online provision for small specialist libraries. Appendix A References Interview questions and how they relate to framework terms 1 What is your name?
