 Chinese civilization has been around for thousands of years, and as a result a huge China. All kinds of digital museums have been developed for them. Each of these museums maintains large digital archives of their collections. They represent an ex-tremely valuable cultural heritage resource, and yet access and exploitation of the data is constrained due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of the resource. There-fore it is highly desirable to find an avenue to integrating these distributed and hetero-geneous systems. Adding semantics and structures is a way of converting unstruc-tured information into formats suitable for machine-processing. Researches from different backgrounds have attempted to provide technical support for such a conver-sion, and ontologies are known to be able to act as effective central mediators. 
The heterogeneity of information raises several challenges for any system designed to search and retrieve information, especi ally if the system needs to provide such services to other organizations or the general public. The first and the most fundamen-tal challenge is that the metadata terms used to describe and structure collections often able. Previous approaches to this kind of problem are to choose a domain ontology reference model as the basis of a semantic framework, such as [1-3]. However solu-tions to semantic interoperability cannot be successfully implemented based solely upon one domain ontology reference model or one theoretical framework, and there are a multitude of prerequisites, including system architectures, standards &amp; proto-cols, and schema mapping rules. We learn from similar previous projects [1-3] and design our unique architecture to solve our particular problem. This project is part of a project funded by the Chinese Education Ministry which involves four simulated Local Museums in the lab of the Institute of Information Technology, Beijing Union University of China, aims to develop a system providing integrated navigation and searching capability for gallery and museum collections by adop ting an ontological approach to identifying and extracting the semantics of the concepts model. The ex-perimentations with our prototype seem to have proven that our system not only achieves anticipated goals, but also is stable and efficient. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the basic module of the architecture, paying particular attention to how CIDOC CRM model is used and how global ontology is constructed in our system. Section 3 gives a conclu-sion. We have designed the system architecture to provide integrated concept based brows-ing, retrieval and analysis of museum information. The architecture consists of three main parts: the Front layer provides an ontology browser; the Mediation layer which is also called the Semantic Web layer represents a global conceptual schema of an-tique information and maintains a mapping between the global and local schemas; and the Backend layer contains distributed Web Services and legacy databases of digital antiques. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the system. 2.1 The Mediation Layer Physically combining data into a single system may be impossible for technical, or-ganizational or economic reasons. Thus medi ation systems are used instead to feder-ate information sources, which make distributed queries possible without physically aggregating information into a single monolithic database. A typical mediation system them to participating systems. These systems reply to the mediator, which then con-solidates the results for the end user. In order to function correctly, a query mediation system has to be able to communicate with each participating system in such a way have identical data schema and may well store different levels of detail about similar objects, so the mediation system needs to be a semantic polyglot. 
The mediation layer is the key part of the system, which consists of five modules: the Global Ontology module which maintains the global ontology of our system, the Web Services UDDI module, the Schema Mapping module, the Command Redirec-tion module and Result Reassembly module. When a user issues a query based on the Global Ontology module, the query is reformulated according to schema mapping rules recorded in the Schema Mapping module, and the reformulated query is redi-rected by the UDDI module which decides the related target local museums of the query according to the Web Service registration, and then executed in the distributed Local Museums. Eventually the answer is returned to the user through the Result Reassemble module. Ontology and Reference Models for Museum Domains Ontology is a formal shared conceptualization of domains of interest providing com-mon vocabularies used for asserting and searching concepts [4]. A reference model is a useful representation to help the understanding, controlling and modeling of specific domains of interest. [5].CRM (Conceptual Reference Model) [6] is one of the cultural heritage domain ontology models [7-9], and it was developed by the ICOM/CIDOC Documentation Standards Group. It describes concepts and relations relevant to the documentation of cultural domains based on an object-oriented model. It covers a vast amount of events, artifacts and people related to museums and its scope and entities are constantly modified. Using the CRM as the basis for the mediation system's data schema makes distributed query systems much easier to design. By mapping each participating system's internal data representation to the canonical form provided by the CRM, it becomes possible to integrate and interpret data stored in otherwise in-compatible systems [10, 11]. Local Ontology Derivation and Global Ontology Construction Take a Chinese antique object for example, say Bronze Gui Vessel (Fig. 2) (From Taiwan forbidden city CD-ROM published by lee &amp; lee communications), Figure 3 shows how a local relational DB schema (left side of Fig.3) maps to the CIDOC CRM model (right side of Fig.3). 
The derivation process of a local ontology involves mappings between the CRM ontology and the DB schemas of local museums. That is, the semantics implicated inherently in the legacy DB logical structures and constraints can be explicitly derived by mapping them to the corresponding CRM classes and relations. These derived ontologies enrich the information content of original local schemas. For a mapping example of Figure 3, the collection of functions include a set of class mappings f 1(E21, R1.author), f 2(E24, R2.antique_id), and a set of derived relation mappings, e.g., f 3((P14, P108), k ) from the class mappings by reasoning about the CRM property declarations between f 1.E21 and f 2.E24 through an intermediate class E12. Based on the above mappings, we can get a local ontology defined in the semantics of CRM ontology. 
When museums derive and develop ontologies that reflect their own viewpoints of domains, queries across the entire distributed system are still impossible. Providing a global ontology merged from the derived local ontologies (distinct copy of the CRM classes and relations) can provide a global view of the distributed system. Schema Mapping Given a pair of independently created schemas and asked to translate data from the source (local DB schemas) to the target (the global ontology), we consider the schema mapping problem which seek to interpret the correspondences in a way that is consis-tent with the semantics of both the source and target schemas. We achieve this in our schema mapping module which record and implement the mapping relations between the global ontology and the local museum DB sources by a mapping tool, such as the IBM Clio schema mapping tool [12]. Such a tool imports the global ontology which is represented in an XML format and the local DB schemas into its internal representa-tions, and then accomplishes the mapping semi-automatically. 2.2 Web Services Layer Digital resources of antiques belong to di fferent Local Museums, which are distrib-uted in different regions which are normally based on different computer platforms, different data formats and different programming languages. In order to share the legacy functions over the Internet to ex ecute the reformulated query locally, we choose Web Services technology [13] to integrate these Local Museums to a single Virtual Museum. Each Local Museum acts as a service provider, and the Virtual Mu-seum visitors act as service consumers. All the Local Museums need to do is to pub-lish the existing functions as web service and register to the UDDI module which does the service registration and discovery. All the messages are sent using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) across the entire system. The following illustrates a basic process when a visitor issues a search query from the browser: 1. The Virtual Museum Visitor issues one query on the browser. 2. The query will be passed to the UDDI module to determine which services to call 3. Each corresponding Local Museum executes called Web Services and returns 4. The query result reassembly module reassembles all the returned results from In this paper we have presented the architecture of a system that enables effective searching, navigating and querying the diversity of antique information held by mu-seums and galleries. The design integrates Local Museum resources based on the CIDOC Concept Reference Model by using the Web Services technology. The archi-tecture supports concept based approaches to querying heterogeneous museums seam-lessly. Museums contain a large quantity of multimedia information including images, audio and video records, etc. In order to search the multimedia content conceptually, our next goal is to combine the main and specific aspects of MPEG-7 and CIDOC-CRM models into a single ontology for describing and managing multimedia informa-tion in museums [14].
