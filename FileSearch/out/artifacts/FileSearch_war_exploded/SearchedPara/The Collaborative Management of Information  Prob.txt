 With the rapid emergence of health information technologies (HIT) in hospitals, it is important to understand how the design of these systems affects the communication of patient information and the collaboration of hospital teams. HIT systems can provide benefits to the patient-care process [2,4,5], but they do not always address serious information probl ems. In some cases, the design and use of HIT systems can cause additional information problems [2,4]. Therefore, this qualitative study seeks to understand how hospital teams identify and manage these information problems, and how in formation problems impact the collaborative activities of the hospital team.

Hospitals are highly collaborative, information-rich environments where hospital staff rely on the availability, accuracy, and completeness of information in order to make well-informed decisions about patient care. Ho wever, hospital staff frequently encounter information problems. These information problems include wrong, outdated, conflic ting, incomplete, or missing information that may interfere with the ability of the hospital staff to do their work. Although thes e information problems have existed for some time in paper-based patient records [2], there is an increasing need to focus on information problems in electronic records. This is because of th e tremendous growth of health information technologies (HIT) in U.S. hospitals due to recent government incentives [8]. Researchers describe how HIT can provide various benefits to users [2,4,5]. However, the use of HIT also changes how hospital teams document, share, and retrieve patient information [2]. In some cases, the design and use of HIT systems can actually introduce new information problems [2,4]. If these information problems are not appropriately identified and managed, they can pose a risk to the patient-care process and to the patients themselves [2]. Although researchers have identified some of the information issues associated with HIT [1,2,4-7 ,9], this research is still limited because it focuses on the individual users of the system and does not always consider the collaborative nature of hospital teams. Therefore, my study seeks to a ddress this limitation by describing how the identification and management of information problems affects the collaborative work of the hospital teams. This research is relevant to the GROUP community because it can improve the understanding of how collaboration and system design impact the identification and management of information problems. This can then help to inform the design and use of HIT systems within hospitals. Current research primarily focuses on the causes of information problems. Researchers discuss th e challenge of designing HIT for the information-rich and fast-paced environment of hospitals. Studies show that HIT systems tend to be overly structured with rigid rules that encourage data st andardization, which can result in information problems caused by the HIT design [2]. Information fragmentation is one HIT design issue that leaves the user with incomplete patient informati on and the loss of a cohesive overview of the patient X  X  record [2,5]. Current HIT system design has also led to a variety of data entry issues including difficulty entering non-standard data, unintentional selection of default values, and data truncation [1,5 ]. Additionally, ineffective HIT design can also prevent the entry of important descriptive information by forcing the use of standardized drop-down values [1] and result in the loss of psycho-social information that is said to provide,  X  continuity of patient care...[and] a richer picture of the patient X  X  situation  X  [9:2065]. Additionally, information problems are also caused by the users themselves. For instance, users tend to copy-and-paste information from prior notes. This can lead to outdated or incorrect information being carried throughout the system [4] and it can result in  X  reducing the credibility of the recorded findings, the chart of its narrative flow and function  X  [7:495]. Delayed information entry can also result when clinicians are too busy or tightly scheduled to enter patient data into the HIT directly after seeing a patient, which can cause information in the system to be outdated or incomplete for extended periods of time [6]. This negatively affects other team members who need access to up-to-date, accurate records [2]. Therefore, this study seeks to extend this research by, not only iden tifying how information problems are identified and managed by hospital teams, but also understanding the impact that in formation problems have on the collaborative work of hospital teams. The three main research questions of this study are: RQ1: How do collaborative hospital teams identify information problems?  X  How does technology help or hinder the identification of  X  How do work practices help or hinder the identification of RQ2: How do collaborative hospital teams manage information problems?  X  How does technology help or hinder the management of  X  How do work practices help or hinder the management of RQ3: How does collaboration within hospital teams play a role in identifying and managi ng information issues?  X  How do hospital teams make each other aware of  X  How do hospital teams determine accountability for This study will use qualitative methods, including direct observations and semi-structured interviews. This methodological approach is appropriate for this study because qualitative research can provide rich, detailed descriptions of the participants X  behaviors and perceptions, and othe r HIT researchers have used it for this similar purpose [2,6,9]. The field study will be conducted in the in-patient area of a large teaching hospital in northeastern United States. I will shadow members of a hospital team (e.g., physicians, residents, nurses, so cial workers, care coordinators) and take field notes on their communication activities (e.g., spoken discussions, formal pape r or electronic documentation, informal transitional documentation). In addition, I will observe activities that involve the collaborative review of patient records, such as hand-off and discharge planning discussions. The field notes will be transcribed and revi ewed in a continuous, systematic way in order to ensure that I am capturing rich, descriptive data that address the study X  X  research questions. The observations will provide an understanding of the general workflow and local terminology, and provide specific examples of information problems that arise for the partic ipants. The observations will also help to inform the interview protocol. After I have gained a sufficient understanding of the workflow and information problems, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with the participan ts. The interview protocol will provide an opportunity to gather the participants X  perceptions of information problems, how HIT helps or hinders their ability to manage information problems, and how information problems impact their collaborative work ac tivities. The interviews will be audio-recorded, and then transcri bed for data analysis purposes. The data will then be analyzed using Braun &amp; Clarke X  X  six-phase thematic analysis approach [3]. This approach facilitates the process of becoming familiar with the data, systematically identifying codes and themes, a nd defining the common themes found across the data. I conducted a 3-month preliminary field study to understand hospital staff X  X  collaboration and use of HIT in an emergency department. Findings from this pr eliminary study showed that information problems frequently o ccur in hospitals. The various types of information problems identified by the participants included wrong, outdated, conflicting, incomplete, or missing information in the HIT, which are similar to information issues summarized in prior literature [1,2,4-7,9]. The study also identified issues encountered when trying to manage the information problems within a collaborative healthcare team where multiple people are responsible for co-managing the information. Some participants described their lack of editing rights when trying to fix information issues, as well as the conflicting and ambiguous perceptions of who is responsible for fixing the problems. For example, a social worker recalled a time when trying to fix inaccurate patient information in the system:  X  Since I cannot update it as a social worker, I try to call others to update it. But they sometimes say that it X  X  someone else X  X  responsibility. I talk to registration, but they say that it X  X  the nurse X  X  responsibility, but when I talk to the nurse, they say it X  X  not their responsibility . X  When asked if there was an unclear understanding of responsibility for th is situation, the participant responded:  X  Well, it X  X  clear to them that it X  X  not their responsibility [laughs]! But it X  X  not clear whose responsibility it is.  X  The findings also describe how managing information problems can lead to user frustration, workflow disruptions, and the use of workarounds. Therefore, the research study summarized in this paper seeks to extend these preliminary findings in order to better understand the information problems that hospital teams face. In addition, this study also plans to explore the role that collaboration plays in identifying and managing these information problems. This includes addressing accountability issu es, such as those described by the social worker in the preliminary data. I passed my dissertation proposal in January 2014 and will collect my field study data from May through September 2014. I will then analyze data and perform any follow-up data collection during Fall 2014 and Spring 2015. I anticipate defending my dissertation in Summer 2015. This research will provide a better understanding of how information problems are identified and managed by hospital teams, as well as how information problems impact the collaborative activities of the team. It will also offer socio-technical design implications fo r how HIT systems can be more effectively designed to help collaborative teams identify and manage these information problem s.
