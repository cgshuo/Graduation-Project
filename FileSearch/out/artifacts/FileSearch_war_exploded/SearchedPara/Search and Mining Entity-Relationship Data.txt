 This paper summarizes the details of the first international workshop on search and mining entity-relationship data. This workshop will bridge between IR, DB, and KM researchers to seek novel solutions for search and data mining of rich entity-relationship data and their applications in various do-mains. We first provide an overview about the workshop. We then briefly discuss the workshop program.
 H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: [Information Search and Retrieval] Algorithms, Design Entity-relationship data, Search, Data Mining
Data complexity and its diversity have been rapidly ex-panding over the last years, spanning from large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data to semantically rich available knowledge, and driven by ever increasing sophisti-cation in data management requirements. Numerous appli-cations in various domains such as social-media, healthcare, telecommunication, e-commerce and web analytics, business intelligence, and cyber-security, require new methods and tools for collecting and extracting entities and their relation-ships from unstructured and heterogeneous data sources to be transformed into useful knowledge and provide insights.
While lots of useful facts are being added on a daily ba-sis on multitude web and enterprise data sources, they are still hidden behind barriers of language constraints, data heterogeneity and ambiguity, and the lack of proper query interfaces. In addition, novel search and data mining meth-ods are required to provide expressive and powerful discov-ery capabilities, yet intuitive enough, for exploring the large amounts of entity-relationship data.

The workshop main objective is to serve as an open fo-rum for discussing the new research challenges in search and mining of large scale ER data extracted from multitude of unstructured and semi-structured data sources, driven by recent industry trends and requirements in various domains and increasing academic interest. The workshop will bring together researchers from different communities working on similar problems in the context of ER and other semantic data, allowing for cross-fertilization between areas. During the workshop, we will identify common problems and their various solution approaches in DB, KM, and IR.
The workshop has two main themes. The first is search and discovery over rich entity-relationship data and includes among others topics such as ER data collection, indexing, query languages and optimization, ranking methods, sim-ilarity and exploratory search, privacy, etc. The second is entity-relationship data mining methods and includes among others topics such ER data extraction, resolution, represen-tation, fusion, ER graph mining, etc.

The workshop programme includes three invited talks, an oral presentation, a poster session, and a panel for open discussion. Next, we provide few details about each.
The workshop has three invited talks. The first invited talk by Michael Witbrock, Vice President for Research at Cycorp, titled  X  Knowledge for/from People for/from Com-puters  X , will focus on Cycorp progress towards human/computer collaboration and reasoning-based applications.

The second invited talk by Krisztian Balog, a postdoctoral at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, ti-tled  X  Finding Related Entities  X , shall provide an overview of the TREC Entity benchmarking effort, highlight promi-nent approaches to the Related Entities Finding (REF) task, and also discuss challenges and future research directions in entity-oriented search.
 The last invited talk by David Carmel from IBM Research-Haifa, titled  X  Is This Entity Relevant to Your Needs?  X , shall discuss the notion of relevance in search over entity rela-tionship data, with a focus on the similarity and distinction between relevancy in Entity and Document search.
A total of 10 papers were submitted to the workshop, out of which 3 were accepted as full (6 page-long) papers and 3 as short (2 page-long) papers. Paper topics span from entity extraction methods to entity search and privacy. We now shortly describe each paper.
 The full paper by Athenikos [3] presents PanAnthropon FilmWorld, a direct, sophisticated entity retrieval system which extracts and derives semantic knowledge from Wikipedia. Facts are represented using domain-relevant classes, entities, attributes, and categories.

The full paper by Wijaya and Gianfortoni [6] suggests sev-eral approaches for ranking human-proposed paraphrasing verbs of Noun Compounds (NCs). A novel approach that uses a two-step process of clustering similar NCs and then labeling the best paraphrasing verb as the most prototypical verb in the cluster is presented. The authors demonstrate the potential of their approach for finding implicit relations between entities especially when the relations are not ex-plicit in the context in which the entities appear, rather implicit in the relationship between its constituents.
The full paper by Tamang [5] examines a re-ranking frame-work for the slot filling task in the context of two different settings: (1) high transparency; a few pipelines share similar resources that can be used to provide detailed intermediate and complementary results; (2) low transparency; many sys-tems use diverse resources, and serve as black boxes, absent of any intermediate results. In both settings, the paper X  X  experimental results show that statistical re-ranking can be used to effectively combine automated systems, achieving better performance than the best state-of-the-art individ-ual system and alternative combination methods. The pa-per further demonstrates the impact of its learning-to-rank framework to combine output from multiple systems, achiev-ing a lower cost than labor intensive human annotation.
The short paper by Abedjan and Naumann [1] applies as-sociation rule mining over RDF data at statement level by introducing the concept of mining configurations. A configu-ration specifies the context of rule mining (the transactions) and the target of rule mining (the items). For each configu-ration the paper describes the corresponding opportunities, capabilities, and application fields. A proof-of-concept is described using the DBpedia data set.

The short paper by Roitman and Yogev [4] presents a novel authorization model for entity search. Entity search has recently attracted the attention of many researchers from a classical IR perspective. Many discovery systems in various domains, such as social, medical, enterprise, and CRM, may benefit from exposing entity search services. Yet, many such systems may need a control on the level of in-formation sharing during retrieval time in order to answer queries of authorized users and protect privacy. Addressing this challenge, the paper suggests an authorization model for entity search, based on traditional IR concept of access control list (ACL) which can be efficiently implemented.
Finally, the short paper by Anderson et al. [2] describes a new and unique thesaurus which allows to address temporal aspects in ER search and data mining and improve context-based retrieval. The paper discusses the application of the Historical Thesaurus of English (HTE) to semantic tagging of texts from AD 700 to the current day and presents several use-cases where the power of HTE is highly exploitable.
We shall conclude the workshop with a panel, where we shall discuss open issues and advances in ER search and data mining. The panel will serve as an open stage for in-terdisciplinary collaboration for facing the emerging research challenges.
