 Giorgio Merola Abstract The paper presents a study about the gestures of athletes while reporting emotions. The study was aimed at singling out possible differences in gestural activity of athletes during the telling of their best and worst performances. To analyse the gestures a manual annotation scheme was adopted that classifies each gesture in terms of handshape, motoric structure, meaning, goal, and type. The annotation scheme allows to provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the athletes X  gestures and consequently to put forward the hypothesis that the mental images expressed by the gestures performed while re-living positive and negative experience contain not only visual and propositional but also sensory-motor and emotional components.
 Keywords Motor imagery Emotional imagery Gesture 1 Introduction The main goal of this paper is to investigate if and how gestures convey information related to emotions felt by the speaker, and if they don X  X  restrict themselves to quantifying the intensity with which the emotions are lived (Ekman and Friesen 1974 ). Therefore, we wonder if people use specific gestures to refer to their emotional states and feelings.

To face the topic of gestures in connection with emotions represents something new, because studies about multimodal communication usually focused on facial expression, while gestures are mostly studied in relation with language and to understand underlying cognitive processes (for example McNeill 1992 , 2005 ; Kendon 1986 , 2004 ; Beattie 2003 ; Goldin-Meadow 2003 ).

For this reason, we tried to frame the subject starting from generally acknowledged theoretical models of gestures and from the most important works on motor and emotional imagery, which offer interesting cues and useful knowledge, even if they are not directly related to gesture studies.

As we said, nonverbal communication of emotions was mainly studied analysing facial expressions. A great number of laboratory researches were conducted to distinguish emotions on the basis of mimic configuration and facial muscles, activated during their expression. Famous are Ekman X  X  studies on people X  X  simulation of specific emotions expression, when they lie or want to conceal their own feelings (Ekman 1985 ).

Nevertheless, already Darwin ( 1872 ) analytically studied the expression of specific emotions in different behavioural modalities, like body movements and postures. He suggested that specific nonverbal signals, including gestures, accompany different emotions like Joy, Sadness, Pride, Shame, Fear/terror/horror, Anger/rage, Disgust and Contempt . After his works, many researchers investigated the topic, but they mainly considered facial expression and vocal production, which seemed the two main nonverbal modalities that could distinguish different emotions, as emerged from many studies (Ekman 1982 ; Izard 1977 ; Scherer 1981 , 1986 ; Banse and Sherer 1996 ). 1.1 Gestures and emotions Ekman and Friesen ( 1974 ) suggested that bodily expression and gestures, differently from facial expressions, can only communicate the intensity of emotions, but not their specificity: for instance the total movement activity reflects the degree in which the emotion is experienced by the speaker.

Other studies found evidence about the possible role of gestures and body movements in distinguishing discomfort and anger from sadness (Camras et al. 1993 ).

Up to 1998, besides clinical observations about specific muscle tensions related to specific emotions lived by certain patients (Lowen 1967 , 1971 ) and about reduced hand and body movements in depressed patients (Ellgring 1989 ), there was not much evidence for differentiated gesture activity accompanying different emotions (Wallbott 1998 ).

Wallbott ( 1998 ), studying the body movements that characterize 14 emotions ( cold anger , hot anger , elated joy , happiness , disgust , contempt , sadness , despair , fear , terror , shame , interest , pride , boredom ), noticed the presence of non verbal behaviours (like lateralized hand/arm movements, stretched arms, opening and closing of arms) which allow to differentiate the  X  X  X ctive X  X  emotions (for example hot anger and elated joy) from the  X  X  X assive X  X  emotions, generally speaking. Moreover, the author observes how some gestures and postural attitudes are specific of certain emotions, as for example  X  X  X rms crossed in front of chest X  X  for the expression of pride or the frequency of  X  X  X elf-manipulation X  X  for shame.

Wallbott ( 1998 , p. 891) resolves that  X  X  X ovement and postural behaviour is certainly indicative of the quantity (intensity) of different emotions ( ... ) On the other hand, certain distinctive features in movement and postural behaviour seem to exist, which allow us to identify the quality, i.e. specific emotions. X  X 
The author suggests that an important element of analysis, to distinguish different categories of emotions, concerns the movement quality, that can be judged rating movement activity, expansiveness/spatial extension and movement dynamics/ energy/power.

Martin et al. ( 2006 ), summarizing the results of the studies on the role of gestures in the expression of emotions, resolve that the type of the gesture, its position in the utterance, its shape but also its manner of execution provide information about the speaker X  X  mental and emotional state. Even if not underlining a direct link between gesture shapes and emotions, the literature highlights that gesture manners are good indicators of the emotional state.

However, it is not an easy task to find protocol and data to study the relation between specific gestures and specific emotions. In fact, according to Componential Appraisal Theories, recent studies (Scherer and Ellgring 2007 ) found out that actors use variable expressions rather than prototypical patterns to portray different emotions. To find data about specific emotions in a real life context can be even more difficult.

Also, in Wallbott X  X  studies and in other researches by him mentioned, target emotions were performed by actors, this limiting the ecological validity of such works. Some evidences, however, (Zuckermann et al. 1976 ; Wallbott 1990 ) indicate that posed emotional expressions represent a good approximation to really felt emotional expressions.

Martin et al. ( 2006 ) underline the importance of studying the spontaneous expression of emotions in real life contexts, in order to comprehend which are the gesture characteristics that guide our interpretation of the mental states and emotions of people.

Also, these researchers think that, in order to study complex emotions (as in case of many emotions expressed at the same time or of masked emotions), it is useful to simulate them with artificial agents and see which parameters of the body movements people consider to recognize the emotions. This way it is possible to carry out the decomposition of gesture expressivity and the test of parameters one by one. From the experiments of these authors emerges that each acted emotion had an impact on all the parameters of expressivity. They admit that the decomposition of expressivity may produce artificial behaviours but they also say that this step seemed necessary to evaluate their model and highlight possible ways of improvement.

According to Pelachaud ( 2005 ), they propose a model of gesture manners, called gesture expressivity, which acts on the production of communicative gestures. They consider six dimensions of Expressivity that characterize communicative gestures, namely: Spatial Extent, Temporal Extent, Power, Fluidity, Repetition and Overall activity.

Spatial Extent describes the amplitude of movements, that is, how large the gesture is in space. Temporal Extent describes how fast the gesture is executed (e.g., quick versus sustained actions) and the duration of movements. Power describes the dynamic properties of the movements, that is, how strong the performance of the gesture is (weak vs. strong). Fluidity refers to how two consecutive gestures are co-articulated or the smoothness of single gestures as well as the continuity between movements, one merging with the other. Repetition describes how often a gesture is repeated. The quantity of body movements over a time span is described by the dimension Overall Activity.

Also other studies that considered the parameters of expressivity pointed out the possibility to define the distinctive features of gestures associated to specific emotions (Chi et al. 2000 ).

However, the majority of literature about gestures concerns the relation between gesture and language, thought and mental images.

In the next paragraph the main studies about the relation between gestures and cognitive processes will be presented, trying to demonstrate how the same models that were used to explain the way in which gestures are related to thinking, can be the starting point to better understand the nature of the link between gestures and emotions. 1.2 Gestures and thought Several studies, even if supporting different hypothesis and theoretical models in conflict between them (McNeill 1992 , 2005 ; Krauss et al. 1996 , 2000 ; Butterworth and Hadar 1989 ), showed that a strict relation holds between gestures and cognitive processes and, particularly, between gesture and speech.

Freedman ( 1977 ), McNeill ( 1979 ), Butterworth and Beattie ( 1978 ), though driven by different theoretical basis, all claim that studying the relation between gestures and words could clarify the processes that lead to the passage from thought to verbal production.

McNeill ( 1992 ) suggests that analyzing the association between gestures and language could also present an opportunity to comprehend the nature of knowledge representations (Paivio 1969 , 1971 ; Pylyshyn 1973 ; Kosslyn 1981 ).

The author thinks that gestures inform the listener of the speaker X  X  mental imagery, as his observations about Character and Observer Viewpoint showed.
Moreover gestures are strictly related to words: knowledge and meanings are represented in memory both propositionally and imagistically (as studies on mental imagery show, (Paivio 1971 ; Kosslyn 1981 ). Language and gestures cooperate to express the minimal global-synthetic nucleus of meaning.

McNeill calls this conceptual unit  X  X  X rowth point X  X  and detects in it the primitive status from which bimodal, gestural and verbal expressions organize themselves. The  X  X  X rowth point X  X  represents therefore a minimal and global entity, where the image and the propositional unit are integrated.

This is why also gestures and spoken words develop themselves in a single integrated process. The  X  X  X rowth point X  X  is a combination of image and word, of semantic categories appropriate for language and images.

According to McNeill ( 1992 ), when a concept needs to be expressed, the corresponding gestures are completely organized already at the beginning of the language unit production.
Co-occurent words and gestures represent two components of the act of verbal expression that cannot be separated ( utterance ): gestures convey the imagistic content of meaning, while words utter the propositional one.

Through numerous experimental evidences, the author regards as confirmed the hypothesis that gestures and speaking come from a single process of formation of expressive articulation.

This articulation has both a linguistic and imagistic aspect. The image is created before and is then transformed into complex structures in which both the gestural and linguistic forms are part and parcel.

From these argumentations comes out that gestures are not the result of linear and partitioned verbal plans and they are not translations of the spoken act in a visual-kinesic form, but they are strongly connected to the language even if characterized by a deeply different significance form.

Moreover, other studies show that the temporal and semantic consistency between gesture and speech associates with all languages. This fact is reported by Goldin-Meadow ( 2003 ) as a further demonstration of the integration of the two expression modalities. 1.2.1 Gestures and spatio-motor imagery Three hypothesis have been formulated about the relation between the kind of information spread by gestures and the corresponding verbally expressed content and about the moment in which the content expressed by gestures is determined: the Free Imagery Hypothesis (de Ruiter 1998 , 2000 ; Krauss et al. 1996 , 2000 ), the Lexical Semantic Hypothesis (Butterworth and Hadar 1989 ; Schegloff 1984 ), and the Interface Hypothesis (Kita and Ozyurek 2003 ).

According to the Interface Hypothesis, gestures derive from a spatial-motoric interface representation between speaking and spatial thinking, relative to information on actions and to spatial information; this interface representation is for the purpose of speaking.

Therefore, through gestures, the spatial-motor features of the referent would be codified compatibly with the possibility of language codification.

Kita and Ozyurek ( 2003 ), sustaining this hypothesis, propose some examples (Ozyurek and Kita 1999 ), related to the gestural differences that derive from the different possibilities of verbal codification in the different languages, in order to express the spatial-motor aspects of the mental imagery to which the speech refers. These researchers retain that gestures not only convey the imagistic content of the growth point but that they are also generated by a process in which the spatial-motor imagery comes into a form adapted to be verbally expressed:
Gestures are involved in the process of packaging the spatio-motor imagery into informational units suitable for speech production. ( ... ) The Interface
Hypothesis states that the spatio-motor imagery underlying a gesture is shaped simultaneously by (1) how information is organized in the easily accessible linguistic expression that is concise enough to fit within a processing unit for speech production and (2) the spatio-motor properties of the referent (which may or may not be verbally expressed) (Kita and Ozyurek 2003 , p.17).
 These authors recognise therefore that the gesture can codify the spatial-motor information that is not expressed verbally.

Another study in which the gestural production was put in relation with the motor content of the mental imagery is the one of Pierre Feyereisen and Isabelle Havard ( 1999 ), who searched for the changes in the gestural expression when aging.
Precedent studies (Rauscher et al. 1996 ) demonstrated that the frequency of iconic gestures in a speech is related to the activation of visual-spatial images, while others (Rime ` and Schiaratura 1991 ) said that the bodily experience plays a more important role than visual experience in gesture production.

Feyereisen and Havard, starting from these theoretical hypothesis, questioned if the motor imagery (Jeannerod 1994 ), which is the mental representation in first person of actions and movements, involving kinaesthetic sensations and a muscular micro-activation, influence more the gestural production, compared to the visual mental imagery in third person.

While the mental imagery to which Kita and Ozyurek referred was not motor imagery, but visual imagery of the referent X  X  movements, these authors consider motor imagery in a strict sense.

In order to verify their hypothesis, Feyereisen and Havard analysed the gestures of young college students and elderly, who had to answer to questions, evocating: (1) visual imagery; (2) motor imagery; (3) no imagery. The results of the experiment showed that the gestural production is strongly influenced by the content of the image and, in particular, that gestures, especially representational, were more frequent when a motor imagery was evoked; while the absence of imagery determined by abstract referents led to lower levels of frequency.

The authors considered as variables dependent from the imagery condition: the proportion of time units with presence of a gesture; the proportion of time units with presence of a representational gesture; the proportion of time units with presence of a beat gesture; the relative proportion of representational gestures.

A limit of this study is related to the control of the effective production of motor or visual imagery: some questions could evoke both kinds of imagery and the subjects were not interviewed on the grade of evocation of the sensations associated to what they imagined.

However the results obtained by Feyereisen and Havard suggest the plausibility of the relation between the motor content of the imagery and the gestural production.
In the next paragraph some studies of psychophysiology will be showed, representing important references for the sport psychology and proposing a model of mental imagery that considers, besides this motor component, also a somatic and emotive response.

By considering these studies and those on the relation between gestures and mental imagery considered before, we are brought to hypothesize that gestures might have a role in conveying the emotional content of the mental imagery, representing therefore the privileged communicative modality, not only to express visual contents of the speaker X  X  thoughts but also the emotions he lives. 1.3 Studies about motor and emotional imagery
To imagine doing something often means no more than to think about, or to contemplate, doing it. But there is a sense of imagining which is at once less cognitive and more engaged than this, a sense in which imaging performing an action is very like actually moving your body to perform it. (Currie and Ravenscroft 1997 ) system that appears to be involved not only in producing movements, but also in imagining actions, recognising tools and learning by observation, as well as in understanding the behaviour of other people. (Jeannerod and Frack 1999 ) When we imagine to carry out an action it is possible to assume an external observer point of view, watching therefore ourselves in third person (external imagery) or, on the contrary, to put on a point of view similar to the real one. In this case the action is mentally simulated as if we were carrying it out in first person (internal imagery) and also the kinaesthetic and muscular effort sensations, referring to the real movement, are evoked.

This kind of internal and kinaesthetic imagery is defined as  X  X  X otor imag-ery X  X (Jeannerod 1994 ; Currie and Ravenscroft 1997 , Stevens 2005 ).

The neural substrate of motor imagery considerably overlaps that of actual movement: the motor imagery activates the supplementary motor area (SMA), the pre-motor cortex and the cerebellum (Decety et al. 1996 ; Gerardin et al. 2000 ; Jeannerod 2001 ).

Some studies (for example, Parsons 1994 ) showed that the temporal and kinematic properties of actual movements are reflected in motor imagery, since both kinds of processes are driven by the same sequencing of brain operations. Deficits in motor performance caused by damage to parts of the motor cortex are reflected in impaired motor imagery (Dominey et al. 1995 ). The same direct effects on heart and respiration rates deriving from the activation of the motor areas of the brain, are also evident during motor imagery (Decety et al. 1991 ).

Coherently with this physiological analogy between motor imagery and real movements, sport psychologists demonstrated the efficacy of the motor imagery to improve athletes X  performances (Murphy 1990 ; Suinn 1993 ).

The classical models (Kosslyn 1981 ; Paivio 1971 ) consider the propositional and visual contents of the mental imagery and don X  X  view the motor and of somatic response component. Two theories that strongly consider the bodily aspect of the mental imagery are the bioinformational theory by Lang ( 1977 , 1979 ) and the theory of the triple code by Ahsen ( 1984 ), both coming from clinical psychology.
According to Lang X  X  model, the images hold two kinds of systems: the stimulus -propositions regarding characteristics of the scenario that needs to be imagined and the answer-propositions , referring to the actions of the imaginer in reaction to the elements of the scenario . The first ones include, for example, the mental imagery relative to the location where the sport activity takes place, to the sport clothes worn or to the sport tools in case used. The second ones concern statements about the motor response and the physiological aspects.

Thus, the imagery holds also a motor program which has inside the instructions on how to respond to the image:  X  X  X he image is not a stimulus in the head to which we respond; it is itself an active response process ( ... ); imagery is accompanied by an efferent out-flow appropriate to the content of the image X  X  (Lang 1979 ).
Moreover, a motor program and an emotional response with related somato-visceral activation are included in the image. Lang studies the emotional imagery and thinks that if any changes occur in the real behaviour or in the mental imagery, then consequently the other feature too will not remain unchanged but will undergo a similar modification, this explaining the therapeutic efficiency of the imagery process. All of this happening because at the moment in which something emotionally involving is imagined, a coherent psycho-physiological and somato-visceral response may be activated, on which it is possible to work.

The mental imagery would therefore be constituted by components of propositional nature, containing a motor and an emotive response with somato-visceral correlations.

Even the triple code model by Ahsen considers the emotive-somatic response component of the imagery, besides considering the aspect of personal significance for the imaginer coming from the image content.

Both models underline the possibility to take into consideration the polisenso-riality of the image and, in particular, the somatic response associated to images with emotionally connoted contents. 1.4 A possible link between gestures and emotions Our hypothesis is that gestures, as a way of body expression and seen their spatial-motor nature and besides being the privileged conveyor of the imagistic content of meaning, might have a role also in conveying the somatic response component of the emotion and sensations, included in the image.

If we observe a high jumper before his attempt, we often see that he closes his eyes and seems to first execute in his mind all the sequences of his drill. During this mental imagery exercise the athlete moves his arms and hands as if he were reproducing movements and feelings of easiness and fluidity. Even if this isn X  X  a communicative gesture, it can be a good example of the nature of the possible link between motor and feeling content of the image and gestures.

In the picture below (Fig. 1 ) we can see this link between gestures and emotions or feelings: it is reasonable to state that gestures express something about emotions and feelings in the same immediate way in which they convey information about the imagistic content of meaning. Because imagery includes motor and emotional responses (besides visual and propositional contents), it is possible that gestures convey information about these supplementary elements.

When we want to express a thought containing emotional contents, what do we communicate with gestures?
Our idea is that gestures not only represent the referent X  X  movement and actions, but they are suitable to express an emotional-somatic response content, that Ahsen and Lang presuppose, and the first person movements included in the motor imagery.
This way our meaning of motor content comes to be different from the one adopted by Kita e Ozyurek, while it is similar to that of Feyereisen and Havard, even if there is a difference in the fact that we also consider the emotional content of the imagery (Lang 1979 ). 2 Emotions in sport experiences We decided to study the relation between emotions and gestures in a sportive context for two reasons: (1) Sport competitions are a situation in which there are expressions of different emotions and feelings in different moments (before, during and after competition); (2) Mental imagery about sport events evokes emotions and feelings (indeed we can say with Lang that they are included in the image). Because of the connection between thinking and gestures, we can observe if gestures have some kind of role in the communication of these emotions and feelings.

The hypothesis on which this work is based is that when we are thinking and talk about an exciting (or particularly significant) event and related feelings (also physical), we exhibit gestures that iconically represent these psycho-physical experiences. Therefore, gestures not only vehicle the imagistic content of meaning (growth point), but also sensorial and emotional content, when the mental image concerns very emotionally involving events, like sport competitions.

Within sport psychology, emotions are studied in relation with performance, although the most important elements that influence performance quality seem to be the athletes X  expectations of success or unsuccess, and the readings and interpre-tations of emotions and feelings related to the performance itself.

Even unpleasant emotions like anger and feelings like somatic anxiety can reveal themselves useful to the quality of performance; at the same time, pleasant emotions like satisfaction and feelings like relax can inhibit the achievement of good results. Then, as Hanin says ( 1993 ), to talk about a very successful competition is not to speak about positive emotions only. Finally, we can say that sports competitions, especially very successful or unsuccessful ones, represent meaningful events for the athletes and they experience them with a high degree of emotional involvement.
Frequently, athletes attribute to emotions and feelings the cause of the quality of their performance. Often, when athletes tell about their sport experiences, many of their words refer to emotions and physical feelings.

The most famous instrument used by sport psychologists to study the relation between emotion and performance achievement, is the IZOF, made by Yury Hanin: it considers 40 pleasant and 37 unpleasant emotions, which represent the most frequently ones reported by athletes during their interviews. In these lists, not only emotions, but also physical and psychological feelings are present: for example  X  X  X igorous X  X ,  X  X  X trong X  X   X  X  X elaxed X  X   X  X  X tiff X  X   X  X  X ervous X  X   X  X  X ervy X  X   X  X  X ense X  X , ect.
During the  X  X  X low state X  X  (Csikszentmihalyi 1990 ), an athlete experiences particular mental state, emotions and feelings that bring him to a peak performance.
When athletes talk about their best or worst performance, or also about a future race, they show their related emotions and thoughts. Butler ( 1998 ) and Kubistant ( 1986 ) stated that we can observe in athletes X  telling the presence of sentences and words that reveal their attitude towards competition and that it is useful to induce athletes to change expressions when these are disfunctional, so that they face the next races more positively. Sport psychologists suggest to use mental imagery to increase the athletes X  involvement in recalling the race.

It is possible to work on sensation and emotion lived again during the telling to obtain a change in mental approach.

As we will see, the present study aims to analyse gestures related to these narrations. 3 Reporting about emotions in sport: A research study We conducted an experiment to observe how athletes use gestures when reporting their emotions about their best and worst performance.

A first goal of this experiment was to  X  X  X dentify the role of gestures while people talk about emotionally significant events X  X . We question therefore if the narration of emotionally connoted events, like competitions, is accompanied by a particular kind of gestures.

More specifically we were interested in searching the differences between gestures exhibited in describing the best performance and gestures exhibited describing the worst one, thinking that the first one associates with mostly pleasant emotions and the second case with unpleasant ones.

By considering the connection between gestures and mental imagery, we want to  X  X  X nderstand if the best and the worst performance evoke different imagery quality and different gestural production, together with different emotions. Moreover we tried to investigate the connection between the quality of imagery (that is, the rating regarding vividness of visual, tactile and kinaesthetic feelings and also the type of perspective) and gestures characteristics.

We would also have been interested in  X  X  X bserving how gestures change when the speaker refers to different emotions . To this end, because the present work is not a laboratory study and maintains the spontaneity of expression of the athletes, we are not trying to locate the gestures that characterise the different emotions but, more generically, which distinctive aspects of the different emotions are represented and how. 3.1 Procedure Participant in the study were 30 track and fields athletes, between 17 and 49 years old (mean = 29,7), equally distributed for sex (15 male and 15 female), recruited, before or after their training session, from three sports grounds in Rome.
Athletes were requested to talk about their own best and worst performances, and to re-live those experiences including the pleasant and unpleasant emotions and physical sensations they felt. Each session was video-recorded.

Mental imagery techniques were used to assure a perfect recall of the best and worst competitions and to induce athletes to experience those emotions and feelings again. During imagery session, each athlete answered four questions about the vividness of the images recalled: we asked them:  X  X  X an you see the track in detail? How much in a scale from 0 to 5? X  X ;  X  X  X an you feel the muscular leg contraction and the foot reactivity? How much in a scale from 0 to 5? X  X , to know the intensity with which they felt the muscular movements again; about the intensity (capacity) of feeling again the tactile sensations we asked:  X  X  X an you feel the tactile sensation of the contact between your pulps and the track (tartan)? How much in a scale from 0 to 5? X  X 
Finally we made a question about the imagery point of view that can be internal, external or mixed (Murphy 1990 ):  X  X  X ow do you see yourself during imagery: have you the same visual perspective that you experienced during the competition (internal perspective) or have you an observer perspective as if you were watching the race in a movie (external perspective)? X  X 
At the end of the imagery session each athlete listed three emotions that characterized the imagined competition. This last kind of survey has been made for two reasons: first of all it was useful to evoke the emotions felt during competition in case they had not been revoked during imagery; secondly, it allowed us to reduce the level of inference in respect to the emotions felt by the athletes during competition, in case the subsequent narration hadn X  X  clearly referred to them.
In our study, in concordance with Hanin X  X  model, besides emotions we took into consideration also the mental states and the physical sensations to which the athletes refer. 3.2 Gesture analysis A total of 748 gestures made by the athletes during their reports was analysed, for a total duration of 96 min and 18 s. In the next table we can see some examples of gestures analysis: in the first column the verbal expression co-occurrent with the gesture is transcribed. Frequently, the meaning of gestures and words is redundant, although the gesture always adds some information, offering the imagistic content of the same concept.

In the second column we can see a description of the gesture, and the rating point from 0 to 5 (average of the scores given by two coders with an average agreement of .81) about parameters of expressivity: Spatial Extent, Temporal Extent, Power, Fluidity, Repetition and Overall activity (Pelachaud 2005 ; Martin et al. 2006 ).

In the third and fourth column the inferred meaning of the gesture and the possible type of meaning are reported. The types of meaning considered in this case (from the model of Poggi 1997 ), are  X  X  X nformation on the Speaker X  X  Mind X  X ,  X  X  X nformation about Emotion X  X ,  X  X  X nformation about the World X  X  and  X  X  X nformation on the Speaker X  X  Identity X  X . In the last column we indicate the type of gesture. We distinguish many types of gesture s : Emotion Expressive , through which the athletes directly express emotions or feelings ; Emotion Describing , through which an iconic, metaphoric or symbolic representation of the emotion is given ; Emotion Involun-tary , which seem to betray the speaker X  X  emotions regardless of his communicative intentions ; Self-Manipulation; Baton; Deictic (Ekman and Friesen 1969 ); Visuo-spatial Iconic that can be Observer Viewpoint or Character-Viewpoint gesture (McNeill 1992 ).

The characteristics of the different types of gestures are better explained in the next paragraph.

In Table 1 , underlined are the elements of the analysis which seem to be, from time to time, more outstanding to express the meaning. 4 Results Video analysis showed the presence of different types of gestures; some of them occurred frequently because they seem appropriate to express contents regarding sport events.

Often athletes used Iconic Gestures (see lower part of Table 1 ) that represent visual elements; for example the athletes X  moving on the track, the overtaking of an adversary, the spatial relation with track elements, etc.

We observed the presence of Character Viewpoint (C-VPT) gestures (McNeill 1992 ) that are used by athletes to represent race movements in first person perspective. For instance they used their arms to mime run actions when they re-lived the competition and put their pulps in the same position in which they put them on the track for the start.

Observer Viewpoint (O-VPT) gestures occur when the speaker mentally  X  X  X atches X  X  the race from the outside. For example athletes used a J shape gesture to represent the moment in which they entered the last 100 m of the race.
The iconicity of these gestures resides first of all in their shape, which therefore becomes the most important characteristic to consider in giving the meaning, because through it the referent X  X  shape is reproduced. When with these gestures one wants to represent the speed of a movement, the most relevant parameter is the  X  X  X emporal extent X  X , because the speed of the gesture is used to represent the speed of the movement of the referent.
Another relevant parameter in presence of iconic gestures is the one relative to the  X  X  X patial extent X  X , because, for example, a big excursion of the gesture in the space can be used to represent a motion which develops on a particularly big distance.
The size of the gesture, however, is not necessarily proportional to the size of the movement or of the referent represented.

According to Holler and Beattie ( 2002 ) O-VPT gestures are used to convey the information relative to the size of referents particularly big or small.

In the case of C-VPT gestures, not frequently used, the parameter  X  X  X patial extent X  X  seems relevant because with these gestures the speaker tends to maintain the real size and position proportion between the agent (himself) and the external objects.

For example, when the athletes represented themselves at the start blocks, as we said, they put their pulps in the same position in which they put them on the track for the start and held their arms at the same distance as when at starting position. In Table 1 , besides the description of the signal, also the temporal extent parameter of this gesture is underlined, because it gives the idea of a position long maintained by the athlete, before the fast start.

Since through C-VPT gestures the action of the agent is reproduced in first person, a certain relevance is taken sometimes by parameters regarding fluidity and power. In fact, with these gestures it is possible to reproduce the fluidity and the power with which the real actions were executed. This is a particular kind of iconicity, through which there is no representation of spatial or movement features, but rather the muscular responses associated to the movements themselves are reproduced. It could be said that these gestures convey information deriving from the motor imagery of the sport action to which it refers. 4.1 Gestures that refer to emotions Besides iconics , several gestures like beats, metaphoric, emblems, etc, not related to the race, occur, but especially gestures that refer to emotions.

The athletes verbally referred to 122 different emotions; for this reason it wasn X  X  possibile to indicate the presence of specific gestures in relation to specific emotions. We distinguished however four main categories of  X  X  X motional gestures X  X : 1. Gestures that express emotions or feelings ( emotion expressive gestures ) ; 2. Gestures that describe (or symbolize) emotions( emotion descriptive gestures ) ; 3. Self-manipulation gestures (non intentional, that reveal present emotions-not 4. Non voluntary gestures;
With emotion expressive gestures athletes wanted to reproduce a state of tension or relax, well-being and easiness (like in the  X  X  X low state X  X , Csikszentmihalyi 1990 ).
These are gestures which directly express the emotion,  X  X  X howing X  X  its somatic response. It is the bodily part of the emotion.

For example athletes clenched their fists to express the feelings of strength (see row 4 on Table 1 ), or they represented the change of the psychological tension by contracting or de-contracting their arms muscles when they showed a gesture. Frequently the modification of the degree of some expressivity parameter was used to express specific feelings or somatic response related to emotions.
For example, when athletes told about the feeling of easiness or about the fluidity of their actions, they used gesture with a high degree of fluidity and a low level of power. When they wanted to represent the meaning of reactivity (in the sense of the feeling of reactivity) they used fast and repetitive gestures.

In order to express feelings of anxiousness or tension (see row 1 on the table), coherently with the real somatic responses associated to them, gestures were used with very low levelled fluidity and high power levels compared to gestures used to express states of relaxation, tranquillity and well-being (row 2).
 Sometimes gestures were shown simply with a particular degree of tension.
Confronting rows 2 and 3, it can be noticed how the reference to the presence or absence of well-being ( feeling of well-being vs. couldn X  X  feel well-being ) in the same athlete, is characterized by the presence of two gestures of the same form but with strongly different fluidity and power rates and with the peculiarity of a rigidifying of the fingers when the absence of well-being must be expressed.

Gestures that describe emotions ( emotion descriptive ) tend to represent them symbolically, (for example the gesture of mental concentration, or the reducing of tense), or iconically, representing visual characteristic like the movement of the heart beat to represent the feeling of anxiety.

The role of these gestures could be defined mainly as a linguistic function, because with them athletes refer to their own emotions, they tell about them and describe them but they don X  X  live them again and they don X  X  reproduce them with a gesture.

For example, they represented the mental states of  X  X  X ental isolation X  X (row 5)  X  X  X oncentration X  X (row 6) or  X  X  X erfect balance X  X (row 8) with gestures that iconically or metaphorically convey these meanings.

With regard to these gestures, the rates of the gesture expressivity parameters seem less decisive, because no particular changes of such rates associated to different emotions or mental states can be observed. The meaning can be understood from the shape and the motions characterizing these gestures and assume a symbolic or iconic function. An exception is given by gestures which represent the perfect balance, where the power and overall activation must assume low grades, to give the idea of the delicacy of the balance. Another exception is made of the low grade of temporal extent, therefore of the high speed of the gesture, to express the concept of the decrease of tension, which occurs quickly.

The so called self adaptors (Ekman and Friesen 1969 ) reveal the present state of the speaker, but they not necessarily refer to the content of the telling (the race in this case).

According to literature, these gestures are related with a high degree of arousal: they derive from shyness and shame and they are not necessary related to the emotion lived during the race.

We noticed that many athletes, when talking about a very important moment of the competition, betrayed their emotions (related to the content of the telling) producing hand gestures or leg movements. We called these kind of movements involuntary gestures and think that they belong to the semantic category of emotional gestures. This because, even if not used to express an emotion felt during the competition and even if not having iconicity features, they always show themselves in moments of the competition emotionally connoted. For example an athlete, even if crossing his arms, started to quickly agitate his legs when talking about the moment in which he knew he would win. Other athletes, referring to decisive moments of the competition, started to make more gestures.

Frequently, the athletes change type of gesture when changing scene or emotional context, and re-use the same type of gesture if they talk again about that scene or emotional context.
 This is an example of the cohesive function of the gestures (McNeill 1992 ).
Telling about positive emotions frequently accompanied by opening gestures, while closure gestures accompanied words that referred to unpleasant emotions. 4.2 Statistical analysis In comparing the best and the worst performances with t Student Test for paired samples significant differences emerge.

The athletes spoke for a total average of 193 s, though showing evident individual differences (S.D. = 66.5 s); they used 105 s to report their best performance and 88 s to report the worst one: these times differ statistically (29 df, t = 2.30, P &lt; .05).

Verbally, when reporting, the subjects referred to the emotions felt during the competition and mostly to the same ones named in the two lists, with a similar frequency in reporting the best or worst performance (29 df, t = 1.24, P &gt; 0.20).
Words referring to emotions were accompanied by emotional-expressive and emotional-descriptive gestures in 40% of the cases, while in the remaining 60% of the times they were either expressed without gestures, in presence of emotional non voluntary gestures or together with self manipulation gestures already activated before words were pronounced.

The total number of gestures per time unit (100 s) and the percentage (relative to the total gestures) of gestures expressing emotions (respectively: df 29, t = 3.75, P &lt; .001 and t = 3.04, P &lt; .005) are bigger when athletes speak about best performance.

It was noticed that also the Percentage of C-VPT is significantly bigger for the best performance (29 df, t = 2.76, P = .01)
The Percentages of non voluntary gestures are not significantly different in the two narrations (29 df, t = 0.40, P &gt; .50).

Other observations are that, when talking about the worst race, self manipulation gestures are more used (29 df, t = 2.12, P &lt; .05) so as gestures that describe emotions (near the significance: 29 df, t = 1.75 P = .09.).

Talking about the worst performance often implied a change of posture and closure gestures.

In Table 2 we can see a comparison between the number of gestures used in the two kinds of narrations and the significant differences between the usage of the different kind of gestures: emotion expressive, emotion descriptive, self-manipula-tion, emotion non voluntary , and C-VPT plus O-VPT (iconics).
The visual vividness quality is basically the same for the best and the worst performance, while the quality of kinaesthetic and tactile reported feelings (sum of the two values) associated to the motor and somatic component of the internal imagery (in first person) is better in the good performance imagery (29 df, t = 2.22, P &lt; .05) as we can see in the last column of Table 2 .

The Internal viewpoint is more used when imagining the best performance (81% vs. 50%) and it is associated with a higher tactile + kinaeshtesic vividness compared to the external viewpoint (mean 5.5 vs 4.6).

There is a possible role of gesture in expressing the motor-emotional content of the image, this deriving from the co-existence of emotional gestures and the quality of kinaesthetic and tactile recall. In order to verify this, we made a correlation between the grades given by the athletes to the vividness of the kinaesthetic and tactile imagery and the number of emotional gestures; this, however, didn X  X  lead to significance results.

That being so might be caused by the fact that the questions about kinaesthetic and tactile imagery didn X  X  refer to the somatic response component linked to the emotions, but to motor imagery aspects only partly linked to this component.
Secondly, while the number of emotional gestures has been defined based on a systematic observation and a later analysis, the vividness of the imagery is a less objective datum, since deriving from a self-report scale. It is therefore not said that a more vivid imagery objectively corresponds to higher vividness values reported by a subject in respect to another.

An ultimate explanation can reside in the limited number of subjects considered. 5 Discussion We decided to start from the connection between mental imagery and gestures to explain the relation between emotions and gestures. In fact, studies about mental imagery show that  X  X  X he image is not a stimulus in the head to which we respond; it is itself an active response process ( ... ); imagery is accompanied by an efferent out-flow appropriate to the content of the image X  X  (Lang 1979 ).

Moreover, a motor program and an emotional response with related somato-visceral activation are included in the image.

Our research question was if the best and the worst performances evoke different imagery quality and different gestural production, apart from different emotions. Video analysis seems to confirm our predictions.

The majority of gestures produced aim to describe the emotions and feelings related to the competition and to the preceding and subsequent moments. In other words, the athletes represent emotions, psychological processes and conditions like concentration and nervous tension, and somatic feelings: thus gesture conveys not only the imagistic content of meaning, but the motor and emotional too.

Many of the gestures produced can be in a sense defined iconic, since they reproduce the physical response related to emotions, feelings and psychological processes.

For instance, many athletes, speaking about nervous tension and muscular contraction (psycho-physical sensation), clench their fists with high intensity, while they exhibit soft and fluent gestures when they want to represent a sense of well-being and thoughtlessness (psycho-physical sensation).

While the iconicity of C-VPT and O-VPT mainly derives from their shape, the iconicity of the gestures from us defined as emotional-expressive, derives from the expressivity parameters, especially power, overall activity and fluidity. The speaker, while modifying the values of these parameters, expresses a specific emotion or sensation he feels, referring to his state of minor or major tension or, on the contrary, of lightness, deriving from it.

Also in some of the C-VPT gestures, however, the expressive parameters are used to indicate the degree of tension, the fluidity or rigidity, with which the narrated actions were made.

In general, when comparing gestures produced in telling about positive emotions and successful performances versus unpleasant emotions and bad performances, some recurrent features can be found, shared, respectively, by the two kinds of gestures.
The answers to questions about imagery reveal that, when recalling negative performances, the athletes create less vivid images and feel muscular and Kinaesthetic sensations with low intensity.

Generally, subjects speaking about their top performance, use more gestures and, specifically more emotional ones. Sometimes, in parallel with the event topic moments, they move their legs to, perhaps, betray their emotional activation.
Also, the memory of the best performance is associated to high levels of imagery vividness, high intensity of kinaesthetic and tactile sensation during imagery and to an internal viewpoint.

However, no significant correlations were found between the number of emotional gestures and the grades relative to the degree of tactile and kinaesthetic imagery vividness. This could be because of the little number of samples, of the kind of questions relative to the imagery in first person but not directly because of the somatic response component included in it and of the fact that, while the number of gestures is an objective datum (even if based on classification criteria which allows to considerate gestures as emotional-expressive), the only indications about the quality of the mental imagery were obtained on the base of evaluations on a self report scale.
The greater number of C-VPT gestures and of emotional expressive gestures in the best performance (characterized, as we said, by more vivid tactile and kinaesthetic imagery), would bring to presuppose a role of these gestures in representing, respectively, the movement in first person featuring the motor imagery and the somatic response to the somatic component included in the image itself.
Gestures would therefore represent something more than the motoric content uttered by Kita and Ozyurek, referring to gestures we can define as O-VPT. The athletes in our experiment convey, with their gestures, information about the muscular and somatic responses associated to the motion in first person and to the state of tension and psycho-physical relaxation.

The presence of a greater number of emotional-expressive gestures and a smaller number of emotion descriptive gestures in reporting the best race, compared to the worst one, suggests that the larger number of gestures, noted in relation to the best performance, is specific and not explainable basing on a simple increment of the activation levels.

We explain it this way: in the case of the positive race the athlete tends to  X  X  X e-live X  X  it, more than simply report it, and this might be owing to more vivid polisensorial mental imagery, associated to the memory.

If this the case, it is possible that gestures actually have the function of conveying the somatic-emotional-motor content of the mental imagery and not only the visual and motional aspect of the referent.

Together with literature about motoric imagery (suggesting that the more vivid motor imagery associates to the automatic knowledge of the imagined motion), we can presuppose that the athletes expressed the motoric and emotional contents of the imagery in the case of the best performance, while in the case of the worst one, this has been expressed referring to a knowledge of declarative nature.

This distinction was highlighted also by Magno Caldognetto and Poggi ( 2004 )in regard to the emotional speech :  X  X  X ot all the emotional lexicon, however, forms the  X  X  X motional speech X  X . I can easily report someone else X  X  emotion, or an emotion I lived myself in the past, or even one I imagine I would feel, but this is not  X  X  X xpressing an emotion X  X : it is, in case, talking about it, telling it. X  X 
To talk about the emotion corresponds to the gestures function we defined as emotional descriptive. The emotion expressive gestures have instead an emotional speech function.

The limited number of subjects and the evident individual differences they showed regarding the emotions they referred to, make it necessary to repeat this study with a larger sample; here a way should be found to remedy to the low control over the independent variable represented by emotions, without limiting too much the ecological validity of the methodology used in this experiment.

It would be useful to take into consideration the live transmission of sport events where athletes are interviewed after their performances.
