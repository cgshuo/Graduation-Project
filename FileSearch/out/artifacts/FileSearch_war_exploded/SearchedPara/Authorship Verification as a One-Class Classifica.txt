 Moshe Koppel KOPPEL @ CS . BIU . AC . IL Jonathan Schler SCHLERJ @ CS . BIU . AC . IL In the authorship attribution problem, we are given examples of the writing of a number of authors and are asked to determine which of them authored given anonymous texts (Mosteller &amp; Wallace 1964, Holmes 1998). If it can be assumed for each test document that one of the specified authors is indeed the actual author, the problem fits the standard paradigm of a text categorization problem (Sebastiani 2002). In the authorship verification problem, we are given examples of the writing of a single author and are asked to determine if given texts were or were not written by this author. As a categorization problem, verification is significantly more difficult than attribution and little, if any, work has been performed on it in the learning community. If, for example, all we wished to do is to determine if a text was written by Shakespeare or Marlowe, it would be sufficient to use their respective known writings, to construct a model distinguishing them, and to test the unknown text against the model. If, on the other hand, we need to determine if a text was written by Shakespeare or not, it is very difficult  X  if not impossible  X  to assemble an exhaustive, or even representative, sample of not-Shakespeare. The situation in which we suspect that a given author may have written some text but do not have an exhaustive list of alternative candidates is a common one. The problem is complicated by the fact that a single author may consciously vary his or her style from text to text for many reasons or may unconsciously drift stylistically over time. Thus researchers must learn to somehow distinguish between relatively shallow differences that reflect conscious or unconscious changes in an author X  X  style and deeper differences that reflect styles of different authors.  X  X  X  X  X  Verification is thus essentially a one-class problem. A fair amount of work has been done on one-class problems, especially using support vector machines (Manevitz &amp; Yousef 2001, Scholkopf et al 2001, Tax 2001). There are, however, two important points that must be noted. First, in authorship verification we do not actually lack for negativ e examples. The world is replete with texts that were, for example, not written by Shakespeare. However, these negative examples are not representative of the entire cl ass. Thus, for example, the fact that a particular text may be deemed more similar to the known works of Shak espeare than to those of some given set of other authors does not by any means constitute solid evidence that the text was authored by Shakespeare rather than by some other author not considered at all. We will consider how to make proper limited use of whatever partial negative information is available for the authorship verification problem. A second distinction between authorship verification and some one-class problems is that if the text we wish to attribute is long  X  and in this paper we will consider only long texts  X  then we can chunk the text so that we effectively have multiple examples which are known to be either all written by the author or all not written by the author. Thus, a better way to think about authorship verification is that we are given two example sets and are asked whether these sets were generated by a single generating process (author) or by two different processes. The ce ntral novelty of t his paper i s a new method for addu cing th e dep th of differe nce betwee n two e xam ple set s, a method that may have far -reac hing co nse que nces for determ ining th e reliab ilit y o f classificatio n m odels. Th e und erlying id ea is to test th e rate o f degradation of the accuracy of learned m odels as the best feature s are iterat ively dr opped from the learni ng proce ss.

Sin ce our meth od s will build up on t he stand ard methods f or han dling authors hip attribut ion bet ween two ca ndidate aut hors , let us begi n by briefly revi ewi ng those standar d methods . We begin by cho osing a fea ture set consi sting of the kinds of feat ures t hat m ight be u sed c onsi stently by a sin gle au tho r ov er a variety o f writing s. Ty pically, th ese feat ure s m ight include f requenci es o f function w ords (Mosteller a nd Wallace 1964), sy ntactic struct ures (Baayen et al 1996, Stam ata tos et al 200 1), pa rts-of-speec h n-gram s (Koppel et al 20 02), co mp lex ity and richness m eas ures (suc h as sentence length, word lengt h, type/ toke n rat io) (Yule 1938, T weedi e a nd Baayen 1998, de Vel et a l 200 2) or sy ntact ic and orthog raph ic id iosyncrasies (K opp el and Sch ler 200 3). Note t hat thes e feature type s con trast sh arply with th e cont ent w ords com monl y used i n text cat egori zat ion by topi c. Havi ng c onst ruct ed t he a ppropriate feat ure vect ors, we cont inue, preci sel y as i n topi c-base d t ext cat ego rizat ion, by usi ng a l earni ng al gorithm t o con struct a distinguishing model . Al though m any learni ng m ethods have been appl ied t o t he pr oblem, i ncludi ng multivariate analysis, decisi on t rees and neural nets, a good n umber of st udies have s how n t hat l inear separat ors w ork wel l for t ext cat egori zation (Ya ng 1999). Li near methods t hat have bee n u sed f or t ext categorization include Na X  ve Bayes (M osteller and Wallace 1964, Peng et al 2004), whic h for t he two-class case is a linear separat or, W innow and Expone ntial Gradien t (Lewis et al 19 96 , Dag an et al 199 7, Kop pel et al 2002) a nd li near s upport vector m achines (Joac hims 1999 , de Vel et al 20 02 , D iederich et al 20 03). assessed u sing k-fold cr oss-v alid atio n or bootstr apping. Thi s gene ral framewor k has been us ed t o convincingl y solve a num ber of real wo rld au thorsh ip attrib utio n problem s (e.g. Mosteller &amp; Wallace 1964, Matthews &amp; Merriam 199 3, Holmes et al 200 1, Binongo 2003). Is t here s ome way to leverage t hese m ethods to solve the verification prob lem in wh ich we are ask ed if some mystery book was written by autho r A with ou t b eing offered a clo sed set of altern ativ es? On e po ssib ility th at sugg ests itself is to con coct a mishmash of work s b y other a uthors and to learn a m odel for A vs. not -A . T his appro ach is prob lem atic, th ough no t en tirely u seless, try to handle t he prob lem with no ne gative exam ples at all. On e ap proach that sounds at f irst b lush as if it m ight work is th is: let X  X  chun k th e kn own works of A and th e mystery wo rk X to generate some su fficiently larg e set of exam ples of each. Now we can learn A vs. X and assess t he ext ent of t he difference bet ween A a nd X between th em , i.e. if we ob tain high accu racy in cro ss-val idation, t hen presum abl y we co uld c onclude t hat A and X are by differe nt authors . Thi s m ethod does n ot w ork wel l at al l. To un derst and why, let X  X  cons ider a real-w orld exam ple. We are give n know n wor ks by thr ee 19 th century Am eri can novel ists, Herm an Melv ille, Jam es Fen imore Co op er and Nath aniel Hawth orne. Fo r each of th e three au tho rs, we of The House of Seven Gables (hence forth: Ga bles ). Usi ng t he m etho d just desc ribed a nd u sing a feat ure set con sisting of the 250 m ost freque ntly use d wo rds i n A and X (d etails b elow), we fi nd that we can d istin gu ish Ga bles from the works of each author with cross-validation acc uracy of a bove 98%. If we we re to concl ude , the refore, t hat none of the se a uthors wrote Ga bles , we would be w rong: Hawt horne wr ote it. If we look c losely at the m odels that success fully distin gu ish Gab les fr om H awtho rne X  X  o ther wo rk (in this case, Th e S carlet Letter ), we find t hat a sm all num ber o f f eat ures are doi ng al l t he wor k o f distinguishing bet ween t hem . These feat ures include he (m ore fre quent in Th e S carlet Letter ) and she (m ore will u se a small n umber o f featu res i n a co nsisten tly diffe rent way bet ween works i s t ypical . These diffe rences m ight res ult fr om t hem atic di ffere nces bet ween t he wo rks, from diffe rences i n gen re or purpose , from chr onologi cal st ylistic dri ft, or from delib erate attem pts b y the au tho r to m ask his o r her identity (as we sh all see b elow). Thi s pr oblem can be o verc ome usi ng a ne w t echni que we call  X  X  nmask ing  X . Th e intu itiv e id ea of un masking is to iterativ ely rem ove thos e features that are m ost usef ul for di stinguishing bet ween A an d X and t o gau ge the spee d with which cr oss -validat ion accuracy degra des as more features are rem oved. Our m ain hypo thesis is th at if A a nd X are by the sa me author, then whate ver diffe rences the re are betwee n them will feature s, des pite possi ble differe nces in t heme, genre and the like. In Figu re 1, w e show the r esult o f un mask ing w hen com paring Ga bles to known works of Melville, Cooper and Hawt horne.

Th is illu strates th at on ce a sm all num ber o f di stinguishing m arkers are rem oved, t he t wo works by Ha wthorne become increasingly hard to distinguish from each othe r. In the following section, we will sho w how the sudd enness o f the deg radation we will see that the phe nom enon illustra ted in the Ga bles exam ple h olds ve ry ge neral ly. 5.1 Cor pus We conside r a collection of twenty-one 19 th century Eng lish bo ok s written b y ten d ifferen t au tho rs an d electr onically av ailab le book s by th ese autho rs t hat were su fficie ntly large (ab ove 500K) a nd tha t pre sente d no special fo rmatt ing ch allen ges. Th e fu ll list is sh own in Tabl e 1. O ur object ive i s to run 2 09 inde pende nt aut hors hip verificat ion e xperiments represent ing al l pos sible a uthor/book pai rs (21 books  X  10 aut hors but exclud ing th e p air Em ily Bron te/ Wu therin g Heigh ts wh ich can  X  X  be tested sin ce it i s th e au tho r X  X  on ly wo rk). Fo r t he sak e of all th e ex perim ents th at follow, we chunk each boo k in to appr oxi mately eq ual sectio ns of at least 500 words wi thout breaki ng u p pa ragra phs. F or each a uthor A and each book X, let A X con sists of all the wo rks by A in the corp us un less X is i n fact written by A, in whic h case A X co nsists o f all works b y A except X. Our objective is to a ssign t o each pair val ue differen t-author ot her wise. 5.2 Baseline: One -class SVM In order to estab lish a baseline, fo r each au thor A in th e corpus and ea ch book X, we use a one -class SVM (Chang &amp; Li n 20 01) on t he 250 m ost freq uent wo rds in A to build a model for A X . (Al though, as di scuss ed abov e, m any m ore in terestin g feat ure sets are possi ble, we use this fea ture set here f or simplicity and uni ver sal applicability.) We then test each book X against the model of each A X . W e assign th e p air &lt;A X ,X&gt; th e value same -aut hor if m ore t han hal f the c hunks of X a re assi gne d t o A X. Thi s method per forms very po orly. Of the 20 pairs that sh ou ld have been assigne d the val ue same -aut hor , only 6 are c orre ctly categorized, while 46 of t he 189 pairs t hat should be assi gned the val ue differen t-au thor are incorrectl y classified. These res ults hol d usi ng an RBF ke rnel ; using ot her ke rnels o r usi ng a t hresh old ot her t han hal f (t he num ber of ch unks assi gne d t o the class) only de gra des res ults. 5.3 Unma sking Applied Now let u s introd uce th e details o f our new m ethod base d o n our o bser vations ab ove re gar ding i terat ive eliminatio n of featu res. We ch oo se as an initial featu re set th e 25 0 word s with high est av erag e frequ ency in A and X (that is, the avera ge of the fre que ncy in A the frequ ency in X, giving eq ual weigh t to A Using an SVM with lin ear k ernel we run the fo llo wing unm aski ng sc heme: In th is way, we con stru ct d egrad atio n cu rves, as in Figure 2, for each pai r &lt;A X ,X&gt;. 5.4 Met a-le arnin g: Iden tifying S ame -Author We wis h now to quantify the diffe rence bet ween same-aut ho r curves and differen t-au tho r curves. To do s o, we first represe nt each curve as a num erical vector in terms 0,... ,9: We s ort t hese vectors int o two s ubsets: thos e in whic h A and X are the by sam e author and those in which A X and X are by diffe rent aut hors. We t hen ap ply a meta-learni ng sche me in whi ch w e use l earner s to det erm ine wh at role to assig n to various feature s of the curves. Tech nical ly sp eaki ng, we ha ve 189 di stinct differen t-aut ho r curve s but onl y 13 di stinct same -author cu rves, sin ce fo r au thors with ex actly two work s in our co rpus, the com parison of A X with X is identi cal for each of the two boo ks. To illu strate th e ease with wh ich same-aut ho r cu rves can be distinguished from differen t-aut ho r cu rves, we no te th at for all 13 distin ct same-aut ho r cu rves, it h olds th at: Th ese two con dition s hold for on ly 5 of the 189 differen t-au thor curve s. 5.5 Accur acy Re sults: Le av e-on e-b ook -out Tests In order t o honestly assess the accuracy of the m ethod, we use t he f ollowing c ross-validation m ethodol ogy . Fo r each book B in our c orpus, we run a trial i n whic h B is completely e liminated from co nsideratio n. We use unmask ing to co nstru ct curves fo r all au thor/bo ok pairs &lt;A X ,X&gt; (w here B does n ot appea r in A X and i s not X) and the n we use a linear SVM to meta-learn to distin gu ish same-author curves from differen t-author curves. The n, for eac h a uthor A in t he c orpus , we use unmask ing to constru ct a curv e for th e p air &lt;A B use t he m eta-l earn ed m odel to determ ine if the cu rve is a same-author curve or a differen t-author cu rve. Using th is testin g protocol, we ob tain the fo llo wing resu lts: All b ut one of th e twen ty same -author pai rs a re correctly classified. T he si ngl e exception is Pygma lion by G eorg e Bern ard Sh aw . In add itio n, 1 81 of 189 differen t-au thor pairs we re c orrectly classified. Am ong the ex cep tion s were t he attribu tio ns of The Profess or by Charlotte Bronte to each of her sisters. Thus , we obtain ove rall accurac y of 95.7% wit h errors alm ost identically distribu ted between false po sitiv es and false n egativ es. Un til no w we h ave not used an y exam ples o f non-A writing to help us con stru ct a model of au tho r A. Of course, plenty o f ex am ples o f non-A writin g ex ist; th ey are sim ply neither exha ustive nor re prese ntative. We now co nsi der ho w use ca n be m ade of suc h dat a. Suppose, t hen, that we ha ve available the works of term s of ge ography , c hronol ogy, cul ture an d ge nre . To make m atters co ncret e, su ppose we are co nsi dering wh ether some bo ok X was written by Melv ille. W e coul d use t he w orks of Hawthorne a nd C oope r as exam ples o f no n-Melv ille writin g an d learn a model fo r Melv ille ag ain st n on-Mel ville. Assu ming we can do so success fully, we ca n the n te st each e xam ple of X t o see if it assig ned b y th e model to Melv ille o r to no t-Melv ille. If man y are assigned to no t-A, i t might be reaso nable to concl ude t hat X is not by the sam e aut hor as A. B ut if it tu rns out that many, or e ven all, exam ples of X are assig ned to Melville, co uld we reason ably conclude th at Melv ille wro te th e boo k? Certain ly n ot, sin ce if th e book were , for exam ple, Uncle T om X  X  Cabi n , we would be le d astray . Ha rriet Beecher Stowe  X  X  Melv ille th an to Hawtho rne an d Coop er, but sh e is no t Melv ille. Still we can ex ploit th is method to possib ly eli minate some false p ositiv es fro m the unmask ing ph ase. Our elimination method works as follows . For each a uthor A, ch oo se other au thors of the sam e typ e  X  let X  X  call represe nt the class not -A. In our corpus , we consi der four t ypes as i ndi cat ed i n Ta ble 1. We l earn a m odel for A against not -A and we learn models for each A agai nst not -A i . Ass uming t hat k-f old cr oss-val idation resu lts for each of th ese m odels are satisfacto ry, we test all the exam ples in X against each one of these m odels. Let A(X) be the pe rcenta ge of e xam ples of X classe d as A rat her t han not A; de fine A i (X) an alogou sly. Th en if A(X) is not greater than A i (X) fo r all i, co nclud e th at A is no t th e au thor of X. Ot herwise con clud e no thing . We use th is elimin atio n m ethod to aug ment u nmask ing . For t hose cas es whe re u nmaski ng c oncl ude s t hat A aut hore d X , we al low t he el im ination method t o ove rrule i t if the el imination method i ndi cates t hat A was no t th e auth or of X. Th e eli minatio n meth od is no t use d at all for cases whe re u nmaski ng co ncl ude s that A did n ot aut hor X. In our exp erimen t, u sing th e eli minatio n m ethod in th is way r esulted in the i ntrod uction of a sing le new misclassification: Thoreau was i ncorrect ly concl uded not to have written A Week on Conc ord . At the sam e time, all o f th e p airs previou sly misclassifie d as same-aut ho r we re c orrected. Overa ll, then, t he augm ented method cl asse d al l 18 9 differen t-author pai rs and 1 9 of 21 sam e-author pairs co rrectly. In Fig ure 3 , we summarize the entire algorithm includi ng both unmaski ng a nd (opt ional ) elim ination.
