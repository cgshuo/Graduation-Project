 Messages, Meaning, and Symbols: The Communication of Information, Charles T. Meadow, Scarecrow Press, Lanham, MD (2006). 256 pp., $40, ISBN: 978-0-8108-5271-6
Communication and information are often unfairly divorced in both textbooks and the classroom; they may be considered separately, or one might serve as a supplement to the other X  X n afterthought. This reviewer himself has encountered several fellow doctoral students who question information science X  X  place within a broader college of communication and information. This artificial divide is counter-intuitive, narrow-minded, and downright backward. Communication and information are joined at the hip, and any discussion of one necessarily requires consideration of the other.

Messages, Meanings, and Symbols: The Communication of Information offers a fascinating introduction to communication, information, knowledge, and related concepts. Meadow sets out to provide the reader with an integrated analysis of the communication of information, and succeeds admirably. Messages, Meanings, and Symbols is targeted at  X  X  X ndergraduates in information science and general readers, anyone from age four-teen or fifteen up X  X  (p. xi). Nevertheless, while this book would indeed serve well as a primary text for an under-graduate communications or information sciences course, it would likely prove equally as useful as a supplementary text for graduate level information science courses (its introduction to the history of commu-nication being particularly beneficial). It might also come in handy as a painless refresher for professionals in all fields of communications and information.

The book consists of twelve chapters covering three broad topics: (1) a history of communication; (2) a dis-cussion of  X  X ommunication X ,  X  X nformation X ,  X  X nowledge X  and related concepts; and (3) a review of the commu-nication process integrating these concepts. A useful bibliography is provided, as is an index. Each chapter includes endnotes and suggestions for further reading (organized by subtopic). Ample illustrations, photo-graphs, and sidebars are used to provide examples, additional detail, and apropos vignettes. These figures prove especially helpful through their easy visual communication of ideas introduced in the main body of the text X  X uch as diagrammatic sketches of Shannon and Weaver X  X  (1947) general model of communication.
The figures also add life to what might be seen as otherwise dry explanations or concepts (for example, a side-bar and schemata are provided to describe the basic workings of a steam engine during a discussion of the development of technology related to message transmission).

The author is a historian of communication, and history permeates the book; it provides a contextual bed for understanding the development of important concepts in the fields of communications and information science. This acknowledgment of history is refreshing, especially when considering that information science seems (at times) to actively avoid attempts to recognize its past. The first four chapters of the book provide a history of human communication X  X rom prehistoric man to the World Wide Web. This history is essen-tially a streamlining of Meadow X  X  (2002) book, Making Connections: Communications Through the Ages.
Although cherry picking from a 384 page history for an 89 page survey was surely a daunting task, the author provides a reasonable survey of communications history. Meadows focuses on the development of written forms of language (Chapter one), the use of sound, light, and transportation as channels of com-munication (Chapter two), the development of photography and electricity (Chapter three), and the elec-tronics revolution (Chapter five). Meadow X  X  history deals with medium and channel , leaving discussion of the information or message for later exploration. Discussion of electronics and the Internet is particularly strong X  X ut this is not unexpected considering the author X  X  extensive computer expertise. The history is (thankfully) inclusive, providing insight into the development of communication, whenever possible, across cultures.
 Chapters five through eight introduce major concepts involving communication and information.

The author subscribes to Shannon and Weaver X  X  general model of communication; using it as a primary framework for understanding and orienting concepts covered (while not excluding alterna-tive interpretations). While Meadow acknowledges the slippery nature of defining  X  X nformation X . He objec-tifies information as expressions of thought (be they gestures, print, sound, or artistically rendered) representations X  X essages. The construction of messages is further examined through an analysis of signs and symbols. All of this allows the reader to better conceptualize information X  X  place in the general model.

The remaining chapters of the book consider the communication (of information) process as an integrated whole X  X edia and message. Meadow traces the message through the general model from source to receiver, introducing concepts such as noise, hot and cool media, and the processes of making meaning and coming to understanding . The book ends with the author X  X  view of modern society X  X  time of convergent media and  X  X ired X  cities. The effect of Meadow X  X  (essentially teleological) analysis of the communications process can be disconcerting. Technology is rendering the distance between source and receiver meaningless X  X re we pre-pared for the  X  X lobal village X ?
The book does a fine job of introducing the reader to the basic processes involved in the communica-tion of information with its casual presentation and clear discussion of tricky concepts. It renders Shan-non and Weaver X  X  work accessible to both information science students and a popular audience, while imbedding the model in a lively history that provides fascinating evidence of the theory X  X  operation. This same casual style, however, may turn off advanced students X  X r those who like their discussion straight up with little embellishment. The author X  X  obvious affinity for cryptic pop communication theorist Mar-shall McCluhan might also turn off readers hoping to see less flashy but arguably more substantial the-orists and theories (an introduction to agenda setting or framing would have been welcome in the discussion of the  X  X ired world X ). Finally, Meadow X  X  discussion of modern society fails to adequately con-sider the Internet X  X  inversion of the general model of communication X  X ts conflation of source and receiver.

Messages , Meanings , and Symbols is an excellent text for undergraduates beginning their study of communication and information. Even the seasoned communications professional looking for a refresher will likely experience a few  X  X ight bulb X  moments X  X nd this is no small feat on the part of the author.
