 Digital Projects Management System (DPMS) is one of main application systems of  X  X igital Yellow River X . DPMS is to conduct remote safety monitoring on Yellow River flood control projects, based on computer network built for the  X  Digital Yellow River X  project and service platform, depending on sensors built in the projects, exterior digital photography survey equipments, 3s technology etc modern and traditional maintenance scheme, provide decision making support to project management under the condition of visualization  X  intensify the scientific and predictive feature of decision making and ensure project safety and realize normal benefits of flood control. DPMS is a must for realizing modernization of project management. 2.1 Present Situation of Projects Since the Yellow River was trained by human being, in order to prevent flood, embankment of lower Yellow River has been elevated and thickened for 4 times and relatively systematic river training projects construction have been carried out. 
Sanmenxia, Xiaolangdi, Luhun and Guxian reservoirs were constructed in main flood control project system of  X  X etarding in the upper reach, discharging in the lower reach, detention with projects along the banks X  was initially formed. Depending on these measures and guard from people and army along the Yellow River, its safety was ensured in past years. 
At present, there are 36 channel projects, 920 dams or buttress and embankment protection projects in the Yumenkou-Tongguan reach of middle Yellow River. The total project length is 139 Km. There are 40 protection projects, 262 dams, buttress in the reach from Tongguan to the dam of Sanmenxia reservoir. There are 363 Km long embankment, 59 vulnerable guiding projects, 1211 dam, buttress and embankment protection projects in the lower Weihe River. The project length is 122 Km. The length of all kinds of embankment protection projects in lower Yellow River is 2291 Km. Among it, embankment of main stream is 1371 Km, embankment in detention area is 314 Km, embankment of tributaries is 196 Km and others is 264 Km. The embankment in the estuary is 146 Km. There are 215 various types of vulnerable spots, 6317 dam, buttress and embankment protection projects, with project length 419 Km. There are 231 guiding and beach protection projects, 4459 buttress, with project length 427 Km. In addition, there are 79 embankment protection projects, 405 protection dam, total 107 sluice for flood conveyance or water abstraction. The construction of these flood control projects enhances the flood control capability in the middle and lower Yellow River. Due to the long amounts of items, project maintenance management is a heavy task. 2.2 Projects Management Situation Being the subordinate agency of Ministry of Water Resources in Yellow River Basin, YRCC represents Ministry of Water Resources to conduct administrative functional authority of the Yellow River. The Department of Construction and Management is one administrative branch of YRCC. It is mainly responsible for projects construction management and operation management of the Yellow River basin. 3 levels of bureau including provincial level, municipal level and county level are established under YRCC. In the lower Yellow River, there established Henan Bureau, Shandong Bureau, 14 bureaus of municipal level( administrative bureau), 63 bureaus ( municipal, district) of county level ( including 12 sluice management bureau). 18407 staff are engaging in project operation management. In the middle Yellow River, there established Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sanmenxia bureau of municipal level, 18 bureaus of county level, altogether 600 staff. Yellow River project management has adopted the management mode of combining special management and multi-agency management for years. This mode played a role under the planning economy mechanism for keeping projects integrated, improving flood control capability of projects. However, with the development of market economy and the deepening of separating management and maintenance, namely reform of project management, previous mode doesn X  X  meet the demand of modern project management any longer. It is urgent to build a new management mode to be fit for modernized project management. Project management includes management during the construction period and that during the operation period. Information collection and transmission 2.3 Information Classification Information of DPMS can be classified into 3 classes according to the usage: information on project construction management, information on project operation management and information on project safety supervision. The forms of information information on project construction management can be classified into comprehensive information on project construction and ma nagement information of each side of management can be classified into assessment information of project management, instruments management information of maintenance staff, management information of project environment. 2.4 Information Transmission DPCM is a distributed multi-level system that covers the whole river. According to the administrative institution and operation mechanism of YRCC, it is composed of 4 levels management of YRCC, provincial level, municipal level and county level. The agency of YRCC is Yellow River Project Management Centre. The provincial agencies are Yellow River Henan Project Management Centre and Yellow River Shandong Project Management Centre. The corresponding management centers are also established at county level. Shanxi Project Management Bureau, Shaanxi Project Management Bureau, Sanmenxia Project Management Bureau, Sanmenxia Reservoir, Yellow River Project Management Centre of Shanxi Bureau, Shaanxi Bureau are directly under the Project Management Centre of YRCC. Data transmission is mainly among the 4 levels or between 4 levels and spots. 3.1 Project Construction Management System (DCMS) DCMS is to meet the demand of preparation period, construction period and approving management. It consists of project bidding invitation management, project construction management and project approving management. 3.1.1 Project Bidding Invitation Management (1) Bidding and bidding invitation management. It includes the publishing and enquiry of all kinds of bidding invitation information, synchronized management of bidding bidding invitation project information 4 . (2) Enterprise quality management. It includes quality management of enterprise under YRCC and that of construction partner. For enterprise under YRCC, they are under dynamic management of initial assessment, submitting, annual assessment and quality class etc. The quality of construction partner need to be checked. 3.1.2 Project Construction Management (1) Project quality management. It is to build a project construction quality control and management system which is supervised by government, responsible by artificial person, guaranteed by construction unit and managed by supervision unit. It consists of objective control, organization and management, process control, document management, management regulations and quality analysis tools. (2) Project progress management. It is mainly to provide convenient functions such as data input, summary and statistic, report generation and database maintenance etc. construction unit, supervision governing unit, quality supervision governing unit. Due progress of the project in time. (3) Project budget management. It is mainly to realize dynamic budget management, investment control of supervision unit, project cost budget management. It should be able to manage and analyze document, announcements, modification and contracts on project budget and fund management, adjust project cost in real time and provide project investment information for all construction partners 6 . (4) Project construction management. It is mainly to include all inquiry and progress management. 3.1.3 Project Approving Management It includes project approving and project document management, provides relevant stipulations, regulations and technique data service for different periods of project, as well as management of all kinds of documents, important files and approving information during project construction. 3.2 Project Operation Management System It provides basic information of project operation progress, serving management and decision making and publishing relevant stipulations, standards, methods and project management and operation, objectives assessment, river involved construction management, subordinate establishments management, management and maintenance group management, project environment management. 3.3 Project Safety Monitoring System flood control projects. It is main part of the hydraulic project construction and management system, the basis of project safety assessment system, maintenance and management system and the operation of management system, as well as the important parameter and proof of water regulation decision. It consists of two parts: online analysis and processing and monitoring apparatuses management. 3.3.1 Online Analysis and Processing monitoring apparatuses. It is different from safety assessment of safety assessment system, usually not for proof of forecasting and decision making. However, it is significant in judgment of the abnormal data, improvement of daily management, assessment. Online analysis and processing is realized through building a project safety forecasting model and establishing corres ponding threshold. Threshold basically reflects the safety degree of project. When the threshold is exceeded, Warning signal will be reported. Safety forecasting model is built based on project design and construction data and historical informatio n are improved gradually with the operation of the system. Online analysis and processing pre-warning information is processed according to the levels of the corresponding unit. 3.3.2 Monitoring Apparatuses Management greatly impact the error of data collected. Th e situation of all kinds of instruments must be managed effectively and error of instruments must be corrected timely so that the project safety parameters can be truly reflected. Monitoring apparatuses management system possesses the function of dynamic management. 3.4 Project Safety Assessment System Project safety assessment system is to synthesize, analyze and process effective monitoring data and information observed, appropriately assess the interior and project rescue, strengthening and maintenance with safety and quality standard system and assessment model. The working process of the system includes two steps: The first monitoring system with safety assessment model; The second is to conduct synthesis assessment with the calculation result by the model put in the project safety assessment system which consists of database, expert experience base; Finally a series of indexes reflecting project safety operation were put forward. From the perspective of content and responsibility of project management, flood control project safety assessment need to be conducted in 4 aspects: normal assessment of flood control project safety, special items assessment, flood period assessment and real time assessment 2 . 3.5 Project Maintenance and Management System It is the main task and important responsibility of project management to conduct flood project, risk rescue and strengthening, maintaining and improving the flood control capability of projects, the project is kept integrated and the maxim management benefit of flood control project is pursued. Project maintenance and management system includes 3 parts: basic project information management, project maintenance decision supporting and project maintenance information management. 3.5.1 Basic Project Information Management Basic project information is basic information of Yellow River flood control projects (embankment, controlling and guiding project at vulnerable spots, sluices, hydraulic multi-purpose projects etc.) It includes data of geology of project, designing and planning, construction, close and operation as well as management data. It is to collect and process basic information of project according to standards and demands, store them in the database, meeting the demand of inquiry, summary and analysis of project GIS technology. 3.5.2 Project Management and Maintenance Decision Support Based on monitoring results of projects and project safety assessment results, a set of project maintenance scheme is generated automatically through project maintenance standard model. Then optimized project maintenance strategy are established and sorted according to their PRI using decisi on and conference system consisted of relevant stipulations, standard bases and expert experience bases. It is to achieve the goal of improving project maintenance decision making and realizing optimized resources allocation.  X  X igital Project Management X  is an important part of  X  X igital Yellow River X  and a brand-new systematic project with obvious social and economic benefits. After the system is constructed and put into use, it will bring great change to the working ideas and project management measures. The future is a society of information.
