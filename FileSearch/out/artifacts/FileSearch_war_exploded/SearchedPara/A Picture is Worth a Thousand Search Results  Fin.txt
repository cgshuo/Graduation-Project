 We present a simple and effective approach to complement search results for children X  X  web queries with child-oriented multimedia results, such as coloring pages and music sheets. Our approach determines appropriate media types for a query by searching Google X  X  database of frequent queries for co-occurrences of a query X  X  terms (e.g.,  X  X inosaurs X ) with pres-elected multimedia terms (e.g.,  X  X oloring pages X ). We show the effectiveness of this approach through an online user evaluation.
 H.5.0 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Gen-eral Experimentation, Human Factors children, Google, query suggestion, Mechanical Turk
Web search engines are not highly usable by children and young audiences [4], in part because results are presented to users in the form of a list of web page summaries, with a limited integration of mixed media (e.g., images). We be-lieve that children X  X  experiences with search engines would benefit from a greater emphasis on multimedia results, par-ticularly of media that are not typically presented as first-class entities. For example, while Google search results com-monly present images, there is no specialized presentation of interactive and learning media such as mazes, puzzles, tracing/coloring pages, music sheets, and games. We re-fer to these specialized media results as TotBytes , and we are building a search interface called collAge in which they can play a strong role in children X  X  search experiences. Our search engine web page currently acts as a thin wrapper between the user and Google search, where, for the user X  X  query, TotBytes are presented alongside fewer traditional web page search results. Figure 1 depicts a mockup of our system, showing a potential interface displaying TotBytes in response to a user X  X  query about dinosaurs.
 last letter 1  X  to Google Suggest [3], which generates a set of suggested queries G ( m i ). If m i  X  G ( m i ), it is considered to be a valid query (as m i is frequently issued by Google users), and it is dispatched to Google X  X  image search 2 , from which the URL of the first result is added to the set of TotBytes for the user X  X  query. The TotBytes can then be presented  X  with image links to the containing pages  X  to the user along-side traditional search results, as in Figure 1, although we leave the problems of presentation and ranking for future work. The combined processes of query suggestion lookup and image search take between 100-200 milliseconds on av-erage, and the process for each media type can be executed in parallel.
We conducted an online evaluation with adults to deter-mine if the TotBytes produced by collAge reflected the me-dia type for which they were constructed; for example, that the TotBytes for the  X  X usic sheet X  media type actually por-trayed music sheets. Our hypothesis was that collAge would produce more accurate results than an approach that sim-ply appended media terms without checking them against the database of popular queries. We first generated a set of queries Q eval with which to evaluate our approach, as, to our knowledge, there is no existing corpus of children X  X  web search queries. We constructed this set by collecting the titles of leaf subdirectories under the top-level topic  X  X ids and Teens X  from the Open Directory Project [2], which in-cluded titles such as  X  X inosaurs X  and  X  X gypt X . Though not necessarily reflective of queries that children would naturally generate, these queries suffice in this stage of evaluation as we are merely determining the extent to which collAge can determine coherent TotBytes for arbitrary queries.

Next, we generated a set of TotBytes TB for a random sample of queries from Q eval . For comparison, we also gen-erated a set of baseline TotBytes, where the query database did not include their corresponding media queries, and added this set to TB . For each b i  X  TB , we constructed an HTML page displaying the media term(s) (e.g.,  X  X aps X ) and image result from b i , a question asking if the image depicted an in-stance of the term (e.g., a map), and a  X  X es/No X  input form for users to record answers. These pages were uploaded to Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk [1] service, which presented the pages to human users, who answered their questions for a small payment. This produced a binary validity assessment for each b i . We then compared the number of valid as-sessments between the collAge and baseline TotBytes across each media type, and measured the significance of their dif-ferences using the two-tailed Fisher X  X  exact test.

Note that we assumed that a valid depiction of the media type partially validated that the media type was appropriate for the query. The theory was that less coherent combina-tions of queries and media terms are less likely to produce a result that depicts either query or media type. A limitation in this evaluation is that we do not ask for assessments for whether the TotBytes reflect the topic of the original query. The last letter is removed from the query because Google Suggest will not offer a suggestion that is an exact match to the query provided.
The results may be filtered for certain media types; for example, given a media query for the maze media type, we filter the result list to include only images that are grayscale and feature line art.
