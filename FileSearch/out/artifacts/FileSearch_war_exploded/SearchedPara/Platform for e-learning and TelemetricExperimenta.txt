 Particularly in environments where experiments are the core elements of learning, it is considerably important how ex-periments are accessible and operable. Especially in the field of production engineering education, real-time remote "hands on" laboratories did not exist in the past. During the EU funded project "Platform for e-learning and Tele-metric Experimentation (PeTEX)", the team has designed and developed a prototype of a networked and distributed learning environment (see Figure 1) for individual and coop-erative lifelong learning aiming at experiment-based educa-tion in production engineering. The distributed prototype consists of three physical real laboratories in the areas of material characterization in forming technology, cutting us-ing a milling machine and joining using friction stir welding. The experiments are holistically integrated into the modu-larized learning material. The proposed demonstration will focus on the example of material characterization in form-ing technology and will include the presentation of online learning material and the tele-operated experiment.

Both presenters are essentially necessary for the enrichment of the demonstration and the comprehensive handling of both focal points "telemetric experimental set-up in mechani-cal engineering" and "e-learning" of our interdisciplinary sub-ject.

The principle goal of this project is the establishment of individual and group oriented learning within a system able to sustain a multi-country learning community in the field of production engineering. Within the project, a comprehen-sive prototype of an e-learning platform for the development, implementation, and delivery of educational and training programs using integrated tele-operated experiments was de-signed.

The physical real laboratories are located in three Euro-pean countries:

The project "PeTEX-Platform for e-Learning and Tele-metric Experimentation" has been funded by the EU (project-code: 142270-LLP-1-2008-1-DE-LEONARDO-LMP; duration: 2008-2010). Further information can be found on the official project 1 and ADAM website 2 .
The proposed demonstration will illustrate one of the tele-operated real-time experiments in the field of mechanical engineering, namely the area of forming. Within that sub-ject, one of the most important and fundamental tests for material characterization is the uniaxial tensile test. This experiment has been comprehensively adapted and holisti-cally integrated for tele-operated interaction. An overview isgiveninFigure 2. The whole platform system is based on a customized installation of the Learning Management System Moodle including interactive self-learning modules, a learning community area, where the social software com-ponents for course communication, user-generated content, and resource sharing have been integrated. Within that con-text, the learner is provided with access to the telemetric experimental set-ups.

This framework facilitates the configuration of walkthroughs as specific training sequences for different levels, from be-ginner to advanced levels. The latter, more complex self-directed and problem-based learning walkthrough will have www.dtpm.unipa.it/petex/index.htm www.adam-europe.eu/adam/project/view.htm?prj=4097 comprehensive means of navigating through the entire envi-ronment, with the opportunity of interacting with all learn-ing objects and solving complex problems.

For the current prototype stage, PeTEX has defined three consecutive learning levels: 1. During the testing phase, the beginner-level students 2. Intermediate-level learners will have wider opportuni-3. Advanced learners will have to solve a subject-specific
We call this approach "experimental e-learning". Using the approach of socio-technical systems and networks, tech-nical, educational and social aspects are integrated into the design process.

During the demonstration, systematic "walks" through the developed learning material organized in appropriate mod-ules will be shown. The learner will walk through a learning path aimed at 1. introducing to forming technologies in connection with 2. identifying the most relevant process issues to be used 3. analyzing the data.

The demonstration will show the real-time, tele-operated set-up of a uniaxial tensile test where the learner is provided with an interface showing
Finally, the learner is provided with the data and results as well as the stream and an HD movie of the experiment for use for his/her own analyses and for discussion within the community.
