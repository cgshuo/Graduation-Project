 While there are many ways to develop search expertise, I maintain that most members of the general public do so in an inefficient manner. One reason is that, with current tools, is difficult to observe experts as a means of acquiring search expertise in a scalable fashion. This calls for a redesign of computer -mediated communication tools to make individual search strategies visible to other users. I present a research agenda to investigate this claim, which draws upon theories of social learning. I u se design -based research to build novel systems that enable imitation -based learning of search expertise.

Tolkien Expertise in web search has become so crucial a skill that it is referred to as one of several  X  X igital literacies X  [3] . It includes genera ting appropriate keywords, understanding the reasoning behind ranking order, discerning legitimate from illegitimate pages, identifying relevance of individual sites, reformulating queries, and synthesizing information gleaned from results. Web search inte rfaces have evolved in such a way that users can learn how to use them iteratively, through trial -and -error, rather than reading or following best practices. There is currently lacking a sociocultural practice of learning to search from one another. Simpl y showing expert search queries and results to other users would not lead to conceptual learning. This is because any individual search is not often reusable for other users X  information needs. That is, information needs vary widely and are context -relevan t, so viewing another X  X  search results may not be most efficient for teaching expertise of the search process itself. It is the menta l processes underlying search that are important to imitate. To transfer these processes, we draw upon the theory of cognitive apprenticeship [2], which posits that experts should reveal tacit and implicit components of the ir thought processes to the learn er in order to help them construct a valid mental model of how to enact the practice.
 We design and study technologies that enable individuals to a) transmit their own search processes and b) model others X  search processes and practices. Such technologies would  X  X ake knowledge visible X  [1] between participants, creating opportunities for cognitive apprenticeship. To this end, my research aims to answer the following research questions: Can search expertise be positively and significantly impacted by technol ogy -mediated social interaction? What are the design principles for such technologies ? Our first work that investigated this idea was the ClassSearch system, meant for a classroom environment. Search metadata from student computers was projected onto a sha red display in tag cloud and related forms. Students used the newfound common ground created by the system to generate interactions between each other about search practices. This system motivated further inquiry into technology -mediated social learning of expertise. The next research platform we built, LineHive.com, rests upon a simple premise: it is currently difficult to communicate a summary of a set of related websites and people would also use such a tool to transmit navigation and path information to one another. The user can choose what sites to string together into a list. To incent users to share search processes, we represent navigation paths as attractive, chronological timelines that can be embedded in any page as a widget (like a YouTube video) . The timeline visualization is meant as a communicative proxy for users to share insights found on the Internet with one another. The  X  X earch expertise X  learning goal is co-opting this medium. My work will identify th e characteristics of peer search processes that will positively impact one X  X  expertise and will determine how and when to display those processes to improve expertise. It draws upon prior work in search instruction and social learning to design novel, scal able systems to improve search expertise. [1] Bereiter, C., Scardamalia, M. (2003).
