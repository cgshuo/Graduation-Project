 focused on MCDM problems to obtain reliable results by con-sidering the assessment of the DMs instead of the assessment of an individual DM (e.g., Chen and Hwang, 1992 ; Deng et al., 2000 ;
Mojtahedi et al., 2010 ; Kuo et al., 2007 ; Vahdani and Hadipour, 2011 ). On the other hand, MCDM methods contain the DMs X  subjective judgments and preferences, including qualitative and/ or quantitative criteria ratings as well as the weights of criteria ( Vahdani et al., 2013 ; Mousavi et al., 2012a , 2012b ). This issue has further intensified the uncertainty of assessments inherent in decision-making process. Under this situation, experts or DMs may not be able to apply precise numbers to describe their assessments; however, they can utilize linguistic variables by their knowledge and experience. With this approach, they can provide more realistic and reasonable judgments and feelings.
Hence, the concept of fuzzy numbers can be integrated into the group decision making under multiple criteria known as fuzzy multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), and can be regarded as an effective approach to solve complex decision-making problems ( Shih et al., 2007 ; Vahdani et al., 2011 ). propose compromise solution methods for the MCGDM problems under a fuzzy environment. For instance, Chen (2000) developed the TOPSIS method for the group decision making in a fuzzy environment. The performance rating of alternatives and the criteria weights are presented by linguistic terms and then described in triangular fuzzy numbers. Chen et al. (2006) the individual regret, which can be highly important in the ranking process of the compromise solution methods, is clearly regarded using new assessment indices rather than the previous studies; (4) the proposed compromise solution method constructs the ideal separation and anti-ideal separation matrixes based on the operations between triangular fuzzy numbers to discriminate among the alternatives in the group decision-making problems, unlike the previous studies which were based on Euclidean distances of each alternative with respect to the reference points; and (5) the proposed method considers both subjective judgment and objective information (both crisp and fuzzy numbers) for the group decision-making problem in real-life applications.
This method is established upon the concept of positive ideal and negative ideal solutions concurrently for solving group decision-making problems with multi-criteria and multi-judges under uncertainty. Finally, a real case study and an application example for the purpose of the contractor selection illustrate utilizing the presented fuzzy compromise solution method in construction industry.

The remaining of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 , the traditional VIKOR method is briefly introduced. New fuzzy compromise solution method is proposed to solve MCGDM problems in Section 3 . Section 4 presents the case study and an application example for the contractor selection problem in the construction industry. The paper is concluded in Section 5 . 2. VIKOR method
A compromise solution for a decision-making problem with conflicting criteria can help the DMs to make a reliable decision. Establishing a compromise solution is usually preferred rather than an optimal solution because of conflicting tangible and intangible criteria. The foundation for a compromise solution was first intro-duced by Yu (1973) and Zeleny (1982) and later followed by Opricovic (1998) ,and Opricovic and Tzeng (2002 , 2004) .Thecom-promise solution is a feasible solution which is the closest to the ideal solution representing an agreement reached by mutual concessions. Two analytical multi-criteria tec hniques, namely TOPSIS and VIKOR, are often regarded as the well-known compromise solution methods for the MCDM problems. These methods are widely applied to numerous management and engineering fields (e.g., Mousavi et al., 2011 ; Vahdani et al., 2010 ).

Over the recent decades, other MCDM methods have been presented such as PROMETHEE and ELECTRE. These MCDM meth-ods differ in many theoretical background and type of results given ( Ebrahimnejad et al., 2012 ). Some MCDM methods have been constructed especially for one specific problem, and they are not suitable for other decision problems. For detail discussions, readers are referred to Ebrahimnejad et al. (2010 , 2012) .
Suppose an MCDM problem that has m alternatives, A 1 , y , A m and n criteria, C 1 , y , C n . Each alternative is assessed with respect to the n criteria. The rating of alternative i with respect to criterion j is denoted by f ij , and the best and worst values are regarded as f n j and f j , respectively. All the performance ratings assigned to the alternatives versus each criterion from a decision relative weight vector about the criteria, satisfying P n j  X  1 w j  X  1. Then, the VIKOR method can be summarized as follows ( Opricovic and Tzeng, 2002 , 2004 ):
Step 1. Determine the best f n j and the worst f j values of all criteria functions j  X  1,2, y , n . If the j th function represents a benefit then: f n j  X  max where 8 &lt; : , u and g are regarded as a weight for the strategy of the majority criteria, whereas (1 u ) and (1 g ) are the weights of the individual regret. The values of u and g fall within the range of 0 to 1, and these strategies can be compromised by u  X  0.5 and g  X  0.5.
 Step 11. Calculate collective index ( CI ).
 The collective index is calculated by:
CI i  X  t i  X  1 Z where the second term refers to all i for which Z i 4 0 while f i 0
Step 12. Rank the preference order. The best satisfactory alternative can be determined according to preference rank order of t i and Z i . The minimum value of the CI indicates the better performance for the alternative i. 4. Application of the proposed method in solving problems 4.1. Illustrative example 1 (real case study)
In this section, a real case study is presented to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed new fuzzy compromise solution method for the contractor selection problem in the construction industry. In general, the contractor selection process is comprised of five stages (e.g., Ilker Topcu, 2004 ; Hatush and Skitmore, 1997 ; Holt et al., 1995 ). These are as follows: Project packaging Invitation Prequalification and analyze the capabilities of contractors to perform a contract satisfactorily if it is awarded to them. It creates a client with a standing list of potential contractors to invite to tender for similar types of project on a regular basis, or only a project list of contractors to be invited to tender for a specific project. Then, bid evaluation deals with same processes but happens at the post-tender stage, and includes the consideration of the bid amount along with the contractors X  capabilities. Hence, contractor prequalification and bid evaluation are the MCDM processes that occur within a company X  overall strategy. They include the development and consideration of a wide range of necessary and sufficient decision criteria as well as the participation of group of the DMs. In the last two decades, in spite of a huge increase in the complexity of projects and clients X  needs as well as an associated increase in alternative forms of project delivery system, analytical methods for the contractor selection and evaluation have not significantly enhanced. Therefore, these analytical methods should be proposed and investigated. the client and is located in the city of Qazvin, Iran. The project title is Islamic Azad University X  X azvin Branch Innovation Park (IAU X  X BIP). The project is among the pioneering scientific center of the country aiming at discovering and expanding knowledge, enhancing relation between universities and industries and also managing technology transfers. This project covers 19,000 square meters and has two phases; the first phase, covering the area about 13,300 square meters, includes multi-activity fields, library and study areas, research sites designed in three floors and the second phase includes technology tower designed in 10 floors covering 5,700 square meters. This technology tower includes research and managing areas. The funding of this project is estimated to be $5,696,500. The building of this innovation park is located in the north of university and construction is in progress. The plan is circular which includes a main building and four other building connecting via corridors.
 and DM 3 ), is formed to evaluate and select the best contractor for AU-QBIP. In this case study, three DMs have equal degree of the importance because of the same backgrounds and experience. Five potential contractors ( A 1 ,A 2 , y ,A 5 ) are chosen, and five main criteria along with 20 sub-criteria ( C i ,i  X  1,2, y ,20) are selected for further assessments (Steps 1 and 2).

In this case study due to the DMs X  judgments, all performance ratings of alternatives versus selected criteria are expressed by linguistic variables; however, the proposed compromise solution method can handle the evaluation process by considering sub-jective judgments and objective information concurrently. The importance weights of the five main criteria and 20 sub-criteria are expressed by using linguistic terms, which are defined in Table 1 and are depicted in Fig. 1 . Also, the performance ratings of the alternatives with respect to sub-criteria are characterized by linguistic terms, which are defined in Table 2 and are depicted in Fig. 2 .

The selected criteria are provided for the contractor selection problem in Table 3 ( Hatush and Skitmore, 1997 ). The weights of these five criteria and 20 sub-criteria are obtained by 3 DMs according to linguistic terms described in Table 1 and are given in Tables 3 and 4 . Then, the ratings of alternatives with respect to sub-criteria are represented by three DMs according to linguistic terms in Table 2 and are illustrated in Table 5 (Step 3). The ratings of five contractors (alternatives) obtained by all three DMs versus each sub-criterion are aggregated in Eq. (10) . Also, the relative importance of selected criteria provided by all DMs is aggregated by Eq. (11) (Step 4). It is worth noting that the final weights of sub-criteria are obtained by multiplying their weights by the corresponding weights of the main criteria.

The normalized fuzzy decision-making matrix and the weighted normalized fuzzy decision-making matrix are con-structed (Steps 5 and 6). Consequently, positive ideal and nega-tive ideal solutions are determined (Step 7). The respective results are presented in Table 6 . Then, ideal separation matrix A 2 and anti-ideal separation matrix A 3 are constructed by using Eqs. (18) and (19) (Step 8).
 , compromise solution method is operated to observe the new results. Hence, the behavior of the proposed method against these weight changes is discussed. Six weight changes are realized for the analysis. In fact, more different weight exchanges can be utilized to expand the analysis. The changes in results can be observed, and this helps the DMs determine priorities and make the assessment process easier for the contractor selection pro-blem in the construction industry.

In the following, we utilize the fuzzy VIKOR method presented by Sanayei et al. (2010) for the purpose of ranking the potential contractors (alternatives) and comparing the results in each of two application examples. By virtue of evaluation of criteria with respect to each other and also the evaluation of alternatives with respect to criteria summarized in Tables 3 X 5 (for illustrative example 1) and Tables 8 and 9 (for illustrative example 2), the respective results are presented in Table 14 , respectively. The results of the proposed fuzzy compromise solution method and the recent fuzzy VIKOR method by Sanayei et al. (2010) are somewhat similar. Both decision-making methods provide similar priorities for the contractor selection problem through two applications in the construction industry. Thus, we can conclude that the proposed fuzzy compromise solution method is more reliable than the solutions obtained by professional experts. 5. Conclusion
The fuzzy compromise solution approach has concentrated on evaluating and ranking from a set of alternatives in an uncertain environment with respect to multiple conflicting criteria. Impre-cision in the multi-criteria group decision making has been expressed by using fuzzy set theory to define criteria and the relative importance of selected criteria. This paper has presented a new compromise solution method by a group of experts or the DMs to effectively solve the evaluation and selection problems under a fuzzy environment. The introduced method extends the Pareto optimal solution that helps the DMs reach an acceptable compromise of the maximum group utility of the majority and the minimum of the individual regret of the opponent. In this method, the relative importance (weights) of criteria and the ratings of alternatives can be described by linguistic terms and then converted to triangular fuzzy numbers. Two indices have been introduced for the purpose of ranking based on the strategy of the majority criteria and the individual regret in order to effectively consider the relative distance of alternatives from the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions. Then, a new collective index has been developed to discriminate among alternatives in the evaluation process based on constructing ideal separation and anti-ideal separation matrixes simultaneously. In fact, the effect of the weight of the strategy of the majority of criteria as well as the weight of the individual regret, which can be highly influen-tial on the assessment process of the compromise solution methods, is properly considered by employing new indices rather than the previous studies. The proposed fuzzy compromise solution method has constructed the ideal separation and anti-ideal separation matrixes based on the operations between triangular fuzzy numbers to distinguish among the alternatives under the group decision-making process, unlike the previous studies which were based on Euclidean distances of each alter-native with respect to the ideal solutions. The method can deal with the situations in which fuzzy and crisp evaluations are simultaneously required. The proposed method assists DMs to take data in the forms of linguistic terms and/or crisp numbers through the group decision-making process. This leads to more realistic and reliable decision-making process in real-life situa-tions. The method is established upon the concept of positive
