Last but not least, the works hop also focuses on global systems for population monitoring and large-scale data analysis and management. Sub-topics within this theme include: 1) Global spread of disease: models, t ools and interventions; 2) Data analytics for clinical care; 3) Systems for Telemedicine; 4) Pharmacy informatics systems and drug discovery; 5) Collaboration technologies for healthcare; 6) Healthcare workflow management; 7) Meta-s tudies of community, national and international programs. We have selected nine papers for oral presentations. These papers cover a range of topics, includi ng knowledge discover from health data warehouse, data schema de sign, pharmaceutical informatics, medical record retrieval, mobile applications and simulations. Schryver, Shankar and Xu proposed to integrate multiple knowledge discovery methods into an analyst X  X  workflow for the complex public health information data set, which allows analysts to progressively gain a deeper understanding of the data set[4]. Their analyst X  X  workflow includes correlation matrices analysis, multivariate outlier analysis, predictive analytics, confirmatory factor analysis and visual analytics. Morton, Mahoui and Gibson tackle the data privacy preservation problem which is very challenging and interesting[3]. They propose an automated k-anonymity approach that uses clustering to maximize the utility of the data while ensuring that the data privacy is maintained. Experi ment results demonstrate the importance of incorporating data constraint rules. Lora, Sabaini, Combi and Moretti leveraged the TimeER modeling technique to design a reconciled schema for a pharmacovigilance data house, called VigiSegn[2]. They present the analysis of different data sources, introduce a reconciled layer of merging all the data needed to conduct pharmacovigilance activities, and adopt TimeER to handle data X  X  time aspect. Bian, Topaloglu and Yu describe an approach to find drug users and potential adverse events resulted from the drug by analyzing a large amount of Twitter tweets[1] . Tweets are analyzed using NLP techniques, followed by bu ilding of SVM. To handle the scale of data, high performance computing platform is utilized. The paper suggests that the acquired knowledge from tweets is beneficial to government agenci es and companies to detect adverse drug event. Yang, Yang, Liang, and Zhang proposed an association mining technique to detect drug safety si gnals from a health social media site, MedHelp [8]. They have investigated several statistical indicators, including leverage, lift, and proportional reporting ratios. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is promising in identifying drug sa fety signals and overcomes the limitations of the traditional techniques that mine the signals through centralized report system and electronic health records. Yadav and Poellabauer describe the design of a personalized search engine that utilizes patient data to retrieve credible and reliable health information from the web[7]. Their system is built on top of a Lucene based Web crawler with credible health resources as seed URLs and is linked to a PHR. When a user logs in and queries, the results are cu stomized based on user's health profile to elevate the rank of search results that appear most suitable to this user's current health problems. Turgut, Meyer, Morana, Heuten a nd Boll describe a case study to derive guidelines for the development of a user centered, non-invasive and usable electronic application for food intake monitoring[6]. They examined how people use nutrition diaries, what data they input and what types of diaries they prefer. Results reveal useful guidelines for mobile nutrition diary design. Zhu and Carterette present a health record search system for finding patients matching inclusion criteria for clinical studies [9]. Their system leverages multi-level evidences and combine proven statistical IR models in an i nnovative way. Experiment results demonstrate that their system achieved substantial improvement over a strong baseline for searching flat-text health records. Subramaniam, Chundi, Muthuraj, Margalit and Sim tackle an interesting task of automatically generate spatial distortion to support prostheses design[5]. They propose a simulation architecture to incorporate distortion models into the simulation of prosthetic vision. A 3D a ffine algebra based method is introduced to generate various type s of distortions of an image. There is an increasing interest in advancing information technology for effective healthcare and wellness . The SHB Workshop will provide the platform for ongoing discussions on this topic and will allow exchange of research ideas and works.
