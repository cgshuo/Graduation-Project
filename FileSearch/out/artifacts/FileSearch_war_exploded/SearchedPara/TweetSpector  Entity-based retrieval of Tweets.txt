People readily express their opinions about the various products, companies, TV shows etc., on Twitter 1 . These tweet messages are thus a rich source of information that can be exploited to understand the sentiments about the con-cerned products or services. Retrieving the tweets related to given entities is however a challenging task as their names are often (deliberately) ambiguous, e.g. Apple, Blackberry, Friends, etc. Nevertheless, identifying the relevant entities is an essential rst step to develop reliable sentiment analy-sis techniques that is not considered in existing systems, for example TweetFeel 2 , TwitterSentiment 3 .

While there is a number of techniques for identifying named entities in unstructured text, they are often not directly ap-plicable in this case, as tweet messages are very short (max-imal 140 characters). This demonstrator introduces Tweet-Spector, a tool that addresses this retrieval task and enables to link tweet messages to a given entity. Our retrieval meth-ods rely on classi cation techniques that exploit our concise descriptions of entity-relevant information, also called entity pro les.
 The demonstrator presents the following features of Tweet-Spector: -Entity Pro le Creation: TweetSpector supports auto-matic pro le creation, where we apply named-entity recog-nition, NLTK, wordnet and Web data extraction techniques to construct pro les for an entity, given a relevant Web-page. TweetSpector also enables manual pro le construc-tion, where users can construct arbitrary entity pro les, as well as manual and automatic updates for initially con-structed pro les (thus the pro les are dynamic). The pro les can also be visualized using Word Clouds. ht tp://www.twitter.com http://www.tweetfeel.com http://twittersentiment.appspot.com
