Data mining aims to develop a new generation of tools to intelligently assist humans in analyzing mountains of data. 
Over the past few years, great progress has been made in both research and applications of data mining. Data mining systems have helped many businesses by exposing previously unknown patterns in their databases, which were used to improve profits, enhance customer services, and ultimately achieve a competitive advantage. DM-II (Data Mining -Integration and Interestingness). 
DM-II is a PC-based system working in Windows 95/98/NT environment. Apart from the normal components of a data mining system, DM-II has a number of unique and advanced sub-systems. These sub-systems have been applied in many real-life applications, including education applications, insurance application, accident application, disease application, drug screening application, image classification, etc. Here, we focus on discussing the following sub-systems: 
CBA: CBA originally stands for Classification-Based KDD-99 San Diego CA USA CBA is a versatile system that has many unique features. We discuss each of them below. Figure 1 shows the main screen interface of CBA. CBA unifies or integrates classification and association rule mining. It focuses on mining a special subset of association rules, called class association rules (CARS), which have a fixed target attribute on the right-hand side of the rules. An existing association rule mining algorithm [l] is adapted to mine CARS that satisfy the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. Mining CARS is by no means a restriction. By setting the target attribute to dummy, CBA can mine normal association rules without a fixed target from table form data or transaction form data. building accurate classifiers based on the set of discovered CARS. Experiment results show that the classifier built by CBA is in general more accurate [lo] than that produced by the state-of-the-art classification system C4.5 (both c4.5rules and c4Stree) [16]. In addition, CBA has another major advantage over the existing classification systems. Due to the use of the association rule mining technique, CBA is able to discover all rules that exist in the database. Traditional classification systems aims to produce a small set of rules to form a classifier [ 161. This results in many interesting/useful rules not being discovered. been used in all our applications. It is shown to be superior to traditional classification systems because of its high classification accuracy and its ability to generate rules that cannot be generated by classification systems. to the grant of a loan, and owning a house is also positively correlated to obtaining a loan. Then, the following association is not so surprising: 
R3: Job = yes, Own-house = yes + Loan = approved because it intuitively follows Rl and R2. We can use Rl and R2 to provide a summary of the three rules. Rl and R2 are DS rules as they set the direction (positive correlation) that is followed by R3. In real-life data sets, a large number of associations are like R3. essential relationships of the domain. The non-DS rule is not surprising if we already know the DS rules. However, this does not say that non-DS rules are not interesting. Non-DS rules can provide further details about the domain, e.g., the non-DS rule above (R3). If the user is interested in the non-DS rules, the DS rules can point him/her to them because non-DS rules are combinations of DS rules. discovered rules can be huge, the number of DS rules is very small. They can be analyzed manually by the human user to obtain the essential relationships in the data. He/she can then focus his/her attention on those interesting aspects of the relationships, and to see the relevant non-DS rules. This technique makes association rule mining effective and practical for data sets whose items are highly correlated. The user can now obtain a complete picture of the domain without being overwhelmed by a huge number of rules. See [ 111 for the detailed technique. 2.3 Mining association rules with multiple Traditional association rule mining aims to discover all item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf) constraints. Since only one minsup is used for the whole database, the model implicitly assumes that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similar frequencies in the data. This is, however, seldom the case in real-life applications. In many applications, some items appear very frequently in the data, while others rarely appear. If minsup is set too high, those rules that involve rare items will not be found. To find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, minsup has to be set very low. This may cause combinatorial explosion. This dilemma is called the rare item problem. split the data into a few blocks according to the frequencies of the items and then mine association rules in each block with a different minsup [7], or group a number of related rare items together into an abstract item so that this abstract item is more frequent [7]. However, either approach is satisfactory. set is inadequate because it cannot capture the inherent natures and/or frequency differences of the items in the database. We have extended the existing association rule model to allow the user to specify multiple minimum Unexpected condition rules: A discovered rule Ai E A has 
Purpose: these rules show the user that there are other Both-side unexpected rules: A discovered rule Ai E A is 
Purpose: these rules remind the user that there are other Visualization component: After the discovered rules are analyzed, IAS displays different types of potentially interesting rules to the user. It does so by showing the essential aspects of these rules in a single screen such that it can take advantage of the human visual capabilities to identify the truly interesting rules easily and quickly. A screen dump is given in Figure 2. units: conforming rules visualization unit, unexpected condition rules visualization unit, unexpected consequent rules visualization unit, both-side unexpected rules visualization unit. These units are intuitively located on the screen to facilitate visual inspection. interesting rules, especially the unexpected rules and/or exceptional rules. In these applications, typically there are thousands of discovered rules. Without IAS, it would be very hard to analyze these large numbers of rules. See [ 133 A normal rule miner (classification rule miner or association rule miner) cannot give these kinds of crucial and actionable information. LMS implemented a novel technique to perform the landscape mining task. The world around us changes constantly. Knowing and adapting to changes is an important aspect of our lives. 
To businesses, knowing what is changing and how it has changed are also of critical importance. There are two main objectives for mining changes: 1. To follow the trends, i.e., to produce products (or 2. To remedy or to prevent undesirable changes. 
In many applications, mining for changes can be more important than producing models for prediction. A model, no matter how accurate, is passive because it can only predict based on patterns mined in the old data. It should not lead to actions that may change the environment because otherwise, the model will cease to be accurate. Significant changes often trigger immediate actions to alter the domain environment. to discover changes that have occurred in the context of decision tree classification and association rule mining. 
In the past few years, many data mining systems, both commercial systems and research prototypes have appeared [e.g., 3, 2, 4, 61. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no system that is able to unify classification and association rule mining tasks. There is no system that is able to summarize the discovered rules. 
There is no association rule miner that can mine association rules using multiple minimum supports. 
There is also no existing system that is able to help the user perform interestingness analysis of the rules. Apart from these unique and advanced features, FM-11 also has sub-systems for change mining and for discovering the landscape of data, which are also useful and important for real-life data mining applications.
