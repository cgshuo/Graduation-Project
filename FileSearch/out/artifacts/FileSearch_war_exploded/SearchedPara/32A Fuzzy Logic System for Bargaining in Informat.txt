 CHRISTOS ANAGNOSTOPOULOS, Ionian University The current form of the Web integrates a huge number of information sources avail-able to end-users. Users (humans) have the opportunity to navigate and search in millions of Web pages. However, this becomes a tedious, nonscalable task for human capabilities. Users cannot browse and process numerous sources in order to find the in-formation that best matches their needs. Moreover, users do not know where pieces of interesting information are  X  X ocated X  and, for this reason, should spend time and effort to find and retrieve the appropriate information. At the resource X  X  side, information providers have a specific production cost. They should cover their expenses in order to provide quality services. In order to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages (i.e., scalability in information products searching, efficiency in information goods pur-chase) the use of intelligent mechanisms that facilitate the purchase and payment for information products (goods) is of high importance. A possible solution calls for the combination of the Intelligent Agent (IA) technology with the development of Informa-tion Marketplaces (IMs).

An IA is a software (or hardware) component capable of accomplishing the tasks delegated by its owner (the end X  X ser) [Nwana 1996]. An IA integrates Artificial Intel-ligence (AI) techniques for learning the preferences and the characteristics of its owner, thus increasing performance and efficiency in information retrieval. For instance, it undertakes the task of searching information in the Web for its owner. Due to its au-tonomous nature, it completes the preassigned tasks with the minimum user interven-tion. Moreover, it operates in dynamic environments where a number of characteristics are dynamically changing over time (e.g., number of participants, their preferences). An IA returns pieces of information that match with the needs/preferences/constraints of its owner. In this article, we propose an interaction methodology focusing on the buyer side that capitalizes on the autonomous nature of IAs. IAs assume the respon-sibility of negotiating the purchase of products designated by their owners (i.e., the buyers).

The combination of the discussed technologies (IAs and IMs) yields many advan-tages to the information goods sales domain. We study the combination of the IA and IM technologies and propose an interaction methodology between buyers and sell-ers. Our contribution is based on an interaction/negotiation protocol of alternating offers under strictly incomplete knowledge on the characteristics of the other entity. Such characteristics are the negotiation deadline, the lower/higher acceptable price, etc. Entities want to maximize their profits and follow the studied negotiation protocol while trying to buy/sell products in an IM. We explicitly focus on the buyer X  X  behav-ior and define a Fuzzy Logic (FL)-based decision-making system for establishing the buyer X  X  decisions. Such interaction is similar to a Bargaining Game (BG) [Fudenberg and Tirole 1991] with incomplete information about the characteristics of players. The established method under study allows the buyer to decide whether to accept offers issued by the seller or not.

An FL-based decision-making system is a system of inference. In such systems the objects of discourse and analysis are associated with information which is, or is allowed to be, incomplete, partially true, or partially possible [Zadeh 1965]. FL deals with incomplete information and provides knowledge representation models (i.e., Fuzzy Set Theory) through which an IA can automatically take decisions during the negotiation process in an IM. FL is appropriate for uncertain or incomplete information handling at the decision-making phase. FL principles express human expert knowledge and enable the automated interpretation of the results. In this article, we investigate the interaction between buyers and sellers in an open environment where players know nothing about the characteristics and the intentions of the rest of the entities. Some of the entity X  X  characteristics are: the time allowed for the negotiation process (i.e., deadline), the product valuation/cost, the intended profit (in the seller side), and the pricing strategies. In this case, FL proves highly advantageous, as it is a popular tool for decision making under uncertainty. The buyer should be able to decide on accepting or rejecting an offer proposed by sellers. Allowing a degree of fuzziness, at the decision-making stage, makes a buyer more flexible and capable of automatically handling the seller X  X  offers.

The adoption of FL involves: (1) representation of the buyer-expert knowledge, that is, the decision rules on the (2) inference of the next decision that the buyer should make at every round of the
The proposed system improves the efficiency in product purchase interactions, that is, increases the percentage of agreements between buyer and seller, decreases the re-quired time for each agreement, and minimizes the agreement price. The contribution of our work is threefold.  X  We define an FL-based system for representing and reasoning on the decisions taken by a buyer in an IM with the zero knowledge assumption on the characteristics of sellers.  X  We apply the proposed system in the buyer decision process. The buyer utilizes the FL system in order to determine the appropriate action at every round of the negotiation based on specific values of basic parameters (i.e., the remaining time until the deadline, the price difference between the seller price and the buyer price, the belief on the negotiation termination).  X  We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system with respect to:  X  the total number of agreements in a number of negotiations,  X  the agreement price (i.e., the final total agreed price of both sides),  X  the time required for the conclusion of each interaction process, and  X  the utility that the buyer gains from each agreement. The utility is based on the We adopt the findings discussed in Kolomvatsos et al. [2008] and Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008]. Such models focus on the seller side and, specifically, deal with the accurate determination of the seller X  X  deadline. In addition, we provide a com-parative assessment of our system with optimal stopping models. Optimal stopping is related to the selection of the appropriate time for taking an action (i.e., accepting an offer). The rest of this article is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the related work. Section 3 analyzes the proposed approach adopted by agents in order to buy/sell information products. Section 4 discusses the FL-base system with respect to fuzzy inference rules and the adaptation mechanism of the buyer. Section 5 presents our performance and comparative assessment results, while Section 6 concludes. In the literature one can find very interesting papers dealing with virtual market-places. In Collins et al. [1998], a collection of domain-specific markets is studied. Ev-ery market includes a number of services (e.g., administration services for identity verification, reliability). Buyers and sellers are represented by agents.

IMs are extensively studied in Ge et al. [2007] and Laufmann [1994]. In Ge et al. [2007], the authors describe a business model for information trading based on a reverse auction approach. A price discovery process is presented. Finally, authors list a number of existing IM intermediaries. In Laufmann [1994], the author studies Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) where some entities can exchange information pieces. An IM consists of a number of information goods and services components.
IAs in electronic marketplaces are discussed in Barbosa and Silva [2001]. In the presented architecture, there are three types of IAs: buyers, sellers, and intermediary agents. Agents represent the needs of their owners. An intermediary agent addresses issues like security and payments.

Kasbah [Chavez and Maes 1996] is an online multiagent system where agents rep-resent users in a marketplace (either buyers or sellers). It concerns an important agent framework. Agents communicate with a single marketplace entity in order to conclude their transactions. The strategy of each agent is based on the values of spe-cific parameters such as initial/lowest/highest acceptable price. After the matching process of buying and selling agents, the negotiation protocol indicates that buyers offer prices to sellers and vice versa up to the set deadlines. If an offer is rejected, the rejecting agent is able to issue a counter-proposal. Three types of entities can be discerned: anxious, cool-headed, and frugal, depicting three different functions (linear, quadratic, and cubic) for tuning their proposals over time. The proposed functions are either concave or linear. Users have a large degree of involvement in the transactions as they can change the strategy at every point of the interaction and need to approve the final agreement.

MAGMA [Tsvetovatyy et al. 1997] is an agent-based market architecture for prod-ucts. It supports manual and automatic negotiation. Administration services are de-fined (e.g., payment mechanisms). MAGMA includes an advertisement server where product descriptions are matched against buyer needs, and a  X  X ank X  that handles pay-ments and trader agents for buying, selling, or negotiating prices.

The aforementioned systems refer to general architectures where agents represent their owners. However, there are research efforts focusing on the interactions between buyers and sellers. In Carbo et al. [2003], the authors present an automated nego-tiation model which adopts FL for quantifying offers. Three alternative models are proposed for calculating counter-offers. The first model deals with crisp values while in the second model a fuzzy-set representation is adopted. In the third model, the authors adopt fuzzy linguistic terms in order to describe attributes of products taken into account, driving the negotiation process, for example, price and quality. For each negotiation, a deadline of 10 counter-offers was defined. In our work, we define a more realistic model in which the involved entities use their own deadlines that vary according to their characteristics.

In Cheng et al. [2005], the authors describe the negotiation between buyers and suppliers in marketplaces. The negotiation tactics are presented as fuzzy rules and a simple heuristic is employed to learn the other party X  X  preferences. The tactics that agents use are explicitly formulated as fuzzy inference systems and are used to infer new offers at each round of the negotiation. The inference process relies on the impor-tance levels of each issue (product characteristic) and the opponent X  X  last proposal.
In De Paula et al. [2001] and Faratin et al. [1998] the authors study approaches every negotiation round. Authors define three different strategies for the formulation of counter-proposals: time-dependent, behavior-dependent, and resource-dependent. In Faratin et al. [1998], the authors define functions for the definition of alternating offers and describe a set of tactics based on which agents try to conclude an agreement. They present a formal model for negotiations between agents and provide relevant results. They examine a large set of tactics and define the following metrics: (i) the intrinsic benefit of the agent, (ii) the cost, and (iii) the performance of the intrinsic utility relative to a complete knowledge game.

The authors in Fatima et al. [2005] present a negotiation model between buyers and sellers, and describe a set of strategies for both sides. The examined parameters are the player X  X  deadline, the acceptable prices, and the discount factor. The discount fac-tor represents the discount in the utility that a player has at every round of the inter-action process. The optimal strategy of the player is studied with respect to a product pricing scheme. Three types of functions are defined: linear (over time), boulware (the player reaches its final proposed price slowly), and conceder (the player reaches its final proposed price quickly).
 The use of FL in Continuous Double Auctions (CDAs) is studied in He et al. [2003]. The presented scenario involves a buyer and a seller. The authors present the al-gorithms used by agents participating in auctions and employ a number of heuristic fuzzy rules and fuzzy reasoning mechanisms in order to determine the optimum bid for specific products.

In Kolomvatsos et al. [2008] and Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008], the authors present a bargaining scenario for agents participating in IMs. In Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008], the direct interaction between buyers and sellers is stud-ied. This interaction involves a set of alternating offers for a specific product. The au-thors describe a mathematical model for the seller X  X  deadline calculation and present their simulation results. The authors in Kolomvatsos et al. [2008] extend the previ-ously reported work and describe a fuzzy model for deadline calculation. This model is based on a set of fuzzy rules defined according to experts X  knowledge for the presented scenario.
 Fuzzy e-Negotiation Agents (FeNAs) are discussed in Kowalczyk and Bui [2000]. The discussed system involves multi-issue negotiation with limited knowledge about the characteristics of participating parties. Utility theory and fuzzy-constraint-based reasoning are used. The aim is to provide an efficient mechanism that maximizes the agents X  utility when negotiating for the purchase of products. However, limited performance results are provided by the authors.
 In Lin et al. [2006] and Wang et al. [2006], the authors adopt FL in agent systems. Specifically, the authors in Lin et al. [2006] present a sequential bargaining technique based on FL. The FL model is used for estimating the acceptable prices of parties when trying to form joint ventures of companies. In Wang et al. [2006], the authors present an intelligent fuzzy-based agent negotiation process. The inference rules and the decision strategies are described along with relevant implementation details.
The authors in Luo et al. [2003] present a negotiation model between agents. Such a model involves a fuzzy-constraint-based solution. Agents seek to determine a fair solution for all involved parties. Several options that satisfy both parties are deter-mined. Thus, if the opponent cannot accept an offer the proposing entity should find an alternative that is equally acceptable by both parties. The proposed methodology uses prioritized fuzzy constraints to represent trade-offs between possible values of negotiation issues.

In Nguyen and Jennings [2003], another negotiation model is presented. Authors compare the concurrent and the sequential bargaining models. The presented results indicate that the concurrent model outperforms the sequential. The presented model covers deadlines but no further analysis is provided. A number of negotiations in-stances between buyers and a number of sellers are examined.

In Raeesy et al. [2007], a fuzzy model for intelligent agent negotiations is pre-sented. Authors investigate negotiations dealing with offers based on fuzzy values on both sides of the negotiation. They use a protocol that allows both fuzzy and crisp prices to be proposed. The discussed model involves parameters like deadline and minimum/maximum acceptable reservation prices. The presented results assume that such characteristics are common knowledge to the two involved parties. In our model, this constraint is relaxed.

In Zuo and Sun [2009], another model for bilateral negotiation is discussed. In this model, authors present a model for the definition of the agreement zone. The agree-ment zone describes the zone between two parties where an agreement could be met. Within this zone the agreement is possible. Multiple issues (i.e., price, quality, etc.) are combined to yield the weighted satisfaction degree of each offer. Thus, each player is able to decide if he should accept or reject the current proposal. Finally, authors use three different concession strategies to produce a counter-offer.

In this article, we describe a model that imitates human behavior when negotiating over a product X  X  price. Our model takes into account deadlines for both buyers and sellers. For example, the seller may want to participate in the negotiation process for two or three rounds while the buyer may be more patient and wait for 20 rounds. We focus on the buyer side and describe its basic characteristics. Our buyer model assumes no prior knowledge on any of the characteristics of the seller. We introduce the belief concept. Every player has a specific belief on the defection of the opponent. Through this model, we manage to increase the probability of an agreement during the negotiation process and try to imitate the way humans behave in real bargaining interactions. Let us examine the following scenario. A very busy user wants to buy an artificial intelligence research paper. However, he/she does not have enough time to search in a very large number of publisher X  X  e-shops to find the article, compare prices, and fi-nally purchase the discussed document. Therefore, he/she decides to assign the task to his/her agent that can act autonomously and buy the desired paper. The user de-fines the paper title, the authors, the publisher, etc., and he/she poses an upper limit for the price and time for transaction conclusion. The buyer agent undertakes the re-sponsibility to find and negotiate the purchase with a number of sellers. The agent finds possible sellers in a marketplace and starts negotiating with each one of them sequentially. If an agreement is true, the agent returns the paper to the user and the seller receives the payment. In this case, the agent successfully completes his/her assignment. For each seller, the buyer agent assigns a specific deadline (which is a percentage of the initial user-defined deadline). The deadline represents the time for which the buyer is willing to participate in the interaction process. In this sce-nario, the main characteristic is uncertainty with respect to the seller X  X  intentions. The buyer does not know anything about the seller X  X  reservation price, the deadline, or the strategy. The proposed FL knowledge base supports a decision-making mechanism for such cases. By using the FL rule base, the buyer is able to handle the uncertainty for the seller X  X  characteristics, and thus results in the most appropriate solution for his/her owner. FL usage increases the autonomy of IAs. An Electronic Marketplace (EM) is a virtual environment, in which entities (e.g., buyers and sellers) cooperate in order to achieve their objectives [Bakos 1998]. An IM [Ge et al. 2007; Grover and Teng 2001; Laufmann 1994] is a virtual environment that involves a set of entities trying to negotiate and exchange information goods for spe-cific returns. Information goods include, but are not limited to, images, videos, music, source-code, and electronic articles. There are several differences between IMs and EMs. At first, the economics of information production indicate that the production of the first instance (copy) may be more expensive than the cost of the reproduction of additional copies [Rose 1999]. Moreover, information products may lose their value and become stale more easily than other product types. Hence, providers may want to sell these products as soon as possible, probably with significant discounts. In the following paragraphs, we assume that sellers, when negotiating popular products, gradually reduce their prices to conclude successfully the trading process. Smaller such cases. Finally, information products are always available to buyers in contrast to other products (for instance, a seller, which negotiates DVD hardware, can run out of products when demand exceeds the offer).

The owners of the commodities want to sell them to every interested member of a community. On the other hand, there is a demand for these products and a group of entities is willing to pay in order to obtain them. It should be noted that the discussed products could be of different type (books, newspapers, articles).

Concerning the roles of entities participating in the market, we distinguish the following.  X  The buyers ( or customers or consumers ) . Buyers are users that search information and are usually represented by an agent. Each buyer has a different valuation for every product [Aron et al. 2006].  X  The sellers ( or providers ). Sellers are entities that possess some information goods and sell them to potential buyers.  X  The middle members. Middle entities of an IM facilitate buyers and sellers in their interaction process [Lin et al. 2006]. Numerous taxonomies for middle entities have been proposed in Klusch [2001].

IMs are highly dynamic with respect to the number and the behavior of the involved entities. The number of buyers and sellers changes over time, thus changing the basic market characteristics (e.g., product demand or supply). For example, an increased number of buyers leads to increased demand for products. Moreover, markets should define mechanisms for the handling of other critical issues such as seller advertise-ments, information searching, and trust establishment. For this reason, a common communication protocol should be adopted.

The entities in an IM can be represented by IAs; users may pose money, time, and product-type limitations to their agents and wait for their results. On the other side, agents could represent information sources in the IM while being capable of handling many clients simultaneously. Moreover, users can perform other tasks while their agents undertake the assigned tasks. An agent that seeks information on behalf of its owner should be able to handle/support the following tasks [Klusch 2001]: (a) informa-tion retrieval, (b) information aggregation, and (c) user assistance. We investigate the case where buyers have direct interactions with sellers in order to conclude an agreement on the price of a certain product (otherwise, buyers should be based on a broker in order to obtain information products paying a service fee). This is called negotiation. We model the direct buyer-seller interaction through a finite-horizon bargaining model under incomplete information. The negotiation process in-volves a number of alternating offers. The buyer (agent) has a specific deadline posed by its owner, while the seller calculates its deadline ad hoc (on case-by-case basis) [Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades 2008]. We take into consideration the following assumptions for the negotiation process.  X  If one of the deadlines expires and no agreement is reached then the negotiation process ends with a conflict and zero profit for both seller and buyer.  X  At each round of the process, the entities propose a price for the product under discussion. If the opponent accepts such a price, the negotiation process ends with an agreement and a positive profit for both entities.  X  Each entity has no knowledge about the characteristics of its opponent, that is, the seller does not know the deadline, the utility, the pricing policy, and the valuation of the buyer, and vice versa.  X  Both entities reason at each round and decide whether to continue the negotiation or not by rejecting the current offer (anticipating a higher profit at a later stage). The seller starts first and the buyer follows if the proposed offer is rejected. The seller proposes an offer at odd rounds, that is, 2 n +1, n = 0, 1, 2, ..., and the buyer issues a counter-offer at even rounds, 2 n , n = 1, 2, .... If a player is not satisfied with the proposed offer, it has the right to reject it and issue a counter-proposal.
 We briefly describe the seller X  X  behavior in the negotiation process (details can be found in Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008]). The seller retrieves information from information sources and adopts a duplication (cloning) strategy, in the sense that it can deliver the same pieces of information to many interested parties. The information goods, available at the seller, are ranked with respect to their popularity . The seller X  X  profits are calculated by a utility function. Such a function determines the profits of the seller based on the product X  X  price and the seller X  X  production cost. An increase in the price of a product triggers an increase in the seller X  X  profit. In the worst case, the seller X  X  profit boils down to zero.

The seller X  X  characteristics include the cost ( c ), the discount factor (  X  s ), the utility function ( U s ), and the deadline for nonzero profit ( T s ). The discount factor indicates how the seller loses profit as the negotiation progresses. Furthermore, the seller knows the popularity of the product, which affects its pricing policy. Popular information goods could be sold in smaller prices (the price is always greater than the cost) as the seller increases the profit through an increased number of purchases. The price pro-posed by the seller depends not only on the production cost, but also on the popularity ranking. The seller, at the very beginning of the negotiation, calculates its deadline and then starts proposing prices to the buyer. A buyer is involved in a negotiation with certain sellers for a finite time interval T b . The maximum utility of the buyer ( U max ) for a specific information product is defined as where V is the buyer X  X  valuation and r is the seller X  X  product relevance factor. The r parameter assumes values in [0, 1]. Every buyer has classified the seller X  X  products according to their relevance to its interests. Specifically, a value for r closeto0 indicates a product that is totally irrelevant to the needs of the buyer. This ranking is based on the descriptions of the products. The relevance factor can be calculated by trustworthy middle entities based on a methodology imposed by the buyer in order to have an objective view (e.g., through keywords). A well-known utility function for the buyer is defined as where U max comes from Eq. (1) and p is the price of the specific product. Negative utility values are not acceptable because the buyer is not willing to pay more than its personal product valuation. The buyer rejects prices that yield negative utility values. player about the price of the product. The smaller the price, the greater the profit becomes. In real scenarios the buyer negotiates with entities of unknown behavior and intentions. This implies that the buyer should use a utility function that is influenced by the risk present in the negotiation process. The buyer spends resources (e.g., time and money) when trying to purchase products. A utility function which reflects the risk on the negotiation process can be the following.

In this case, the buyer is a risk-aware player that gains more profit when the product price has small values. Moreover, the logarithmic nature of the utility function indi-cates the risk aversion of the buyer. However, based on the model/system in Faratin et al. [1998], we adopt the intrinsic utility of the buyer. Such utility is given by where, in our model, p max is buyer X  X  valuation ( V ), p min is the buyer X  X  first price, and Agreement is the agreement price. The agreement price is the price in which the prod-uct will be sold. The parameter  X  determines the convexity of the utility function and we consider it equal to 1 (as discussed in Faratin et al. [1998]).

Moreover, there is a discount factor which indicates that a buyer loses profit as the negotiation progresses. Specifically, the value of the discount factor indicates the urgency of the buyer to conclude the negotiation successfully (i.e., with an agreement). The discount factor for buyers is represented by  X  b  X  [0, 1]. The discount factor is defined at the very beginning of the negotiation. Hence, the buyer X  X  characteristics for a negotiation include valuation ( V ), discount factor (  X  b ), utility function ( U b ), and deadline ( T b ). Moreover, the relevance factor ( r ) of the considered product is known. The buyer wants to buy the product but is not willing to pay more than its valuation. the negotiation leads to a conflict. On every even round, the buyer proposes a price according to a pricing function (see Eq. (5)). The buyer can be:  X  patient, that is, wait for several rounds aiming to buy at the smallest possible price, or  X  aggressive, that is, try to buy the product as soon as possible.
 In our model, we adopt an aggressive behavior for the buyer. The buyer proposes prices according to where p b i denotes the proposed price at round t, p 0 is an initial price, U max is given by Eq. (1), T b is the buyer X  X  time interval for the specific game, i is the index of each buyer proposal, and k indicates the buyer X  X  policy. A patient policy is adopted when k  X  2. The higher the k is the more patience is exercised by the buyer. Such a policy denotes a buyer who waits in order to attain higher profits since it proposes low prices. In such cases there is a risk for the expiration of the deadline (as defined by the sellers), thus leading the negotiation to conflict. On the other hand, the aggressive policy implies that the buyer proposes high prices from the beginning of the negotiation in order to reach an agreement as soon as possible. This is followed when k &lt; 2. The participants in a negotiation propose at each round a price for the product. Enti-ties accept an offer if it is higher (lower) than the production cost (product X  X  valuation). Moreover, if the participants believe that their deadline or their opponent X  X  deadline expires in the current or at the upcoming rounds then they accept the offer in order to conclude the negotiation without conflict.

We focus on the buyer X  X  side and describe the reasoning mechanism adopted by the buyer in order to decide on the acceptance or rejection of a seller X  X  offer. We designed and developed an FL-based System (FLS) which determines the buyer X  X  reaction to the seller X  X  proposals. We define as Acceptance Degree ( AD ) the capability of the buyer to accept the seller X  X  offer. The AD parameter is defined by the FLS, as we describe in the end of the current section. Such degree reflects the willingness of the buyer to accept the price for a product offered by the sellers hoping to maximize his/her utility function. Ahigh AD degree indicates that the buyer accepts the seller X  X  offer and concludes the negotiation. Specifically, the AD degree depends on the following parameters:  X  X he relevance factor ( r ) which shows to which extent the product corresponds to the buyer X  X  needs,  X  the absolute value of the price difference ( d ) between the seller X  X  proposal and the upcoming buyer X  X  offer,  X  X he belief ( b ) about the expiration of the seller X  X  deadline,  X  X he time difference ( t )between the current time of the negotiation and the buyer X  X  deadline, and  X  the buyer X  X  valuation ( V ) about the product.
 We exploit FL in order to introduce a fuzzy-rule-based FLS capable of adapting the decisions of the buyer to the characteristics of the product. The FLS is a nonlinear mapping between n inputs u i  X  U i , i =1, ..., n and m outputs y i  X  Y i , i = 1, ..., m . The inputs are crisp, that is, they are real numbers (not fuzzy sets). The ordinary sets U i and Y i are called universes of discourse -domains -for u i and y i , respectively. To specify rules for the rule-base, the expert (the buyer) uses linguistic descriptions for 1975a, 1975b, 1975c], for the input u i and y i . For instance, an input to the FLS might be described as: a product with high relevance factor ( l ( u i )=high,u i = relevance factor describe characteristics of the variable ( u i ). If A ij denotes the j th linguistic value of the variable u i then l(u i ) takes values from the set Ai = { A ij : j = 1, ..., N i } .Eachelement A ij is a fuzzy set defined as A ij = bership function and maps U i to [0,1]. In this article, we adopt trapezoidal membership functions, with the general form given in Eq. (6) and illustrated by Figure 1. We have or
The FLS relies on a rule-base for inference. Hence, the mapping of the inputs to the outputs of the FLS is realized by means of condition -action rules. We adopt the Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) form of the linguistic rule R j ,with r = u 1 , d = u , b = u input parameter i and for the output parameter AD , respectively. The FLS controls decisions through a set of linguistic rules. Such a system autonomously adjusts the  X  2 j parameters are based on statistical learning techniques [Nauck and Kruse 1995] in order to obtain an accurate representation of the negotiation semantics.

The general architecture of the FLS is depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The buyer maintains a Knowledge Base (KB) with the necessary information for the determina-tion of the parameters (see Section 3). At each round, the buyer receives the proposal of the seller and calculates the values of each parameter. Such values are forwarded to the FLS in order to determine the value of the AD . The AD value is the basis for the buyer X  X  decision, which is also announced to the seller. The FLS involves a three-step process:  X  the fuzzification step transforms the input parameter values into fuzzy subsets,  X  using the FL rule base (see Section 4.2) an inference takes place for the output value (fuzzified AD), and  X  the defuzzification process converts the output of the fuzzy inference into the crisp outputs for the parameter AD.
 For the defuzzification process, we use the Center-of-Gravity (COG) approach [Passino and Yurkovich 1998]. Hence, the value of AD is calculated as The fuzzy rule-base of the proposed FLS is adopted to the buyer decision process. Such a rule-base covers all the aspects of a negotiation process. The linguistic expressions of the values of the parameters r , d , b , t , V ,and AD are defined in the sets A 1 = A 2 = A 3 = A 4 = A 5 = B 1 = sets are depicted in Figures 4(a) to 4(f). Specifically, a linguistic value of low r indicates that the relevance of the product with the buyer X  X  needs is low. A linguistic value of medium r denotes that the relevance of the product is medium and a linguistic value of high r indicates that the product has increased relevance with the buyer X  X  needs. For a more fine-grained resolution of the linguistic values of r , we use the linguistic modifier very: very(  X  (r)) =  X  (r) 2 . Specifically, very low r denotes that the product is not relevant to the buyer X  X  needs and very high r denotes that the product demonstrates the highest possible relevance with the buyer X  X  needs. The crisp values of r are in the interval [0, 1]. For the rest of the parameters, Table I presents the meaning of the linguistic values.

We assume that the parameter V is bounded from above, thus the range of the parameter is [0, V max ] where V max is defined by the buyer. For example, we can define as maximum valuation for a buyer 200 MU (Monetary Units). We also adopt three sigmoid functions in the range [0, 1] for parameters d , t ,and V having the value of 0.5 d max is equal to p s 1 and the buyer, respectively. A value of f ( d )close to 1 shows that the price difference indicates that the seller X  X  price and the buyer X  X  price are similar. The same holds for the remaining sigmoid functions.

Concerning the acceptance degree AD (see Figure 4(f)), a fuzzy value of low AD indicates that the buyer should not accept the seller X  X  proposal and make a counter-offer while a medium and a high value of AD indicate a neutral and positive attitude to the seller X  X  offer, respectively. In particular, a high AD value indicates that the buyer accepts the seller X  X  proposal and concludes the negotiation.

Through the fuzzy rule-base, we imitate the human behavior when acting in a trad-ing environment with no information on the characteristics of the other party (i.e., the seller). The proposed fuzzy rules provide an efficient mechanism that yields the ap-propriate response to each proposal of the seller. Moreover, the mechanism models the uncertain knowledge that relates to the seller characteristics. Our FLS contains ten fuzzy rules which are defined by experts on the e-commerce domain. The FLS adopts rules defined in the Mamdani model [Mamdani and Assilian 1975]. Each fuzzy rule has the following forms. We have
R j :IFx 1 j is A 1 j AND/OR x 2 j is A 2 j AND/OR .... AND/OR x nj is A nj THEN y j is B j , where R j is the j th fuzzy rule, x ij (i=1...n)areinputsofthe j th rule, y j is the output of the j th rule, and A ij and B j are membership functions usually associated by linguistic terms. It should be noted that inputs and outputs in such a fuzzy system are crisp values that are fuzzified and defuzzified by the system.

Table II lists the fuzzy rules used in our FLS. Next, we provide details on two fuzzy rules in order to demonstrate how the proposed FLS works.
 Fuzzy rule: R 2 If (r is Low AND d is Not Low AND b is Not High AND t is Not Low AND V is Not Explanation: If the relevance factor for the specific product is small, the values of the parameters d, b, t, and V indicate a large difference in the proposed prices, and the buyer believes that the deadline of the seller will not expire, then the buyer should reject the offer. This decision is enforced by the values of t and V. In such cases, t shows that there is enough time for the buyer X  X  deadline expiration and V shows that the buyer has a small or medium valuation about the product.
 Fuzzy rule: R 4 If (r is Medium AND d is Low AND b is Not Low AND t is Not High AND V is High Explanation: The buyer is neutral on the acceptance of the seller X  X  proposal because the relevance factor assumes medium values and, possibly, there are products that satisfy the buyer X  X  needs. Moreover, the product valuation is relatively high, the be-lief, and the time difference show that probably the negotiation has reached its end. Moreover, the price difference shows that the proposed prices have a small divergence. Finally, it is worth noting that the fuzzy rules defined in FLS aim to direct acceptance only when the product is very important for the buyer (i.e., high relevance factor). In the remaining cases, the fuzzy rules express that the buyer should continue the negotiations until the deadline expiration or until the end of the seller X  X  deadline. In Figure 5, we plot the AD values against the parameters used for the buyer decision ( r , d , b , t , V ). The buyer takes a decision at every round based on the defuzzification result of the FLS. The buyer receives an offer from the seller and decides on its accep-tance/rejection. The relevance factor plays an important role in the buyer X  X  decision; the buyer accepts more easily the seller X  X  offers when the relevance factor is greater than 0 . 5. In addition, as shown in Figure 5(b), the buyer exhibits a neutral behavior on the proposal X  X  acceptance when both his/her belief for the seller X  X  deadline expira-tion and the valuation about the product assume small values. This is anticipated because the buyer does not want to accept immediately a seller X  X  offer for a product for which he/she has a low valuation. Moreover, when the buyer discerns that the nego-tiation will continue further and the seller X  X  deadline probably will not expire in the immediate future, the buyer decides to stay longer in the negotiation process. Another interesting observation is that the buyer decides to stay in the negotiation process until his/her offer and the seller X  X  proposal converge.

It is worth noting that the buyer adapts his/her decisions at time instant ( t ) accord-ing to the current values of the parameters (price difference, belief) in order to provide a more thoughtful decision at the next time instant ( t + 1). However, the decisions taken at time instant ( t  X  1) could also be taken into consideration in the proposed fuzzy reasoning procedure. This is an open research issue that we are currently addressing. Moreover, the membership functions of the reasoning parameters can be adapted to the revised decisions of the buyer in order to obtain a more comprehensible represen-tation of the considered fuzzy sets. In this case, the buyer autonomously adapts and, consequently, is capable of changing his/her decision as the negotiation progresses. The technique of an Inverse Reference Model [Passino and Yurkovich 1998] could support such reasoning capability.
 In this section, we highlight the importance of the adoption of FL in the negotiation process under zero knowledge on the players X  characteristics. In contrast to other models, we consider that the offers proposed by both sides are generated by the pric-ing functions of the buyer and the seller (see Section 3) and are not randomly selected. The buyer adopts the pricing function in Eq. (5) and the seller acts as described in Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008]. The seller knows the exact popularity ranking of the product, which also affects the pricing policy. The price proposed by the seller depends on the cost but also on the popularity ranking of the product. This means that it is possible for the seller to sell products with high popularity in smaller prices than other products. In every odd round x , the seller proposes prices using the following function. p x denotes the seller X  X  price at the seller X  X  round x (i.e., x = 2 implies the second pro-posal from the seller issued at the third negotiation round),  X  denotes the profit, c is the product X  X  cost, and q is the popularity metric for item i according to Zipf  X  X  law. Such a law refers to frequency distributions of words found in different languages. It indicates that the probability of occurrence of words or other items starts with a high value and tapers off. In our case, we adopt the reference popularity ratio (PPR) metric where Prob(i) is the reference probability of the element found in the i th (popularity) rank, Prob(1) is the reference probability of the most popular element, and a is the Zipf parameter. We assume  X &lt; 1. A high q value indicates that the product is highly popular and thus can be sold at a low price (and still yield profit). Furthermore, the seller selects its deadline as described in Kolomvatsos et al. [2008] and Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008], and not randomly. The authors in Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008] report that there is a time limit, T s , beyond which all the prices proposed by the seller change marginally. T s is the threshold for the termination of the offers proposed by the seller. Hence, from the seller X  X  point of view, if the buyer does not accept its prices up to this time limit, it is meaningless for the seller to con-tinue the negotiation process. For this reason, the seller defines this time limit for its involvement in the negotiation. This deadline for the seller is given by Eq. (14). We have where  X  denotes the intended profit (see Table III for the range value) and q is the popularity metric for item i as defined in Eq. (13). The parameter  X  is a scaling factor, which depends on the seller X  X  policy. Specifically, if the seller follows a patience policy, the  X  factor assumes a high value (see Table III for the range value). For instance,  X  = 100 denotes that the seller reaches at the lowest cost bound more slowly than, say,  X  = 20. Low  X  values indicate an impatient seller that proposes only a few prices and rapidly concludes the negotiation.
 It is worth mentioning that in Kolomvatsos et al. [2008] the seller uses a specific FLS that determines the final value of the deadline. In this case, the seller X  X  deadline is adapted to the characteristics of each product. Finally, the buyer X  X  belief about the termination of the negotiation (at every round) is determined through a methodology that is not presented in the current article. This is a future extension of the current research effort. Table III presents the value range for each parameter. U(  X  ,  X  ) denotes the uniform distribution. In order to assess the performance of our model, based on the analysis provided in Faratin et al. [1998], we define the Convergence Indicator (CI) indicating how much closer to the first price proposed by the buyer the agreement price gets. CI describes the patience that the buyer shows when interacting with the seller. CI is defined as where V is the buyer X  X  valuation about the product, FirstPrice is the buyer X  X  first pro-posed price, and Agreement is the agreement price at the end of the negotiation. CI is calculated when the final result of the negotiation is an agreement and it is in the interval [0..1]. CI =1 indicates that the product is sold in a price equal to the buyer X  X  first price and represents the best deal for the buyer. Recall that the buyer starts the negotiation by proposing a very small first price. As we will see, CI remains at high values denoting that the agreement price is very close to the first price. This is very profitable for the buyer as the seller is forced to sell the product with reduced profit (Table IV).

For the seller side, the profit is depicted in the product price and quantified in MUs exceeding the production cost. As we can observe from Table V, our model is profitable for the seller side, as in all the listed cases profit is larger than in the cases where a simple negotiation model is adopted.

In order to investigate the efficiency of our model, we compare it with algorithms adopted by the Optimal Stopping Theory (OST) [Shiryaev 2007]. OST deals with the problem of choosing the most appropriate time for stopping an interaction process in order to maximize a profit or minimize a cumulative cost. In our case, the aim of a player is to maximize its reward/utility or to minimize its cost. Some of the most known problems found in the area are the secretary or the asset selling problems [Ross 1983]. We treat the problem discussed in this article as an optimal stopping problem. We focus on the buyer X  X  side. The buyer negotiates with the seller and tries to increase his/her profit. Its reward mainly depends on the product price. Moreover, in time-series search and one-way trading problems, a player is searching for the maximum (minimum) price in a sequence. In El-Yaniv et al. [2001], the authors determine the optimal competitive performance for a number of variants of the discussed problem. They prove the optimal deterministic search strategy in competitive search algorithms. Let us consider that the exchanged prices are chosen in the region [m, M], m &gt; 0. Based on OST, the player should accept the first price that is greater (smaller) than The R parameter in (16) represents a threshold that indicates the most profitable price in a negotiation governed by OST. We use the discussed OST-based theoretical model for the evaluation of our model. Moreover, following Lau et al. [2006], we define the following metric. We have where R is the reservation price (agreement price) taken by our model and R optimal is the reservation price defined by Eq. (16).

For the calculation of the optimal reservation price, we take into consideration the first proposed price by the seller and the seller X  X  cost for each product. The seller X  X  first price is equal to the cost plus the  X  X ntended X  profit. The seller X  X  profit is randomly chosen in a specific interval as Table III indicates. Surely, the buyer does not know the profit nor the product cost. We experimented for short and long deadlines. In Tables VI and VII, we provide our results for the case where the seller has maximum profit value equal to 20 (as Table III indicates). Our model is very efficient (based on Eq. (17)) especially when the buyer valuation is small, as the agreement price is less than the OST-based one. As the valuation increases the agreement price reaches the OST-based one. In addition, for high values of valuation the R metric also assumes high values. Better results (for small valuations) are obtained in the long-term deadline case. In such scenarios, the buyer can wait for long time and thus force to press the seller to accept smaller prices as the negotiation evolves.
 In the case where the seller aims at high profit values, we observe better results. Tables VIII and IX show such outcomes. Here the buyer achieves better prices than the OST-based prices for a wide range of valuations. Especially when the buyer has long deadlines the difference is more significant. The reason is that both players have large deadlines, thus remain in the negotiation process for long. The buyer stays in the interaction until he/she accepts a profitable offer that is small when the valuation is low. For this reason, the seller is forced to propose small prices but surely above the product X  X  cost. The seller prefers to sell the product even for a low profit than risk a conflict. When the valuation is large, the buyer can accept higher prices than in the previous case as the products are necessary for him/her. For this reason, the agreement prices are over the OST-based ones.
 5.4.1. General Remarks. We present our comparison results for a large number (7000) of negotiations between a buyer and a seller. In our experiments, we examined certain scenarios for the buyer valuation. For each valuation, we performed 500 negotiations in order to have an objective view of the FLS performance. The negotiations involved short-and long-term buyer deadlines (we adopt the presented scenarios in Faratin et al. [1998]). In addition, the deadline T b of the buyer is randomly chosen at the very beginning of each negotiation while the seller deadline is calculated as in Kolomvatsos et al. [2008] and Kolomvatsos and Hadjiefthymiades [2008].
 We briefly discuss the models that are compared with our approach. The model in Carbo et al. [2003] involves 100 negotiations about price and quality. All negotiation parameter values (i.e., weights and thresholds) are randomly selected. Moreover, this model considers a failure/conflict after 10 sequential offers. This limits the model as in real situations agents have different deadlines that are dynamically adjusted.
In the model presented in Raeesy et al. [2007] a number of experiments are de-scribed for different values of basic negotiation parameters. The model in Raeesy et al. [2007] considers the minimum price equal to 10 while the maximum reservation price is equal to 40. Moreover, in the same model, the authors consider three scenarios for deadlines: short (10 rounds), medium (20 rounds), and long (40 rounds). Based on such parameters, the authors present results for the time required for negotiation con-clusion. They claim that, using FL, the negotiation requires less time than using crisp values. Moreover, as they state, they do not claim that their fuzzy-based model always outperforms the standard crisp negotiation, however, they argue that fuzzy logic leads to a more flexible negotiation.

The authors in Faratin et al. [1998] experiment with a number of strategies followed by the players and present their results, mainly concerning the agreement percentage as well as the intrinsic utility of each player. They examine two cases: long-term dead-lines, which are randomly chosen between 30 and 60 time instances, and short-term deadlines, which are randomly chosen between 2 and 10 time instances. Next, we present a comparative assessment of the discussed models with respect to the param-eters: (i) number of agreements, (ii) intrinsic utility, and (iii) negotiation steps. 5.4.2. Comparison Parameter: Number of Agreements. In Carbo et al. [2003], the authors examine three cases of negotiations involving offers based on crisp values, on fuzzy sets, and on fuzzy labels. They present results for the exchanged messages, the profit, and the percentage of agreements. However, no other information is available con-cerning the reservation prices, the policy of the players, etc. Their results indicate 86% agreements in all experiments when fuzzy sets are used.

In Faratin et al. [1998], the authors present a formal model for negotiations between agents and present their results. They examine a large set of tactics and define the following metrics: (i) the intrinsic benefit of the agent, (ii) the cost benefit, and, (iii) the performance of the intrinsic utility relative to a game of perfect information. In their results, for all experiments and for all tactics, the number of deals varies accord-ing to the tactic used in the experiment. For example, a conceder tactic resulted in 100% agreements while a boulware tactic resulted in approximately 45% agreements. These results stand for long-term deadlines. In scenarios with short-term deadlines the maximum percentage of agreements is approximately equal to 90% while the min-imum equals 10%. In the short-term deadlines case, only one tactic results in 90% agreements while the rest of them achieve percentages below 60%.

The results presented in An et al. [2006] could only be compared with respect to the success rate of the negotiation processes. In An et al. [2006], we observe that the maximum agreements percentage is close to 90% for very large deadlines. The deadlines are defined as the time (in sec) in which each player should conclude its transactions. The reaction time for each agent is 5 sec which means that in 450 X  550 sec the agent could issue 90 X 100 proposals to the opponents. The authors discern three strategies: flexible, general, and desperate. Each of them represents a pricing policy. The number of agreements for each strategy is as follows.  X  Flexible: from approximately 30% (short deadlines) to 90% (long deadlines),  X  General: from approximately 25% (short deadlines) to 70% (long deadlines),  X  Desperate: from approximately 15% (short deadlines) to 55% (long deadlines). Figure 6 depicts the agreements percentage for short-and long-term deadlines and for different valuations. If we consider a medium deadline, where the buyer has a valuation ranging from 50 to 80 MUs, we can see that our model achieves a high number of agreements (over 85%). This percentage is very close to 100% in cases where the valuation is over 100 MUs. Our results are close to the results presented in Faratin et al. [1998]. Our model outperforms the model presented in Faratin et al. [1998] in the short-term deadlines as the agreements percentage is over the 60% that the majority of tactics (in Faratin et al. [1998]) achieves. Moreover, our model outperforms the model in Carbo et al. [2003].

In addition, in our simulations we focus on the profit that both entities obtain from their interaction. In Figure 7, we present the average utility that the buyer gains in all scenarios and for different valuations. As the valuation increases the utility also increases. The depicted utility is calculated based on the utility function described in Section 3.4. 5.4.3. Comparison Parameter: Intrinsic Utility. In Faratin et al. [1998], for all experiments and for all tactics the maximum average intrinsic utility was equal to 0.9. In the majority of cases the average intrinsic utility is below 0.6 for both short-and long-term deadlines. Especially when agents adopt short deadlines the average intrinsic utility is below 0.4 for all tactics. In Table X, we can see that our model outperforms the aforesaid models concerning the average intrinsic utility. The average intrinsic utility increases as the buyer valuation increases. In such cases, the buyer starts from a very small price (compared to its valuation) and as the game evolves triggers the seller to accept smaller prices. However, a high valuation means that the product is very important for the buyer and for such products the buyer is willing to accept larger prices. The FLS takes into consideration all the parameters, at every round of the negotiation, and determines the most appropriate value of the AD . For the results of Table X, we used a short deadline in the buyer side (the deadline is randomly selected in the region [1..10]). We can see that our lowest average intrinsic utility is above the highest value presented in Faratin et al. [1998]. The same observation holds for the long-term deadline case.

In Table XI, we can see our results for long-term deadlines in the buyer side (the deadline is randomly selected in the interval [1-60]). The difference is that in our case there is a possibility for a buyer to have deadline below 30 rounds, in contrast to Raeesy et al. [2007] where a long-term deadline is 40 rounds and to Faratin et al. [1998] where a long-term deadline is selected in the interval [30,60]. Moreover, an important observation is that in such cases the average intrinsic utility has a low limit equal to 0.70 in the first scenario. In this scenario there is little room for an agreement, however, in each agreement the profit that the buyer gains is very important. The maximum intrinsic utility is equal to 0.98.

In Table XII, we present our results when the buyer deadline is selected in the region [30..60]. We refer to a long-term deadline case and we can see that the average intrinsic utility remains at high levels (above 0.90) in the majority of cases. The best value of the intrinsic utility is achieved when the buyer valuation is at high levels (200 MUs). This value is close to the OST-based case. 5.4.4. Comparison Parameter: Negotiation Steps. In Carbo et al. [2003], the minimum average number of steps to reach an agreement is equal to 1.79 when fuzzy sets are used and the maximum benefit is obtained when fuzzy labels are used (agreements percentage approximately 80.29%). In Al-Ashmaway et al. [2007], the authors propose a negotiation model and present performance results. The presented results refer to the time required for the completion of each transaction and for different policies adopted by the players. The maximum number of rounds required to successfully complete transactions is approximately equal to 8 and the minimum equals 1. The authors argue that the more boulware the policy of the players, the lower the number of negotiation rounds.
 In Zuo and Sun [2009], an experiment between a buyer and a seller is presented. The negotiation rounds were 13 using the  X  X reedy X  strategy and 8 using the  X  X alm X  strategy. Also, when changing the parameter  X  that indicates the pricing strategy of the player, they take negotiation rounds from 17 to 8 (greedy strategy) or 8 to 2 (anxious strategy).

In our model the average number of agreement steps decreases as the buyer valuation increases (see Tables X, XI, and XII). The minimum average number of agreement steps is 1.24 for short-term deadlines. As discussed in Carbo et al. [2003] the smallest average number of steps was 1.79 and in Al-Ashmaway et al. [2007] was 1. In the long-term deadline case, we have similar results as in the short-term case (the number of steps decreases as the valuation increases). However, these numbers are greater than in the short-term deadline case, mainly due to the larger deadline that the buyer has. This leads to an increased number of rounds in each negotiation process and, thus more time is needed to conclude a transaction. In this article, we propose an FL-based model for buyer behavior at every round of a negotiation. We describe the negotiation and discuss the behavior of the buyer along with the behavior of the seller. The buyer proposes prices for a specific number of rounds based on a dynamic strategy. The strategy determines whether the buyer is patient in concluding on a negotiation or not. At every round of the negotiation, the buyer examines the price proposed by the seller.

We propose an FLS enhanced with a reasoning mechanism for the determination of the actions taken by the buyer when it receives the seller X  X  proposal. The behavior of the buyer is based on a set of parameters. Such parameters involve the proposed prices by the two parties, the belief of the buyer for the expiration of the seller X  X  dead-line, the remaining time until deadline expiration, and the valuation of the product. Furthermore, the relevance factor indicates how relevant the seller and its product to the buyer X  X  goals and this plays an important role in the actions assumed by the buyer. Hence, the buyer examines the values of the discussed parameters and, based on the fuzzy reasoning process, takes actions to respond to the seller X  X  offer either positively or issuing a counter-offer.

We show that our model achieves a better performance concerning the agreements number, the agreement price, or the buyer X  X  intrinsic utility when compared with other research efforts or a model based on OST. In our results, we can see that, based on the described behavior of both players, the agreements percentage is at high levels while the intrinsic utility is better than in other research efforts. The most important aspect is that when we compare our model with an OST-based one, we see that for small and medium valuations the agreement price is lower than the OST-defined threshold.
A self-organizing FL system is an interesting extension to our work. This system is capable of self-adapting, at every round, to decisions taken in previous rounds and the response of the seller. This could be of high importance as long as the rate at which the buyer updates its decisions depends (to some extend) on previous decisions. Hence, the FL system will provide a more efficient automatic reasoning mechanism for the discussed scenario. This aspect is an open research issue that we are already working upon.
