 1. Introduction
One of the most well-established findings in regard to scientific information-seeking behavior is that there are major dis-ciplinary differences in behavior. For example, physical scientists have different patterns of information-seeking behavior compared to humanities scholars or social scientists (see e.g. Brockman, Neumann, Palmer, &amp; Tidline, 2001; Brown, 1999; 2002; Tomney &amp; Burton, 1998 ).
 But what are the reasons for these disciplinary differences? Several factors have been identified. For example as Talja, Vakkari, Fry, and Wouters (2007) showed different scientific fields may have different research cultures and research culture influences the use of e-resources. Research culture in Talja et al X  X  work refers to characteristics such as research-group membership and the degree of establishment of the research area. Different fields may rely on certain types of information in a field could also have impact on the information-seeking behavior of the scholars of that field. Two other factors have been shown to have impact on the information-seeking behavior of scholars are the interdisciplinary nature and the scatter of literature of a scientific field (Talja &amp; Maula, 2003; Tenopir, 2008; Vakkari &amp; Talja, 2005 ).
 tributed (scattered) among the resources where such information may be expected to be found. Although the two concepts may use the literature of chemistry, but this does not mean that they have a scattered body of literature as the chemistry literature they use might be published in only one or two specific chemistry journals. Therefore, their field could be inter-disciplinary but with a relatively concentrated literature.
 terns compared to those who practice in well established subject areas with clear boundaries (Bates, 1996 ). However, the nature of this difference needs further investigation and clarification.

 closer and clearer picture of the issues being investigated. The reason is that most of the research in the field of scientific information-seeking behavior deals with rather broad subject categories such as natural sciences, physical sciences and so-cial sciences; and sometimes somewhat narrower (but still broad) categories as physics, chemistry etc (see for example
Sparks, 2005 ). However, nowadays a single discipline like physics or chemistry is so heterogeneous it needs to be broken down to specialized subfields, many of which will have quite different characteristics. 2. Related works and their relation with the information-seeking behavior of scholars. Mote (1962) was the first researcher who made the dis-tinction between subjects with high and subjects with low scatter. Before the popularity of digital information resources and services and in the age of print resources, a study by Packer and Soergel (1979) showed that scholars in high scatter subject areas tended to use current awareness methods and spent more time on searching. Somewhat in contrast to Packer and Soer-gel, Bates (2002) later hypothesized that scholars in high scatter fields use chaining and browsing as their primary search methods, whereas directed keyword searching is a more effective method for finding relevant materials in low scatter fields. which they have investigated the effect of scatter of literature on the information-seeking behavior of scholars. The key find-ings of these studies are: by Brown (1999) showed that physicists and astronomers used citations at the end of articles (94%), retrospective searching of indexing/abstracting tools (56%), personal communication (50%) and browsing older volumes (19%) for identifying arti-cles. Nicholas, Huntington, Rowlands, Jamali, and Haynes (2005) surveyed the users of the Institute of Physics (IoP) journals and found out that the most frequent method used to locate journal articles was visiting a journal X  X  website. Younger respon-dents were more likely to rely on the Web of Science, while older respondents were likely to depend on their personal col-lection. In general, younger users were more likely to depend on and use online methods. Two surveys of astronomers by Tenopir, King, Boyce, Grayson, and Paulson (2005) indicated that they are highly reliant on e-journals. They concluded that the availability of a mature electronic journals system (such as Astrophysics Data System, ADS) from their primary profes-sional society has surely influenced their early adoption of e-journals. Another study by Nicholas, Huntington, and Jamali (2006) that utilized both log analysis technique and online survey to study the information-seeking behavior of ScienceDi-rect X  X  authors (as users) revealed some information about physicists in comparison to scientists in other fields. Physicists, compared to respondents from other subjects, were more likely to be browsers than searchers  X  they obtained much infor-mation by requesting journal homepages and journal issues. Physicists were also more active, making a higher number of requests in a session. In brief, it could be said that physicists and astronomers have some distinct attributes including: they of fact among developers of e-journals and e-resources (Dixon, 1999, p. 3; Singleton, 1997, p. 152, Kurtz et al., 2000, 2005; and finally they are known as innovators in methods of scholarly communication (Wertman, 1999 ). 3. Methodology
This article is based on a mixed-method research project (Jamali, 2008 ) whose aim was to conduct an intradisciplinary study on the information-seeking behavior of physicists and astronomers. What is presented in this article is based on the quantitative part of the study. The broad aim of the quantitative part of the original study was to find out about certain aspects of information-seeking behavior of scientists such as keeping up-to-date and finding articles as well as to triangulate some of the findings of the qualitative part of the study. A self-administered web-based questionnaire (see the Appendix A ) was designed for conducting the survey. The questionnaires went online on the 3rd of May, 2006 for a month. To conduct the survey, a personalized email was sent to all staff and PhD students in the department with a link to the questionnaire. This was followed by two sets of reminder emails with about ten day intervals. The sample included all PhD students and staff in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCL.

The Department had the following seven research groups at the time of the study that were considered as the research areas and units of analysis in this study. They are: Atmospheric Physics (AP); High Energy Physics (HEP); Condensed Matter and Materials Physics (CMMP); Astronomy and Astrophysics (AA); Theoretical Molecular Physics (TMP); Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Positron Physics (AMOP); Optical Science Laboratory (OSL).

The two main attributes studied in this research, i.e. interdisciplinarity and scatter of literature, were measured by asking two questions (Q7 and Q8 below) of the respondents. Of course this is based on their perception of their field and may not a 100% match the reality. Possibly, a more reliable measure of interdisciplinarity and scatter of literature would be obtained by conducting scientometric studies, especially citation studies. Conducting that type of study is out of scope of the current re-search. A search in the literature resulted in no significant such study that would give us an actual measurement of inter-disciplinarity nature and scatter of literature of the different subfields of physics and astronomy, so we could compare it with the respondents X  perceptions presented in this study. However, the assumption is that the respondents know their field and know how much they rely on the literature that belongs to other scientific fields.

Crosstabulation was used for the statistical analysis and Pearson chi-square and Cramer X  X  V tests were used to check the significance of all results. 4. Findings 4.1. Characteristics of the sample
There were 129 staff and 113 PhD students (total 242 people) in the department that were invited to take part in the sur-vey. The survey achieved 47.1% response rate with 114 respondents. This is a good response rate given that academic Web-based surveys X  participation rates range from 3% to 62% for electronic surveys (Hemminger, Lu, Vaughan, &amp; Adams, 2007 ). Table 1 shows the size of the research population and the number/percentage of respondents. 57% of respondents were re-search students and 43% were members of staff.

Seven main subfields of physics and astronomy (research group entities inside the department) were used to categorize the respondents ( Table 2 ). CMMP accounted for 31.6% of the respondents. CMMP is the biggest research group in the depart-ment and it encompasses a considerable number of smaller research groups that research very specific topics. After CMMP, AA accounted for the second highest number of respondents with 22 (19.3%) respondents. This research group also covers many smaller research groups such as hot stars, star formation and so on. The smallest number of respondents belonged to the OSL with three respondents who all do instrumentation-kind of research. OSL at the time of data collection had 11 mem-bers so three respondents means about 0.33% of the population, and it is relatively a representative sample. However, it is still a small number of respondents and the findings related to this group should be interpreted with extra caution. 4.2. Interdisciplinarity disciplinary their research was. Fig. 1 shows how often respondents in each group used literature of other fields. The data show that groups such as CMMP and TMP are more reliant on the literature of other fields and therefore have a more inter-disciplinary nature. Fifty-three percent of respondents from CMMP and 45% from TMP stated that they  X  X ften X  use the liter-ature of other fields. Other groups such as HEP rely mainly on their own literature and cannot be counted as interdisciplinary. Only 6% of respondents from HEP stated that they used the literature of other fields  X  X ften X  while 33% of them never used the Cramer X  X  V test (=0.37) showed that the relation between the research field and interdisciplinarity is not very strong. 4.3. Scatter of literature
Respondents were asked how scattered they perceived the literature of their fields to be. The characteristics of literature in different subfields of physics and astronomy are not the same as we can see in Fig. 2 . The literature of some subfields of physics, such as CMMP and TMP, is more scattered and some other subfields such as HEP and OSL have clearer boundaries dents from the OSL group maintained that the literature of their field is concentrated. A Pearson chi-square test approved the tions between scatter of literature and research field is not considerably strong. 4.4. Keeping up-to-date 4.4.1. By interdisciplinarity of the field
Scientists rely on different methods for keeping abreast with the developments of their fields. Some may rely on the word of mouth and what they hear from their friends and colleagues. Some rely on meetings held within their departments or research groups and some go to conferences for that purpose. Besides interpersonal communication methods, there are also print and electronic resources to use. Using email alerts (whether of journals ToC, or of e-print or a database), conducting regular or semi-regular searches in databases such as arxiv.org, and browsing e-resource collections are other methods that could be used for keeping up-to-date.

Those with the most interdisciplinary research used  X  X atabase searching X  more than the others. Nineteen percent of those who said they often need to use other disciplines X  literature and 11% of those who said they did it sometimes searched dat-abases for keeping up-to-date. The figure was zero for those who never or rarely needed other disciplines X  literature. A Pear-relates). 4.4.2. By scatter of literature
Those who believed their literature was scattered were more likely to search databases and browse e-journals for keeping up-to-date. Those with concentrated literature had the highest rate of e-print archive usage (36%). Those who were not sure about the scatter of literature of their subfields tended to rely on word of mouth more than the other groups did; a third did these findings are in line with those of Vakkari and Talja (2005) . 4.5. Finding research articles Scientists identify the articles they read through different methods. Some articles might be recommended to one by friends or colleagues. A researcher might identify an article through searching a general database, such as Web of Science or a sub-ject-specific database like ADS. An article might also be identified through email alerts a user receives or through browsing an e-journals website. Following the references in other resources might also result in finding more articles.
A cross-tabulation of interdisciplinarity with the most used methods for identifying articles ( Fig. 5 ) show that those peo-(100%), ToC email alerts (63%) and searching general databases such as Web of Science (58%). On the other hand those who used the literature of other fields never or rarely relied more on recommendations (63%), and searching subject databases (54%). A Pearson chi-square test showed that the result was significant ( v 2 = 34, Sig = 0.03, Cramer X  X  V = 0.41). 4.5.1. By scatter of the field X  X  literature
Fig. 6 gives the percentage breakdown of the most used method for identifying articles by the scatter of the subfields X  literature. The more scattered the literature, the higher the likelihood of using Google, Google Scholar, general databases and subject databases. On the other hand the less scattered the literature of a subfield the higher the chance that respon-dents used ToC email alerts. This makes sense because databases cover several subject areas and they tend to be a better means for finding articles in several fields simultaneously. The cross-tabulation of the most used method for identifying arti-(2002) and Vakkari and Talja (2005) . A Pearson chi-square test showed that the result for this crosstabulation was not sta-tistically significant ( v 2 = 46, Sig = 0.61). 5. Discussion and conclusions
Table 3 profiles the subfields of physics and astronomy in terms of their interdisciplinarity and the level of scatter of their literature and it also shows the main methods they relied on for keeping up-to-date and for finding articles. The ranking for the interdisciplinarity and scatter of the table are based on the percentage of the answers of the survey respondents to the ber of stars the more interdisciplinary and the more scattered the literature of the field. As we can see from the table, the subfields of physics and astronomy are different in terms of their reliance on different methods used for keeping up-to-date as well as methods used for finding articles.
 The findings of the present study raise a question about the past hypotheses proposed by Bates (2002) and Vakkari and seeking behavior of scientists. Bates (2002) suggested that the use of chaining and browsing are the main search methods used by scholars in high scatter fields and directed keyword searching is the more effective method for finding relevant materials in low scatter fields. On the other hand, Vakkari and Talja (2005) argued otherwise and maintained that the in-crease in scatter increases only the importance of searching in reference databases. A few points should be discussed here: (c) Arguing against Bates (2002) , the cross-disciplinary use of literature does not necessarily imply the scatter of litera-
With regard to the information-seeking behavior of physicists and astronomers, in general, the study lends support to the findings of Brown (1999) that showed high usage of citation tracking. It also confirms some of the findings by Nicholas et al. (2006) that showed physicists compared to scientists in some other subjects were more likely to be browsers. However, as we have found specific subfields are different and talking of physicists here might be over-generalisation of the data. It should be borne in mind that this study has some limitations and one must be cautious in generalising the findings. A limitation of this study is that we have focused on scientists X  opinions about the interdisciplinarity and scatter of liter-Another limitation was the size of the population. The number of respondents of some of the groups, especially OSL, was very small and this has definitely had impact on the results, which could be see in relatively low results of Cramer X  X  V tests. Some of the findings were not statistically significant and a study with a larger population should be conducted for further clarification. However, this study was meant to explore the issues of interdisciplinarity and scatter of literature with an intradisciplinary perspective, an aim that has been mostly achieved. Obviously, further international research is required to reach a firm conclusion on the issues discussed in this article. Especially as the past studies have shown that influence the use of e-resources.
