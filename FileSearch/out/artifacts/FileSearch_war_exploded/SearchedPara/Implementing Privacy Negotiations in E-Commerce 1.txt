 Online users are facing a large and increasing complexity of the web, due to its size and its diversity. In online retailing, stores are constantly expanding their assortments in width, depth and quality levels, making it impossible for users to examine all pos-sible alternatives. The user may be offered effective guidance through automated recommender systems; her appreciation for personalized websites [11], and their economical benefits for service providers co uld be verified empirically [2, 10, 13]. 
Several recommendation strategies have been developed in the past, an overview for websites to communicate their privacy principles is to post  X  X rivacy policies X . 
Our contribution is to depict how negotiation techniques can overcome current drawbacks of static privacy policies, and how these negotiations can be implemented negotiable privacy dimensions and present the optimization calculi of the user and the tion 5 explains how privacy negotiations can be implemented using P3P and illus-summary and outlook in section 6. The privacy-personalization trade-off as presented above has led to several ap-Preferences developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [19], and the Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language (EPAL) developed by IBM [7]. P3P is a recommendation since 2002 and aims  X  X o inform Web users about the data-collection practices of Web sites X  [20]. P3P has become widely adopted by service providers but it remains restricted to the  X  X ake-it-or-leave-it X  principle: The service provider offers a privacy policy; the potential user either can accept it or to reject it as a whole. A nego-tiation process between the involved parties is not intended. Although the first drafts moved in favour of easy implementation and early and wide adoption of the protocol. The latest P3P 1.1 specification [20] does not mention negotiations either. 
In addition to the P3P specification, the W3C conceived APPEL1.0, A P3P Prefer-of preferences regarding P3P policies between P3P agents X .

In parallel to the development of privacy-related technologies and research both in ciplines. The bases had been set up in game theory, where negotiation is modelled as tance of autonomous agents and collabora tive computing [4]. Frameworks for carry-outsourcing to third parties on the economic side, combined with mobile and ubiqui-tous computing will make Privacy Negotiation Technologies gain in importance in the near future [9, 21]. Thompson states that negotiations are an  X  X nterpersonal decision-making process neces-sary whenever we cannot achieve our objectives single-handedly X  [17]. Especially in the shortcomings of current online privacy handling mechanisms can be overcome if privacy vider (seller) and the user (buyer): 
The first shortcoming is the  X  X ake-it-or-leave-it X  principle, i.e. the user can only ac-cept or refuse the provider X  X  proposal as a whole. The provider is always the one who moves first, he makes the initial offer; the user cannot take the initiative. 
The second shortcoming is the  X  X ne-size-fits-all X  principle: once the service pro-accepted offers with less privacy protection and would have agreed to the provider X  X  proposal even if more personal data would have been asked. Thus, the provider fails to tap the users X  full potential. 3.1 Individualized Privacy Policies Adopting a broader view and extending the analysis from a single service provider to to the large number of gradations for all considerable privacy dimensions, a speciali-zation is not trivial. 
Consider n service providers and m n users having different privacy levels with a known distribution. Hence, a given service provider will target more than one privacy level. This may be implemented by giving the users the choice between a set of usage scenarios corresponding to different amounts of personal data to be collected. As the maintenance of one scenario induces costs for the service provider, the set of scenar-ios will be limited in size to a few possibilities. 
A current example of this strategy is the search site A9.com, a wholly owned sub-switch to an alternative service where the data collection and use is limited to a mini-mum and no personalization is implemented. potential users. Thence, even under market-driven specialization and alternative usage scenarios, the user still faces fixed po licies and the main problem persists. 3.2 Negotiable Privacy Dimensions aspect is to identify relevant and negotiable privacy dimensions. We define a privacy dimension, different discrete revelation levels exist, monotonously associated with the user X  X  willingness to reveal the data. Privacy dimensions can be identified at different degrees of granularity. DATA will be collected. As shown by empirical studies, these four generic dimensions about. Moreover, they are in accordance wi th European privacy legislation [5, 6]. the amount of data to be revealed (see section 3.4). 3.3 Privacy vs. Personalization  X  User X  X  Individual Utility Calculus In order to model the user X  X  individual trade-off between personalization and privacy, we present it as a utility maximization probl em, taking into account different overall sented in section 4, giving the service provider the opportunity to choose its optimal strategy. We denote the user X  X  utility by U, using the following notations: D is a n-dimensional privacy space and d i  X  D are its privacy dimensions a is the user X  X  data revelation level on dimension d i a is a threshold indicating the minimum required data the user must reveal  X  is a weighting of dimension d i  X  indicates the user X  X  global privacy sensitivity R is the discount provided by the service provider P are other non-monetary personalization benefits B is the base utility by the execution of the contract Using this notation, the user X  X  utility can be expressed by: 
In case that the user is not willing to provide sufficient data for the contract to be personalization benefits P even if the involved parties do not conclude on a contract. data, the user will prefer unpersonalized usage of the services (3).

The necessity can be deduced from postal delivery if the user refuses to provide her shipping address. It is to note that in recipient dimension may be the company itself (no third-party logistics company used) and the minimum purpose the user has to agree upon may be postal delivery.

Through the active support, the user can save search time and simultaneously the matching quality between her preferences and the subsumed under the variable R. This is es pecially appropriate, as increased matching quality only becomes effective in case the product is purchased (and R is zero in case revelation levels. Hence, the user X  X  type is determined by  X  i and  X  . 
As mentioned above, the multiplicative structure of the Cobb-Douglas utility func-different privacy dimensions are not perfectly substitutable (e.g. the user X  X  telephone  X  a i /  X  j a j ) is not constant or independent from the current level of revealed data: it de-creases with the amount of data already provided. 
The influences of the different parts on the user X  X  utility function are described by the partial derivatives and their interpretations shown below:  X  U /  X  a where she does not care.  X  U /  X  R &gt; 0: The user appr eciates discounts.  X  R /  X  a for which the service provider does not honour revelation.

First, the willingness of customers to provide personal party companies). Third, the relevance of the retention time is rated considerably less important [1]. Finally, all data carries with it a more or less pronounced intrinsic pur-pose that cannot be subject to a negotiation (e.g. phone numbers are used for personal contact and telemarketing). Hence, negotiating the kind of data seems appropriate in the case of online retailing. must at least meet the following criteria:  X  the user must be able to provide the data  X  necessity of providing it  X  it must not be indispensable for the execution of the contract, either by its nature or by the level of detail (i.e. no negotiations for a i &lt; a i T )  X  data can be smoothly collected without the us er X  X  consent, there is no need for ne-gotiating (for example the request time can be collected automatically) found significant differences in comfort level across the various types of information, the user X  X  type. The other aspect, the global privacy sensitivity expressed by  X  , will be examined in the following section. 4.1 Facing Different Types of Users The service provider is confronted with diffe rent types of customers that have various differently.

User type Characteristics, Important factors  X  (fundamentalists)  X  (profile averse)  X  (identity concerned)  X  (marginally concerned) 4.2 Modelling the Negotiation Process Various methods for modelling negotiation processes exist, some more influenced by computer science (e.g. using finite state machines), others more influenced by micro-economics. We will adopt a game-theoretic approach, examining two possible nego-tiation scenarios: a sequential game as framework and a simultaneous game that may be played on every step. [3] has examined negotiation protocols in different contexts: (or not) and no transaction costs for both parties (or not). 
Assuming that the service provider can reliably identify privacy fundamentalists for example by means of web usage mining technologies, he will propose a take-it-or-data will be higher than the discounts the service provider can offer; the inequality (3) dures. In contrast, the three other types are indistinguishable for the service provider. set whereas the node for type  X  PF is apart. 
The service provider X  X  strategy is a function that associates discounts to data reve-results in solving the following optimization problem: For users being drawn from a known distribution (with the probabilities as depicted in figure 1), maximize the total other costs. Latter encompass in particular customers that are lost during the negotia-tion process by cancelling (e.g. due to psycho logical reasons or just because they feel detailed solution, as rigorously integrating the service provider X  X  cost structure would go beyond the scope of this paper. 
The framework for the negotiation process is a dynamic game where the service This constitutes the fallback offer in case the user does not want to enter negotiation. and more data to be asked. On every step, the user may cancel (i.e. no contract or the be implemented). 
This wizard-like structure is strategically eq uivalent to a set of offers as (data, dis-count)-tuples from which the user can choose one. However, a sequential implemen-data and instantaneous adaptation of the strategy. Note that for a given offer, the re-the customer only enters the additional information (monotonously increasing revela-dress). This is particular useful for addressing different weightings of privacy dimen-sions that are equivalent for the service provider. Implementations may offer the mul-tiple privacy dimensions sequentially. A switch to another dimension is performed in case the user refuses to provide further data or the service provider is not interested in a higher detail level for the current dimension. A current implementation is described in section 5.2. 
In this basic case, the service provider gr ants a fixed discount on every single step, which is cumulated along the process. A more sophisticated procedure could also multaneous game on every stage: the user indicates the minimum discount she wants to get for revealing the data and the service provider indicates the maximum discount can play this simultaneous game. 5.1 Integrating Privacy Negotiations into P3P The negotiation process as described in the previous section can be implemented using the extension mechanism of P3P, which can be used both in a policy reference agents capable of interpreting the negotiation extension will fetch extended policies. In a P3P policy, two extensions can be added: a NEGOTIATION-GROUP-DEF in the POLICY element, and a NEGOTIATION-GROUP in the STATEMENT element. The mecha-nism is comparable to the tandem of STATEMENT-GROUP-DEF and STATEMENT-GROUP in P3P 1.1 [20]. A NEGOTIATION-GROUP-DEF element defines an abstract pool of alterna-tive usage scenarios. One or several statements (identified by the attribute id ) code a possible usage scenario; the pool membership is expressed by the NEGOTIATION-GROUP extension in the statement (attribute groupid ), which describes relevant para-meters of the given scenario, such as the benefits for the user. This mechanism allows element. The following example illustrates the usage: users of a bookstore can choose between e-books sent by email and hard copy books, shipped by postal delivery: Example of an extended P3P policy, including the proposed elements NEGOTIATION-GROUP-DEF and NEGOTIATION-GROUP (XML namespaces omitted) readable privacy policy and other information resources on the site must work hand in hand with the P3P policy. The exhaustive machine-readable coding of the benefits is a reduced purchase price. 5.2 Example: Negotiations in Multi-channel Retailing entering their ZIP code into the store locator . A check of majority is done before these website services can be used. 
Two privacy dimensions can be identified: the user X  X  age (d 1 ), with the revelation user X  X  address (d 2 ), with the revelation levels: {city (C), city and ZIP code (CZ), city majority check) and a 2 T = city and ZIP code (for the store locator). Possible negotia-tion outcomes are depicted in the left part of figure 2. Using the user X  X  utility function creases when moving to the upper right corner, as the revelation levels increase. 
Based on these two figures, the service provider develops its strategy: he chooses the discounts he will grant to the customer for each of the six possible contracts,  X  X a-belling X  them with the R(.) function (that maps from D n to discounts). Hence, he can code the negotiation space by six statements in an extended P3P policy. system, displaying possible alternatives (a human-readable communication of the data accessed via the  X  X olicy X ,  X  X ummary X  and  X  X ptions X  buttons in the  X  X age Info X  dia-have added a  X  X egotiate X  button: a modal dialog is opened, summarizing the negotia-The implementation relies on XUL and JavaScript, uses the Mozilla APIs and inte-dimension can be negotiated as long it can be expressed using the P3P data scheme. relationship between service provider and customer. Negotiating allows a better vidual utility maximization can take into account the multi-dimensionality of privacy; the service provider may wish to reduce th e negotiation space in a way that suits the given business scenario. The incremental revelation of data by the user can be strate-gically reduced to a choice from a set of alternatives. Using the extension mechanism involving diverse privacy dimensions: We proposed two new elements that follow the negotiations in E-Commerce. Software support of the extension was added to the Mozilla browser, integrating privacy negotiations seamlessly into the user agent. 
Future work will focus on the practical implementation of privacy negotiation tech-niques on large scale public websites. We are currently investigating which user inter-face design best fulfils the usability requirements and how negotiable privacy dimen-sions are best visualized. Moreover, a taxonomy should be developed to allow a or-leave-it offers more favourable for the service provider.
