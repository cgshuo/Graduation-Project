 1. Introduction
Serendipity is often associated with luck, accident, and chance. But it is more than that  X  it is an experience marked by an interruption or discontinuity triggered by ideas, information, or phenomena that stops us in our tracks and prompts us to make connections that may have personal, organizational, community, or global outcomes ( McCay-Peet &amp; Toms, in press ).
Despite serendipity X  X  association with events outside our control, it is serendipity X  X  positive impact that motivates people and organizations to find ways to nurture and facilitate it.  X 
In her Rice Centennial Lecture, Shirley Ann Jackson, President of New York X  X  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, argued that funding basic research spurs serendipity and thus innovation  X  X  X ecause without [serendipity], there is no vitality in the innovation ecosystem. Indeed, there is no innovation X  X  ( Jackson, 2012 , n.p.). While Jackson suggested that basic research facilitates serendipity, companies such as Google design buildings and rearrange furniture to maximise the potential for serendipitous encounters among co-workers ( Lindsay, 2013 ), and developers create mechanisms such as recommender sys-serendipity and understand how it may be influenced (see for example, Makri, Blandford, Woods, Sharples, &amp; Maxwell, 2014 ), we know very little about how the complex relationships among the traits and abilities of individuals and the environments in which they are immersed may lead to serendipity. Thus, we are blind to how we may facilitate serendipity through policy, education, or systems design.

The purpose of our research is to examine whether selected characteristics of people, i.e., individual differences, and selected characteristics of environments influence likelihood of serendipity to occur, and whether some combination of the two interact to lead to serendipity. Before we can examine these relationships, we first need to develop a way to measure perception of serendipity and a way to assess whether an environment in which the user is immersed has the potential to that relationships among serendipity, the environment, and the individual could be explored. Measuring an abstract, subjec-tive construct such as serendipity is a difficult task. People have different notions of what serendipity means and what experiences they would describe as serendipitous ( McCay-Peet &amp; Toms, in press ). However, the lack of tools to measure serendipity hampers the ability to improve research policy, educational strategies, and digital environments. Without tools to measure serendipity, for example, we are unable to verify whether changes to the interface or algorithms of a digital environment supports or hinders serendipity. 2. Prior research
We define serendipity as an unexpected experience prompted by an individual X  X  valuable interaction with ideas, informa-tion, objects, or phenomena. In a study of how twelve scholars and working professionals experienced serendipity, a serendipitous experience was identified as a process consisting of five main elements: trigger, connection, follow-up, valu-able outcome, and unexpected thread. Driving this process are the internal and external factors that are hypothesised to experience, encompassing aspects of the trigger, connection, and follow-up.

Our definition of serendipity and its complementary model ( McCay-Peet &amp; Toms, in press ) share many of the features of previous definitions and discussions of serendipity in its emphasis on the unexpected and positive aspects of the phenomenon example, postulated chance favours  X  X  X hose at work in microenvironments that make for unanticipated sociocognitive inter-actions between those [with] prepared minds; X  X  what he referred to as the  X  X  X erendipitous sociocognitive microenvironment  X  X  gent  X  X ixes X  of insight coupled with chance X  X  (1996, p. 434), suggesting internal and external factors are at play. The main ing of the phenomenon requires the internal (e.g., the prepared mind) and the external (e.g., outside context and events) to come together in the right way, with neither on its own considered enough for the classification of an experience as serendipity X  X  (np). Each of these definitions and extrapolations extend the more basic notion of serendipity as an aptitude or a happy accident, embedding within them how and why serendipity unfolds.

Interactions between individuals and their environments appear to be important for serendipity to occur but how can we facilitate and influence serendipity? 2.1. Environment
This research focuses in particular on the more stable characteristics of the individual X  X  environment rather than situa-tional factors such as time pressures and information strategies, which are discussed elsewhere (e.g., Makri et al., 2014;
McBirnie, 2008; Sun, Sharples, &amp; Makri, 2011 ). We sought to understand what it is about digital environments that might facilitate serendipity, recognising that people do not interact with digital environments in a vacuum and experiences with their broader work environment may exert an influence on experiences of and perception of digital environments.
While we know of no research that has tested whether the type of environment, digital or physical, influences the like-lihood of experiencing serendipity, research does suggest that some environments are more likely to support serendipity than others (e.g., Bj X rneborn, 2008; Toms, 1997 ). Settings more conducive to serendipity include those designed to deliver information such as libraries, lecture rooms, as well as unfamiliar environments where new information can be found ( Sun
Toms (1997) found in her experimental study of 47 adults that navigational mechanisms in a digital newspaper to support browsing also supported serendipity by exposing users to useful news stories they did not intend to find. Bj X rneborn (2008) examined the characteristics of the physical library space that lead to divergent behaviour. The information behaviours of patrons in two public libraries were observed over several months. A number of these patrons ( N = 118) were interviewed while eleven further participated in think-aloud sessions. Bj X rneborn identified ten  X  X erendipity dimensions X  of the physical library). While the research stops short of verifying whether the divergent behaviour prompted by the environment led to serendipity, the dimensions are significant, shedding light on environmental features that have the potential to support serendipity.

Based on an investigative study of serendipity involving semi-structured interviews with twelve scholars and working professionals who shared specific experiences of work-related serendipity as well as prior research (e.g., Bj X rneborn, 2008 ), McCay-Peet and Toms (in press) identified four main external or environmental factors that may facilitate the process of serendipity  X  an environment that is trigger-rich, highlights triggers, enables connections, and enables capturing. McCay-
Peet, Toms, and Kelloway (2014) reexamined these four facets through a digital lens, proposed five facets of a potentially serendipitous digital environment, and developed a self-report questionnaire to measure how well a digital environment supports serendipity. The content validity of the scale was tested and content subsequently refined through an expert review by eight researchers experienced in serendipity-related research and further tested and refined using a web-based question-naire in which 107 university students rated how well the items reflected each facet X  X  meaning. The five facets are defined below: enables exploration, trigger-rich, highlights triggers, enables connections, and leads to the unexpected ( McCay-Peet et al., 2014 ). 1. Enables exploration: the degree to which a digital environment supports exploration and examination of its information, ideas, or resources.

Digital environments that enable exploration provide individuals with opportunities to bump into information and ideas they may not have otherwise found through mechanisms that, for example, allow users to browse content ( Toms, 1997 ). The digital environment that enables exploration supports unimpeded and direct access, stopability, explorability, and multi-reachability ( Bj X rneborn, 2008 ). esting and useful to the user.
 encountered must be interesting and useful to have the potential to be serendipitous. It must contain triggers. Just as relationships to their own interests or needs, or what have been referred to as a person X  X  interest space or problem ( Bj X rneborn, 2008; Sun et al., 2011; Toms, 1997 ). 3. Highlights triggers: the degree to which a digital environment brings interesting and useful information, ideas, or resources to the user X  X  attention.

Face-to-face communication, visual saliency, noise, and emotion highlight triggers, bringing our focus of attention to these attributes to potential serendipitous triggers may help ensure they are noticed. Highlighting triggers through curios-ity-invoking displays, striking contrasts, and pointers ( Bj X rneborn, 2008 ) has been found to prompt divergent behaviour in physical libraries and thus may also prompt serendipity. With this rationale, Max, a web-based system that emails users links to websites with unexpected and interesting information ( Campos &amp; Figueiredo, 2002 ), and Mitsikeru, an ambient intelligence system that calls attention to interesting or surprising content (webpage links) relative to the user through visual cues ( Beale, 2007 ), were both developed to support serendipity. 4. Enables connections: the degree to which a digital environment makes relationships or connections between information, ideas, or resources apparent.

Connections is another main element of the process of serendipity; the recognition of a relationship between the trigger media sites that connect people to other people with interesting ideas and information.
 5. Leads to the unexpected: the degree to which a digital environment provides opportunities for unexpected interactions with information, ideas, or resources.

Unexpected thread is an important element of the process of serendipity; the unexpected, chance, accidental, or surpris-ing element that is evident in one or more of the trigger, connection, follow-up, or valuable outcome elements of the pected may increase opportunities for serendipity. In physical environments, this may take the form of imperfections such as was encountered; for example, an idea for a work project gleaned from a social media site primarily used for connecting with friends and family.

These five facets characterise user expectation about what a serendipitous digital environment might facilitate. But, there is also research that suggests a connection between serendipity and one X  X  creative environment or characteristics of the environment that support a person X  X  creativity. There are many areas of convergence between creativity and serendipity one broad definition of creativity includes the environment: creativity is  X  X  X  combination of interacting individual and tual parallel with divergence in the serendipity research (e.g., Bj X rneborn, 2008; Heinstr X m, 2006 ). With the right environmental conditions, an individual X  X  creative output may be enhanced leading to the creation of new products and ideas for a creative work environment to support serendipity, no research to date has explored the relationship between the cre-through education, practice, and tools, we know little of the relationships between the environment and serendipity. 2.2. Individual differences
While the environment in which an individual is immersed is one part of the equation of serendipity, individual differ-ences are another. It was not possible to explore all of the individual differences that might influence why one person has a propensity to have serendipitous experiences, while another does not. Therefore, we selected three individual differences that may be influential identified through prior research (e.g., Heinstr X m, 2006; McCay-Peet &amp; Toms, in press ): openness to experience, extraversion, and locus of control.

At face value, openness to experience and extraversion, two of the Big Five personality traits ( McCrae &amp; John, 1992 ), research often point to these qualities and behaviours of individuals. For example, Dantonio, Makri, and Blandford (2012) found in interviews with 15 postgraduates that spending both time and energy creating, sharing, and exploring social media content and making an effort to engage in conversations on social media sites had the potential to lead to more opportunity creative imagination is a necessary component of serendipity in science; scientists must not only draw upon their knowledge and experience (prepared mind) but also their ingenuity and creativity to provide an explanation for unexpected observa-tions ( Barber &amp; Fox, 1958 ).

In research on students X  incidental information acquisition (IIA) ( Heinstr X m, 2006 ), two studies ( N = 305 masters X  stu-dents; N = 27 library and information science students) in which the NEO Personality Inventory ( Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992 ) was administered found a significant relationship between extraversion and incidental information acquisition (IIA)  X   X  X  X c-openness to experience and IIA. More empirical research is required to support these findings and explore their complexities.
McCrae (1987) , for example, was careful to point out that while research indicates a relationship between openness to experience and divergent thinking, practice over time or incentives may lead those with relatively low openness scores to do equally well on divergent thinking tasks as open individuals. Perhaps incentives can make us behave in an extraverted and open manner that may otherwise be out of character, increasing opportunities for serendipity by changing the quality and frequency of our interactions with information, ideas, and phenomenon.
 led up to the opportunity. Many factors have the potential to influence locus of control making it a challenging construct to ceived their career paths were less influenced by chance events than those with an external locus of control in one study
In summary, while prior research suggests that both external and internal factors may influence serendipity and its per-ception, no research has empirically examined how different digital environments and their characteristics may facilitate serendipity. Likewise, while some prior research examined relationships between personality traits and concepts related to serendipity (e.g., chance events, incidental information acquisition), no research has investigated the influence of per-sonality on the perception of serendipity in digital environments. 3. Research design
Using a web-based survey, multiple questionnaires relating to the individual and the environment were administered to 289 professionals, academics, and graduate students. Our survey was designed to meet our main research objective:
To test whether the type of digital environment and selected characteristics of the individual, the work environment, and the digital environment have the potential to facilitate or influence serendipity.

To this end, several previously developed questionnaires were selected to measure individual differences and the work environment: locus of control of behaviour ( Craig, Franklin, &amp; Andrews, 1984 ), openness to experience ( Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004 ), extraversion ( Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004 ), and creative environment perceptions ( Mayfield &amp; Mayfield, 2010 ).

But how can we reach our research objective without instruments to measure serendipity? Without tools to measure the perception of serendipity and the serendipitous digital environment, three main problems persist: 1. Comparisons across digital environments are limited. 2. Examining the potential interactions between the individual and their environment is problematic. 3. Heuristics for the development of serendipitous digital environments are hit and miss.

We met the challenge of a lack of measures through the development of self-report questionnaires for the purposes of this research.

The serendipitous digital environment scale ( McCay-Peet et al., 2014 ), which was in the process of development and refined through research reported here, was used to both help further its development (see Section 7 ) and test relationships among serendipity, the environment, and individual differences. The serendipitous digital environment scale followed scale development procedures (e.g., DeVellis, 2003 ) and was designed to assess the degree to which a particular digital environ-enables connections, and (5) leads to the unexpected.

In addition, we needed a measure of serendipity itself. A perception of serendipity scale was developed for the purposes of this study to assess how frequently individuals perceive they experience serendipity at three levels: in a specific digital environment, digital environments in general, and in general (see Section 4.1.1 ). Through the development of a tool to mea-sure how frequently individuals perceive they experience serendipity  X  a global or direct measure of serendipity  X  we could then explore what variables may fuel these perceptions. Moreover, the perception of serendipity scale gave us the tool serendipity reflect these facets, research is needed to validate whether digital environments that better embody them are more likely to support serendipity than those that do not.

The inclusion of the instruments described above allowed for the exploration of the relationships among factors including types of digital environment (e.g., social media versus databases). Three main research questions (RQs) guided our research: RQ1 How does the type of digital environment an individual uses influence serendipity? For example, do people experience serendipity more frequently in social media sites than databases? RQ2 How does the type of digital environment influence a user X  X  perceptions of its characteristics?
In other words, are certain types of digital environments like databases more closely associated with characteristics such as leading to the unexpected or enabling connections than search engines? ment, creative environment perceptions, locus of control, openness to experience, and extraversion?
Several hypotheses relating to these RQs were generated and are described in Section 8 . Principal components analysis (PCA), multiple regression, and multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used to analyze the data. 4. Methodology 4.1. Study variables
An overview of the twelve study variables including origin, definition, and composition are outlined in Table 1 . Study vari-ables are bolded for clarity. The following sections describe the five types of variables outlined in Table 1 : perception of serendipity, serendipitous digital environment, type of digital environment, work environment, and individual differences.
Because the perception of serendipity and serendipitous digital environment variables were developed specifically for this research, their origin is described in more detail than the others. 4.1.1. Perception of serendipity
Three variables measuring the perception of serendipity were developed (see Table 1 , Row A). Prior research has designed direct measures of serendipity-related constructs to assess participants X  experience with information encountering ( Erdelez, 1995; P X lsd X ttir, 2010 ), incidental information acquisition (IIA) ( Heinstr X m, 2006 ), and incidental online news exposure previous studies have varied depending on the intent of the research. For example, some questions focused on the particular type of information encountered such as news or health; others were broader, specifying useful information while others focused on where the experience occurs or type of resources used, and still others were more general in nature and did not reference a particular topic or environment. For the purposes of our research, we developed three scales, each containing a set of statements designed to be direct measures of how frequently individuals perceive they experience serendipity (1) in a specific digital environment; (2) in digital environments in general; and (3) in general (no specific environment).
 ficity grounded in the environment but each capturing the phenomenon of serendipity and thus related. The three levels cap-ture the three ways in which discussions of serendipity are often framed today. Digital environments are pitted against environments in general (e.g., digital libraries versus physical libraries) and comparisons are made between specific digital environments such as Twitter and Google, with one held up as superior to another (see, for example, Andrew, 2014 ).
Each of the three scales contains four items. Responses to items are on a 5-point frequency scale (never, rarely, some-times, frequently, very frequently; I don X  X  know). Item wording is retained across these three scales. For example, the first on my everyday life. X  X  However, the specific digital environment scale prefaces this statement with  X  X  X n the digital environ-ments X  X  (S-DEs-1), while the general sub-scale contains no preamble (S-Gen-1).

While two of the statements in each of the sub-scales outlined in Table 2 use the word serendipity , one refers to serendip-ity in everyday life and the other to work-related serendipity because boundaries between the two appear to be blurred the use of the word serendipity to help cover the broad conceptual space of serendipity. One mirrors Erdelez X  X  (2005) def-inition of information encountering:  X  X  X n instance of accidental discovery of information during an active search for some other information X  X  (p. 180). The other was derived from Makri and Blandford X  X  (2012) main elements of serendipity identi-fied  X  X  X  mix of unexpectedness and insight [that lead] to a valuable, unanticipated outcome  X  X  (p. 684). Following principal components analysis, the three scales were computed to three study variables: Serendipity-
SpecificDE , Serendipity-DEs , and Serendipity-General . This analysis is described in Section 6 . 4.1.2. Serendipitous digital environment
Variables measuring the serendipitous digital environment were derived from a scale comprised of five facets developed of items such as  X  X  X  bump into unexpected content in it X  X  (U1) and responses to items are on a 5-point agreement scale (strongly agree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree; I don X  X  know). All items are listed in Appendix A . Following principal components analysis, four factors were extracted and computed to study variables: SDE-Enables
Connections , SDE-Highlights Triggers , SDE-Trigger-Rich , and SDE-Leads to the Unexpected . This analysis is described in Section 7 . 4.1.3. DE Type
The DE Type variable was derived from the specific digital environment each participant chose to assess: databases, social media, search engines, websites, or intranets. For example, one participant chose to select PubMed, which we subsequently categorised as a database. In this way, comparisons could be made among types of digital environments. This type of com-parison would not have been possible to conduct among specific digital environments due to the sheer number of diverse digital environments selected, as exemplified in Table 3 . 4.1.4. Work environment
The Creative Environment Perceptions variable was derived from the creative environment perceptions scale ( Mayfield responses to nine items including for example,  X  X  X y supervisor encourages me to be creative X  X  and  X  X  X y organisation encour-ages me to work creatively. X  X  The questionnaire includes nine items with responses on a Likert scale of agreement (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree). The mean of the nine items was computed to create the Creative
Environment Perceptions variable. 4.1.5. Individual differences
Locus of Control of Behaviour: The locus of control of behaviour questionnaire ( Craig et al., 1984 ) asks individuals to reflect on the extent to which they perceive that events are influenced by their own behaviour or, conversely, by something external to them through seventeen questionnaire items including as  X  X  X  great deal of what happens to me is probably just a ment (strongly agree, generally disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, generally agree, and strongly agree). The mean of the seventeen items was computed to create the Locus of Control of Behaviour variable.

Openness to Experience: Lee and Ashton X  X  (2004) openness to experience questionnaire asks individuals how much they ther agree nor disagree], agree, and strongly agree). The mean of the sixteen items was computed to create the Openness to Experience variable.

Extraversion: The extraversion questionnaire ( Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004 ) asks individuals how much they agree with sixteen and dynamic than I generally am. X  X  Responses are on the same Likert scale of agreement as Openness to Experience. The mean of the sixteen items was computed to create the Extraversion variable. 4.2. Questionnaire
The questionnaire had the following components: 1. Introduction and consent. 2. Demographics questionnaire to gain a profile of the participants. 3. Participant X  X  selection of a specific digital environment to assess (see Table 3 ). 4. Serendipitous digital environment scale (see Appendix A ). For the purposes of this study, for each item we replaced  X  X  X he digital environment X  X  with  X  X  X he digital environment I selected. X  X  Responses to the 37 items are on a 5-point agreement scale (strongly agree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree; I don X  X  know). quently, very frequently; I don X  X  know). 6. Environment and individual differences scales: 7. Option to provide email address to enter the prize draw, receive recruitment notices in the future, and receive a copy of the consent form. 8.

 For the full study instrument see McCay-Peet (2013, Appendix 5) .

Two versions of the questionnaire were created, but were nearly identical. In both cases, participants selected a digital environment, but the questionnaires were designed to prompt participants to recall different kinds of digital environments. Several examples were provided to help participants in their selection.

What digital environment (e.g., intranet, website) comes to mind when you read the following statement? academic studies. or academic studies that I had not planned to find.

Please indicate the name of one digital environment that comes to mind in the space provided below. Examples: your organisation X  X  intranet, a government website, ACM digital library, Twitter social media site, CNN website, Digg social news website.
 The two different prompts were developed to ensure participants selected a variety of digital environments to evaluate.
An adequate amount of variance is required for factor analysis. While the first was designed to prompt participants to recall digital environments in which they purposeful sought information, the second was designed to prompt participants to recall experiences with digital environments in which they came across information, ideas, or resources in a more serendipitous manner.

 4.3. Recruitment and participants
Professionals and academics who frequently search for and monitor information relating to their work and graduate stu-dents engaged in thesis work were invited to participate. Participants were recruited via flyers handed out at an academic conference and on a university campus, through web-based forums, listservs, and social media, and by encouraging col-leagues and participants to pass on the study link. As incentive, participants were given the opportunity to enter a draw for a chance to win one of twenty $20 online gift certificates.
 Of the 289 participants (female = 207, 71.6%), 151 (52.2%) completed Questionnaire 1 and 138 (47.8%) completed cation as Master X  X  ( N = 158, 54.7%), but many indicated undergraduate ( N = 61, 21.1%) or doctorate ( N = 41, 14.2%).
Participants include both those employed ( N = 184, 63.7%) and students ( N = 102, 35.3%). The students X  ( N = 102) area of study ranged and included social sciences ( N = 35, 34.3%) or professions and applied sciences ( N = 30, 29.4%), though some primarily indicated the broad category of social science, education, government service, and religion ( N = 99, 53.8%) best ture, recreation, and sport accounted for less than 5% of occupations. 4.4. Procedure
The questionnaire was accessible via the web over a one-month period from February to March 2013. Participants were provided the survey URL via the paper-and web-based recruitment instruments. On access, each was randomly assigned to one of the two versions described above (Questionnaire 1 or 2).

The survey instrument used open source LimeSurvey software, and was hosted on a secure university server. Participants moved through the survey in the order indicated in Section 4.2 ; however, the order in which participants were presented with the creative environment perceptions, openness to experience, extraversion, and locus of control of behaviour question-tal environment scale and the perception of serendipity scale were randomised to prevent order effects.
Data were downloaded and converted to SPSS and Microsoft Excel files for analysis. The emails collected for the prize draw, consent form, and future recruitment were downloaded without participant ID numbers and saved to a separate
Excel file. Random number software was used to select the prize draw winners and those who requested the consent form were emailed a copy. 5. Data analysis
The data was first checked to ensure it was suitable for multivariate analysis. Of the original 353 participants, 289 remained after missing data and univariate and multivariate outliers were checked, using the following steps: (1) Reverse scoring: Questionnaires containing negative items were reverse scored. (2) Mean substitution: Means were computed for those participants who responded to at least 14 of the 16 openness to (3) Univariate outliers: Two sets of data were removed due to careless responders. (4) Normality and linearity: Checked and found satisfactory. (5) Multivariate outliers: One multivariate outlier was identified. Analyses were run with and without this outlier. The (6) Correlations: Correlations of 53 variables (37 serendipitous digital environment scale items, 12 perception of
In summary, 64 cases were removed due to two careless or inattentive responders, one multivariate outlier, and 61 cases variables with no variables containing more than 5% missing data, which is an indication that none of the items were problematic.

The free-text responses in which participants selected a specific digital environment to respond to the serendipitous digi-tal environment scale were deductively coded as databases, social media, search engines, websites, or intranets to prepare  X  X  X nclear, X  X  or  X  X  X ther. X  X  The definitions of digital environment types together with examples are contained in Table 3 . Once the data were prepared, data analysis unfolded as follows, which outlines the next three sections of the paper: Section 6 : Principal components analysis of the perception of serendipity data to identify variables for further analysis in Section 8 .

Section 7 : Principal components analysis of the serendipitous digital environment data to identify variables for further analysis in Section 8 .

Section 8 : MANOVA and multiple regression analysis of relationships among perception of serendipity (Section 6 ), the serendipitous digital environment (Section 7 ), work environment, and individual differences. 6. Identifying perception of serendipity variables
Principal components analysis with varimax rotation and extraction based on eigenvalues was applied to the data drawn from the perception of serendipity scale (see Table 2 ). Three factors were extracted explaining 71.6% of the vari-ance in a single iteration of exploratory factor analysis, a robust solution. All four items in the first factor were serendipity in Digital Environments in General items and explained 25.9% of the variance. All four items in the second factor were serendipity in a Specific Digital Environment items and explained 24.7% of the variance. Finally, all three items in the third factor were serendipity in General items and explained 21.0% of the variance. The communalities ( h ) were fairly high, ranging from .61 to .78. Results are shown in Table 4 . Subscale reliability for all three was very good: Digital Environments in General = .88.
 Specific Digital Environment = .83.
 General = .83.

The mean of each of the three factors were computed to prepare them for use as dependent variables in Section 8 of this paper.

In summary, in a single iteration of exploratory factor analysis, the number of items of the perception of serendipity scale was maintained at eleven (a twelfth item was removed prior to this analysis in Section 5 due to high correlation) and three factors were extracted explaining 71.6% of the total variance  X  a robust solution. All three factors had very good subscale reliability: Digital Environments in General.

 These three factors were computed into variables for analysis and are henceforth referred to as Serendipity-Specific DE ,

Further analyses (Section 8.2.2 ) will help us understand what characteristics of the individual and the environment may influence these variances. 7. Identifying serendipitous digital environment variables
The sets of seven to nine items for each of the five serendipitous digital environment facets (see list in Appendix A ) were each examined separately in SPSS 17.0 using principal components analysis with varimax rotation and extraction based on eigenvalues to reduce the items of each facet to more parsimonious sets. Items of the serendipitous digital environment scale Connections; U = Leads to the Unexpected) and a number (e.g., H1, H2).

The four or five highest loading items per facet were retained for further analysis, which resulted in the total number of items being reduced from 37 to 24. Previous research ( McCay-Peet et al., 2014 ) had been unable to deduce whether the this preliminary iteration of factor analysis, confirming their potentially confounded relationship with Trigger-Rich items. rather than the usefulness or helpfulness of the information contained in the digital environment, which was the intended primary function of the Trigger-Rich facet.

For factor analysis, Meyers, Gamst, and Guarino (2006) recommend a sample size to variables ratio of ten to one, though not below N = 200. Therefore, a sample size of 289 was adequate to proceed with data analysis of the remaining 24 items.
To identify the most parsimonious set of items of the serendipitous digital environment scale and identify its factors without imposing a pre-conceived structure on the outcome, exploratory factor analysis using principal components, vari-items loading &lt;.63 (low loading) would be removed from further analysis as well as items loading on more than one factor 2013 ). Due to correlations among factors, both orthogonal (varimax) and oblique (oblimin) rotations were performed.
Results were the same for both, therefore, only the results of the varimax rotation are reported here. Three iterations of analysis were conducted and results are summarized below.

First iteration: Five factors extracted. Total variance explained = 67.2%. Items reduced from 24 to 19. Items C8, H4, E1, E8 removed due to cross loading. T2 removed due to low loading.

Second iteration: Four factors extracted. Total variance explained = 65.3%. Items reduced from 19 to 15. Items E2, E9, C2 removed due to cross loading. E3 removed due to low loading.
 Third iteration: Four factors extracted. Total variance explained = 70.6%. All 15 items retained.

All five items in the first factor were from the original Leads to the Unexpected facet (U1, U4, U5, U7, U2) and explained 23.4% of the variance. All four items of the second factor were from the original Highlights Triggers facet (H8, H10, H2, H9) and explained 18.1% of the variance. All three items from the third factor were from the original Enables Connections facet
Trigger-Rich facet (T5, T6, T7) and explained 13.7% of the variance. None of the items from the original Enables Exploration facet remained. Results of the final iteration of exploratory factor analysis are shown in Table 5 . ing from .62 to .79. Subscale reliability or internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach X  X  alpha and DeVellis X  (2003) guideline for interpreting alpha.
 Leads to the Unexpected = .89 (very good).
 Highlights Triggers = .83 (very good).
 Enables Connections = .86 (very good).
 Trigger-Rich = .75 (respectable).

The mean of each of the four serendipitous digital environment factors were computed to prepare them for use as depen-dent variables.

In summary, with three iterations of exploratory factor analysis, the number of items of the serendipitous digital environ-ment scale was reduced to fifteen items and four factors were extracted explaining 70.6% of the total variance. Enables factor. Enables Exploration items appeared to share too much in common with more than one factor. The four factors that did emerge had good subscale reliability: 1. Leads to the Unexpected. 2. Highlights Triggers. 3. Enables Connections. 4. Trigger-Rich.

These four serendipitous digital environment (SDE) factors were computed into variables for further analysis and are henceforth referred to as SDE-Leads to the Unexpected , SDE-Highlights Triggers , SDE-Enables Connections , and SDE-
Trigger-Rich . 8. Relationships among the perception of serendipity, environment, and individual differences This third analysis addressed the relationships among the three perception of serendipity variables ( Serendipity-Specific DE , Serendipity-DEs , and Serendipity-General) , the four serendipitous digital environment variables ( SDE-Enables Connections ; SDE-Highlights Triggers ; SDE-Trigger-Rich ; and SDE-Leads to the Unexpected) , DE Type , Creative Environment Perceptions , Openness to Experience , Extraversion , and Locus of Control .
 To explore relationships we developed the following five hypotheses relating to our three research questions. RQ1 How does the type of digital environment an individual uses influence serendipity? ( Serendipity-Specific DE ).
 RQ2 How does the type of digital environment influence a user X  X  perceptions of its characteristics? connections, highlights triggers, is trigger rich, and leads to the unexpected ( SDE-Enables Connections ; SDE-Highlights Triggers ; SDE-Trigger-Rich ; and SDE-Leads to the Unexpected) .

RQ3 What relationships exist among the perception of serendipity and the underlying facets of a serendipitous digital environment, creative environment perceptions, locus of control, openness to experience, and extraversion? enced by the creativity of their work environments, their locus of control, how open to experience and extraverted they are, and whether people perceive the specific digital environment enables connections, highlights triggers, is trigger rich, and lead to the unexpected ( Creative Environment Perception ; Locus of Control of Behaviour ; Openness to
Experience; Extraversion; SDE-Enables Connections; SDE-Highlights Triggers; SDE-Trigger-Rich ; and SDE-Leads to the Unexpected) .
 the creativity of their work environments, their locus of control, and how open to experience and extraverted they are ( Creative Environment Perception ; Locus of Control of Behaviour ; Openness to Experience; Extraversion) . their work environments, their locus of control, and how open to experience and extraverted they are ( Creative Environment Perception ; Locus of Control of Behaviour ; Openness to Experience; Extraversion) .

Data analysis examining relationships consisted of two main stages. The first stage was designed to test H MANOVA with DE Type as the independent variable while the remaining study variables functioned as dependent variables.
All study variables were included in the MANOVA though formal hypotheses were not developed for each variable. By per-forming analyses including all of the dependent variables, interrelations between the variables can be taken into account and a more complete picture of perceptions of digital environments may be captured.

The second stage of data analysis tested H 3 ,H 4 , and H
Serendipity-Specific DE , Serendipity-DEs , and Serendipity-General as dependent variables while the four serendipitous digital environment variables, Creative Environment Perceptions , Openness to Experience , Extraversion , and Locus of
Control as the independent variables. 8.1. Data analysis Descriptive statistics and correlations of the study variables are shown in Table 6 .
 The following section describes the results of the two main stages of data analysis: Stage1: MANOVA with DE Type as the independent variable and the study variables in Table 6 as the dependent variables. This analysis was designed to test H 1 and H 2.
 Stage 2: Three separate multiple regression analyses with Serendipity-Specific DE , Serendipity-DEs , and Serendipity-
General as the dependent variables and the remaining variables in Table 6 as the independent variables. This analysis was designed to test H 3 ,H 4 , and H 5 . 8.2. Results
We first examine the results of a MANOVA designed to test the hypotheses that the type of digital environment (e.g., web-site, search engine, database) will influence how frequently people experience serendipity (H leads to the unexpected (H 2 ). We then examine the results of three multiple regression analyses through which we test the remaining three hypotheses that the frequency of the three levels of the perception of serendipity is influenced by the creativity of their work environments, their locus of control, how open to experience and extraverted they are (H
H ,H 5 ) and how well a specific digital environment enables connections, highlights triggers, is trigger rich, and leads to the unexpected (H 3 ).
 environment RQ1 How does the type of digital environment an individual uses influence serendipity? RQ2 How does the type of digital environment influence a user X  X  perceptions of its characteristics?
To answer our first two research questions and test our hypotheses (H multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed with all study variables contained in Table 1 . The independent variable was DE Type and the remaining eleven variables relating to serendipity, the environment and the individual were 17%), websites ( N = 42, 15%) and intranets ( N = 21, 7%). Comparisons of digital environments in which the type was unclear results and therefore were left out of this analysis. Effect sizes of partial g large (.25) ( Cohen, 1988 ).

Using Wilk X  X  criterion the composite dependent variate was significantly affected by DE Type , Wilk X  X  k , F [44,916.31) = 3.62, p &lt; .001, partial g 2 = .14. Univariate ANOVAs were conducted on each variable separately to determine the cause for the significant multivariate, medium-sized effect. Five of the variables were significantly affected by DE Type . A medium effect size was found for
Serendipity-Specific DE , F (4,249) = 11.47, p &lt; .001, partial g
SDE-Leads to the Unexpected , F (4,249) = 13.61, p &lt; .001, partial g
SDE-Trigger-Rich , F (4,249) = 6.14, p &lt; .001, partial g
A small effect size was found for DE-Enables Connections , F (4,249) = 3.83, p &lt; .01, partial g sised, a small effect size was also found for Openness to Experience , F (4,249) = 2.90, p &lt; .05, partial g Those variables with significant results are explored through posthoc results. Results of the MANOVA are displayed in Table 7 . Table 8 contains the mean scores and standard deviations for the eleven dependent variables as a function of DE Type .

Serendipity-Specific DE post hoc. DE Type shares a relationship with individuals X  perceptions of how frequently they experience serendipity in a specific digital environment. Serendipity-Specific DE was significantly higher for social media
SD = .63). Serendipity-Specific DE was also significantly lower for intranets than websites ( M = 3.25, SD = .72) and search engines.

SDE-Leads to the Unexpected post hoc. DE Type shares a relationship with individuals X  perceptions of how well a digital environment leads to the unexpected. Specifically, SDE-Leads to the Unexpected was significantly higher for social media
SD = .85). SDE-Leads to the Unexpected score for websites was also significantly higher than that for intranets and databases.

SDE-Trigger-Rich post hoc DE Type shares a relationship with individuals X  perceptions of their environment as trigger-media ( M = 4.16, SD = .69) and higher for databases ( M = 4.46, SD = .51) than intranets or social media.
SDE-Enables Connections post hoc DE Type shares a relationship with individuals X  perceptions of the ability of a digital environment to enable connections. SDE-Enables Connections was significantly higher for websites ( M = 3.92, SD = .75) than for intranets ( M= 3.14, SD = 1.09) and search engines ( M = 3.33, SD = 1.00).

Openness to Experience post hoc. DE Type shares a relationship with Openness to Experience . Those assessing social media sites had significantly higher Openness to Experience scores ( M= 3.99, SD = .45) than those assessing intranets ( M = 3.61, SD = .56).

In summary, H 1 was confirmed while H 2 was partially confirmed. Results of the MANOVA indicated that some types of digital environments may be more conducive to serendipity than others (H of a serendipitous digital environment vary by type of digital environment (H and functions of these digital environments may underlie perception of serendipity. In other words, findings give credence to the belief that we can design digital environments to better support serendipity. Serendipity was perceived to occur more frequently in some digital environments than others  X  namely, in social media versus databases, search engines, or intranets and in websites and search engines versus intranets. Examining particular features and functions common to these digital environments may point to how we can design for serendipity. However, while there were differences in perceptions of how trigger-rich a digital environment is and how well it enables connections and leads to the unexpected across different example, the various websites assessed (see Table 3 ), more research is needed to examine these perceptions. Moreover, while the findings are encouraging, more research is needed to confirm all of the findings of this MANOVA due to the rela-tively low number of participants ( N = 21, 7%) who assessed intranets in particular. In addition, the finding that those who assessed a social media site had higher levels of openness to experience than those who selected intranets to assess was not anticipated. However, this result makes sense relative to prior research indicating people more open to experience are more assess for this study.
 ment, creative environment perceptions, locus of control, openness to experience, and extraversion?
To answer our final research question and test our hypotheses ( H regression analyses were performed using Serendipity-Specific DE , Serendipity-DEs , and Serendipity-General as the dependent variables and the variables relating to the serendipitous digital environment, work environment, and individual differences as the independent variables. The results are described below and outlined in Table 9 . Effect sizes of R interpreted as small (.02), medium (.13), and large (.26) ( Cohen, 1988 ).

Serendipity in specific digital environments. H 3 , which examined relationships between serendipity in a specific digital environment ( Serendipity-Specific DE) and environmental and individual differences variables, was partially confirmed. We did find that perceptions of how frequently serendipity occurs in a specific digital environment such as Twitter or to the unexpected ( SDE-Enables Connections, SDE-Trigger-Rich , SDE-Leads to the Unexpected) . However, how well the digital environment highlighted triggers ( SDE-Highlights Triggers) or brought information to people X  X  attention had no influence on the perceived serendipitousness of the digital environment. Creative Environment Perceptions , Openness to Experience , Extraversion, or Locus of Control of Behaviour also had no influence on perception of serendipity. The mod-el X  X  variables, however, explain 51% of the variance of how frequently serendipity occurs in the digital environment they selected, a large effect size.

Serendipity in digital environments in general. H 4 , which examined relationships between perceptions of serendipity in digital environments in general and environmental and individual differences variables, was not confirmed. No relationships were found between participants X  perceptions of how frequently serendipity occurred and any of the hypothesised variables ( Creative Environment Perceptions , Openness to Experience , Extraversion, or Locus of Control of Behaviour ). Though not hypothesised, a relationship was found between Serendipity-DEs and SDE-Leads to the Unexpected and SDE-Enables Connections . The model, however, explains just 12% of the variance, a small effect size.
 Serendipity in general. H 5 , which examined relationships between the perception of serendipity in general ( Serendipity-
General) and environmental and individual differences variables was partially confirmed. Only Extraversion had an influ-ence on how frequently people perceived they experience serendipity. Though not hypothesised, a relationship was also found between Serendipity-General and SDE-Enables Connections . The model, however, explains only 5% of the variance, a small effect size.

In summary, H 3 , relating to what influences perception of serendipity in a specific digital environment and H perception of serendipity in general were partially confirmed. H ments in general was rejected. Results indicate how trigger-rich a specific digital environment is and how well it enables connections and leads to the unexpected influences perceptions of how frequently serendipity occurs in that digital environ-ment. This was not, however, the case for how well a digital environment highlights triggers, which challenges the hypothe-sis that a digital environment that points to or alerts users to interesting information supports serendipity. As well, the creativity of their work environments, their locus of control, and how open to experience individuals are had no influence on how frequently they experienced serendipity in a specific digital environment, digital environments in general, or in gen-eral. However, we did find a significant, though small, relationship between those with higher levels of extraversion and a propensity to experience serendipity in general.

The results that were not hypothesised included: (1) a relationship between how frequently serendipity occurs in digital environments in general and how well the specific digital environment leads to the unexpected and enables connection and (2) between how frequently serendipity occurs in general and how well the specific digital environment enables connections. However, given that the perception of serendipity scale measures nested levels of the perception of serendipity ( Fig. 1 ), perception of specific digital environments are encompassed with the broader measures of serendipity in digital environments in general and serendipity in general, causing a pebble-in-the-water ripple effect. The decreasing ability of the factors relating to the serendipitous digital environment to explain variance in the three models of decreasing levels of granularity helps supports this interpretation. 9. Discussion
This research examined a number of variables relating to the individual and the environment that may influence serendipity and found that the type of digital environment such as social media and databases as well as the more specific perceived characteristics of a digital environment play a significant role in perception of serendipity.
While five potential facets of the serendipitous digital environment were examined, the enables exploration facet perhaps shares too much conceptual space with the other four facets to be a distinct factor. Environments that enable exploration may still support serendipity but instead may manifest in part through trigger-rich perceptions. After all, comprehending how trigger-rich an environment is  X  the extent of its information, ideas, or resources  X  may be facilitated in part through relationship with serendipity. Maybe it is enough for digital environments to be trigger-rich; users will notice what is most salient to them, what catches their interest, not just what is most visually salient ( McCay-Peet, Lalmas, &amp; Navalpakkam, 2012 ). Or perhaps there is no relationship because a digital environment that highlights triggers prompts divergent behaviour, but not the more complex phenomenon of serendipity, the process of which involves five main elements: trigger, connection, follow-up, valuable outcomes, and an unexpected thread that runs through one or more of the elements main elements of model of the process of serendipity.

While the environment may help shape people X  X  experience with serendipity (e.g., Sun et al., 2011 ), how creative their work environment is did not emerge as an important factor despite the apparent overlap between serendipity and creativity.
Surprisingly, with the exception of extraversion, individual differences examined in this research also do not appear to be good predictors of how frequently individuals perceive they experience serendipity. It makes sense that those more likely often identified as an important theme in both general discussions of serendipity and efforts to support serendipity (e.g.,
Rubin et al., 2011 ). However the concept of control in relation to the phenomenon of serendipity has elements of both per-sonal agency (e.g., prepared mind) and external influence (e.g., chance events) and this push and pull may lead people to and external forces at play. For example, someone with an internal locus of control who recalls stumbling upon a link to an cle by chance; however, experience and knowledge allowed me to recognise the article X  X  importance and do something use-ful with it. Or perhaps rather than locus of control, serendipity is more closely associated with expectations that may vary depending on the environment and the situation.

While this research supports prior research that found people who are open to experience may use social media more to have serendipitous experiences within social media sites as their more open counterparts. It may be that digital environ-ments have an equalising effect in which personality may be less important than characteristics of the digital environment in enabling serendipity. However, the cumulative qualitative evidence in prior research of an association between openness and serendipity cannot be dismissed. While openness as a personality trait may not be an important factor in serendipity, other forms of openness may be; for example, those grounded in situations or in work-related strategies or best practices rather than personality. Professionals and academics, the focus of this research, have incentives to be open to experience relative to their work and research, motivations to keep an eye out for information and ideas that might be useful.
Moreover, professionals and academics may have been trained to be open to experience in relation to their work, leading to equal opportunity for serendipity despite potential personality differences.

While we confirmed a relationship between extraversion and serendipity in general, its relationship is relatively weak and does not extend to serendipity within digital environments. Perhaps, like openness to experience, technology provides a democratising effect, giving intraverts and extraverts alike the opportunity for serendipity within digital environments, regardless of how extraverted they may be in face-to-face interactions. Extraversion X  X  weak relationship to serendipity buoys ing number of social media tools are centre stage (e.g., Twitter) or play a supporting role (e.g., social recommendations) in digital environments, interactions within these digital environments may still be predominantly object-oriented rather than tion and ideas presented by others without ever having a personal exchange. Research, for example, suggests that Twitter may be described as an information network rather than a social network due to the lack of reciprocal ties ( Kwak, Lee, Park, and Moon (2010) .

This research has a number of limitations. We asked participants to recall their experience in a specific digital environ-ment when responding to the serendipitous digital environment scale. Thus, the recency of these experiences and partici-pants X  ability to recall them may have influenced responses. As well, the nature of serendipity itself has been historically attributed to both the environment and the individual; therefore, we felt it was important to test these relationships.
Consequently, we had a large number of variables increasing the possibility of a type 1 error  X  falsely concluding there is a relationship when in fact none exists. Therefore, further research is needed to support our findings. Furthermore, though we identified from participants X  freeform responses overlapped; for example, social media sites and websites. And there is a types were selected more than others leading to some low cell counts in the analysis, potentially weakening the strength of the results. Finally, while we were able to identify relationships between several variables, they do not prove causation.
Future work will need to examine through controlled studies whether, for example, a digital environment that scores high on the serendipitous digital environment scale is assessed as more serendipitous than a digital environment that scores low on the serendipitous digital environment scale. 10. Conclusions and future research
Through our web-based study of 289 professionals, academics, and students engaged in thesis work, we developed a 11-item scale to measure serendipity at three nested levels, reduced the serendipitous digital environment scale to a more parsimonious set of 15 items, explored relationships between serendipity, the environment, and individual differences, and came to the following main conclusions.

Enables exploration, one of the five proposed facets of the serendipitous digital environment, appears to share too much conceptual space with the other facets. Thus while support for exploration may still be an important to designers and developers interested in facilitating serendipity, a system X  X  capacity for supporting exploration may be assessed through other elements of the scale (e.g., enables connections).

Three of the four proposed factors of the serendipitous digital environment were found to share a relationship with serendipity. An environment that highlights triggers did not share a significant relationship with serendipity. This finding may have implications for systems design; it suggests that overt tactics for drawing attention to information and ideas, however useful and unexpected, may backfire if the intent is to facilitate serendipity. Personalised email alerts or recom-mendations, for example, may lesson the perception of serendipity by revealing the structure and control that underlies the design of all digital environments. Future research will seek to understand whether this is the case and why.
The three factors of the serendipitous digital environment scale that share a relationship with serendipity  X  trigger-rich, enables connections, and leads to the unexpected  X  help confirm the model of process of serendipity ( McCay-Peet &amp; Toms, in press ) that contains the corresponding elements of trigger, connection, and unexpected thread.

Whether the digital environment is a website, database, social media site, work intranet, or search engine may influence how frequently users perceive they experience serendipity in that environment. Future research will examine which specific features (e.g., related items, alerts, personalised results) of these digital environments are perceived to be asso-ciated with serendipity and develop heuristics for those who aim to develop digital environments to support serendipity.
Extraversion shares a significant, though small, relationship with serendipity in general though this relationship is not evident relative to serendipity in digital environments.

Openness to experience, locus of control, and creative environment perceptions shared no relationship to perception of serendipity. Perhaps future research could examine the influence of other broad work environment factors, more social factors, for example, relating to networking or collaboration and different factors relating to the individual such as the prepared mind or temporary states such as unfocussed attention.

More work needs to be done to further develop and validate the perception of serendipity and serendipitous digital environment scales, but more tools and methods are needed to help examine the complex problem of support for serendip-ity. Despite research indicating serendipity X  X  significance across a number of fields and the pervasive and persuasive anec-conclude that while further research is needed to understand these relationships, environment matters. Design for serendip-ity in digital environments is within reach if we can further understand and embody the perceived characteristics of the serendipitous digital environment in our databases, websites, social media sites, and search engines.
