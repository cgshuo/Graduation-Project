 We consider blog feed search: identifying relevant blogs for a given topic. An individual X  X  search behavior often involves a combination of exploratory behavior triggered by salient features of the infor-mation objects being examined plus goal-directed in-depth infor-mation seeking behavior. We present a two-stage blog feed search model that directly builds on this insight. We first rank blog posts for a given topic, and use their parent blogs as selection of blogs that we rank using a blog-based model.

We focus on blogs: the unedited, unregulated voice of an indi-vidual [ 5], as published on a web page containing time-stamped entries. The blogosphere has shown a huge increase in volume in recent years, and is now a major source of information online. To allow for end users to follow a blog that regularly covers a given topic, we can provide them with a ranking of blogs that are likely to show a recurring interest in the topic. This task of identifying topi-cally relevant blogs is referred to as blog feed search . Even though the unit of retrieval is blogs, the indexing unit should be blog posts, as this allows for easy incremental indexing, and the use of a single index for both blog feed search and blog post retrieval. Indeed, all current approaches to this task use a post index [ 1, 2, 4, 6].
We propose a two-stage model to blog feed search. The model exploits the following observation about human strategies for iden-tifying complex information objects such as blogs (or people, for that matter). Prior to in-depth examination of complex informa-tion objects, humans display exploratory search behavior triggered by salient features of such objects [ 3]. This insight gives rise to the following two-stage model for blog feed search. In stage 1, we take individual utterances (i.e., posts ) to play the role of  X  X ttention trig-gers X  and select an initial sample of blogs based on the most inter-esting posts given the query, using a post-based approach. Here, we define  X  X nteresting X  as topically relevant, but more elaborate tech-niques can also be applied (e.g., credibility, novelty, etc. [ 8]). Then, in stage 2, we only consider these most interesting blogs, which we then examine more in-depth by considering all their posts to deter-mine the likelihood of the topic being a central theme of the blog, using a blog-based approach.

We hypothesize that by pruning the list of posts taken into ac-count in stage 1, and thus focusing on the most interesting ut-terances, we can achieve improvements over a blog-based model baseline on effectiveness and, as a result of blog selection, also on efficiency. Furthermore, we expect to see a considerable improve-ment on precision when applying pruning, and more so, when using a lean, title-only document representation in stage 1.
Previous work in blog feed search centered around two families of approaches: blog-based models and post-based models. Blog-based models use posts to construct a model for each blog. Rank-ing is done by matching the query against these blog models. Ex-amples of blog-based models include the Blogger model [ 1]and the Long Document model [ 2]. The other type of approaches, post-based models, start from a ranking of blog posts and scores of individual posts are aggregated in order to infer a ranking of blogs [ 1, 2, 4]; these models boil down to estimating the relevance of blog posts and associating these posts to their parent blogs, us-ing some weighted association value. Various ways of aggregating scores [ 4] and association values [ 2, 9] have previously been dis-cussed. Both families of approaches have problems: post-based models ignore the recurring interest requirement; just a few rele-vant posts in a blog can be enough for it to be ranked high, even though other posts are non-relevant. On the other hand, blog-based models can become quite inefficient when applied to large numbers of frequently updated blogs, where each consists of several posts.
We are working in a language m odeling setting a nd rank docu-ments (blogs, posts) based on their likelihood of being generated from the query. We use Bayes X  Theorem to rewrite this probability: P (
D | Q )= P ( D ) P ( Q | D ) /P ( Q ) .As P ( Q ) does not influence the ranking, we drop this term; we assume P ( D ) , i.e., the a priori belief of a document D being relevant, to be uniform. This term can therefore be ignored. We are left with P ( D | Q )  X  P our specific case we rank blogs, and try to estimate the probability P ( Q | blog ) .

In stage 1, we are looking for salient utterances on the topic in blog posts. Therefore, we rank posts for a given query using: where P ( t |  X  post )=(1  X   X  post ) P ( t | post )+  X P ( with the background collection) and n ( t, Q ) is the number of times term t is present in the query. We use the top N most relevant utterances (posts) to identify the set of possibly interesting blogs: where P ( post | blog ) denotes the importance of a post given a blog, which is assumed to be uniform. Note that the summation part in Eq. 2 corresponds to a post-based model for ranking blogs, how-ever, in our approach it is only used for identifying blogs that de-serve to be ranked for the topic.

Having identified the set of possibly interesting blogs, we now estimate the probability of each blog  X  X  having generated the query, i.e., displaying a recurring interest in the topic: We represent blogs as a multinomial probability distributions over the vocabulary terms, and infer a blog model  X  blog , such that the probability of a term given the blog model is P ( t |  X  blog struct such a representation, we first aggregate all terms from posts of the blog to estimate an empirical model: Then, this probability P ( t | blog ) is smoothed using the background collection probability P ( t ) , to arrive at P ( t |  X  blog is done analogously to smoothing applied to posts).
We test whether our two-stage model is capable of effective blog feed search. We perform two series of experiments. First, we in-vestigate the amount of pruning applied, i.e., the value of N in Eq. 2. We consider three settings: no pruning, topic-independent pruning (train on 2007 topics, test on 2008, and vice versa), and topic-dependent pruning (best empirically found values per topic). The  X  X o pruning X  cond ition corresponds to the blog-based model (Blogger model in [ 1]). Our second set of experiments concerns the representation of posts for stage 1 of our approach. We com-pare the results of the two-stage model to a blog-based model only, since blog-based models usually outperform post-based models [ 1].
The blog feed search task ran at TREC 2007 and 2008 [ 7]and uses the TRECBlog06 corpus. We use the English blog posts, and ignore blogs that only have 1 post. We have a total of 95 topics and relevance judgments, and we only u se the title field of the topics. In our experiments, we optimize for MAP. Testing for significance is done using a two-tailed paired t-test; significant differences are indicated using and (  X  =0 . 01 ), and and (  X  =0 . 05 ).
Tabl e 1 lists the results on the 2007 and 2008 topics for the blog-based model, and the various settings for stage 1 in our two-stage model. Results show that our model is at least as effective as the blog-based model, while being considerably more efficient: The blog-based model examines all 2.5M blog-post associations, while our two-stage model considers just 1% (23,700) in stage 2. Topic independent pruning results in a slight improvement in effective-ness over the blog-based model, while topic dependent pruning results in significant improvements. The use of a lean document representation, with an average document length of just 12 words, results in very good overall precision scores.

Topic dependent pruning of the post list in stage 1 helps, and we can combine this with a lean document representa-tion to improve early precision even further. Future work is aimed at learning the optimal pruning level per topic.
