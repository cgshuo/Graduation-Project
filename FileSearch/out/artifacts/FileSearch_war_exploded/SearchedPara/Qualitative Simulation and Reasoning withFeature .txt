 On the other hand, RST believes that knowledge has granularity, the smaller, roughness and information entropy, proving the monotony of knowledge rough of informational view and algebraic view of RST and provides reduction algo-set and rough classification.

In the above study, knowledge rough entropy is failing to show accurately entropy based on boundary region and is an attempt to solve measure uncer-reduction algorithm of decision table based on boundary conditional entropy the problem of knowledge redundancy by using feature reduction method in qualitative reasoning and simulation. R called B-lower approximation and B-upper approximation respectively. Given { by D.
 Definition 2.1 [6-9]. The information entropy of knowledge B is defined as follows, Definition 2.2 [8]. Conditional information entropy of knowledge C with re-spect to D is defined as follows, From Definition 2.2, we get H ( D | C )=  X  therefore, positive region of decision system has no effect on H ( D | C ). uncertainty by boundary region.

Decision system S =( U, C  X  D, f ), P, Q  X  C , define partial order relation  X  : P  X  Q  X  U/R P  X  U/R Q , then P is more refined than Q (or: Q is rougher strictly rougher than P), shown as P  X  Q .
 { conational entropy against D are defined as follows respectively: Proposition 3.1. E BN ( B  X  D )= E BN ( D | B )  X  E BN ( B ). Proof. E BN ( B  X  D )=  X  Additionally because So E BN ( D | B )= E BN ( B  X  D )+ That X  X  E BN ( B  X  D )= E BN ( D | B )  X  E BN ( B ). (Finished) Proposition 3.2. Decision system S =( U, C  X  D, f ), A, B  X  C .If A  X  B , then E BN ( D | A )  X  E BN ( D | B ).
 According to proposition 3.1: E E + + so  X E = E BN ( D | B )  X  E BN ( D | A ) = + + Additionally because Thus  X E =  X  + + + =  X  log 2 p [( G p  X  G q )  X  D i ] } + +log 2 p ( G p  X  G q )  X  log 2 p ( G q )  X  log 2 p [( G p  X  G q )  X  D i ] } x&gt; 0 ,y &gt; 0 , 0  X  a  X  1 , 0  X  b  X  1, then If a  X  b =0,get f i  X  0. 0 &lt;a  X  1 , 0 &lt;b  X  1 shall be only considered in the following: then when  X  = a b = 1, function f i gets the minimal f i |  X  =1 =0 . reduces with the diminishing of information granularity. It shows that boundary conditional entropy of knowledge decreases with the based on conditional entropy reduction associated to boundary region related redundancy. 4.1 Heuristic Algorithm for Feature Reduction The significance of attribute is defined as follows: binBwithrespecttoDisdefinedasfollows, We know such important conclusions as information entropy is monotonously reducing with the diminishing of information granularity. Because B is more b is important in B can be measured based on the increment of boundary con-system, i.e., D =  X  , then we can consider E BN (  X  | B )= H ( B ). Proposition 4.1. b is necessary in B when Sig B \{ b } ( D |{ b } ) &gt; 0.

Repeat: E The time complexity of the algorithm is O ( | C | 3 | U | 2 ). or CEBARKCC [8]: { Similarly, we can get { aresult: { a, e } ,Stop.
 4.2 Application of KIEBAFR in Qualitative Simulation and { [ x ] , [ f ] , [ a ] , [ v ] } ).

The qualitative differential equations of spring physical system can be ob-tained by KIEBAR algorithm. i.e., [ f ]=[ a ], [ f ]=[ x ], [ x ]=[ a ].
The explanation is as follows: in qualitative expression information system, { is the modulus of spring flexibility)[10]. The existence of boundary region is the major cause of set uncertainty. The edge boundary rough entropy and boundary conditional entropy, and describes some algebraic view in RST by using the method of boundary conditional en-is a powerful method in data mining and of good reliability and prospect in qualitative reasoning and qualitative simulation.
