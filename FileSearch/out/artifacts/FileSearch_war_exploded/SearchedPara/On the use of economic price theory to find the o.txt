The approach presented in this paper is limited to cases where global recoding [12] is used as the main technique for microdata anonymisation.

In this Section, we provide a brief overview of the concepts from economic price theory that were used as a basis for ferred to these works for more information on economic price theory.

Let us suppose that a consumer has a particular income I that he wishes to spend on two goods , x the two goods x 1 and x 2 , we can represent this as an equation known as the consumer X  X  budget : p consumer X  X  (economic) utility [16].

Consumer imize both the privacy and the information utility of the released data. 4.1.2. Goods
The optimization problem in our research work can be thought of as maximizing the amount of information utility and privacy as our (economic) goods, whose consumption we wish to optimize.

In simple terms, the optimization problem can be seen as a process during which we need to determine, for each iden-form the total level of information utility and n goods that will form the total level of privacy. 4.1.3.

ANOPI isation process ANOPI, or the ANonymisation with Optimum Privacy and Information utility. The purpose of ANOPI is to anonymise microdata by guiding the anonymising process such that an optimum balance between privacy and information utility is obtained. The process is shown in Fig. 1 and its two functions are described below.
Given a non-anonymised microdata set, the ANOPI process first determines the optimum levels of privacy and informa-takes place in the Anonymising Function, which provides an anonymised microdata set as its output. 4.2.1. The OPI function vacy and information utility are determined.

The input to this function is a non-anonymised microdata set with n identifying variables V fying variable V i has a set of m codings { C 1 , ... , C two goods: x i and y i . For an identifying variable V i , good x { x , ... , x n , y 1 , ... , y n }. The OPI function is performed in seven steps as follows. Step 1: Determine the consumer X  X  preferences between different goods step, we also determine the preference between each identifying variable. These preferences are used to determine the amount of (economic) utility that can be derived.

Step 2: Determine the consumer X  X  income
To determine the consumer X  X  income, I , we need to determine the amount of information with which we are presented in is released with coding C 1 . (We do not use the joint entropy H (( V the income, as explained in Step 6).

More formally, given a non-anonymised microdata set with n identifying variables V where the superscript of the variable indicates that the variable is released with coding C Step 3: Determine the possible information utility levels
For each identifying variable V i ( i =1, ... , n ), with a set of m codings { C levels Iu  X  V i  X  1 ; ... ; Iu  X  V m i that the consumer can consume of good x i . Step 4: Determine the possible privacy levels
For each identifying variable V i ( i =1, ... , n ), with a set of m codings { C can be consumed by the consumer is represented by the set of possible privacy levels { Priv (( V be derived for every possible coding of V i .
 Step 5: Determine the price of each good
For each good x i (i.e. those goods that represent the information utility level of a variable V
Similarly, for each good y i (i.e. those goods that represent the privacy level for a variable V user obtains one unit of information utility for any coding of the variable V amount of information utility that the user will obtain if V mation entropy H (( V i ) j ) that will exist in the V i when it is released with coding C follows (where q i is the amount of user preference points allocated to V

To calculate the price, we use (1) the amount of privacy that will be obtained if V amount of information entropy H (( V i ) 1 ) H (( V i ) j
The price t i for a good y i is calculated as follows (where r scribed in Section 3.4): Step 6: Determine the consumer X  X  budget We determine the consumer X  X  budget by using the income I obtained in Step 2, as well as the prices derived in Step 5.
Using these, the consumer X  X  budget becomes: Hence, it implies that the whole income must be spent and therefore the above formula is not an inequality.
Given the above formula for the consumer X  X  budget, we can now explain why the income I should be equal to the sum of variables.

Since each x i and y i are the information utility and privacy levels of V follows (by using Eqs. (6) and (7) ): By simplifying, we obtain: Therefore, the income I is equal to the sum of the entropies of the individual identifying variables.
We also know that H (( V 1 ) 1 , ... ,( V n ) 1 ) 6 H (( V the joint probability of the values of variables V 1 , ... , V vidual variable V 1 , ... , V n . More formally, equality will hold if and only if Pr ( V to the probability of the values of variable V i .

H (( V 1 ) 1 )+ + H (( V n ) 1 )= H (( V 1 ) 1 , ... ,( V ables are not independent. Therefore, H (( V 1 ) 1 )+ + H (( V
Therefore, if we set the income to equal to the joint entropy of the non-anonymised identifying variables, a solution where the non-anonymised identifying variables are released would be unattainable. Hence, the assumption we made ear-fying variables.
 Step 7: Optimize the maximum value for U ( x 1 , ... , x n , y 1 , ... , y that only non-negative amounts of goods are consumed. We can rewrite this as: For this purpose, we use the Lagrange Multipliers Method. The Lagrangian ( L ) becomes:
At the optimum point, the first order conditions that need to be satisfied become:
These are used to obtain the optimum values for x 1 , ... , x (2 n + 1) unknowns x 1 , ... , x n , y 1 , ... , y n , k . 4.2.2. The anonymising function

That is, we choose a coding C j such that j x are the preference values for information utility and privacy, respectively, and where q and the intruder preference points allocated to the variable V vacy that have been found in the OPI function.

The need to suppress relatively rare records from the anonymised microdata set is currently out of the scope of this paper. However, for future work, we intend to expand our proposed solution by assuming that both global recoding fects of both global recoding and data suppression when the optimum values for privacy and information utility are derived. 5. Examples
In this Section, we provide two examples of using the ANOPI microdata anonymisation process. We first start with the simplest case, in which we need to find the optimum balance between privacy and information utility when given tifying variables. In both examples, we show how the optimum solution changes with different values for the input parameters, and in the second example we also represent the optimum values for information utility and privacy graphically. 5.1. Example 1-A microdata set with one identifying variable the Appendix A , with one identifying variable year of birth , which we shall denote as V x represents the level of information utility in V 1 . Good y Let us set the possible codings for V 1 as follows:
C 1 : non-recoded data; V 1 can assume any valid year from 1961 to 1990.

C 2 : V 1 can assume the values  X  X 1961 X 1962 X ,  X  X 1963 X 1964 X , ... ,  X  X 1989 X 1990 X .

C 3 : V 1 can assume the values  X  X 1961 X 1963 X ,  X  X 1964 X 1966 X , ... ,  X  X 1988 X 1990 X 
C 4 : V 1 can assume the values  X  X 1961 X 1965 X ,  X  X 1966 X 1970 X , ... ,  X  X 1986 X 1990 X .

C 5 : V 1 can assume the values  X  X 1961 X 1970 X ,  X  X 1971 X 1980 X ,  X  X 1981 X 1990 X .

C 6 : V 1 can assume the values  X  X 1961 X 1975 X ,  X  X 1976 X 1990 X .

C 7 : V 1 can assume the values  X  X 1961 X 1990 X . 5.1.1. OPI function Step 1: Determine the consumer X  X  preferences between different goods important. Therefore, we assign equal values to a and b as follows: a  X  1 erence points to the single identifying variable.

Therefore, the (economic) utility function is: U  X  x 1 ; y Step 2: Determine the consumer X  X  income In this example, we have only one identifying variable, and hence the income is: Step 3: Determine the possible information utility levels
The information utility levels are as follows for the possible codings of V Iu (( V 1 ) 1 ) = 135.03.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 2 ) = 112.27.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 3 ) = 94.21.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 4 ) = 75.08.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 5 ) = 47.60.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 6 ) = 30.01.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 7 )=0.
 Step 4: Determine the possible privacy levels The privacy levels for the possible codings of V 1 are as follows.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 1 )=0.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 2 ) = 22.76.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 3 ) = 40.81.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 4 ) = 59.95.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 5 ) = 87.43.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 6 ) = 105.02.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 7 ) = 135.03.
 Step 5: Determine the price of each good
The price for x 1 is s 1  X  1 100  X  0 : 01 and the price for y Step 6: Determine the consumer X  X  budget
The consumer X  X  budget is defined by the equation: 0.01 x 1 Step 7: Optimize tion problem can be stated as:

This coding is C variable V 1 is released, as shown in Table 4 in the Appendix A .
 how the optimum values for x 1 and y 1 change, together with the codings with which the microdata should be released. 5.2. Example 2-A microdata set with two identifying variables
We now present a more advanced example, in which we need to anonymise a microdata set with two identifying vari-marital status , which we shall denote as V 1 and V 2 , respectively. We create four goods: x resent the information utility levels for the identifying variables V of privacy for the identifying variables V 1 and V 2 , respectively.
 Let us set the possible codings for V 1 to be the same as in Example 1.
 Let the set of possible codings for V 2 to be as follows:
D 1 : non-recoded data; V 2 can assume the values  X  X ingle X ,  X  X  X arried X ,  X  X  X idowed X , or  X  X  X ivorced X .

Furthermore, let us assume that the data user prefers V to allocate 60 intruder preference points to V 1 and 40 intruder preference points to V an intruder would place on these two variables. Therefore, the (economic) utility function is: Step 2: Determine the consumer X  X  income In this example, we have two identifying variables, and hence the income is: Step 3: Determine the possible information utility levels
The information utility levels are as follows for the possible codings of V Iu (( V 1 ) 1 ) = 81.02.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 2 ) = 67.36.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 3 ) = 56.53.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 4 ) = 45.05.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 5 ) = 28.56.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 6 ) = 18.
 Iu (( V 1 ) 7 )=0.

The information utility levels for the possible codings of V Iu (( V 2 ) 1 ) = 20.85.
 Iu (( V 2 ) 2 ) = 8.69.
 Iu (( V 2 ) 3 )=0.
 Step 4: Determine the possible privacy levels The privacy levels for the possible codings of V 1 are as follows.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 1 )=0.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 2 ) = 13.65.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 3 ) = 24.49.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 4 ) = 35.97.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 5 ) = 52.46.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 6 ) = 63.01.
 Priv (( V 1 ) 7 ) = 81.02.
 The privacy levels for the possible codings of V 2 are as follows.
 Priv (( V 2 ) 1 )=0.
 Priv (( V 2 ) 2 ) = 12.16.
 Priv (( V 2 ) 3 ) = 20.85.

Step 5: Determine the price of each good Step 6: Determine the consumer X  X  budget
The consumer X  X  budget is defined by the equation: Step 7: Optimize
The optimization problem can be stated as:
When this is solved, we obtain the optimum values as follows: x 5.2.2. Anonymising function A.

In each graph in Figs. 3 X 7 , we show the possible values for x variable must equal to 100 (see Section 3.3), the number of user preference points allocated to variable V points only to variable V 1 , since the intruder preference points allocated to variable V the levels of information utility ( Iu ) in the case of values for x y and y 2 . 6. Analysis of graphical results and simplification of the OPI function the values for x 1 and x 2 are greater in comparison to the values for y increases (i.e. as the value for b increases). Moreover, the values for x allocated to the respective variables. In a similar way, the values for y are allocated to the respective variables.

Upon closer inspection of the results that were used to create the graphs, we noticed that the values allocated to x of the values allocated to a and q i . Similarly, the values assigned to y ymised identifying variables, but this portion is based on a ratio of the values assigned to b and r in a more generalized form as follows.

Given a microdata set with n identifying variables V 1 , ... , V can be calculated as: and the optimum level of privacy y i for a variable V i can be calculated as: where, a is the preference value for information utility, as explained in Step 1 in Section 4.2.1, b is the preference value for privacy, as explained in Step 1 in Section 4.2.1 q i is the number of user preference points allocated to variable V r i is the number of intruder preference points allocated to variable V n is the number of identifying variables in the non-anonymised microdata,

For example, the data owner may set a minimum privacy level for a particular identifying variable V solution must satisfy, namely that the minimum privacy level of the released variable V

In a similar way, the data user may require a minimum information utility level for an identifying variable V that it should be released with a coding no greater than C satisfies an additional constraint, namely that the minimum information utility level of the released variable V least as large as Iu (( V i ) j ). That is, the additional constraint that the optimum solution must satisfy is: x
Therefore, to find the optimum solution in Step 7, we will need to find the maximum value for U ( x of particular identifying variables. 8. Related work (e.g. [29 X 31] ).

However, the papers referred to in the above paragraph only consider the need of maximizing information utility such privacy.

Other approaches for balancing privacy and information utility have also been proposed recently. In [9], Mohammed et al. propose a privacy model called LKC-privacy.

The aim of the research work presented in this paper was to find a way in which we can guide the process of microdata anonymisation, such that the anonymised microdata will possess an optimum balance between privacy and information mization problem was solved by using concepts and optimization approaches from economic price theory.
We presented an anonymisation process that finds an optimal balance between privacy and information utility and then anonymises the microdata such that this balance is achieved. Based on experimental evaluation, we were able to simplify the process through which our optimization problem is solved and also reduce the complexity of the actual optimization itself.
