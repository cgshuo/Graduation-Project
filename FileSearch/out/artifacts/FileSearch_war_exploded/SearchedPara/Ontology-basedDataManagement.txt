 Ontology-based data management aims at accessing and us-ing data by means of an ontology, i.e., a conceptual represen-tation of the domain of interest in the underlying informa-tion system. This new paradigm provides several interesting features, many of which have been already proved e ff ective in managing complex information systems. On the other hand, several important issues remain open, and constitute stimulating challenges for the research community. In this talk we first provide an introduction to ontology-based data management, illustrating the main ideas and techniques for using an ontology to access the data layer of an information system, and then we discuss several important issues that are still the subject of extensive investigations, including the need of inconsistency tolerant query answering methods, and the need of supporting update operations expressed over the ontology.

While the amount of data stored in current information systems and the processes making use of such data contin-uously grow, turning these data into information, and gov-erning both data and processes are still tremendously chal-lenging tasks for Information Technology. The problem is complicated by the proliferation of data sources and ser-vices both within a single organization, and in cooperating environments.

The following factors contribute explaining why such a proliferation constitutes a major problem with respect to the goal of carrying out e ff ective data governance tasks: 1. Although the initial design of a collection of data sources 2. It is common practice to change a data source (e.g., a 3. The data stored in di ff erent sources and the processes
The result is that information systems of medium and large organizations are typically structured according to a  X  X ylos X -based architecture, constituted by several, indepen-dent, and distributed data sources, each one serving a spe-cific application. This poses great di ffi culties with respect to the goal of accessing data in a unified and coherent way. Analogously, processes relevant to the organizations are of-ten hidden in software applications, and a formal, up-to-date description of what they do on the data and how they are related with other processes is often missing.

The introduction of service-oriented architectures is not a solution to this problem per se, because the fact that data and processes are packed into services is not su ffi cient for making the meaning of data and processes explicit. Indeed, services become other artifacts to document and maintain, adding complexity to the governance problem. Analogously, data warehousing techniques and the separation they ad-vocate between the management of data for the operation level, and data for the decision level, do not provide so-lutions to this challenge. On the contrary, they also add complexity to the system, by replicating data in di ff erent layers of the system, and introducing synchronization pro-cesses across layers.
All the above observations show that a unified access to data and an e ff ective governance of processes and services are extremely di ffi cult goals to achieve in modern informa-tion systems. Yet, both are crucial objectives for getting useful information out of the information system, as well as for taking decisions based on them. This explains why or-ganizations spend a great deal of time and money for the understanding, the governance, the curation, and the inte-gration of data stored in di ff erent sources, and of the pro-cesses/services that operate on them, and why this problem is often cited as a key and costly Information Technology challenge faced by medium and large organizations today [1].
We argue that ontology-based data management (OBDM) is a promising direction for addressing the above challenges. The key idea of OBDM is to resort to a three-level archi-tecture, constituted by the ontology, the sources, and the mapping between the two, where the ontology is a formal description of the domain of interest, and is the heart of the whole system. In this sense, OBDM can be seen as aformofinformationintegration,wheretheusualglobal schema is replaced by the conceptual model of the applica-tion domain, formulated as an ontology expressed in a logic-based language. With this approach, the integrated view that the system provides to information consumers is not merely a data structure accommodating the various data at the sources, but a semantically rich description of the relevant concepts in the domain of interest, as well as the relationships between such concepts.

The distinction between the ontology and the data sources reflects the separation between the conceptual level, the one presented to the client, and the logical/physical level of the information system, the one stored in the sources, with the mapping acting as the reconciling structure between the two levels [3]. This sepration brings several potential advantages:
OBDM is a new paradigm, which provides several inter-esting features. Many of them have been already proved e ff ective in managing complex information systems. On the other hand, several important issues remain open, and con-stitute stimulating challenges for the research community. We mention some of them here. [1] Philip A. Bernstein and Laura Haas.
