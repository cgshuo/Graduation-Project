 Browse with either web directories or social bookmarks is an important complementation to search by keywords in web information retrieval. To improve users X  browse experiences and facilitate the web directory construction, in this paper, we propose a novel browse system called Social Web Di-rectory (SWD for short) by integrating web directories and social bookmarks. In SWD, (1) web pages are automati-cally categorized to a hierarchical structure to be retrieved efficiently, and (2) the popular web pages, hottest tags, and expert users in each category are ranked to help users find information more conveniently. Extensive experimental re-sults demonstrate the effectiveness of our SWD system.

Besides search by keywords, browse systems provide an alternative way for web information retrieval [6], especially when there is a lack of appropriate keywords or comprehen-sion and learning processes are required during the retrieval tasks. Thus far, we have seen two generations of browse sys-tems, i.e., (1) web directories, such as Yahoo Web Directory and Open Directory Project (www.dmoz.org), in which web pages are collected and categorized manually by skillful edi-tors, and (2) social bookmarking and tagging services, such as Del.icio.us and citeulike.com, which enable users to an-notate web pages by themselves. Nonetheless, these browse systems still have a few minor flaws in two aspects, namely (1) lack of an automatic categorization on web pages. To be specific, the maintenance of a web directory requires ex-tensive human efforts, while the social bookmarks and tags provided by various individuals often suffer from noisy and ambiguous annotations as well as various personal catego-rizations [4]; and (2) lack of page ranking, although web pages ranked by their popularity often help users find infor-mation more efficiently and conveniently.

Aiming at improving users X  browse experiences and facili-tating the web directory construction, we propose a novel browse system known as SWD ( S ocial W eb D irectory), which adopts the social information (e.g., web page tags) from Del.icio.us to automatically categorize web pages with the help of the well-edited hierarchical catalog structure in Open Directory Project, and ranks the web pages in each category by estimating their popularity. Furthermore, SWD can also identify expert users and the hottest tags in each category which enrich the category X  X  description, and thus can support community based-exploratory browse [5].
Extensive experiments have been conducted on 18,304 web pages from Open Directory Project together with 604,032 annotations from Del.icio.us, and the results show that com-pared with a straightforward method, i.e., using the pure content of each web page for categorization, our SWD sys-tem improves 27.9% of accurary on web page categorization and 72% of efficiency. Moreover, our case study confirms that the expert users and hottest tags in each category iden-tified by SWD are of high quality and can help users explore the category information more effectively.
The system contains three parts, i.e., a training data de-pository, and two models constructed with this depository.
The training data depository is automatically obtained by merging the well-edited web page catalog of Open Directory Project (ODP for short) and web page tags from Del.icio.us. Specifically, the web pages of which the URLs are within both ODP and Del.icio.us are collected into our training data depository. Then, any web page in the depository has information including users who collected it, tags used to annotate it, and the category it belongs to.

With the training data depository, there are two models constructed in SWD, i.e., (1) the web page categorization model, which classifies any newly collected web page into an existing category according to its tags, and (2) the social ranking model, which provides a ranking list of the popular web pages, hottest tags, and expert users in each category. Fig. 1 shows two snapshots of our SWD system, in which Part A lists the top categories, Part C the sub-categories, Parts B &amp; D the corresponding web pages, Part E the hottest tags in current category, and Part F the expert users.
Compared with previous methods which based on web page contents and URLs [2,10] , we propose a more efficient approach to web page categorization by only investigating the web page tags annotated by users. This is motivated by our preliminary study on the tags, which reveal that these tags can usually describe the web page accurately, and mean-while, web pages under the same category often have similar tags and vice versa. For example, Fig. 2 illustrates the aver-age tag-based similarity between the web pages in different categories, which is defined as where | c x | and | c y | denote the number of web pages in cat-egories c x and c y , p i and p j are web pages in each category, represents the tag T k  X  X  weight in a web page p i , and can be calculated by the tf-idf metric, i.e., i n which f req ( T k , p i ) is the number of times the tag T used to annotate web page p i by different users, N the to-tal number of web pages, n k the number of the web pages containing tag T k , and t the total number of web page tags collected in SWD. From Fig. 2, we can learn that tags are discriminative features for categorization since the average tag-based similarity between web pages of the same category is much higher than those from different categories.
Based on the above discussion, we can utilize web page tags to represent each web page p i as a vector below. Then, classification methods such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and K NN can be adopted to help SWD categorize web pages by using these vectors.
In traditional web directories, web pages of each category are listed randomly or chronologically, resulting in that web pages of high quality are often hidden in the mass collections and thus are inconvenient for retrieval. In social bookmark fields, although a few ranking algorithms are proposed to provide the most popular web pages in each category based on the web page tags [1,9], they often surfer from a relatively

To avoid the above limitations of existing browse systems, we provide a social ranking model for our SWD system, which can rank the popular web pages as well as expert users and the hottest tags of each category efficiently.
Since each web page p i has a set of associated users and a set of tags, it can also be represented as (1) a binary vector p i of which each element p user ir (1 6 r 6 u , u is the total number of users who have collected web pages for SWD) indicates whether web page p i is collected by the r th user, and (2) a binary vector p tag i of which each element p tag k 6 t ) denotes whether web page p i has the tag T k . With these two binary vectors, we measure web pages X  popularity based on the following two features.

User Count. If a web page is collected by many users, it is often of a high quality and should be recommended to the other users. Hence, we identify these kinds of web pages by the user count U C ( p i ) of each web page p i , where
Topical Similarity. The topical similarity T S ( p i | c x tween a page p i and a given category c x also indicates whether this web page should have a high rank in the category. where c tag x is the category vector of c x represented by tags, of which each element c tag xk = P i I ( p i  X  c x )  X  p tag 1 6 k 6 t and I (  X  ) is the indicator function.
Then the popularity P op ( p i | c x ) of a page p i in a category c can be calculated as
P op ( p i | c x ) = T S ( p i
Listing up expert users can help a new user find useful web pages via their collected web pages, and meanwhile stimulate users to collect new web pages of high qualities into our system. To this end, we present the following three metrics to help identify the expert users of each category.
Collection Quality. This metric checks whether the web pages collected by a user u r are useful in a category c x where p i  X  u r denotes that user u r collects web page p Table 1: Categorization performance comparison
Interests of Users. T he metric examines whether a user u is a specialist to a category c x by estimating the relevance between his collection and the category.
 where u tag r is a binary vector of which each element u tag (1 6 k 6 t ) indicates whether user u r has used tag T k .
Contributions of Users. This metric is provided to en-courage users to collect new web pages of high qualities for our system. The contribution Con ( u r | c x ) of a user u category c x is defined as w here d denotes that u r is the d th user who collected p
The hottest tags in each category help describe the cate-gory and can also navigate users to their target web pages.
The hotness Hot ( T k | c x ) of the tag T k (1 6 k 6 t ) for a category c x can be estimated by investigating the tag X  X  frequency of occurrences in this category and in all the cat-egories, formally, Hot ( T k | c x ) = where T l  X  c x means that a tag T l appears in a category c
Experimental Setup. We collect 18,304 web pages over 60 categories and sub-categories from ODP together their 7,691 tags which are used as annotations for 604,032 times. We represent each web page as a vector by Eq. (1) (see Section 3), and respectively utilize Naive Bayes Classifier (NB for short) and SVM as the classification methods. To evaluate the average categorization performance of our SWD system across all categories, we adopt the micro-and macro-average F-scores (Mi-F and Ma-F for short) as the performance metrics, and perform 5-fold cross-validation to reduce the uncertainty of training data and test data.
Performance Study. Besides our SWD system, we also report the web page categorization performance of the fol-lowing three methods, i.e., (1) the pure content based method, which straightforwardly uses the text content of each web page for the categorization, (2) a state-of-the-art descrip-tion based method [8], and (3) a combined method, which combines the categorization results of our proposed method and the pure content based method as follows.
 T arget ( p i ) = arg max F igure 3: (a) Mi-F of combined method vs.  X  . (b) SWD categorization performance vs. user number of a web page p i belonging to a category c x by using the pure content based method and our proposed method.
Table 1 shows that our propose method achieves a 27.9% improvement over the pure content based method and 19.1% over the description based method. In addition, the com-bined method gets a slight improvement over our method since it can benefits from both the two methods combined.
To investigate which method provides more profit in this combination, we vary the parameter  X  from 0 to 1. When  X  = 0, the combined method is equivalent to ours, and when  X  = 1, it is equivalent to the description based method. Fig. 3(a) shows that the combined method often performs better when the weight of our method is higher, indicating that our method contributes more in the combination.
Moreover, previous studies have shown that most of clas-sification algorithms including NB and SVM are often sensi-tive to the document length when using the content of each web page for categorization [7]. However, since the number of each web page X  X  tags is much less than that of the words within each web page X  X  content, our proposed approach to web page categorization is more efficient on both time and space. Taking the NB algorithm as an example, experimen-tal results demonstrate that it saves 90% in terms of space and 72% in terms of running time.

Effect of Annotation Amount. The above perfor-mance study verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our SWD system on web page categorization. In what follows, we address another concern, i.e., whether the categorization are stable and at least how many annotations should be col-lected by SWD to guarantee its categorization performance.
To this end, we examine how the Ma-F and Mi-F of our categorization results are affected by the increasing number of tags when more and more users are involved, and depict the result in Fig. 3(b), in which the x -axis indicates that the first r users X  annotations are used for web page categoriza-tion. The figure shows that (1) the categorization accuracy improves much on the arrival of each new user when the number of users involved is small, and (2) improves not very much and tends to be stable as the number of users increases. S imilar as the conclusion in [3], this observation can be ex-plained by the fact that the distribution of tags of a specific web page tends to be stable during the running of the social bookmarking systems, e.g., Del.icio.us.
In this experiment, we conduct some case studies to con-firm the effectiveness of our social ranking model. Towards this, we collect a sample of Del.icio.us data consisting of 2,879,614 tags made by 10,109 different users on 690,482 different web pages which are automatically categorized to the hierarchical catalog of ODP by our SWD system.
In SWD, when users are browsing information of a par-ticular category, we will show them the URLs of the most popular web pages, the hottest tags, and the expert users, all of which help enrich the description of this category and can navigate users to find the target information more ef-ficiently and conveniently. For example, Table 2 has listed the top 5 hottest tags of 4 sub-categories in the  X  X omputer X  category, while Table 3 has listed the URLs of the most pop-ular web pages in of another 3 sub-categories, and the top URLs collected by 3 expert users of the  X  X ava X  sub-category. From Tables 2 and 3, we can observe that (1) the hottest tags seem reasonable, these tags (e.g.,  X  X abletpc X  for  X  X ys-tem X  and  X  X ss X  for  X  X nternet X  ) summarize the hottest topics in each domain; (2) the URLs really correspond to authority web pages in each domain; and (3) the expert users always bookmark web pages of high qualities in each domain, which are very helpful for those rookie users who are interested in this domain. The case study has been also conducted on the other categories and sub-categories, the conclusion is similar to the above observation. We proposed a framework of novel browsing system called Social Web Directory (SWD), which can automatically cat-egorize web pages collected and tagged by every user and enable them to browse these web pages in an efficient way. By taking advantages of the well-edited hierarchial catalog structure in ODP and the social bookmarks in Del.icio.us, our SWD system can make up the flaws of previous brows-ing systems, and has the following three characteristics. (1) The system constructs a web directory automatically with the help of social bookmarks. In other words, the main-tenance of a web directory does not require skilled editors to pay extensive efforts any more because our SWD system enables every user to contribute to the web directory and locate the desired resources easily. (2) The system provides a ranking list of popular web page in each category. With this ranking list, users can easily find the most useful web pages in a certain category with much less clicks and content reviews. (3) The system also supports community-based ex-ploratory browsing since it offers the hottest tags and expert users in each category, which enrich the category description and make the browse of community information easier.
