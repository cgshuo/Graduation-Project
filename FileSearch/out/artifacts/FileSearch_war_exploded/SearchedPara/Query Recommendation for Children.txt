 One of the biggest problems that children experience while searching the web occurs during the query formulation pro-cess. Children have been found to struggle formulating queries based on keywords given their limited vocabulary and their difficulty to choose the right keywords.

In this work we propose a method that utilizes tags from social media to suggest queries related to children topics. Concretely we propose a simple yet effective approach to bias a random walk defined on a bipartite graph of web resources and tags through keywords that are more commonly used to describe resources for children.

We evaluate our method using a large query log sam-ple of queries aimed at retrieving information for children. We show that our method outperforms query suggestions of state-of-the-art search engines and state-of-the art query suggestions based on random walks.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Query for-mulation Experimentation, Measurement query formulation, children, social media
Children experience several difficulties searching the web using state-of-the-art search engines. In particular, children have been found to struggle formulating queries with key-words [2, 6].

In this work we propose a query suggestion method to help children find keywords that are more likely to be relevant for them. Although several research has been carried out on query suggestion[15, 17], our work deviates from previous studies in that (1) the suggestions are aimed at potential children search intents; (2) the suggestions are constructed in the absence of query logs and (3) the suggestions are ranked based on a novel biased random walk to promote suggestions aimed at children topics.

The query suggestions of our method are based on the tags from the bookmarking system Delicious that are associated to the query web results and to previously seen web resources intended for children. These type of tags are a valuable resource in the domain of IR for children since we can exploit the collaborative information provided by users sharing web resources for children.

Concretely, we propose a novel way to boost tags in a random walk that are more frequently used to describe re-sources for children and that are more prominent with re-spect to a background model of web resources aimed at the general public. The model is built using a subset of the large delicious crawl described in [16]. The subset consists of bookmarks of high quality of web resources focused on content for children. The assumption of our method is that tags more frequently associated to urls focused on children topics are better candidates to construct query suggestions for children. For instance consider the query cars . Accord-ing to Google X  X  query suggestions common aspects associ-ated to this query are car rentals, cars for sale, used cars, new cars, disney cars and car pictures . On the other hand, aspects oriented to satisfy children information needs should rather include aspects as car games, car toys, car movies, car images, car colouring pages . Our system ranks higher the latter tags providing suggestions more focused on con-tent for children.

The quality of the results is evaluated using a large log sample of queries and query reformulations that are aimed at retrieving information for children. The data set was extracted from the AOL query log and we utilize queries landing on domains listed in the Kids and Teens directory of Dmoz.

The organization of this paper is as follow: Section 2 de-scribes the most relevant related work to this paper, where we emphasize query expansion methods and tag ranking. Section 3 describes our method employed. Section 4 de-scribes the data acquisition process. Section 5 presents the results obtained by our random walk method. In the last section conclusions of this work and some directions for fu-ture work are discussed.
This work is related to the areas of query suggestion, query expansion and tag ranking. In the following paragraphs we review the most relevant research related to our work.
Extensive research has been carried out on query recom-mendation based on query click-through data from query logs [8, 1]. In these methods the association between query and documents in the search graph is mined to infer related queries. More recently, random walk frameworks have been proposed to rank documents and queries using hitting time [12] and based on the query -document frequency in the graph[4, 5].

The method we proposed utilized Craswell et al. X  X  [5] frame-work. However, our work deviates from theirs in the defi-nition of the transition probabilities and the normalization of these probabilities. Our motivation is to bias the walk towards suggestions more appropriate for a specific niche of users (i.e., children) which is not addressed by their work.
Recently, two random walk frameworks have been pro-posed to leverage query logs and social media annotation within the same graph. The first exploits the latent topic space of the graph [3] and the second utilizes the graph hit-ting time [12]. Their focus is to refine queries by exploit-ing the tag vocabulary of the social media and to provide exploratory and search query suggestions within the same framework. Our work also exploits the annotations of social media to the generation of query suggestions however our work differs from theirs in that our method provides query suggestions in the absence of query logs, that is solely based on social media.
Gyllstrom et al. [9] presented a variation of Page Rank to rank web pages that are more suitable for children. They utilized label propagation to score the documents. Our work deviates from theirs in the characteristics of the graph uti-lized (we employ social media while they employ web doc-uments) and in that we boost query suggestions associated with content for children through information metrics be-tween a foreground model of tags used to describe content for children and a background model. Moreover we improve over the results of our random walk using a learning to rank framework by introducing features that are not trivial to add in a graph based model.
Tag ranking has recently received attention given the pro-liferation of social media sharing sites. Liu et al. [10] pro-posed a method to estimate the relevance score of a tag to an image based on probability density estimation. The es-timation is further refined using a random walk over a tag similarity graph. Our work deviates from theirs in the struc-ture of the graph and the bias introduced into the random walk. In [10] the graph consists only of tags and in our problem the graph consists of tags and web resources. This graph structure is important in our problem since we exploit the characteristics of web resources aimed at children to bias the random walk.
In this section we describe the scenario in which query expansion is studied and the method proposed to mine query suggestions using tags from social media.
We envisage a search service for children which reuses state-of-the art search engines to deliver content aimed at children. In this system, the query submitted by the user is sent to several search engines to retrieve keywords from the snippets and titles of the web results. These keywords represent the possible topics associated to the user X  X  query. Our task is to generate these keywords and rank them to construct query suggestions. Note that in this scenario we do not have access to search engine query logs which are widely used for query recommendation [4, 11]. Moreover given the increasing concern of users for their privacy and the characteristics of the audience targeted by our system (i.e. children), it is desirable to avoid the tracking of user information.
Our random walk model uses a bipartite graph of web re-sources (i.e., urls ) and tag nodes. Previous research on tag ranking [10] employed random walks methods for tag recom-mendation systems using a graph composed solely of tags. In the setting of our problem we found it useful to treat urls as nodes as well since our methods rely on a trusted set of web resources, which are used as seeds to bias the random walk towards more relevant tags for the targeted audience. That is, tags more frequently associated to urls that are known to be targeted at a certain niche of users (i.e. chil-dren) will be promoted over tags employed more frequently to described urls for a different niche of users (i.e. adults). Note that is not straight forward to represent this informa-tion in the case where the graph is only composed of tag nodes, moreover this graph representation allows to add a measure of how reliable or trustful a seed url is (e.g., based on its source or popularity).
 In this work the graph was created using a set of the Del.icio.us bookmarks from the Wetzker et al. [16] collec-tion. Concretely, bookmarks of urls known to be adequate for children were extracted to create the set of urls and tags. Details about the characteristics of the dataset are provided in Section 4.1. Our random walk method is based on the framework proposed by Craswell and Szummer [5]. Formally the graph is defined as: Definition 1. (Bipartite graph) a bipartite graph of urls and tags : G = ( U,T,E = { ( u,t ) | ( u,t )  X  U  X  T } ) where U = { u 1 ,u 2 ,..,u n } is the set of urls described by tags T = { t 1 ,t 2 ,..,t m } and E is the set of edges in the graph.
In [5] the transition probabilities are defined as:
The term c ( i,j ) represents the number of times a tag i was used to describe a web resource j and the term  X  is the self transition probability which is used to slow the diffusion of the scores. We employed this weighting scheme as baseline for our method.
We propose to bias the random walk by introducing a weight based on the point-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) di-vergence metric. Intuitively, this metric allows in a straight forward manner to promote those tags that have a greater expectation to appear in a collection of content for children (our foreground model) than in a corpus of content for grown ups (background model). Equation 2 and 3 reflect the new transition functions. p bwKL ( i | j ) = where p ( i ) is the probability of a tag (or url) to appear in the collection of resources for children and g ( j ) is the proba-bility of i to appear in the collection of resources for the gen-eral public. We normalize the point-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances to lie between 0 and 1 in order to intro-duce them into the random walk framework. The normaliza-tion was carried out using the maximum and minimum KL point-wise distance in the collection in the following manner: kl n ( p || q ) = kl ( p || q )  X  minKL/ ( maxKL  X  minKL ).
We also found that using a uniform normalization for the transition of urls to tags improves the performance of the random walk. Intuitively, this occurs because the standard transitions of urls to tags tend to promote the most popular tags, however our focus is to promote those tags that are more children oriented, which are not necessarily the most popular for a given url. Thus, a uniform normalization em-phasizes the effect of the KL weight introduced in Equation 2 and 3. Using this observation we renormalized the forward probability as follows: p fwN ( i | j ) =
From Equation 2 we need to estimate the probabilities of the tags and urls in the two corpora. These probabilities are estimated based on a set of Delicious bookmarks that represent the interests of the target group.

We define a bookmark as a tuple containing a url and a tag, which describes the url: b =  X  u i ,t i  X  where u i  X  U,t T , the set of urls and tags respectively. A collection of book-marks is defined as a bag of N bookmarks B = { 1 ,b 2 ,..,b
We employ a set of bookmarks that contains trusted and oriented urls for a specific target audience (i.e. children). Definition 2. (Bookmarks for kids ) The bag of bookmarks of trusted and oriented urls for a target audience is defined as: B k = { b 1 ,b 2 ,..,b N | proj url ( b i )  X  U k } where U seeds urls.
 The estimation of the transition probabilities depicted in Equation 2 is estimated using maximum-likelihood estima-tion (MLE) using B k for the foreground model and B for the background model where | T | and | U | is the raw size of tags and urls in the collection B k
The query is represented as a single node in the graph and we define a special transition probability from the query node to the tag nodes of the graph. We do not include tran-sition probabilities from the query to url nodes because the user X  X  query is represented as a bag of tags. The query rep-resentation is constructed from the query itself and the tags found in the titles and snippets of the top ranked web re-sults. The query can also be seen as a document constructed with the tags found in the web results and the query. For-mally we define the user X  X  query and the tag set of a query as : Definition 3. (Query) A query q of length l is represented as the sequence of words ( w 1 ,w 2 ,..,w l ).
 Definition 4. (Tag set of a query) The tag set of a query q consists of the m tags extracted from a social bookmarking system S, which are associated to the top web results of query q: Q = { t 1 ,t 2 ,..,t m } .

This representation is convenient because query sugges-tions can often be obtained directly from the keywords ap-pearing in the snippets of the web results. Using a sam-ple of 10K queries from the AOL query log we found that the intersection between the keywords generated from the snippet/title and the vocabulary of the query reformulations (and which are also present as tags in Delicious) was 65%.
Using this query representation we define the transition probability p ( t | Q ) as:
The first term on the right hand side is the likelihood of the candidate tag t in the collection and the second term describes the likelihood of t co-occurring between the tags in the query and the collection. These probabilities are es-timated using MLE in a similar fashion as in 5. where p ( q i ) is the prior probability of q i and  X  is the Diricht-let smoothing parameter.
As training data we created a set of Del.icio.us bookmarks from the Wetzker et al. [16] collection. To the best of our knowledge this is the largest collection of social tagged data available for research. The collection contains 132 million bookmarks and 420 million tag assignments, and it was re-trieved between December of 2007 to April of 2008. The set was created by extracting the bookmarks of the urls listed in the Kids and Teens section of the Open Directory Project ODP (only exact matches). These urls link to  X  X eb sites that have been selected for age-appropriate content by a team of volunteer editors X  1 . These resources have also been used in other information retrieval problems for young users [9, 7] with positive results. The data set was cleaned by normalizing multi-worded tags and removing ill-defined and infrequent tags (tags submitted by less than 3 three users).
Search sessions were created using the standard 30 min-utes window in order to extract query tuples. A query tu-ple consists of a query and a query reformulation occurring within the same search session. A query q 0 is a query re-formulation of q if the former is a prefix (e.g. brit, britney spears ) or a suffix of the latter (e.g. wars cheat codes, lego star wars cheat codes ), or the latter contains all the words of the former plus another word, independently of the order in which the words appears (e.g. york giants, super bowl york giants xxv ) and there are no query events between them. We only consider queries that land on the domains listed in the Dmoz kids and teens section [14] . For the evaluation we grouped query tuples according the target audience of the urls (i.e., kids , teens and adults ). In Dmoz, urls tagged as for kids and teenagers represent urls that are appropriate for children aged, respectively, 8 to 12 and 13 to 16 years old. The query tuples targeting content for grown ups ( adults) were created using a sample of the queries landing on the general Dmoz directory (non kids and teens ).

Using this methodology we were able to extracted around 480K queries and 20K sessions. From these sessions we ob-tained in the order of tens of thousands of query pairs for each one of three age groups.
The purpose of the evaluation is to quantify the coherence and appropriateness of the query suggestions provided by the methods described in section 3.

Assessing the quality of query suggestions can be a very hard task given that the intent of the user is rarely clear from solely the query. However, we consider that the query suggestions that are submitted by users of a given age range represent a good approximation of good query suggestions for this particular segment of users. A similar assumption has been adopted in previous query recommendation studies [13, 3].

The performance of the query recommendation task was measured in terms of recall, NDCG. All the metrics are cal-culated based on the set of query tuples extracted and de-scribed in the section 4.2. We employed a subset of the AOL log to tune the parameters involved in the random walk. We set the number of iterations of the random walk to 100 and we set the parameter  X  to 0.1 . The smoothing parameter m was set to 1200 .

To calculate the performance scores we define the set of query pairs from the gold standard as G = { X  q,q 0  X  X  where q www.dmoz.com Table 1: Query examples from the two query logs utilized is a query reformulation of q . And the set S n = { X  q,q where q 0 is a query suggestion of q and r is the ranked po-sition of q 0 . For instance, recall is calculated as r = The intersection between the set of query suggestions and reformulations is performed using exact matching.

Table 1 presents query examples of the query suggestions provided by our method, Bing and the gold standard defined by the queries extracted from the AOL logs.
We evaluate the random walk baseline (Equation 1) and our random walk method (Equation 2 ). Additionally, we compare the results obtained by the methods against a state-of-the-art search engine query suggestions. The graph con-structed utilizes the domains from the Dmoz directory la-belled as suitable for children up to 12 years old. The graph contains 91.6K edges and 20K nodes (12.9K urls and 7.1 tags). In the tables shown in this section the baseline will be referred to as rw and our method as rw-kl .

Tables 2 shows the recall values obtained for the query pairs extracted. We found that our method outperforms the baseline and the Bing query suggestions for the children queries and the teenager queries. However this is not the case for the set of adults queries, which was expected given that our random walk method gives priority to tags that are more popular for children.

We observed that the maximum gain obtained was for the children queries when considering the top 10 results: +7.5% with respect to the baseline and +9.6% with respect to Bing. For the teenagers queries the maximum gain is obtained at top 5 results: +2.3% with respect to the baseline and +2.9% with respect to Bing. Interestingly the gain observed for teenagers is not a high as the gain obtained for the children dataset. This may be due to the fact that the seed urls em-ployed to build the graph are associated to web resources for children and not teenagers. In future work we will explore the possibility of building customize graph models for other age groups (e.g. teenagers).

The performance trends observed for the recall results were also reflected in the NDCG scores, as is shown in Ta-ble 3, which shows that the quality of the ranking is also improved by a reasonable margin. It is important to men-tion that the low values of NDCG reported are due to the sparsity of the data. On average we collected 1.6 query sug-gestions per query. Nonetheless, numbers on the same order have been reported on query recommendation studies for long-tailed queries [13].

In this paper we presented how tags from social book-marking system can be exploited to produce query sugges-tions for a specialized group of users using a set of seed web resources and a biased random walk based on point-wise KL divergence between a foreground model and back-ground model. Our method can be used to improve current search assistance functionality for children since we show that our method performs the best for queries aimed at the the youngest group of users (i.e. children between 10 to 12 years old). We show that our method clearly outperforms state of the art search engine query suggestions for this type of queries. We also showed that social media is a highly valu-able resource for the generation of query suggestions and its use can replace the utilization of query logs which may not be available to several search systems. For future work we are interested in applying the method proposed in different domains and on different age segments. We are also inter-ested in enriching our query suggestion method by combin-ing it with other topical features. This can be achieved in a LTOR approach by using our method as one of the features.
