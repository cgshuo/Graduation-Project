 Production and Manufacturing by Taberg Media Group AB Box 94, 562 02 Taberg Sweden A total of 20 tutorial proposals were submitted to the ACL 2010 Tutorials track, from which 6 were finally accepted. We are very grateful to the ACL-NLP community for the large amount of exciting, time made the selection process very difficult. It was really hard to reject some of the proposals. All 20 proposals were reviewed by both co-chairs, and the final selection was approved by the conference General Chair. We also sought expertise from external reviewers where necessary.
 Based on the following criteria we selected the maximum number of proposals allowed: 1) Quality: the content and scope of the proposal, and the competence and experience of the presenters; 2) Diversity: We sought a range of different topics and approaches; 3) Appeal: Whether the tutorial topic would be likely to attract a reasonable number of participants; and 4) Novelty: Tutorial topics featured at very recent ACL events were dispreferred (unless the content was clearly novel and different). The final tutorial programme covers a wide range of NLP topics, including Annotation, Grammars, Discourse Structure, Structured Prediction, Semantic Parsing and Machine Translation. Sincere thanks to all authors for preparing and sending all the information and materials timely. We know that this is not always easy because of the tight schedule and other competing committments. We are very indebted to previous tutorial chairs, especially to Diana McCarthy and Chengqing Zong for sharing with us their experience and already developed materials. They provided also valuable advice all throughout the process. We are also equally grateful to the ACL 2010 General Chair, and the Local/Publicity/Publications Chairs for their help and advice in the organization of the Tutorials program and materials, and for sending always the appropriate reminders! Finally, we only hope that the participation will be as successful as all the previous steps. To all the attendees, enjoy the ACL 2010 tutorials!
