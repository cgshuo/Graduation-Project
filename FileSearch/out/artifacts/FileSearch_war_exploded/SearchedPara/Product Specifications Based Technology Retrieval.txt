 Patents provide ample resource of the knowledge in the specific area of research. They contain both legal and technological boundaries in their unique piece of document in a typical area of research. Patent search is a general term that covers different types of search processes such as for technology survey, prior art search, freedom to operate, validity and patent portfolio search etc. These search processes differ in terms of the information need of the searcher, the corpora and the output of the search. Notice, however, that the precise names and definitions of these search processes vary between those who deal with patents, like for example, information specialists, private patent searchers, patent examiners, and patent lawyers [8]. Many researches are ongoing in the area of patent information retrieval for different purposes of research. Patent prior art search is one of the known research problems in this domain. Patent search is an active sub-domain of the research field known as information retrieval [21]. The prior art search is the common task before filing a patent for grant. The inventor(s) as well as the patent examiner perform the prior art search for assuring the originality of the invention by using information retrieval techniques. These searches are performed using the keywords or phrases or some set of words extracted from the draft patent application, which are used typically as the query [14, 16, 22]. Keyword based query search is the simple query search which searches general documents in which it must handle the query expansion problems in the patent prior art search. However, this problem is more critical in patent search than in the search of general research documents. Larkey (1999) [7] proposed some ideas to expand the query terms to increase the recall of patent search. He suggested using phrase co-occurrence and dictionary to find the relevant words. Inoue et al. (2000) proposed [5] a similar concept that uses probabilistic method and Hierarchical Bayesian Clustering (HBC) to calculate the similarity and relevance of words between patents. In the problem or patent prior art search based on the IR systems, various single query representations of the patent applications has been introduced e.g. by Becks et al. 2011; Lopez and Romary 2010 [1, 17] etc. In the present paper, an application has been developed which may create many dimensions while acting primarily on the patent prior art search. Using the present development patent assessment, patent technology clustering and new cutting-edge technological advancements in the current specific area of research may be worked out. A product specification based novel approach has been developed which contains many dimensions of the patent prior art search. It is expansion of all the applications developed or used in the patent prior art searches which are mainly keywords or phrases based searches involved. It gives only the prior art literature in the results. The proposed applications of the present work may be expanded in many dimensions of the patent prior art search. 
Patent prior art searches are one of the challenging information retrieval problems which act differently in comparison of general document searches. A patent document search represents long technical document as a query for the search performance. Early systems mimicked the approach taken by professional patent examiners, who (at the time) valued high frequency words as query terms [3, 4]. Recently, use of the entire draft patent document (or a large set of terms automatically extracted from it) has become popular. It is tedious task to extract automatically all the main appropriate query terms from a patent document. The patent documents has well defined sections (e.g. Abstract, Background of the Invention, Complete Specifications or Descriptions of the technology, the Claims, the Diagrams etc.) and have well defined/ significant roles of each and every section of the text and diagram. The research conducted by Saad and N X rnberger, [18] studied prior-art cross lingual information retrieval approaches from patents. In the research [6] encompassed the visualization analysis of the patents and papers pertaining to the terahertz technology. In their research [2] presented a survey that focuses on analysis and retrieval of the images, drawings, diagrams, charts, and plots from patent documents. The patent document retrieval is often cumbersome looking into its compact form. In a patent document, abstract and description sections contain the innovative steps and highly specialized technical words which are not found in daily uses language while claim section contains the legal terminology which sounds highly specific to legal domain. Most appropriate keywords extraction and  X  X et of words X  extraction have been targeted in many ways. These are summarized as below. 2.1. Keyword Based Search Generating the appropriate query for keyword based extraction methods has been most utilized to make a retrieval process for the patent prior art search as the basic concept. The objective herein is to find more relevant literature based on these extracted keywords. In their research [15] focused on the query length and stated that patent applications demand queries comprising hundreds of words as opposed to ad-hoc web searches where queries are usually rather short. [23] experimented with the data taken from United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They examined using query terms taken from different fields of a patent document. In the experiment they found the best performance was obtained when using high frequency terms extracted from the raw text of the Description field. In their research [12] proposed a two-stage patent retrieval method, in which the first stage uses the similar approach to expand the query, and the second stage focuses on claim parsing to re-weigh the query words and then identify the top 1000 patents. In the method of keyword extraction an expansion focuses on the Key phrase Extraction from Scientific Articles, [10] have proposed to use up to 5-grams for the phrases extraction from textual content of the document. In the researches in this area there are various state-of-the-art patent IR systems [1, 11, 15, 13]. All of these systems use single query representations of the patent application. In contrast described below is our approach to prior-art search that uses multiple query representations. 3.1. Claim Structure Based Search 
Another effective method is claim structure categorization method for the patent prior art searches. In their research [19] focused on claim schema tree generation using words and their features identified for some verbs as predicates. Based on these verbs in the claim, they segmented and labeled words according to their elements (features), and then form a case-role . Moreover, the comparison of the similarity and co-occurrence of features between these and other case-roles was used to construct a conceptual schema tree. Furthermore, Sheremetyeva (2003) [20] used supertags to improve the POS tagging, and showed the significant performance gains. 
Shinmori et al. (2003) [21] proposed the idea of using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to parse a patent claim. According to Marcu (1997), [11] RST relies on  X  X ue phrases X  in implementing algorithms to discover the valid RST trees for a single document. This work is reasonable based on the assumption that an author has a fixed writing style. 
In the literature various methods have been implemented for the patent prior art searches using keywords extraction, expansion of keywords extraction using N-gram, claim structure words feature extraction, cross lingual keyword extraction, visualization analysis, images, diagrams and drawings etc. In the present paper an application has been developed with different approach which will comprise of many results analysis. An invention specification based patent prior art search and invention clustering has been proposed in the present paper. Based on the present methodology a patent may be clustered with similar group of invention and their current status of the invention and their specifications or working features. The figure 1 given below shows the three modules of the work proposed in the present paper. 3.1. Text Extractions for the Similarity Checkup 
A GUI application has been designed and implemented for entering of specifications of the related products already in the market with user compatibility mode. This GUI is used for the input purposes whereby the user enters the E&amp; ICT product name or model for their complete specifications. Once this inputting phase is over, the system will process and connect to the appropriate patent websites for the complete specifications of the product in question for which patents used are to be searched. 3.2. Text Extractions for the Similarity Checkup 
In this phase, once the user selects particular model name/number and presses the submit button the software parses the web page and gathers all important keywords, on which patent search can be applied in next phase. The preprocessing of the gathered data is done for the exact keywords or phrases selection. Stop word removal and stemming processes are applied on the data for query generation for the patent searching. Stop words are frequent words that carry little useful information such as pronouns, prepositions or conjunctions. Word stemming is the process of removing suffixes to generate word stems. This is done by grouping words that have the same conceptual meaning such as  X  X un X ,  X  X unner X , and  X  X unning. X  A well-known algorithm for this task is the Porter stemmer. Stemming, for instance, can reduce all words with the same root to a single form. There are three classes of word normalization: 1. Morphological stemming: terms like  X  X etrieving X  use the stem  X  X etriev. X  2. Lexicon-based: terms like  X  X etrieval X  become  X  X etrieve. X  3. Term clustering: Use classes such that terms  X  X ecover X ,  X  X etch X  and  X  X ring X  are all equivalent values. The preprocessor removes stop words and uses word stemming to group the similar words such as  X  X ise X  and  X  X isdom. X  Furthermore, verbs are also discarded. 
The gathered keywords are separately stored in an HTML file and simultaneously a window appears listing those keywords in drop-down menu, for providing to the user a choice to select keywords on which he/she wants to search patents. 3.3. 
It consists of two sub phases where the first sub phase deals with searching the patents using API which accesses its patent databases like United States Patent and Trademark Organization (USPTO) or European Patent Organization (EPO) or World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) patent database. The later sub-phase deals with output representation and analysis of the patent clusters. The output section provides user with four widely used options namely  X  X earch by Relevance X ,  X  X earch by Time-Period X ,  X  X nly Filed Patents X  and  X  X nly Issued Patents X . The functionality of each of these is exactly as reflected by their name. 
The results generated comprise of patents with assignee which makes the cluster of specific technology domain and their big players in the market and their historical patenting nature in the particular domain. Similar area may be considered in most near similar clusters. Second analysis will make the technology on the edge in the particular domain. In the figure 2 below a complete process of the designed system is given. A typical example may be taken of Mobile phones. There are many technological subsystems used in the manufacturing of mobile phones e.g. Battery, Screen, OS, processor, RAM, Sound devices, Camera, Security devices etc. Each and every area of these subsystems technology has some assignee making most of the patents which have more expertise than others. In the proposed method, these are analyzed subsequently. The figure 3 given below shows the overall working diagram of our proposed application. 
The methodology proposed in the present paper has been tested on E&amp;ICT products. A sample example of the Mobile phones has been analyzed and reported here by giving the test results in this section. The system has been designed for the user facilitation to accept input for the patent searches. Thereafter the system processes the query and fetches the specifications of the product. After getting product specifications, it generates keywords on the basis of product specifications e.g. lithium battery, camera, OS (version) etc. Based on those keywords it will fetch relevant patent documents and thereafter generate some categorization table of the patent documents. Figure 3 shows the tables generated by the first phase of the application. 
After completing the relevant patent document downloading it will generate a complete patent list with all details about patent documents. Further on the basis of technology and invention assignee and area of research, it generates different pools which comprise of specific domain and inventions. Figure 4 shows the complete list for a mobile after completing the process. 
Patent prior art search is a challenging task characterized with many constraints due to the nature of the related patent documents. It is different from general information retrieval for a document. Many researchers are working in many ways for the patent prior art report generation. In the literature discussed earlier most of them are based on keywords extraction or expansion of keyword querying method to retrieve the relevant patents particularly focusing on the  X  X echnology/detailed specification X  section of the patent documents. Some of the researchers have also explored use of the claim structure and visualization techniques. In these methodologies, only prior art search is focused to generate the report containing the relevant patents as the results. 
The present paper, in contrast, targets generating prior art report based on products technical specifications. As a case study it focuses on technology for specific subassemblies forming a system, it classifies the technology e.g. for example for case of a cellular mobile the subassemblies are battery, screen, camera, OS etc. After searching the patents based on the keywords for these technology areas, it generates a cluster of maximum patents in each and every technological classification. After generating the technology cluster along with their assignees that have maximum patents in specific technology, it finds out the technology assessment and possible technology advancement in the specific areas. Figure 5 shows both the approaches and their possible application benefits 
With recent technological developments, patent analysis plays an ever-increasing role in de fi ning business strategies and supporting decision making in and across all related organizations. Tools with versatile capabilities to effectively retrieve and visually represent patent information are bene fi cial to organizations in a wide range of tasks. This literature review provides an overview of text mining and visualization based techniques for patent analysis and a taxonomy that classi fi es these approaches. In the present paper, a new approach has been developed on the basis of product specifications to generate a number of applications based on it. It is different approach from the existing purely the keyword based the patent prior art search just focusing on one query to find advancement of one technology class at a time. The advanced results arrived at from the present innovation generates shows the spectrum of its utilizations. The process used for E&amp;ICT products and in the results sections a typical example has been discussed for case of cellular mobile phones. It can be broadened with the more specifications and their use in near future. 1. Becks, D., Eibl, M., Ju  X rgens, J., Ku  X rsten, J., Wilhelm, T., &amp; Womser-Hacker, 2.
