 1. Introduction
Query suggestion is a common feature of many information search systems and increasing amounts of research has been published about query suggestions ( Silvestri, 2010 ). Most studies have focused on techniques to identify and generate query suggestions. Fewer studies have focused on understanding when and how query suggestions might be useful during search, if query suggestion usage leads to better search outcomes and if and how query suggestion usage and effectiveness change as a result of contextual factors.

The potential usefulness of query suggestions during information search is great. Query suggestions are potentially ben-eficial because they provide searchers with alternative methods for exploring topics and can help searchers develop better understandings of their topics and richer vocabularies with which to create manual queries. Query suggestions allow search-ers to continue to execute searches even when they are unable to formulate their own queries and provide a lost-cost meth-od to access additional information (searchers can click to get new search results rather than engage in manual query reformulation). Query suggestions can potentially support orienteering strategies (e.g., O X  X ay and Jeffries, 1993; Teevan,
Alvarado, Ackerman, &amp; Krager, 2004 ) by providing searchers with additional navigation links from their current search posi-tions. Finally, query suggestions might be particularly useful for less experienced searchers or for those with less domain knowledge who are more likely to have difficulty formulating and reformulating queries.  X 
Information search models provide another way to consider the potential usefulness of query suggestions. Kuhlthau X  X  (1994) and Vakkari X  X  (2001) models are anchored by different stages, which are associated with different types and sources of desired information, search tactics and mental models. For example, Vakkari (2001) identified three stages (pre-focus, for-mulation and post-focus) and found that searchers sought different types of information during each stage (general informa-tion, faceted background information, specific information). Query suggestions can potentially assist in all stages of search by helping the searcher get started during the pre-focus stage, explore various facets during formulation stage and follow-up with specific questions during post-focus stage.

In our previous investigations of query suggestions, we found direct evidence that participants used query suggestions as was introduced by Bates (1979b) as a move to help searchers generate new ideas or solutions to information search prob-lems. Bates noted that idea tactics serve a psychological purpose in that they can potentially improve a person X  X  thinking and creative processes during information search (p. 280). Bates further justified the importance of idea tactics by observing that mation problem can sometimes block their efforts to think of novel and useful ways to proceed with search. Bates (1979b) idea tactics, which emphasize idea generation and pattern-breaking, can help searchers move beyond these initial models.
Participants from our previous studies ( Kelly et al., 2009; Kelly et al., 2010 ) revealed during interviews that query sugges-tions gave them ideas for searching and helped them get started with their searches. They further stated that the suggestions helped them think of other avenues for searching when they exhausted their own ideas and when they were uncertain about how to proceed.

To better understand when and how these participants used query suggestions, we analyze the search behaviors of par-ticipants from one of these studies ( Kelly et al., 2010 ). In this paper, we address the following questions: (1) When do users integrate query suggestions into their searches? (2) How does use of query suggestions differ according to search experience, temporal segment of search and topic difficulty? (3) Does the use of query suggestions help users find more relevant documents? 2. Related work
The work described in this paper covers many areas: search tactics; search experience; topic difficulty; search stage, phase and segment; and query suggestions. 2.1. Search tactics
One common and classic way researchers have classified search behavior is according to tactics and strategies (e.g., Bates, the search while a tactic deals with moves made to further a search. Bates (1979a) identified 29 search tactics and organized them into 4 categories (monitoring tactics, file structure tactics, search formulation tactics and term tactics). Bates (1979b) also identified 17 idea tactics, or  X  X  X actics to help generate new ideas of solutions to problems in information searching X  X  (p. 280), which were classified as either emphasizing idea generation or pattern-breaking. Idea generation focuses on the stim-ulation of new ideas, while pattern-breaking tactics help searchers go beyond their current way of thinking about the prob-lem and suggest moves that can be made while interacting with a retrieval system. Although some pattern-breaking tactics are intended to be used by the searcher introspectively, a number of these focus on search behavior and query generation.
Bates (1979b) noted that many of the search tactics introduced in (1979a) can also be used as idea tactics, especially search formulation and term tactics.

Bates (1979a) classification of search tactics served as an important conceptual reference for the large number of empir-according to purpose (broadening, narrowing, and topic change) and according to type (physical/cognitive; conceptual/oper-ational). Cognitive moves refer to moves that users make internally such as conceptually analyzing search terms and exam-ining documents for potentially useful search terms, while physical moves refer to external moves made by searchers; for example, clicking on a specialized search feature.

Recent studies of Web search have focused on Bates X  search formulation and term tactics (e.g., Jansen, Booth, &amp; Spink, tance accounted for nearly 45% of all query reformulations actions. Jansen et al. (2009) speculate that these results show that users often have unclear ideas about how to express their information needs and so submit a series of queries to try to better define their information needs. This speculation is consistent with orienteering strategies (e.g., O X  X ay and Jeffries, 1993; Tee-van et al., 2004 ) where searchers make a series of small moves to resolve their information problems. Each move is based on the outcome of the previous move. Rather than entering one long query to retrieve the best search results list, searchers in-stead expect to make a series of smaller moves, often by entering a series of short queries, each of which will lead them in an incremental fashion to results which will potentially satisfy their information needs. Thus, query suggestions seem like a particularly useful type of system support for this type of search strategy.

One useful approach to studying search tactics is to create models of the frequency and order of search moves using tech-niques such as Markov modeling ( Chapman, 1981; Chen &amp; Cooper, 2001, 2002; Jansen et al., 2009; Qiu, 1993; Wildemuth, sequence. Patterns are frequent sequences of individual moves made by searchers. Qiu (1993) used a log linear model to determine the order of Markov model for search patterns when users were interacting with hypertext systems. Chen and
Cooper (2001, 2002) analyzed the transaction logs of an on-line university OPAC and used statistical cluster analysis to cat-egorize users into six groups according to search behavior. Wildemuth (2004) used the maximal repeating algorithm (MRP) to study the search behavior of undergraduate student searchers in a microbiology course to determine the impact of domain knowledge on search tactics. Wildemuth (2004) found that search tactics changed over time as the students X  domain knowl-edge changed.

In this paper, the aim is to investigate people X  X  search tactics rather than their search strategies, including when they inte-grate query suggestions into their searches. Of particular concern are search formulation tactics, since this is the class which best characterizes query suggestion. In some situations, query suggestions might also function as a term tactic in that the searcher might manually add individual terms from a query suggestion to their query, but such actions are more difficult to measure. 2.2. Search experience
Search experience was an important construct in early studies of interactive searching as online information systems of-ten required searchers to have extensive knowledge of search syntax and query languages, and were designed primarily for information professionals. As a result, many early studies investigated the impact of search experience on search behaviors.
These studies showed that people with different levels of search experience exhibited different search behaviors (e.g., Bates, 1977 ). Many follow-up studies have also shown this to be the case (e.g., Hoelscher &amp; Strube, 2000 ; Lazonder, Biemans, &amp;
Wopereis, 2000; Sutcliffe, Ennis, &amp; Watkinson, 2000; Yuan, 1997 ). For example, Yuan (1997) found that search experts were faster and used more tactics and search features. Hoelscher and Strube (2000) found that experts relied more on query-for-matting tools than novices.
 There are fewer contemporary studies about the impact of search experience on search behavior. A recent example is
White and Morris (2007) who analyzed a search engine query log to determine if it was possible to identify advanced search-ers. Advanced searchers were defined as searchers who used advanced operators in their queries. White and Morris (2007) found that advanced searchers issued fewer and longer queries and examined documents at lower depths in the search re-sults list than other searchers. They also showed that advanced searchers were generally more successful than less advanced searchers.
 Studies have also shown that search experience impacts a searcher X  X  preferences for system support ( White, Ruthven, &amp;
Jose, 2005 ). For example, in a study of explicit and implicit relevance feedback systems, White et al. (2005) found that par-ticipants with both high and low search experience were positive about the implicit relevance feedback system, but the ex-plicit relevance feedback system was preferred by more experienced searchers. This latter finding might be because these participants were better able to conduct the activities necessary to make the explicit relevance feedback work.
Although there have been a large number of studies of search experience and it is typically included as a measure in stud-ies of interactive searching, it is difficult to precisely determine the impact of search experience because of variability in how researchers define and measure search experience ( Moore, Erdelez, &amp; He, 2007 ). While the previous research suggests that search behavior differs depending on search experience, and that those with less experience issue more queries and prefer a different type of search assistance than those with more experience, the usefulness of query suggestions in helping novice searchers is still an open question. 2.3. Tasks, topics and their properties
This paper focuses on topic difficulty, but a search of the literature reveals that topic difficulty and task complexity are often conflated, along with topic knowledge (or domain knowledge) and task knowledge. However, each of the various con-structs differs and can interact in a variety of ways. For example, a person might know a great deal about a topic, but be we distinguish between topic knowledge, which we consider to be how much a person knows about a particular topic, and topic difficulty, which we consider to be a characteristic of a person X  X  experiences searching for information about a partic-ular topic. The former is determined before searching, while the latter is determined after searching. We consider task as the underlying goal of the search and hold it constant while topics vary across a single type of information task.
To better understand topic familiarity and difficulty, we first review research that focuses on the conceptualization task since these constructs are often discussed in this literature. A great deal of recent research has explored and defined task and task properties (e.g., Bystr X m &amp; Hansen, 2005; Kim &amp; Soergel, 2005; Li &amp; Belkin, 2008; Toms, 2011; Vakkari, 2003;
Wildemuth &amp; Freund, 2009 ). Researchers have classified tasks according to specific type (e.g., open, factual, navigational, decision-making) and according to task properties (e.g., nature, urgency, structure, stage), and have found that search behav-Ingwersen &amp; J X rvelin, 2005 ). The current research is focused on search tasks.

Task properties have been further categorized into those related to tasks, users, and the relationship between the user and acteristics including source (internally generated or externally assigned), product (intellectual, decision), task (objective complexity, interdependence) and user X  X  perceptions of task (urgency, difficulty, complexity, knowledge of task topic and knowledge of task procedure). In this classification, there is a clear distinction between objective and subjective task prop-erties, as well as task and topic knowledge. The present research is concerned primarily with knowledge of task topic. This research is also concerned with knowledge of task procedure to a certain extent which Li and Belkin (2008) describe as, in part, consisting of the searcher X  X  knowledge of the method or procedures for completing a task, including the searcher X  X  search experience. 2.3.1. Task difficulty
Several studies have shown that search behavior varies according to task difficulty. Gwizdka and Spence (2006) found that tasks that searchers evaluated as more difficult were associated with more page views, more time spent per page and longer navigation paths. In a follow-up study, Gwizdka (2008) found that only number of page views continued to be related to task difficulty. Gwizdka (2008) also tested additional variables and found that searchers took longer to complete the most difficult tasks and bookmarked more pages. Gwizdka (2008) did not look at query behavior. However, Kim (2006) found that participants engaged in more query reformulation, spent more time, and viewed more pages for more difficult tasks. Liu, Gwizdka, Liu, and Belkin (2010) found that searchers conducting difficult tasks spent more time overall, spent more time examining search results pages, viewed more search results pages, issued more queries, and issued more queries that did not result in any page saves. Liu et al. (2010) then construct and evaluate several models to predict task difficulty using these behavioral variables.

Aula, Khan, and Guan (2010) found that when searching for difficult fact-finding tasks, searchers formulate more diverse queries, use advanced operators and spend a longer period of time on the search results page. Smith (2008) also found that searchers entered queries more frequently when working on difficult topics. Aula et al. (2010) observes that searchers X  behaviors became more varied and explorer-like when engaged with difficult tasks. Task difficulty was determined by the researchers rather than the searchers, but it is not described how this was done so it is difficult to compare these results to other studies that measure task difficulty via the searcher X  X  post-task assessments.

White et al. (2005) studied the impact of task complexity on participants X  perceptions and use of implicit and explicit rel-evance feedback. Task complexity was varied according to the method described by Bell and Ruthven (2004) and consisted of varying the number of potential sources and type of information required for the same general topic. White et al. (2005) found that explicit relevance feedback was preferred for less complex tasks, while implicit relevance feedback was preferred for more complex tasks. White et al. (2005) note that for complex tasks, participants had a difficult time finding relevant documents which they could feed to the system for relevance feedback. When participants X  initial queries were not good enough to retrieve relevant documents, explicit relevance feedback was not useful.

White et al. X  X  (2005) finding implicates the potential usefulness of query suggestions since they are not as closely tied to the quality of the search results list. The research in this section also showed that when searching for difficult tasks, search-ers entered a greater number of queries and more diverse queries. Thus, system support in the form of query suggestions is likely to be especially useful in this situation. 2.3.2. Topic knowledge and difficulty The impact of topic (or domain) knowledge on search behavior has been acknowledged for quite some time ( Bates, 1977;
Fidel &amp; Soergel, 1983 ). Allen (1991) found that searchers with greater domain knowledge used more search terms; in par-ticular, searchers with high domain knowledge were able to continue to introduce new search terms even when experienc-ing difficulty with the search. Hsieh-Yee (1993) demonstrated that searchers made greater use of search functionality designed to assist with query formulation (e.g., a thesaurus) when searching for topics about which they had little topic knowledge. Vakkari (2001) found that searchers with less topic knowledge used broader and more ambiguous terms and simpler search tactics than searchers with more topic knowledge. Vakkari, Pennanen, and Serola (2003) later demonstrated that searchers with less domain knowledge experience greater difficulty choosing appropriate search terms. Similarly, Wil-demuth (2004) found that less domain knowledge was associated with less efficient selection of concepts to include in the search and more errors in reformulation of the search tactics. Shute and Smith (1993) found that domain experts used more terms than novices, illustrating that domain experts have a larger vocabulary with which they are able to generate queries.
Hembrooke, Gay, and Granka (2005) also found differences in search strategies used by domain novices and experts; experts issued more complex search queries with more unique terms. In a recent analysis of search logs from a commercial Web search engine, White, Dumais, and Teevan (2009) found that domain experts differ in the sites they visit, the query vocab-ulary they use, their patterns of search behavior and their search success.

Vakkari (2001) argues that searchers with little domain knowledge need support in expanding and differentiating their conceptual model of a topic and that their inability to generate appropriate terms potentially makes some automatic query expansion techniques problematic. Vakkari (2001) suggests that a search thesaurus might be more appropriate assistance; however, in a later study, Sihvonen and Vakkari (2004) demonstrated that topic experts were more successful using a thesaurus for expansion than novices. Sihvonen and Vakkari (2004) also investigated the relationship between topic knowl-edge and task difficulty and found that both novices and experts used more thesaurus terms for the difficult tasks.
Most studies have focused on topic familiarity rather than topic difficulty (although the previously discussed research about task difficulty is relevant since these concepts are often conflated). These studies have found that those with less topic familiarity have a more difficult time identifying and selecting terms for query expansion and reformulating their queries.
Query suggestions can potentially help these types of searchers since they provide semantic units, which might be easier to recognize, understand and integrate into their searches. 2.4. Search stage, phase and segment
Results from several longitudinal studies of people engaged in information seeking have demonstrated that search behav-ior changes according to search stage ( Kuhlthau, 1994; Vakkari, 2001; Wang, 1997 ). Kuhlthau (1994) created a 6-stage mod-el of the information search process, each with different feelings, thoughts and actions and found that students sought and used information differently depending on the stage of the search process. Kuhlthau X  X  (1994) results suggested that differ-ences in search terms and strategies at different stages might also vary, but she did not specifically monitor students X  uses of online IR systems. Using Kuhlthau X  X  (1994) framework as a guide, Vakkari (2001) observed the search behavior of 11 stu-dents working on their master X  X  theses in information science throughout the course of a semester. Vakkari (2001) collapsed
Kuhlthau X  X  (1994) 6 stages into: pre-focus, formulation and post-focus and associated each stage with a different type of information: general information, faceted background information and specific information. Vakkari (2001) found that the information sought, search tactics used and relevance assessments were all related to problem stage. As their projects (and searches) progressed, students used increasingly specific search terms, more operators, a greater diversity of operators and more versatile search tactics.

In another study, Vakkari et al. (2003) observed the information seeking behavior of 22 students in a psychology seminar who were tasked with preparing a proposal. The students conducted two information search sessions, which were moni-tored. Vakkari et al. (2003) found differences in the number and type of search terms used between the two sessions, but no differences in participants X  use of search tactics and operators ( Vakkari et al. (2003) acknowledge that these results may have been an artifact of the times at which participants were observed). Additional differences in behavior across the two sessions were found among participants X  with varying levels of search experience and topic knowledge. Vakkari et al. (2003) concludes that both novice searchers and those with vague understandings of their topics need system support in selecting search terms and formulating queries. Query suggestions may provide such support.

The studies above developed models based on longitudinal data collected across numerous sessions. Researchers have also examined variations in search behavior within single search episodes. In these studies, people X  X  searches are typically divided by time. Rather than focusing on stages, these studies can be better characterized as focusing on phases of search or temporal search segments. Xie (2000) identified four types of shifts and three types of strategy changes that occur during an information searching episode. Searching experience, domain knowledge, error discovery, and dissatisfaction with search re-sults were presented as the primary triggers for users X  shifts in search tactics which suggests that some variables, such as search experience and domain knowledge, interact with search stage in complex ways. In White et al. X  X  (2005) study of ex-plicit and implicit relevance feedback, participants X  search sessions were divided into nine portions  X  with three portions corresponding to a different phase of the search: start, middle and end. Results showed that participants provided more ex-plicit feedback information towards the end of their searches and implicit relevance feedback was used more at the begin-ning or end of their searches. Participants were more likely to accept term suggestions towards the end of their searches when using both the explicit and implicit systems. In contrast, Jansen et al. X  X  (2009) found that people were more likely to request query reformulation assistance at the start of the search session.

The studies in this section show searchers X  behaviors and the type of support needed change over the course of a search both within and between sessions. However, it is an open question as to whether query suggestions would be more or less useful at different stages of a work task and at different points during a single search episode. In this study, we use temporal demarcations to divide participants X  single session searches into three periods (early, middle and late) and focus on if and how query suggestion usage changes during the course of a session. 2.5. Query suggestion
The final area of research related to this work is query suggestion. While a great deal of research on mining Web logs to identify techniques for query suggestion has been conducted (see Silvestri (2010) for an overview), much less published re-search has been done on how and when people integrate query suggestions into their search interactions. In a series of re-lated work, Smyth and Freyne ( Freyne, Farzan, Brusilovsky, Smyth, &amp; Coyle, 2007; Smyth et al., 2004 ) describe the I-SPY search engine (and variations thereof), which incorporates a collaborative ranking function based on similar query-docu-ment pairs and suggests related queries to users. Results of several evaluations, including ones with users, demonstrate that the techniques were effective at improving retrieval and that user X  X  found the suggestions useful. Glance (2001) proposed techniques to identify similar queries and create a query network which allowed users to explore similar queries. However, this work was not evaluated by users.
White, Bilenko, and Cucerzan (2007) compared the effectiveness and usability of a system that suggested queries with two versions of a system that suggested destinations (or pages), along with a baseline system that did not make any sugges-tions. White et al. (2007) showed that participants preferred the query suggestion system to the baseline; participants cited reasons such as the query suggestion system X  X  support for query reformulation and because the suggestions gave them ideas for query expansion. For known-item searches, in particular, participants rated the query suggestion the best over the other three options and used the most suggestions during these searches. Most participants indicated that they selected query sug-gestions because they saved them from typing, rather than providing new ideas. However, given that participants entered the largest number of queries when using the query suggestion system than the other three systems for both known-item and exploratory tasks, it is unclear if they would have really generated these queries on their own without the aid of query suggestion.

In our previous work ( Kelly et al., 2009 ), we compared a query suggestion system to a term suggestion system and found that participants saved more documents with query suggestions than with queries created using suggested terms and that participants preferred the query suggestion system to the term suggestion system. Participants also used more query sug-gestions when searching for more difficult topics, although these differences were not significant. Participants stated that the query suggestions gave them ideas for searching even though they did not always click on the suggestions (in many cases, they entered the suggestions manually, which is in contrast to White et al. X  X  (2007) finding) and that they appreciated the ease with which they could execute new queries (similar to White et al. X  X  (2007) finding). Finally, many participants noted that the query suggestions helped them get started with their searches and think of other avenues for searching when they were stuck.

In another study ( Kelly et al., 2010 ), we investigated how the presentation of usage information (the number of other peo-ple who had used the suggestion) impacted use of query suggestions. Both the usage information and quality of the query suggestions were manipulated. Results showed that participants were not significantly more likely to take high usage sug-gestions, but were significantly more likely to take high quality suggestions, regardless of usage information. We also found that participants took more query suggestions when searching for difficult topics. During interviews, participants indicated that, overall, the suggestions were useful, especially when they exhausted their own ideas and when they were uncertain about how to proceed with the search. Participants also stated that the suggestions stimulated and expanded their thinking about the topic.

The previous research on query suggestion shows that people are favorable about query suggestions and use them. How-ever, it is unclear how and when they use them, and if use differs depending on other variables such as search experience and time period during a search. Comments made by participants in our previous studies show that query suggestions are used as idea tactics, but further research is needed to determine when query suggestions are integrated into the search and how their use potentially changes as a function of search experience, topic difficulty and temporal search segment. 3. Method
This research is a secondary analysis of data that was collected for a study investigating query suggestions ( Kelly et al., 2010 ). The goal of the original study was to determine the extent to which participants could be influenced to take query suggestions based on the provision of usage information, where usage information was a numeric value indicating to the participant how many other searchers had used a particular suggestion (see Fig. 1 ). Results from this study revealed that participants X  selections of query suggestions were not significantly influenced by this usage information: participants se-lected 148 queries that were associated with low usage information and 165 queries that were associated with high usage information. Because there was no main effect for the experimental manipulation in this study, we combine all the data for the analyses reported in this paper.

While results describing this previous study have been published as a conference paper ( Kelly et al., 2010 ), most of the results presented in this paper have not been published. This paper includes more detailed analyses of participants X  search behaviors using Markov modeling and of the impact of topic difficulty on query suggestion usage, as well as new analyses of the impact of search experience and temporal search segment on query suggestion usage and of the relationship between query suggestion usage and search performance. 3.1. Interface, retrieval system and search log
The search system employed in the previous experiment was developed using the Lemur IR toolkit . KL-divergence retrie-val model was used for retrieval and ranking of documents. The interface of the retrieval system is shown in Fig. 1 . From this interface, participants could enter queries in the search box, browse the result list generated by the query, and click query suggestions on the right hand side to get a new result list. Below the search box were a set of functions that allowed par-ticipants to view the documents they had saved, their past queries and current search topic. Additionally, participants could click through a link from the result list to view the full text of a document and save it if relevant.

Participants X  interactions were automatically logged using a logging tool built into the retrieval system. The following activities were logged and used in the analyses reported in this paper: queries entered, query suggestions clicked, documents viewed from search results list, documents saved and documents removed from saved list. Query suggestion usage, one of the major variables in our study, was measured by participants X  clicks on the query suggestions. 3.2. Corpus and topics
Four search topics were selected from the TREC HARD 2005 collection ( Voorhees, 2006 ). This collection consists of 50 top-ics and a 3 GB corpus of newswire text (over 1 million articles), drawn from three sources: Xinhua News Service (1996 X  2000), New York Times News Service (1998 X 2000), and Associated Press Worldstream News Service (1998 X 2000). We man-ually selected these topics by considering past users X  performances with the topics from another study ( Kelly et al., 2009 ), the number of relevant documents in the corpus and whether we thought the topic would be of interest to target partici-pants (undergraduates). Participants had up to fifteen minutes to search for each topic and were instructed to save the rel-evant documents they found. Topics were rotated using a Latin-square. The description of the four topics is summarized in
Table 1 . Participants were also provided with a short narrative that further elaborated the topic. 3.3. Search experience
To measure search experience, a modified version of Debowski, Wood, and Bandura X  X  (2001) 21-item Search Self-Efficacy scale was used ( Table 2 ). This scale asked participants to indicate how confident they were that they could execute a number of different search related tasks such as constructing a query and managing search results. Participants responded to each item using a 10-point scale, where 1 = totally unconfident; 5 = reasonably confident; and 10 = totally confident. The Search
Self-Efficacy scale was modified in several ways. First, seven items were deleted that were no longer relevant given more contemporary and prevalent search practices (e.g., items about searching CD-ROM collections). Second, minor word changes were made to several items to improve clarity. Finally, the original scale asked people to first indicate whether they believed they could or could not perform the described action, and then asked them to use the 10-point confidence scale. We elim-inated the initial binary response and just asked participants to use the 10-point scale. Participants completed this question-naire online before starting the search tasks.

The changes we made to the Search Self-Efficacy scale compromised any of the initial validity and reliability testing that was done to develop the instrument. Debowski et al. (2001) do not describe how the instrument was developed and tested, aside from citing information and library science literature which they studied in order to identify items for the scale. However, Debowski et al. (2001) report the following four reliability coefficients (participants completed the scale at four different points in time in their study): 0.95, 0.97, 0.98 and 0.98. The researchers did not report results of a factor analysis, but did average participants X  responses to all items to form a composite measure. In our study, we did not collect data from enough participants to perform a factor analysis, but did compute two measures of reliability: Cronbach X  X  alpha, which was 0.96 and Guttman X  X  Split-Half coefficient which was also 0.96. Like Debowski et al. (2001) , we averaged each participant X  X  responses to the set of items to arrive at a single measure for each participant and refer to this as search experience, rather than Search Self-Efficacy since the original scale was modified. 3.4. Topic difficulty
In the original study, participants rated the difficulty of each search topic on a 5-point scale (1 = very easy; 5 = very dif-ficult) using an electronic questionnaire following completion of each search task. Thus, this measure of topic difficulty rep-resents participants X  perceptions of topic difficulty. Table 3 displays participants X  average self-reported difficulty ratings of each topic, along with the number of documents saved for each topic. Overall, Topic 354 was rated the easiest, while 426 was rated the most difficult. The number of documents saved for each of these topics reflects these distinctions. In the anal-yses reported in this paper, we refer to topics by their difficulty rank rather than their TREC topic identification number. 3.5. Temporal search segment
To study the usage of query suggestions at different time periods during the search episode, every search session was divided into three segments according to time: early, middle and late. This division was based on the length of time each individual participant searched for a specific topic. For example, if one participant spent 12 minutes searching for one topic, then the early segment corresponded to the first four minutes of the search, the middle segment, the next four minutes and the late segment, the last four minutes. 3.6. Relevant documents saved
Participants were instructed to save documents they thought were relevant to the topics. Thus, in this study we use a simple, participant-specific measure of document relevance that was based on each participant X  X  saving behaviors. 3.7. Procedure
Participants were recruited by sending out an invitational email to the undergraduate student mailing list at our univer-sity. Each experimental session was conducted in a private laboratory and lasted approximately one hour. Participants first completed a consent form and demographic questionnaire. Next they completed the search experience questionnaire. Fol-lowing this, they were presented with their first search topic. Following each search topic, participants completed a post search questionnaire about their searching experience with that particular topic. After this, they started their next topic.
After they finished all four search topics, participants completed an exit questionnaire and interview. All questionnaires were administered electronically. At the end of the study, participants were debriefed and given $20 USD compensation. 3.8. Participants Twenty-three students participated in this study (16 females and 7 males). Participants X  mean age was 21 years ( SD = 1.9).
All were undergraduate students except for one graduate student. Thirteen percent of participants were humanities majors, 30% were social science majors, 22% were science majors and 35% were in a professional school. 4. Results 4.1. When do users integrate query suggestions into their searches?
Overall, participants submitted a total of 722 queries for all topics (31.39 queries per person or about 8 queries per par-ticipant per topic on average). Of these 722 queries, 425 (59%) were manually entered through the search box while 297 (41%) were clicked suggestions. Each participant was shown a total of 32 suggestions (8 suggestions per topic 4 topics).
On average, participants selected 13.70 ( SD = 7.02) query suggestions. One participant did not select any, while another se-lected 24. The maximum number of queries (either self-created or suggested) submitted to the system per topic per person was 18 and the minimum was 1.

A point of note is that 113 of the 425 manually typed queries were exactly the same as one of the suggested queries. Of these 113 queries, only 7 were the first queries typed by participants (in which case they would not be duplicates since par-ticipants did not receive any suggestions until they entered one query). This indicates that participants might adopt a query suggestion by typing it in the search box rather than clicking it. Figs. 2 and 3 display the relative proportions of user gener-ated queries and query suggestions by submission order. Fig. 2 counts query suggestions as only those that were clicked, while Fig. 3 counts query suggestions as both clicked suggestions and manually entered queries that duplicated suggestions.
Both Figures show that the first queries entered by participants were self-generated, which is what one would expect since participants had to enter a query before suggestions were shown.

As shown in these Figures, many participants incorporated suggestions into their searches at the second iteration X  X early 50% of participants according to Fig. 2 and nearly 65% of the participants according to Fig. 3 . Query suggestions continued to be used for multiple iterations (up to 16 iterations for one participant). Both Figures suggest that participants integrated query suggestions into their searching fairly quickly and continued using suggestions throughout their searches. Fig. 3 shows that the use of query suggestions was greater than that of self-created queries for queries issued from the second to the eighth iterations. Fig. 2 shows the proportion of user generated queries and query suggestions varied a bit more during these same iterations, although this proportion was roughly equivalent. Following the eighth iteration, the use of self-created que-ries becomes greater than query suggestions in both Figures, which is likely explained by the fact that only 8 query sugges-tions were offered per topic. In the remainder of this paper, only clicks are treated as use of suggested queries since there is no way to ascertain whether the origins of the manually entered queries came from the suggestions or naturally from participants.

To investigate how participants interacted with the search system and when they incorporated query suggestions into their searches, the logs were analyzed. Table 4 displays the frequency of each of the different actions performed by partic-ipants during their searching. Open Document accounts for 46.23% of the total number of actions. Participants entered slightly more self-created queries than query suggestions (11.43% vs. 7.99%) and the proportion of opened to saved docu-ments was high (about 74%). Remove saved document occurred infrequently (0.16%).
 First order Markov modeling was used to investigate the sequence of moves executed by participants during a session.
The first-order Markov model, also called a state transition matrix, reports the probability of the transition from all the pos-sible current states to all the possible future states. First-order Markov models are the types of models most frequently found in the ILS literature ( Wildemuth, 2009 ).

Table 5 summarizes the frequency of moving from the states presented by rows to the states represented by columns. The most frequent transition is from Open Document to Save Document, which occurred 1268 times. This finding is comparable to the findings in Table 4 , which showed that Open Document and Save Document accounted for higher percentages of the total actions taken by participants. In such a matrix, the value in each cell can be converted to a percentage of all the tran-sitions in the row (i.e., each row sums to 100%) and can be interpreted as the probability of going from the corresponding row state to the column state ( Qiu, 1993 ). By looking at the first row of the table, we can observe the frequencies of the transi-tions from Enter Query to all the possible future states. As indicated, opening a document is most likely to follow the action of entering a query (58.99%). The next likely action to follow is repeating the action of entering a query (26.50%) followed by clicking a suggestion (13.56%).
 With respect to moves following clicking a suggestion, opening a document is still the most likely to follow (57.30%).
Interestingly, clicking another suggestion is the second most frequent action that follows clicking a query suggestion (37.36%) and entering a manual query the third most frequent, although much less so (5.34%). It might be the case that when formulating queries people tend to maintain the previous entry mode (either manual entered through typing or query sug-gestion through clicking). Additionally, the likelihood of going from Enter Query to Click Suggestion is much higher than the reverse. This might be because people use query suggestions when they have exhausted their own ideas or when results for the entered query are less relevant. However, once participants use query suggestions, they often do not return to typing queries.
 The second-order transition matrix is graphically displayed in Fig. 4 . The most common sequence was Open Document,
Save Document, Open Document followed by Save Document, Open Document, Save Document. Click Suggestion most often followed the sequence Open Document, Save Document as did Enter Query. Similar to the first-order matrix, any two se-quence action that ended with Click Suggestion was more likely to be followed by Click Suggestion rather than Enter Query. 4.2. How does use of query suggestions differ according to search experience?
Participants X  search experience scores ranged from a minimum of 5.14 to a maximum of 9.79. The mean score was 7.319 with a standard deviation of 1.386 and a median of 7.143. In general, participants X  average search experience scores were above the mid-point of 5 ( reasonably confident ). The standard deviation was relatively small, showing little variance in these scores. Overall, these scores show that most participants believe they are fairly experienced searchers.

A correlation coefficient was conducted to see if there was a relationship between search experience and use of query suggestions. This correlation coefficient was not significant, ( r = .250, p = 0.250). Since the distribution of search experience scores did not vary that much, this is unsurprising, but it does suggest an inverse relationship between search experience and use of suggestions. To better explore the potential relationship between search experience and use of suggestions, we grouped participants into two search experience groups, high and low. Participants were divided into the two groups using the median score (participants scoring 7.14 and less were placed in the low group, while those scoring more than 7.14 were placed in the high group) and the number of query suggestions taken by each group was compared. Participants in the low search experience group used an average of 15.75 ( SD = 5.94) query suggestions, while those in the high search experience group used an average of 11.09 ( SD = 7.50); this difference was not significant t (21) = 1.66, p = 0.11. 4.3. How does use of query suggestions differ according to temporal search segment?
Table 6 shows the mean number of user generated queries and query suggestions submitted for each temporal search segment. An ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there was a difference in the mean number of user generated que-ries and query suggestions observed at different segments. Both the source and phase main effects were significant,
F (1,137) = 9.42, p = 0.003 and F (2,137) = 3.43, p = 0.038. Post-hoc tests revealed a significant difference between the number of queries entered during the early and middle segments. There was also a significant interaction effect between source and segment, F (2,137) = 8.44, p &lt; 0.001, with participants entering more of their own queries during the early and middle seg-ments, and more suggestions during the late segment.

As displayed in Table 6 , overall, participants entered more of their own queries than query suggestions and entered the most queries during the early segment. With respect to the interaction effect, in the early segment, participants entered more of their own queries, but during the late segment, participants selected more suggested queries. These results suggest that query suggestions might be more useful during later periods of search. During these periods, participants might be exploring the various facets of the topic and/or looking for specific information. These are also likely to be the points at which participants have exhausted their own ideas for queries and need ideas for alternative queries to continue with their searches. 4.4. How does use of query suggestions differ according to topic difficulty?
Table 7 displays the number of user generated queries issued and the number of suggested queries taken according to topic difficulty. Participants issued the most queries for the most difficult topic. While the number of queries participants created on their own was somewhat constant, the number of query suggestions participants selected increased as topics be-came more difficult. However, results of an ANOVA revealed no main effect for topic difficulty [ F (3,184) = 1.82, p = 0.146] and no significant interaction effect between source and topic difficulty [ F (3,184) = 0.70, p = 0.55]. 4.5. Does use of query suggestions help users find more relevant documents?
In this analysis, we assume that documents saved by participants are considered relevant since these were the instruc-tions provided. Thus, we count all saved documents as relevant. We present results in this section using two different units of analysis. In the first sub-section, we use the participant as the unit of analysis, in the second, the query. 4.5.1. Participants
A total of 1271 documents were saved by all 23 participants for the four different search topics (about 13.8 documents per topic per participant). To better explore individual differences, we grouped users into high and low users of query sugges-tions. This categorization was based on the descriptive statistics for use of query suggestions. The mean and median scores were similar (13.52 and 14.00, respectively), so we divided participants at the median; thus, participants who selected on average 0 X 14 query suggestions were placed into the low usage group, while those selecting 15 X 24 were placed in the high usage group. We then compared the relationship between query suggestion usage group (high and low), search experience group (high and low) and number of documents saved ( Table 8 ).

An ANOVA showed that those in the high query suggestion usage group saved significantly more documents than those in the low usage group, F (1,22) = 4.696, p = 0.04. Participants in the low usage group saved an average of 27.25 ( SD = 7.75) doc-uments, while those in the high usage group saved an average of 35.91 ( SD = 9.95) documents. The test also showed that participants in the low search experience group saved more documents than participants in the high search experience group ( M = 32.50, SD = 10.53; M = 30.18; SD = 8.78, respectively), although this difference was not significant ( F (1,21) = 0.071, p = 0.793). Although Table 8 shows a slight interaction effect between search experience group and query suggestion usage group, this was not significant, F (1,21) = 0.209, p = 0.652. 4.5.2. Query
In this section, we try to better understand which queries  X  user-generated or query suggestion  X  led to the most relevant documents being identified by participants. On average, 1.95 ( SD = 3.70) documents were saved per user-generated query and 1.49 ( SD = 2.77) were saved per query suggestion. For most queries, no documents were saved ( n = 352 queries). The maximum number of documents saved for user-generated queries was 32, while this number was 24 for a query suggestion.
These results seem to suggest little difference in the total number of relevant documents retrieved by user-generated and suggested queries. A Levene X  X  test showed that the difference in variance between the groups was significant ( F = 4.50, p = 0.034), a t -test (assuming unequal variance) showed the difference between means was not significant, t (716.423) = 1.87, p = 0.062.

We examined the relationship between source of query, temporal search segment and number of documents saved to test for interaction effects ( Table 9 ). An ANOVA showed that there was a significant main effect for segment, F (2,721) = 11.74, p &lt; 0.01, but no significant interaction effect, F (2,721) = 0.13, p = 0.88. Scheffe X  X  post-hoc tests showed that participants saved significantly fewer documents during the late segment than the early and middle segments.

We also examined the relationship between source of query, topic difficulty and number of documents saved to test for interaction effects ( Table 10 ). An ANOVA showed that there was a significant main effect for topic difficulty, F (3,721) = 9.57, post-hoc tests showed that participants saved significantly more documents for the easiest topic than for the other topics.
With respect to the interaction effect, user-generated queries yielded more relevant documents for the easiest two topics and fewer relevant documents for the most difficult topics.
 4.6. Discussion
This study addressed several questions: (1) When do users integrate query suggestions into their searches? (2) How does use of query suggestions differ according to search experience, temporal search segment and topic difficulty? (3) Does the use of query suggestions help users find more relevant documents? Results in relation to each of these questions are discussed below. 4.7. When do users integrate query suggestions into their search behaviors?
Overall, 41% ( n = 297) of the 722 queries entered by participants were query suggestions. Participants incorporated query suggestions into their searches fairly early (nearly 50% of participants X  second queries were query suggestions) and contin-ued using them throughout the search process. We noted that of the 425 typed queries, 106 were identical to the query sug-gestions. It might be the case that participants preferred to manually enter the query suggestions or it might just be that participants typed an identical query without ever seeing the suggestion. The analysis of the transition matrix revealed that participants exhibited a preference for maintaining query entry mode. The transition matrix indicated that people tended to repeat what they have done in the last iteration when formulating queries: typing queries manually was likely to be followed by another typing and clicking a suggestion was likely to be followed by another clicking. Despite this evidence, for simplic-ity reasons, all the typed queries were treated as self-created queries. Real query suggestion usage might be higher than the results reported in this paper and a follow-up study using an eye-tracker might provide more insight about the extent to which query suggestions are used even when they are not clicked. Ultimately, this demonstrates the difficulty of investigat-ing the cognitive aspects of information search since an observable behavior does not always occur and when it does it is difficult to associate with a particular mental action or intent. Future research might also investigate different input modes for query suggestion and the extent to which people maintain query entry mode. Selecting a query suggestion by clicking the mouse is one type of input mode; additional input modes  X  in particular, those that map to the keyboard such as keyboard shortcuts or spoken dialog  X  might be useful directions for future research. 4.8. How does use of query suggestions differ according to search experience, temporal search segment and topic difficulty?
We used a modified version of the Search Self-Efficacy scale to operationalize search experience. Although there was no significant difference in the number of query suggestions taken according to search experience, participants with lower search experience used more query suggestions than those with higher search experience. These results are aligned with previous research that has shown that those with less search experience issue more queries ( White &amp; Morris, 2007 ); given this general strategy of novices, query suggestions can at least save novices some effort in issuing queries. Those with greater search experience are likely to have a greater range of search tactics in their search repertoire, have a better understanding of how retrieval works and of how to construct appropriate queries. Query suggestions are a relatively simple and comprehend-ible type of assistance that can easily be integrated into searching even when one has less search experience. A searcher does not have to know how the underlying retrieval algorithm works or puzzle over things such as term order. While in past stud-ies a greater numbers of queries issued by novices have not necessarily lead to the identification of a greater number of rel-evant documents, there is some evidence in this study that this did happen (see discussion in next section).

There was not great variation in participants X  search experience scores, which might explain why our results were not significant. Participants X  scores were concentrated at the higher end of the search experience scale. Studying participants with a wider range of search experiences might better illustrate the usefulness of query suggestions for those new to search-ing or for those with very little experience. Future studies might engage in quota sampling to obtain a more varied and bal-anced sample that would allow for a robust examination of the relationship between search experience and usage of query than their actual abilities, so the classification of participants might contain some error.

To study the relationship between query suggestion usage and temporal search segment, we divided search sessions into three temporal segments: early, middle and late. We found that participants used the most query suggestions during the late segment of their searches. This might be because participants exhausted their own ideas for queries towards the end of the search, or it might be because participants felt they had obtained sufficient information for the task and then used the sug-gestions to verify their findings in the remaining time, or just to explore system functionality.

In this paper, we focused on temporal search segments, rather than search stages. The terminological difference is nec-essary to distinguish research such as Vakkari X  X  (2001) , which is based on intensive, longitudinal examination of search behaviors as people work to resolve real-world work tasks, from research such as ours that examine variations in search behaviors as people work to resolve artificial search tasks across single search episodes. While the former studies use activ-ities, behaviors and cognitions to demarcate various search stages, the latter type of study uses simple, time-based demar-cations without regard to what participants might actually being doing during these periods. Although comparison is tenuous given these differences, our results slightly differ from what one might expect given Vakkari X  X  (2001) pre-focus, for-mulation and post-focus stages and the types of information sought by people in each of these stages: general information, faceted background information and specific information. Given Vakkari X  X  (2001) stages, query suggestions would seem especially useful for obtaining general and faceted background information, and perhaps less so for specific information, but in our study the greatest usage was found in the last temporal segment. It might be case that during single search ses-sions, participants experience and engage in different types and sequences of behaviors. Alternatively, it might be the case that our division was too coarse and failed to accurately pinpoint when query suggestions were most useful. The results showed that participants integrated query suggestions into their searches fairly quickly ( Fig. 2 ); while it might be possible to further divide the searches into smaller units of time, it is unclear to what information type such temporal units would correspond. The temporal dimensions associated with various segments are also likely to vary depending on factors such as topic difficulty and task familiarity. Understanding how to better subdivide single search episodes is an important topic for future research.

The results suggest that query suggestions are more useful for difficult topics; participants selected increasing numbers of query suggestions as topic difficulty increased and they also issued more queries overall for more difficult topics, although documents by issuing a small number of their own queries. They might also be able to think of a variety of queries based on their pre-search understanding of the topic. Finally, participants might be able to generate more of their own queries based on their search interactions. If participants X  initial queries are retrieving relevant documents, then they might be able to use these documents as sources of terms for query reformulation. For difficult topics, participants might need more assistance both during the early and late temporal search segments because of a lack of pre-search topic knowledge or because initial queries do not yield useful results. One factor that may contribute to search difficulty is the complexity of the topic, where complexity is the number of topic facets. If searchers are unaware of the range and types of facets, then they might have a difficult time identifying queries that represent these different facets. Query suggestions can potentially provide users with an overview of different facets as well as easy entry points into different parts of the collection. Facet and cluster-based browsing is not new, but browsing via query suggestion may provide a more simplified and meaningful method of access.
Finally, it is important to note that topic difficulty was determined based on participants X  self-reported difficulty ratings of the topics, which they provided after they searched. Although we used participants X  topic difficulty ratings to rank the topics, the range in scores was small (0.74 X 2.09 on a 5-point scale). A greater range in topic difficulty scores might have revealed different findings. 4.9. Does the use of query suggestions help users find more relevant documents?
To examine the relationship between use of query suggestions and number of documents saved, we first analyzed the data on a per participant basis, and then examined the data at the individual query level. Participants in the high query suggestion usage group saved significantly more documents than those in the low usage group, so it appears that the use of query suggestions can lead to better performance, at least when performance is based on the number of docu-ments saved. Furthermore, when combined with the results regarding search experience, it appears that the query sug-gestions can potentially help those with less search experience perform better than those with more search experience, although results of an ANOVA showed no significant interaction effect between query suggestion usage group and search experience group.

When looking at the yield of individual queries, we found that slightly more documents were saved with user-generated queries, although this difference was slight. This suggests that the query suggestions were as useful as the user-generated queries. We found a significant effect for temporal segment: participants saved significantly fewer documents during the late segment of search. This might generally be expected and corresponds to Vakkari X  X  (2001) findings. It is the case that partic-ipants used more query suggestions in the late search segment; thus, it might be the case that participants did not find any new relevant documents with these suggestions. Although there was no significant interaction effect between temporal search segment and query source, this is an important issue to investigate further since the real potential of query sugges-tions, in part, is to help searchers explore new areas of the collection and new facets of the information problem, rather than retrieving documents similar to those found by user-generated queries.

Finally, we found a significant interaction effect between topic difficulty, source of query and number of documents saved. When searching for the most difficult topic, participants saved significantly more documents retrieved by query sug-gestions than by user-generated queries. The opposite was true when searching for the easiest topic. These results implicate the value of suggestions for difficult topics. Previous studies have shown that searchers enter more queries for difficult topics this strategy and more importantly, this seemed to result in a good outcome with respect to number of documents saved.
However, since we do not have a control group we cannot say if this outcome was better than if the suggestions were not present. Previous studies have also shown that participants make greater use of query formulation assistance when searching for topics about which they have little knowledge ( Hsieh-Yee, 1993 ) and when searching for difficult tasks ( Sihvo-nen &amp; Vakkari, 2004 ), which seemed to be the case in this study. Previous studies have shown that those with more domain knowledge have a larger vocabulary about the topic and are better able to use query formulation assistance in the form of a difficult topic likely provided participants with a greater range of search terms and in a form (i.e., query) that semantically made sense, was easy to operate and was not over-whelming or cumbersome. 5. Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to better understand when and how query suggestions might be useful during search, if query suggestion usage leads to better search outcomes and if and how query suggestion usage and effectiveness change as a result of search experience, topic difficulty and temporal search segment. We found that participants integrated query suggestions into their searches quickly and that participants with lower search experience used more suggestions and saved more documents. We also found that participants used more suggestions towards the end of their searches and when search-ing for more difficult topics. These scenarios are suggestive of when searchers might need assistance formulating queries during information search.

Querying is one of the primary methods for searchers to communicate their information needs to retrieval systems. Con-temporary search systems quickly provide results and offer basic query suggestions, which make strategies that involve mul-tiple querying, like orienteering, possible. However, query suggestions are likely to be more useful if they are better tailored to the searcher and the search situation and task. Future research should create and evaluate techniques for tailored query suggestions and variable input modes, along with other features that provide searchers with ideas when they get stuck, allowing them to move forward with their searches even after they have exhausted their own ideas.
