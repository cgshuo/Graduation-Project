 This paper calls out several research challenges in the art of recommendation technology as applied in Web media sites. One particular characteristic of such recommendation set-tings is the relative low cost of falsely recommending an irrelevant item, which means that recommendation schemes can be less conservative and more exploratory. This also cre-ates opportunities for better item cold-start handling. Other technical difficulties include analyzing offline data that is heavily biased by the site X  X  appearance, and in a related vein  X  once a recommendation module X  X  appearance has been de-signed  X  defining the correct metrics by which to measure it. Also called out are tradeoffs between personalization and contextualization, as are novel schemes that aim at recom-mending sets and sequences of items.

The art of recommender systems has evolved tremendously since its early incarnations in the nascent field of eCommerce in the late 1990s. While the field now merits a dedicated conference, many challenges exist -particularly around new applications of recommendation technology in different set-tings. This extended abstract calls out several challenges arising from the integration of recommendation technology into Web media sites.
In many recommendation scenarios, the cost suffered by the user when consuming an irrelevant item  X  as measured by money or time spent  X  can be quite high. On the other hand, when browsing a Web media site, the cost of a click leading to a non-engaging story is rather low -no money and very little time is lost by the user. Given the low cost of falsely recommending items, recommender systems can may require knowing the layout seen by users and consider-ing also the items they chose not to consume [7]. Recommendation modul es come in many shapes and forms. Some are fixed size, displaying exactly some top-k items. Others allow scrolling through multiple k-sized sets of items. Lately, continuous scrolling modules deliver more items as the user scrolls, leading to an  X  X nfinite list X  experience.
The differences in how recommendations are shown to the user translate to differences in the metrics that should drive the offline stage of data analysis and modeling. When show-ing only a few top items, offline learning should probably focus on identifying only the best items available per user per time, whereas discriminat ing between non top-k items (e.g. the RMSE or AUC metrics) is far less consequential.
Furthermore, online metrics should look beyond just con-sumption rates, or  X  as typically manifested in media sites  X  click-through rates (CTR). It is well known that media sites can gain short-term clicks by promoting sensational stories; however, such policies are detrimental to a site X  X  brand and appeal in the long run. While metrics such as long-term user satisfaction are difficult to quantify, engagement cues other than CTR -dwell time, sharing, rating, commenting  X  might be better indicators of user satisfaction and can be tapped for learning.
Web media sites often display links to additional stories on each article page. These stories are sometimes tabbed as  X  X elated stories X  and sometimes as  X  X ecommended for you X , but the use-case is essentially the same. Given a user visiting a Web page, how should the additional stories be chosen? What should be the relative importance of the story on the page (the context) vs. the person visiting the page? The items that best match the user might be unrelated to the story, and in certain cases displaying them in the story X  X  context may be distasteful and could reflect badly on the site. On the other hand, putting too much emphasis on related context may result in stories that do not match very well the user X  X  taste. Coming up with the right balance of contextualized and personalized factors is a challenging problem, and novel techniques such as Tensor Factorization [8] may prove helpful here.
In certain media types users often consume several items in rapid succession. Examples include listening to music and browsing online content on a media site. This raises the question of whether items should be recommended inde-pendently, based only on their individual projected affinity to the user, or whether the system should aim to recom-mend a set or sequence of items that are  X  X ell consumed together X . Recently, two papers attempted to model radio playlists as sets [4] and sequences [5] of items, and clearly there is room for additional investigation. Furthermore, in some domains, constraints might be imposed over the items that are co-consumed together (e.g. playlists may not be al-lowed to include too many tracks of any individual artists),
