 A common motiv ation for personalised searc h systems is the abilit y to disam biguate queries based on some kno wledge of a user's interests. An analysis of log les from three searc h pro viders, covering a range of scenarios, suggests that this sort of disam biguation would be of marginal use for more specialised pro viders but may be of use for whole-of-W eb searc h.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retriev al ]: Information Searc h and Retriev al| search process Measuremen t Disam biguation, personalisation
Personalisation techniques in information retriev al are of-ten motiv ated by disam biguation: if a query term is ambigu-ous, a personalised system can use kno wledge of the user to determine the term's correct meaning and thus impro ve precision (e.g. [2, 6, 8, 9, 10]). There are also implemen-tations of personalised searc h in commercial whole-of-W eb searc h engines, and these implemen tations app ear to carry out some disam biguation. The question we address here is: is disam biguation likely to pro vide a real bene t in searc h, and if so in whic h scenarios?
We have examined log les from three searc h pro viders (the public website of a compan y; a portal for governmen t websites; and a large whole-of-W eb searc h engine) to coun t the num ber of sessions in whic h users issued a query to dis-ambiguate an earlier one, for example follo wing \jaguar" with \jaguar cars". This pro vides an estimate of the num-ber of queries whic h are: 1. ambiguous in one or more terms, 2. not already answ ered well by the searc h pro vider, and 3. imp ortan t enough for the user to warran t the e ort of
Our coun t therefore pro vides an estimate of the prop or-tion of sessions whic h could be impro ved by automatic dis-ambiguation, and an indication of the scenarios where the technique may be most useful.
Logs were acquired from three searc h pro viders, covering a range of scales: one was a medium-sized compan y, one a portal to a range of governmen t websites, and one a whole-of-W eb searc h engine. Eac h log included the text, time, and a user iden ti er or clien t IP address for eac h query .
For eac h pro vider, the logged data was divided into ses-sions: a \session" was de ned as all queries from the same user or clien t IP address with not less than ve min utes in-activit y. Any session with only one query could not include explicit disam biguation and was remo ved. A uniform sub-sample of at least 750 of the remaining sessions was tak en and given to two judges for man ual classi cation. Eac h judge mark ed those sessions whic h app eared to con tain an instance of explicit disam biguation.
 The compan y's searc h engine indexes around 22,000 pages. Log les used covered 5 days and 11,733 sessions, of whic h 939 (8%) had more than one set of terms and were candi-dates for judging. The governmen t portal is signi can tly larger, with 2,300,000 pages and 59,717 sessions across 24 days; 1720 sessions (3%) were candidates for judging. Logs from the whole-of-W eb engine covered three mon ths and 338,775 sessions of whic h 96,788 (29%) were candidates.
Explicit disam biguation generally took the form of extra terms being added to narro w the scop e of queries, but on some occasions terms were replaced with near synon yms. Examples from the logs included:
Results are summarised below. \Explicit disam b." is the prop ortion of all sessions whic h app ear to include an in-stance of explicit disam biguation; these are the sessions for whic h automatic disam biguation would be a clear adv an-tage. \In ter-judge agreemen t" is the Jaccard similarit y be-tween the judges' assessmen ts, j J 1 \ J 2 j = j J 1 [ J and J 2 are the sets of sessions mark ed by eac h judge. We note that agreemen t of 71{88% is in line with results of man y TREC exp erimen ts [11].

The similarit y between the results for the single compan y and governmen t portal is unexp ected: it would seem rea-sonable to assume that with the greater range of sub ject matter in the governmen t portal there would be more scop e for ambiguit y (criterion 1 above) and that governmen t busi-ness would be more imp ortan t to users (criterion 3). Since the prop ortion of sessions with more than one query is so low for this pro vider, we believ e the di erence may be in the qualit y of the searc h engine and in the nature of common queries.

The nal gures for the single compan y and governmen t portal are low (1.3% and 1.7% resp ectiv ely). While these results do indicate a poten tial bene t from automatic dis-ambiguation, they also suggest the impact of suc h a system will be small, and that the overall impro vemen t may not be worth the additional e ort and additional risk of error.
The whole-of-W eb result of 6.5%, however, suggests that automatic disam biguation would be helpful in general Web searc h. This is reinforced by the observ ation that a full 29% of sessions in our data involve more than one query . The dif-ference observ ed between whole-of-W eb and more focussed searc h could be explained by sev eral factors:
Finally , we note that the gures above represen t the gain available only if we can successfully disam biguate in all cases. With realistic success rates of about 60% [7], the bene t of automatic systems would be further limited.
In con trast to the investigation rep orted here, researc h on disam biguation has typically used standard test corp ora and arti cial queries. Follo wing an investigation using arti-cial terms in the Reuters corpus [5], Sanderson concluded that automatic disam biguation is likely to be of only small bene t to information retriev al systems and then only if the disam biguation is of high qualit y. Stok oe, Oak es, and Tait broadly agree [7], nding an impro vemen t on TREC Web Track tasks but only of very small degree (around 0.03 im-pro vemen t in R-precision). Similar small bene ts have been noted by other studies over TREC-lik e data (e.g. [1, 3, 4]), but larger bene ts are suggested with Web searc h [9]. This is consisten t with our ndings.

As well as systems whic h use disam biguation to impro ve performance over all users, a num ber of systems have been built to personalise a system by performing disam biguation (eg [2, 6, 10]). To the best of our kno wledge, the impro ve-men ts due to disam biguation have not been systematically measured for these \real world" systems.
Personalisation systems motiv ated by disam biguation as-sume there are enough instances of ambiguous and poor queries to be worth while. We nd explicit disam biguation in only 1.3{1.7% of sessions with commercial and govern-men t searc h pro viders, but 6.5% with whole-of-W eb searc h. This suggests that automatic disam biguation will only re-alise a small bene t in more focussed environmen ts but may be somewhat helpful in Web searc h.
