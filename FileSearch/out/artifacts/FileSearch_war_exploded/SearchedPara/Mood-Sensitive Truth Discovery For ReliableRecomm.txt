 This work is motivated by the need to provide reliable in-formation recommendation to users in social sensing. Social sensing has become an emerging application paradigm that uses humans as sensors to observe and report events in the physical world. These human sensed observations are often viewed as binary claims (either true or false). A fundamental challenge in social sensing is how to ascertain the credibility of claims and the reliability of sources without knowing ei-ther of them a priori . We refer to this challenge as truth dis-covery . While prior works have made progress on addressing this challenge, an important limitation exists: they did not explore the mood sensitivity aspect of the problem. There-fore, the claims identified as correct by current solutions can be completely biased in regards to the mood of human sources and lead to useless or even misleading recommen-dations. In this paper, we present a new analytical model that explicitly considers the mood sensitivity feature in the solution of truth discovery problem. The new model solves a multi-dimensional estimation problem to jointly estimate the correctness and mood neutrality of claims as well as the reliability and mood sensitivity of sources. We compare our model with state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions us-ing four real world datasets collected from Twitter during recent disastrous and emergent events: Brussels Bombing, Paris Attack, Oregon Shooting, Baltimore Riots, which oc-curred in 2015 and 2016. The results show that our model has significant improvements over the compared baselines by finding more correct and mood neutral claims.
 Reliable Recommendation Systems, Mood Sensitive, Truth Discovery, Social Sensing, Disaster and Emergency Response
This paper develops a new principled approach to ad-dress the mood-sensitive truth discovery problem for reliable recommendation systems in social sensing. Social sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm for sensing the physical environment by using human as sensors [1]. This paradigm is motivated by the proliferation of digital sensors, ubiquitous wireless connectivity and massive data dissemi-nation opportunities (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.) [2]. For example, survivors may tweet to document the damage and outage in the aftermath of a disaster or emergency event. Citizens may report geotagged photos to document the pot-holes on city streets or litter locations in a park. These hu-man sensed observations are often viewed as binary claims (either true or false). A fundamental challenge in social sensing is to ascertain the correctness of claims and the reli-ability of sources without knowing either of them a priori . We refer to this challenge as truth discovery .

Consider a disastrous scenario like Hurricane Sandy (Nov. 2012), where many gas stations near New York city ran out of gas and people were hanging around and posting the gas availability of different stations on Twitter. A reliable rec-ommendation system could accurately recommend the gas stations that are most likely to have gas from massive noisy and emotionally biased tweets. However, it is challenging to accurately ascertain the correctness of human sensed data with little or no prior knowledge of the data sources and the claims they make [3]. For example, users may report unreliable information on Twitter that could mislead peo-ple to the stations that did not have gas [4]. Alternatively, sources may generate completely mood-biased claims in re-lation to the disastrous event with a purpose of attracting public attention or showing their personal opinions.
Important progress has been made to solve the truth dis-covery problem in recommendation systems [5, 6], data min-ing [7, 8], and networked sensing communities [4, 9]. Despite this progress, there exits an important limitation: they did not explore the mood sensitivity aspect of the problem. Therefore, the claims identified as correct by current so-lutions can be completely biased in regards to the mood of human sources and lead to useless or even misleading recommendations. For example, during the recent Brussels Bombing event in March 2016, people reported on Twitter their claims that are either neutral or moody (e.g., positive or negative) in relation to the bombing event (See Table 1). Those moody claims usually come in a large volume but con-tain little factual information about the event itself. There-fore, they should be separated from the neutral and credible claims suggested by the recommendation system.

A few challenges need to be addressed in order to incorpo-rate the mood sensitive feature of claims into the truth dis-covery solutions. First, social sensing is an open data contri-Table 1: Moody and Neutral Claims in Brussels Bombing Event, 2016 bution paradigm where the source reliability (the likelihood of a source to report correct claims) and the source mood sensitivity (the likelihood of a source to report mood sensi-tive claims) are often unknown a priori. Second, it is not straightforward to identify a set of keywords that could per-fectly classify mood sensitive claims from the neutral ones, especially with the absent of knowledge on a particular event before it happens. Simply ignoring the mood-sensitive fea-ture of sources and claims will generate many moody claims that are useless and interfering in decision making.
To address the above challenges, this paper develops a principled approach to solve the mood sensitive truth dis-covery problem in social sensing. The new approach solves a multi-dimensional estimation problem by developing a new Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithm: Mood-Sensitive EM (MS-EM). The MS-EM scheme jointly esti-mates i) correctness and mood neutrality of claims and ii) reliability and mood sensitivity of sources without knowing either of them a priori. We compared the MS-EM with the current mood-ignorant truth discovery solutions using four real world datasets collected from Twitter during recent dis-astrous and emergent events: Brussels Bombing, Oregon Shooting, Baltimore Riots, and Paris Attacks, which oc-curred in 2015 and 2016. The evaluation results showed that the MS-EM scheme effectively identifies both correct and mood neutral claims in the truth discovery results and significantly outperforms other baselines. The results of this paper are important because they directly contribute to building reliable recommendation systems in social sens-ing that allow users to make sound decisions by exploring the massive noisy and unvetted data from the crowd.
We summarized the contributions of this paper as follows:
There exists a good amount of work in data mining on the topics of fact-finding that jointly compute the source reliability and claim credibility [10]. Hubs and Authori-ties [11] proposed a fact-finding model based on linear as-sumptions to compute scores for sources and claims they asserted. Yin et al. developed an unsupervised fact-finder called TruthFinder to perform trust analysis on heteroge-neous information networks [12]. Other fact-finders extended these basic frameworks by considering properties or depen-dencies within claims and sources [13]. More recently, new fact-finding algorithms have been designed to address the topic relevance [14], time sensitiveness [15], confidence aware-ness [16] and provenance aspect [17] of the problem. This paper uses the insights from the above work (i.e., the inter-dependence between source reliability and claim credibility) and develops a new estimation approach to explicitly model unreliable and moody human sensors and solve the mood sensitive truth discovery problem in social sensing.
Our work is also related with reputation and trust sys-tems that are designed to study the reliability/credibility of sources (e.g., the quality of providers) [18, 19]. eBay is a homogeneous peer-to-peer based reputation system where participants rate each other after a transaction [20]. Alter-natively, Amazon is a heterogeneous on-line review system where sources offer reviews and comments on products they purchased [21]. Recent work has also investigated the con-sistency of reports to estimate and revise trust scores in rep-utation systems [22 X 24]. However, we normally do not have enough history data to compute the converged reputation scores of sources in social sensing applications [3, 25]. In-stead, this paper presents a principled estimation approach that jointly estimates the reliability and mood sensitivity of sources as well as the correctness and mood neutrality of claims based on the data collected.

Finally, our work falls into the scope of recommendation systems [26]. Expectation Maximization (EM) has been used as an optimization approach for both collaborative fil-tering [27] and content based recommendation systems [28]. For example, Wang et al. developed a collaborative filtering based system using the EM approach to recommend scien-tific articles to users of an online community [27]. Pomerantz et al. proposed a content-based system using EM to explore the contextual information to recommend movies [28]. How-ever, the truth discovery in social sensing studies a differ-ent recommendation problem. Our goal is to recommend credible and reliable information from a large crowd of un-vetted sources with unknown reliability and mood sensitiv-ity rather than predict users X  ratings or preferences of an item. Moreover, item or rating based recommendation sys-tems commonly assume a reasonable amount of good data is available to train their models while little is known about the data quality and the source reliability a priori in social sensing applications.
In this section, we formulate our mood-sensitive truth discovery problem as a multi-dimensional maximum like-lihood estimation problem. In particular, we consider a Social Sensing application scenario where a group of M sources (Users) S = ( S 1 , S 2 , ..., S M ) report a set of N claims C = C 1 , C 2 , ..., C N . In this paper, we consider two inde-pendent features of a claim: (i) mood sensitivity: whether a claim is of mood neutral or mood sensitive; (ii) correctness: whether a claim is true or false. We let S u denote the u source and C k denote the k th claim. C k = O and C k = O represent that claim C k is mood sensitive and mood neutral respectively. In social sensing applications, sources may in-dicate a claim to be mood sensitive (e.g., using emotional words or emoticons). Furthermore, C k = T and C k = F rep-resent the claim to be true or false respectively. We further define the following terms to be used in our model.
A key challenge in social sensing lies in the fact that sources may not always report neutral and truthful claims. In this paper, we explicitly model mood sensitivity and re-liability of sources. First, we define the mood sensitivity of source S u as M u : the probability that a claim C k is mood sensitive given the source S u indicates it to be. Second, we define the reliability of source S u as R u : the probability that a claim is true given that source S u reports it to be true. Formally, M u and R u are defined as follows:
We further define a few conditional probabilities that we will use in our problem formulation. Specifically, we define V u,O and V F u,O as the (unknown) probability that source S indicates a claim to be mood sensitive or not given the claim is indeed mood sensitive. Similarly, we define V T u, O and V as the (unknown) probability that source S i indicates a claim to be mood sensitive or not given the claim is indeed mood neutral. Formally, V T u,O , V F u,O , V T u, O , and V as:
In addition, we define I u and J u as the probability that source S u reports a claim C k to be true given that claim C is indeed true or false. Formally, I u , J u are defined as: Notice that sources may report different number of claims. We denote the probability that source S u reports a claim to be mood sensitive as mp u,O (i.e., mp u,O = Pr( S u M k = 1)), and denote the probability that source S u reports a claim to be mood neutral as mp u, O (i.e., mp u, O = Pr( S  X  1)). Additionally, we denote the probability that source S u reports a claim to be true by sp u (i.e., sp u = Pr( S u 1)). We further denote h 0 as the prior probability that a randomly chosen claim is indeed mood sensitive (i.e., h O Pr( C k = O )). We denote d as the prior probability that a randomly chosen claim is true (i.e., d = Pr( C k Based on the Bayes X  theorem, we can obtain the relationship between the items defined above as follows: Finally, we define two more vectors of hidden variables  X  and Z where  X  indicates the mood neutrality of claims and Z indicates the correctness of claims. Specifically, we define an indicator variable r k for each claim where r k when claim C k is mood sensitive and r k = 0 when claim C k is mood neutral. Similarly, we define another indicator variable z k for each claim C k where z k = 1 when C k is true and z k = 0 when C k is false.

Using the above definitions, we formally formulate the mood sensitive truth discovery problem as a multi-dimensional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem: given the Source-Mood Matrix SM and the Source-Claim Matrix SC , the objective is to estimate: (i) the mood neutrality and correctness of each claim; (ii) the mood sensitivity and the reliability of each source. Formally, we compute:
In this section, we present the mood sensitive identifi-cation scheme: Mood-Sensitive Expectation Maximization (MS-EM). The MS-EM scheme jointly estimates the mood sensitivity of each claim and the mood sensitivity of each source.

Given the terms and variables we defined earlier, the like-lihood function L = ( X  ms ; X,  X ) for MS-EM is as follows: V the MS-EM scheme. Note that V T u,O , V F u,O , V T u, O h , are defined in the previous section. Additionally,  X  k,u and Pr( r k ) are defined in Table 2. In the table, S u M and S u M O k = 0 when source S u indicates claim C k mood neutral. S u M O k = 0 and S u M O k = 1 when source S u reports claim C k but indicates it to be mood sensitive. S
M O k = 0 and S u M O k = 0 when source S u does not report claim C k at all. Other notations are defined in the previous section. The model structure is illustrated in Figure 1. Given the above likelihood function, we can derive E and M steps of the proposed MS-EM scheme. First, the E-step is derived as follows: where  X ( n, k ) is defined in Table 2.

In the above table,  X  O ( n, k ) = Pr( r k = O | X k ,  X  ( n ) represents the conditional probability of the claim C j to be mood sensitive given the observed data X k and current es-timate of  X  ms .  X  O ( n, k ) can be further expressed as: where L O ( n, k ), L O ( n, k ) are defined as:
In the M-step, we set derivatives  X  X   X  X  T equations, we get expressions of the optimal V T u,O V N is the total number of claims in the Source-Mood Matrix. SF O u is the set of claims the source S u indicates to be mood sensitive. SF O u is the set of claims the source S u reports but indicates to be mood neutral.
 In summary, the input to the MS-EM scheme is the Source-Mood Matrix SM . The output is the maximum likelihood estimation of the mood-sensitivity of claims and the mood-sensitivity of sources. Since we assume the mood sensitive feature of a claim is binary, we can classify claims as ei-ther mood sensitive or mood neutral based on the converged value of  X  O ( n, k ). The convergence analysis of MS-EM is presented in the next section. Algorithm 1 shows the pseu-docode of MS-EM.
 Algorithm 1 Mood-Sensitive EM Scheme (MS-EM)
In this section, we evaluate the MS-EM scheme on four real-world data traces collected from Twitter in the after-math of recent emergency and disaster events. We show the performance of our scheme against the state-of-the-art base-lines on these data traces. First, we present the particular experimental settings as well as data pre-processing steps that we used to set up the data for evaluation. Next, we show the baselines mentioned above and evaluation metrics we used in our evaluation. Last, we show our results: (i) MS-EM scheme can identify mood neutral claims more ac-curately than the compared baselines and (ii) MS-EM can achieve non-trivial performance gains in finding more valu-able (i.e., neutral and correct) claims compared to current truth discovery techniques.
Social sensing has emerged as a new area of experimen-tation where human sensors discuss events that happened in the physical world. The reported observations in social sensing applications may be incorrect or mood sensitive due to the open data collection environment and unvetted data sources [1]. However, this noisy nature of social sensing ap-plications gives researchers an opportunity to investigate al-gorithms in real world scenarios and in our case, the MS-EM scheme. In the evaluation, we selected four data traces: (i) Brussels Bombing event that happened on March 22, 2016; (ii) Paris Terrorists Attack event that happened on Nov. 13, 2015; (iii) Oregon Umpqua Community College Shoot-ing event that happened on Oct. 1, 2015; and (iv) Baltimore Riots event that happened on April 14, 2015. These data traces were collected through Twitter X  X  open search API us-ing query terms and specified geographic regions related to the events [4]. The statistics of the four data traces are summarized in Table 4.
To evaluate our methods in real-world settings, we con-ducted the following data pre-processing steps:
Clustering : We use a K-means clustering algorithm and the Jaccard distance metric for micro-blog data clustering to cluster similar tweets into the same cluster [29]. In par-ticular, the Jaccard distance is defined as 1  X  A  X  B A  X  B and B represents the set of words that appear in two com-pared tweets respectively. Hence, the more common words two tweets share, the shorter Jaccard distance they have. We then take each Twitter user as a source and each cluster as a claim in our model described in Section 3.

Source-Mood Matrix and Source-Claim Matrix Genera-tion : we first generate the SM Matrix using the mood in-dicator (i.e., moody words) from the tweets. In particular, we collected a list of moody words (both positive and neg-ative) used in online social media [30]. If source S u reports the claim C k using a moody word in the tweet, the cor-responding element S u M k in SM matrix is set to 1. Simi-larly, if source S u reports claim C k without using any moody words, the corresponding element S u M k is set to  X  1. The el-ement S u M k is set to 0 when source S u did not report claim C . Second, we generate the SC Matrix by associating each source with the claims he/she reported. In particular, we set the element S u C k in SC matrix to 1 if source S u generates a tweet that belongs to claim (cluster) C k and 0 otherwise.
In our evaluation, we use the following metrics to evaluate the estimation performance of the MS-EM scheme: Preci-sion , Recall , F1-measure and Accuracy . Their definitions are given in Table 5.

In Table 5, T P , T N , F P and F N represents True Pos-itives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives respectively. We will further explain their meanings in the context of experiments carried out in the following subsec-tions.
In this subsection, we evaluate the performance of the proposed MS-EM scheme and compare them to the state-of-the-art truth discovery methods.
We first evaluate the capability of MS-EM scheme to cor-rectly identify the mood neutral claims from noisy data. We compared the MS-EM with several baselines. The first one is Voting : it assumes the mood neutrality of a claim is reflected by the number of times it is repeated: the more repetitions of a claim, the more likely it is mood neutral. The second baseline is the Mood Classifier : it considers a claim to be neutral if the claim doesn X  X  contain mood-sensitive words. The third baseline is the Sums [11]: it assumes a linear relationship between the source X  X  mood sensitivity and the claim X  X  mood. The last baseline is the TruthFinder [12]: it can estimate the mood neutrality of a claim using a heuristic based pesudo-probabilistic model.

In our evaluation, the outputs of the above schemes were manually graded to determine their performance on mood sensitive claim identification. Due to man-power limitations, we generated the evaluation set by taking the union of the top 50 neutral claims returned by each scheme to avoid pos-sible sampling bias towards any particular scheme. We col-lected the ground truth of the evaluation set using the fol-lowing rubric:
In our evaluation, the True Positives and True Negatives are the claims that are correctly classified by a particular scheme as mood neutral and mood sensitive respectively. The False Positives and False Negatives are the mood sensi-tive and mood neutral claims that are misclassified to each other respectively.

The evaluation results of Brussels Bombing data trace are shown in Table 6. We can observe that MS-EM outperforms the compared baselines in all evaluation metrics. The largest performance gain achieved by MS-EM on F1-measure and Data Trace Brussels Bombing Paris Attack Oregon Shooting Baltimore Riots Start Date Mar. 22 2016 Nov. 13 2015 Oct. 1 2015 April 14 2015 Time Duration 7 days 11 days 6 days 17 days # of Tweets 986,560 873,760 210,028 952,442 # of Users Tweeted 466,398 496,753 122,069 425,552 accuracy over the best performed baseline (i.e., Mood Classi-fier ) are 11% and 10% respectively. The results of Baltimore Riots dataset are also presented in Table 6. MS-EM contin-ues to outperform all baselines and the largest performance gain achieved by MS-EM on F1-measure and accuracy com-pared to the best performed baseline is 9% and 10% respec-tively. Similar results are observed in Oregon Shooting and Paris Attacks datasets presented in Table 6.
In this subsection, we evaluate the truth discovery per-formance of MS-EM scheme and compare it with the state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions that ignore the mood sensitive feature of claims. The baseline that stays closet to ours is Regular EM [3], which computes the claims X  truth-fulness and sources X  reliability in an iterative way and has been shown to outperform four fact-finding techniques in identifying truthful claims from social sensing data. The only difference is that Regular EM ignores the mood sensi-tivity of claims. Other baselines include TruthFinder [12], Sums [11] and Voting .

To incorporate both mood sensitivity and correctness of claims into our evaluation, we generalized the concept of a correct claim from the truth discovery problem to a valuable claim in the mood-sensitive truth discovery problem. In particular, a valuable claim is defined as a claim that is both correct and mood neutral. The valuable claims are the ones that are eventually useful in the decision making process. Similarly as the mood-sensitive identification evaluation, we generated the evaluation set by taking the union of the top 50 claims returned by different schemes. We collected the ground truth of the evaluation set using the following rubric:
The True Positives and True Negatives in this experiment are the claims that are correctly classified by a particular scheme as valuable and valueless ones respectively. The False Positives and False Negatives are the valueless and valuable claims that are misclassified to each other respec-tively.
 Figure 2: Truth Discovery Results on Brussels Bombing Dataset Figure 3: Truth Discovery Results on Baltimore Ri-ots Dataset Figure 4: Truth Discovery Results on Oregon Shoot-ing Dataset Figure 5: Truth Discovery Results on Paris Attack Dataset
The evaluation results of Brussels Bombing dataset are presented in Figure 2. We observe that the MS-EM scheme outperforms all baselines. Specifically, the largest perfor-mance gain achieved by MS-EM compared to the best per-formed baselines on precision, recall, F1-measure and ac-curacy is 13%, 16%, 20% and 19% respectively. The re-sults on Baltimore Riots dataset are shown in Figure 3. We observe that our MS-EM continues to outperform the com-pared baselines and the largest performance gain it achieved over the best performed baselines on precision, recall, F1-measure and accuracy is 12%, 12%, 14% and 20% respec-tively. The results on Oregon Shooting and Paris Attacks datasets are presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively. We observe consistent performance improvements achieved by the MS-EM compared to other baselines. The perfor-mance improvements are achieved by explicitly considering the mood sensitivity feature of truth discovery problem in social sensing, a main challenge addressed by this paper.
We also perform the convergence analysis of the MS-EM scheme and the results are presented in Figure 6. We observe the MS-EM scheme converges within a few iterations on all four data traces.
This paper develops a new principled approach to solve a mood sensitive truth discovery problem for reliable recom-mendation systems in social sensing applications. The new approach takes the mood sensitive features of both sources and claims into account in the truth discovery solutions. The proposed approach jointly estimates the mood sensitiv-ity and reliability of sources as well as the mood neutrality and correctness of claims using expectation maximization schemes. We evaluated our solution (i.e., MS-EM scheme) using four real world datasets collected from Twitter. The results demonstrated that our solution achieved significant performance gains in correctly identifying mood neutral and correct claims compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. These results are important to recommendation systems be-cause it gives us an analytical foundation to venture into the mood sensitive aspect of the truth discovery problem and enhance the credibility of information users of recom-mendation systems would receive.
