There is more and more evidence showing that there is a widespread and long-term trend toward warmer global temperatures [13]: (1) Heat waves and periods of unusually warm weather; (2) Ocean warming, rise in sea-level and coastal fl ooding; (3) Melting of glaciers; (4) Warming of the Arctic and the Antarctic.

The impact of global warming also includes spreading of disease, earlier spring arrival, plant and animal range shifts and population changes, coral reef bleaching, downpours, heavy snowfalls, fl ooding, droughts and fi res [13].

The global CO2 concentration, derived from measurements of CO2 concentration in air bubbles in the layered ice cores drilled in Antarctica and from atmospheric measurements, is considered to be one of the most important causes of global warming, and should be closely monitored, accurately forecasted, and controlled [21]. In addition, the range of the global CO2 concentration is also important, and the narrowest range should be determined so that the global CO2 concentration is neither over-estimated or under-estimated. However, forecasting the global CO2 concentration is not easy. Prentice et al. [23] forecasted the global CO2 concentration for the year 2100 after considering several scenarios, and their result ranged from 541 to 970 ppm.

The global CO2 concentration was highly uncertain in the past. In addition, it is dif fi cult to fi tthe distribution of the global CO2 concentration during a future period, which means that a stochastic approach might not be applicable [12]. A fuzzy approach is therefore proposed in this study. There are two viewpoints to forecasting global CO2 concentrations. The input-output relationship viewpoint, is to determine the economic, sociological, technological, and natural development factors (e.g. fossil fuel burning, deforestation, land-use change, etc.) that in fl uence global CO2 concentration, and then to model the relationship between the global CO2 concentration and these factors, and so forecast the future global CO2 concentration. The time-series viewpoint, is to treat the fl uctuation in the global CO2 concentration as a type of time series. Theoretically there are many approaches, e.g. moving average (MA), weighted moving average (WMA), exponential smoothing (ES), MLR, ANN, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and others that can be applied to forecast the global CO2 concentration. Generally, an ANN is suitable for modeling a short-term nonlinear pattern of the global CO2 concentration, while traditional approaches such as MA, WMA and ES provide good performances when the trend in the global CO2 concentration is stable. This study belongs to the second category.

For the precise and accurate forecasting of the global CO2 concentration, this study used the fuzzy linear regression (FLR) and back propagation network (BPN) approach.

FLR has been applied to various fi elds. Traditionally, there are two ways of solving an FLR problem: the linear programming method or the fuzzy least-squares method. The fi rst one attempts to minimize the averagefuzziness(e.g. Tanakaand Watada [25]) or to maximize the averagemembership (e.g. Peters [22]) given that the fuzzy forecast contains the actual value to a certain degree. Redden and Woodall [24] compared various FLR methods and discussed the differences between fuzzy and traditional regression approaches. Some researchers (e.g. Donoso et al. [15]) pointed out the weakness of Tanaka X  X  approach, which did not consider the optimization of the central tendency. In addition, Tanaka X  X  approach usually derived a high number of crisp estimates.

Our proposed methodology has four steps as described below: (1) Construct multiple FLR equations: At fi rst, multiple experts construct their own FLR equations (2) Fit each FLR equation by solving two nonlinear programming problems: Each FLR equation (3) Apply fuzzy intersection to combine the fuzzy forecasts: In the fi rst step, fuzzy intersection (4) Defuzzify the aggregation result with a back propagation network (BPN): After wards, considering
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed 3-step methodology. In section 3, the historical data of the global CO2 concentration are used to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. The accuracy and precision of the proposed methodology are evaluated and compared with those of some existing approaches. Based on the results of the analysis, some points are made. Finally, the concluding remarks and some directions for future research are given in Section 4. 2. The hybrid fuzzy-neural approach for global CO2 concentration forecasting
The proposed methodology consists of several steps that will be described in the following sections: (1) Pre-process the raw data. (2) Construct multip le FLR equations to generate the fuzzy global CO2 con centration forecasts. Each (3) Apply fuzzy intersection to combine the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts into a polygon-(4) Defuzzify the aggregation result with a BPN.

The system diagram of the proposed methodology is shown in Fig. 1. 2.1. Preprocess the raw data
The global CO2 concentration differs from month to month, and therefore the seasonality in the collected data must be removed before forecasting: 2.2. Construct mu ltiple FLR equations
In the proposed methodology multiple experts construct their own FLR equations to fo recast future global CO2 concentrations. where k indicates the period number; k = 0  X  K (the number of periods for which data was collected);  X  C fuzzy numbers (TFNs) then: The model is a FLR equation, which can be fi tted by solving the following linear programming problem, according to Tanaka X  X  FLR method [25]: subject to where 0 s 1; T is the number of periods; K indicates the number of moving periods. The objective function is to minimize the sum of the range/support of fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts. Constraints (5) and (6) request that the membership of the actual value in the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast has to be greater than or equal to s . Constraint (7) requests the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast to be non-negative. Constraint (9) shows the sequence of the three corners of a TFN.

There are other methods to convert the FLR equation, such as Peters X  fuzzy linear regression method [22] as described below.
 level is maximized instead, then the following linear programming problem can be constructed: subject to where d is the desired range of every fuzzy global CO2 concentrationforecast, which has to be determined in advance.

In either model, every fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast contains the actual value. As a result, the intersection of the two fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts generated by the two models also contains the actual value. Besides, the intersection has a narrower range than those of the two regions. Therefore, the forecasting precision measured in terms of the average range is indeed improved after intersection.

At the same time, some assumptions underlying the two models are made to simplify the calculation, and can be relaxed due to the popularity of optimization software such as Lingo: (1) The sensitivity to the uncertainty ( o l ): Minimizing a higher-order sum of the ranges theoretically (2) The desired range of every fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast ( d l ): The desired ranges by (4) The relative importance of the outliers of the sample data ( m l ): In both models, the range of every Taking these issues into account, this study proposes a hybrid fuzzy and neural approach for global CO2 concentration forecasting. The hybrid fuzzy and neural approach incorporates expert opinions about the four issues, and comprises the following two nonlinear programming models: (Model I) subject to (Model II) subject to where o l re fl ects the sensitivity of expert l to the uncertainty of the fuzzy global CO2 concentration required by expert l ;0 s l 1; d l is the desired range of every fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast expert l ; m l  X  Z + .When m l = 1, the relative importance of the outliers is the highest and is equal to in the variable is less than 1. Otherwise, it should be greater than 1.

If there are L experts, then after incorporating the experts X  opinions into the two nonlinear program-ming models there will be at most 2 L nonlinear programming problems to be solved. After solving each nonlinear programming problem, the optimal solution is used to construct a corresponding FLR equation. Eventually, there will be at most 2 L FLR equations, each of which generates a fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast. A mechanism is therefore required to combine these fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts. In the proposed methodology, a two-step combination mechanism is applied for the global CO2 concentration forecasting. 2.3. Apply fuzzy intersection to combine the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts into a
The aggregation mechanism consists of two steps. In the fi rst step, fuzzy intersection is applied to aggregate the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts into a polygon-shaped fuzzy number, in order to improve the precision of global CO2 concentration forecasting. Fuzzy intersection combines n fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts in the following manner: global CO2 concentration forecasts by L experts. If these fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts are approximated with triangular fuzzy numbers, then the fuzzy intersection is a polygon-shaped fuzzy number (see Fig. 2).

The result of this step is a polygon-shaped fuzzy number that speci fi es the narrowest range of the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast. However, in practical applications a crisp global CO2 concentration the polygon-shaped fuzzy number. For this purpose, a variety of defuzzi fi cation methods are applicable [20]. Once the defuzzi fi ed value is obtained it is compared with the actual global CO2 concentration to evaluate the accuracy. However, among the existing defuzzi fi cation methods, no one method is better variable is often chosen from the existing methods, and thus the optimality of the chosen method cannot be guaranteed. Also, the shape of the polygon-shaped fuzzy number is special. These phenomena are our reasons for proposing a tailored defuzzi fi cation method. In this study, a back propagation network is applied, because theoretically a well-trained back propagation network (without being stuck in a local minima) with a good selected topology can successfully map any complex distribution. 2.4. Construct a back propagation network to defuzzify the polygon-shaped fuzzy number
The con fi guration of the back propagation network used is established as follows: (1) Inputs: 2 m parameters corresponding to the m corners of the polygon-shaped fuzzy number and (2) Single hidden layer: Generally one or two hidden layers are more bene fi cial for the convergence (3) The number of neurons in the hidden layer is chosen from 1  X  4 m according to a preliminary (4) Output: the crisp global CO2 concentration forecast. (5) Network learning rule: Delta rule. (6) Network learning algorithms: There are many advanced algorithms for training a BPN, e.g. the (7) Number of epochs per replication: 60 000. (8) Activation function: The activation function of the hidden layer is a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (9) Number of initia l conditions/replications : Because the perfo rmance of a BPN is sensitive to A ten-fold evaluation process is applied to cross validate the data. That is, if there are R jobs then a ten-fold decompos ition process m akes each fold contain R/10 jobs. E ach fold is used to be the testing data and the remaining folds are merged as the training data. 3. Data collection and analyses
To demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology, the real data of the global CO2 concen-tration from 2005 X 2009 were used [14] (see Fig. 4). The raw data contained 14 columns and 60 rows. There was obvious some s easonality in the original d ata, which was removed according to Eq. (1).
Three experts were asked to submit their opinions about the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts, which are summarized in Table 1. These experts X  opinions were considered unequally important. To determine the relative importance of each expert X  X  opinions, the mutual assessmentprocedure established in Chen and Lin [7] was applied. The process and fi nal results are summarized in Table 2. There were six nonlinear programming problems to be solved. From the optimization result of each nonlinear programming problem, a corresponding FLR equation could be constructed. All six FLR equations were applied to forecast the global CO2 concentration. Subsequently, the fuzzy intersection of the forecasting results was obtained, which was a polygon-shaped fuzzy number for each period. The data of the corners of all polygon-shaped fuzzy numbers, i.e. the aggregated fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts, were used to train and/or test the back propagation network defuzzi fi er. The 4-fold cross-validation was then adopted again. Finally, the back propagation network was applied to defuzzify the polygon-shaped fuzzy number input to the network to generate the representative value, i.e. the crisp global CO2 concentration forecast.

In the experiment, the expert opinions were stored into the expert opinions database which was constructed using Microsoft Excel 2003. The Optimization Toolbox of MATLAB 2006a was applied to solve the nonlinear programming problems. To exchange and synchronize the data between the expert opinions database and the optimizer, the Excel Link add-in of MATLAB was used, which communicates between the Excel workspace and the MATLAB workspace and positions Excel as a front end to MATLAB. Finally, the Neural Network Toolbox of MATLAB 2006a was applied to implement the back propagation network defuzzi fi cation approach. The forecasting accuracy was measured with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. For fac ilitating the application of the proposed methodology, two MATLAB programs were used, as shown in Figs 5 and 6, for solving the nonlinear programming problems and for training the back propagation network defuzzi fi er, respectively.

At the same time, the forecasting precision of a non-biased crisp approach can be measured with 6 (or 6 RMSE), because theoretically the probability th at such an interval cont ains the actual value is about 99.7%, based on the assumption that residuals follow a normal distribution. The precision of a fuzzy approach can be measured with the average spread (or range) of fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts if all of them contain the actual value.

To make a comparison with some existing approaches, MA, ES, BPN, ARIMA, Tanaka X  X  FLR ap-proach, and Peters X  FLR approach were applied to the collected data. In MA, various numbers of moving periods (from 10 to 2 step  X  1) were tried. Among them, the best one was chosen for the subsequent analysis. The number of inputs in BPN was determined in a similar way. In ES, the value of the smoothing constant changed from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0.1, and then the value that contributed to the best accuracy was adopted. In ARIMA, there are three stages: model identi fi cation, model estimation, and model checking. The minimum information criterion (MINIC) method was used to identify the order in the ARIMA process. The augmented dickey fuller (ADF) unit root tests were used to test the stationarity and seasonal stationarity in the global CO2 concentration data. In the BPN approach, there was one hidden layer with nodes twice as many as that of the inputs. The number of epochs was set to 60 000. In addition, the initial values of all parameters in the BPN were randomly generated 100 times. Among them, the best setting was kept for the subsequent analysis. A 4-fold evaluation process was applied to cross-validate the data. In the FLR approaches of Tanaka and Peters, a fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecast is defuzzi fi ed with the center-of-gravity (COG) formula: The accuracy and precision achieved by applying these approaches were recorded and compared in Figs 7 X 10.

MA was adopted as the comparison basis. The experiment provided the following results, (1) The accuracy of global CO2 concentration forecasting, measured in terms of RMSE, of the (2) Among the fuzzy approaches, the proposed methodology surpassed the two traditional FLR (3) ES outperformed MA because there was an obvious (upward) trend in the collected data. (4) The accuracy of the nonlinear approach BPN was poor because it could over-react when there was (5) As expected, the forecasting accuracy of ARIMA was also very good and quite close to that of the (6) On the other hand, the precision of the proposed methodology was signi fi cantly better than those (7) The advantage of the proposed methodology came from two sources. First, it was shown to
To further validate the performance of the proposed methodology, it was applied to the book-to-bill ratio in the semiconductor industry. According to our experimental results, the proposed methodolo-gy improved both the precision and the accuracy of book-to-bill ratio forecasting by 21% and 81%, respectively. 4. Conclusions and directions for future research
Forecasting the future global CO2 concentration is a crucial task. To this end, a FLR-BPN approach was proposed in this study. In the proposed methodol ogy, multiple experts construct their own FLR equations from various viewpoints to forecast future global CO2 concentrations. Each FLR equation can be fi tted with two equivalent nonlinear programming problems to be solved. To combine the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts by different experts, a two-step aggregation mechanism is applied. In the fi rst step, fuzzy intersection is applied to combine the fuzzy global CO2 concentration forecasts into a polygon-shaped fuzzy number, in order to improve the precision of global CO2 concentration forecasting. The polygon-shaped fuzzy number contains the actual value. Afterwards, taking into consideration the special shape of the polygon-shaped fuzzy number, a BPN is constructed to defuzzify the polygon-shaped fuzzy number and to generate a representative/crisp value, to enhance the accuracy.
A practical case containing the historical data of the global CO2 concentration was used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. The results of the experiment were as follows. (1) The forecasting accuracy (measured in terms of MAE, MAPE, or RMSE) of the proposed method-(2) At the same time, the proposed methodology outperformed the existing approaches in forecasting (3) Combining the opinions of multiple experts signi fi cantly enhanced the accuracy and precision of
Conversely, there are some disadvantages associated with the proposed methodology: (1) Compared with some existing approaches, more data are required with the proposed methodology (2) It takes more time to develop the program codes for the proposed methodology than for the other
More sophisticated global CO2 concentration forecasting approaches can be developed in similar ways in future studies. The proposed methodology is a general approach like Takagi-Sugeno X  X  fuzzy inference system and Mamdani X  X  fuzzy inference system, and can be applied to forecast any phenomena in various competitiveness for ecasting [2,18], defect and yield analysis [ 17], and others. Howev er, domain experts must be asked to give their opinions in the proposed methodology, so that the fuzzy forecasts obtained can satisfy the requirements of these experts. Nevertheless, in case that there are no domain experts to consult, there is always the alternative of forming a committee of  X  X irtual experts X  for providing opinion sets for the proposed methodology. This doesn X  X  mean that opinion sets can be randomly generated, because impractical opinion sets might result in no feasible solutions of the nonlinear programming problems or increase the dif fi culty to fi nd the optimal solution.
