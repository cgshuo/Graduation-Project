 We present WAP MEAD, a WAP-enabled text summarization system. It incorporates a state-of-the art text summarizer enhanced to produce hierarchical summaries that are appropriate for various types of mobile devices, including cellular phones. H.3.3 [ Information search and retrieval ]: Question Answering and Text Summarization Keywords : Hierarchical summarization, mobile devices Displaying textual documents on the screens of cellular phones is problematic for several reasons. First, bandwidth to such devices costs significantly more than to networked computers, and, second, the screens of mobile devices are much smaller than computer screens. The traditional approach to such problems has been to use text summarization [1,2]. Text summarization for mobile devices has been also attempted before [3]. We will demonstrate a novel method for summarization for mobile devices that does not require the input documents be in HTML but instead, infers a hierarchical structure automatically. Hierarchical Summarization (HS) operates in two stages. First, it identifies the salience of each sentence in a document and ranks the sentences accordingly. Sec ond, it builds a tree of all sentences such that its root is the sentence with the highest salience and, given any sentence node with salience s at depth d , all sentences above that depth have salience higher than s , while the salience of the rest of the sentences is below s . To compute the salience of a sentence, a linear combination of four features is used: Centroid (how similar a sentence is to the overall document), Position, Length, and SimWithFirst (how similar the sentence is to the first sentence of the document, often the title or headline of the document).
