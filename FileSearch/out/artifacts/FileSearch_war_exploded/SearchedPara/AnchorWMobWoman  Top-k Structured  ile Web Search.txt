 With advances in technology, mobile handheld PDAs X  X ave become very popular. In many r e users want to find structuring information u s devices, which are convenient to use but have resources. In this paper, we present a top-k struc search engine. It uses a top-k adaptable searc h utilizes hierarchical structure of hypermedia obj look for structuring information from the mobil e engine, which is implemented in the mo b provides users with top-k adaptive Web search for mobile handheld devices.

We develop a top-k struc t search engine, called AnchorWoman ( anchorWoman/default.aspx), to conduct this ty p engine provides adaptive navigation and adap may be changed according to some kinds o f models. Moreover, the engine filters out unne c to a Webpage according to its hierarchical str u relieve mobile resource limitation. Our top-k structured mobile Web search engin e key modules: the Web-tree determination mo The result is a reduced dynamic search tree, which we call a top-k adaptive search tree . Such a top-k tree is then used to recommend search directions to the MC. For instance, the TEM returns information on  X  X nterrelated X  Web hypermedia objects to the MC via the user interface. We implemented the mobile Web search engine on Pocket PC based on Windows. The implementation environment is Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK (Standard Development Kit) for Pocket PC, test the application software targeting Windows Mobile 5.0-based Pocket PC devices. In addition, we used ActiveSync 4.0 to synchronize data between Windows XP Professional and Pocket PC devices. Adaptive search mechanism for hyperlinked objects is elucidated assume that the current location of a user for a Web site is given by selecting a Web hypermedia object from a returned ranked list or user input. Detailed explanations are as follows. URL decision: A PDA user submits a search query with the keywords (e.g.,  X  X EEE Web education X ) to a search engine, which The selected URL (i.e., the selected Web hypermedia object) becomes the root URL of mobile Web search domain and the changed dynamically wherever the user selects the current URL as the root. Step 1: The Web-tree determination module (WDM) of our mobile Web search engine defines the structured search domain. Specifically, with the user-selected root URL, the WDM a set of URLs that include the root URL and all the other URLs in the Web site that can be reachable from the root URL via directed connecting these URLs. Web hypermedia objects and their corresponding URL-ids are include d in the resulting structured mobile Web search domain for the selected root URL. Step 2: The weight measure module (WMM) of our mobile Web search engine computes arc weights of the directed domain graph for the selected root URL. Step 3: With the directed domain graph constructed in Step 1 and the arc weights computed in Step 2, the top-k enumeration module (TEM) finds the best rooted directed spanning tree (i.e., the optimal adaptive search tree using the mobile Web structuring model). Figure 2 shows some portions of the best rooted directed spanning tree. contains nodes representing the five most relevant URLs. The
