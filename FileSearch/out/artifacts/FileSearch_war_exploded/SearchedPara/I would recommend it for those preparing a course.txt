I would recommend it for those preparing a course on data mining as a reference to the broad field and orientation to other sources. With the exception of Web usage mining, researchers working on general
Web data mining issues will also find it helpful. A Web site (http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/mining-the-web/) is available with supporting materials and errata.
 Mike Thelwall, Link Analysis: An Information Science Approach, 2004, Elsevier Academic Press, 269 pp., ISBN: 0-12-088553-0, $70
The Web emerged about fifteen years ago and has become one of the main information sources in the developed world. Documents on the Web not only provide information, but the underlying hypertext pro-tocol allows authors to easily create links to other pieces of information residing on the Web. Thus, doc-uments and links are the two major  X  X  X ngredients X  X  of the Web. Web links have been heavily studied by the computer science community in order to understand the structure and growth patterns of the Web and they are currently also one of the parameters in the ranking algorithms of most search engines. This book de-parts from the usual computer science approach and discusses the value of studying links for information and social science research.

The book has twenty-six chapters, divided into six parts. The first part provides the theoretical back-ground for the rest of the book and defines what is meant by  X  X  X nformation science approach to link ana-lysis X  X  in the context of the book. The author views it as nine step method comprised of: a research question; a pilot study; identification of appropriate web pages; collecting link data; data cleansing; link count val-idation; interpretation of results; and reporting the results and limitations of the study. Methodological issues related to sample size, data validation, and careful interpretation of relationships ( X  X  X eport results, remembering that correlation does not prove causation X  X , p. 42) are emphasized throughout the book. This part also includes a clear, non-technical description of web crawling, introduces different link counting models and the use of correlation tests for interpreting link counts.

The second part discusses the structure of the Web; provides an overview of growth models and topol-ogies of the Web based on the computer science approach. Another objective of this part is to demonstrate the relationship between web links and topics X  X his goal is achieved by exploring the content structure of the Web.

The topic of the third part is the academic Web and is largely based on the extensive studies carried out by Mike Thelwall and his collaborators, but results of other studies are reported as well. This part covers page and link types; the relationships between incoming link counts in the different models introduced in part one and traditional research indicators (e.g., grants, funding and national peer review), the relationship between geographic distances within a country and link counts; national versus international links; linguis-tic influences; disciplinary differences and linking to journal websites.
Part four covers a variety of topics not discussed in the previous sections. The first chapter in this section focuses on search engine design and of ranking algorithms. It provides examples with step-by-step expla-nations of the PageRank and the HITS algorithms used for ranking of search engine results. This chapter together with the chapter on crawling in the introductory part presents an excellent overview of search en-gine architecture. The other chapters in this part cover a study of Spanish universities, a characterization of linking from personal web pages to university sites, the use of network diagrams in academic webs and a short chapter on business web sites.

The fifth part is one of the highlights of the book, especially for students and researchers who wish to apply the techniques introduced in the previous parts. First, it discusses the use and limitations of commer-cial search engines for link analysis research, then it introduces SocSciBot and the tools associated with it X  a personal crawler developed by Mike Thelwall. The crawler and the associated tools are freely available from http://socscibot.wlv.ac.uk; both the site and the appendix of the book contain SocSciBot tutorials to help potential users. In addition, one can also use the data already collected by the crawler. The database of crawls can be accessed at http://cybermetrics.wlv.ac.uk/database and the structure of the database is explained in the book. Currently the site has nineteen databases with link data for UK, New Zealand, Aus-tralian, Chinese, Taiwanese and Spanish universities. This part also introduces social network analysis and network visualization techniques. The online component of the book (http://linkanalysis.wlv.ac.uk/ index.html) has instructions for creating visualizations of SocSciBot data with the freely available
Pajek network analysis tool (http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek). Finally there is a short sum-mary of the currently defined academic Web indicators, most of them already introduced in previous chapters.

Mike Thelwall and his collaborators have published a large number of papers related to link analysis, mainly in the academic setting. Parts of the book are based on these previous studies, but the  X  X  X hole is greater than the sum of its parts X  X , since the book provides an insight to Mike Thelwall  X  s view on link ana-lysis as a whole. One of the strengths of the book is that it emphasizes the limitations of such studies, and methodological issues related to the need for data cleansing, data validation and to careful interpretation of the results. The chapters on crawling, link structure and ranking can be well used in information retrieval courses for information science students.

The book also provides practical information about the use of the SocSciBot tool and database and about the Pajek visualization tool. It provides an easily understandable starting point for researchers and students wishing to study Web links and invites them to try to use the tools developed by the author and to join the group of people researching the topic. The book is also valuable for readers who do not plan to actively carry out research projects in this area; since it gives an easily readable overview of the results achieved so far and of research trends based on the information science approach to link analysis. I highly recommend the book X  X ersonally I enjoyed reading it very much.
