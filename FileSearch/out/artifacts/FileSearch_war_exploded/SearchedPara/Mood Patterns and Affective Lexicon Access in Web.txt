 Social media provides communication and inter-action channels where users can freely participate in, express their opinions, make their own content, and interact with other users. Users in this new media are more comfortable in expressing their feelings, opinions, and ideas. Thus, the resulting user-generated content tends to be more subjec-tive than other written genres, and thus, is more appealing to be investigated in terms of subjec-tivity and sentiment analysis. Research in senti-ment analysis has recently attracted much atten-tion (Pang and Lee, 2008), but modeling emotion patterns and studying the affective lexicon used in social media have received little attention.
Work in sentiment analysis in social media is often limited to finding the sentiment sign in the dipole pattern (negative/positive) for given text. Extensions to this task include the three-class clas-sification (adding neutral to the polarity) and lo-cating the value of emotion the text carries across a spectrum of valence scores. On the other hand, it is well appreciated by psychologists that sen-timent has much richer structures than the afore-mentioned simplified polarity. For example, emo-tion  X  a form of expressive sentiment  X  was sug-gested by psychologists to be measured in terms of valence and arousal (Russell, 2009). Thus, we are motivated to analyze the sentiment in blogo-sphere in a more fine-grained fashion. In this pa-per we study the grouping behaviors of the emo-tion, or emotion patterns, expressed in the blog-posts. We are inspired to get insights into the ques-tion of whether these structures can be discovered directly from data without the cost of involving human participants as in traditional psychological studies. Next, we aim to study the relationship be-tween the data-driven emotion structures discov-ered and those proposed by psychologists.

Work on the analysis of effects of sentiment on lexical access is great in a psychology perspective. However, to our knowledge, limited work exists to examine the same tasks in social media context.
The contribution in this paper is twofold. To our understanding, we study a novel problem of emotion-based pattern discovery in blogosphere. We provide an initial solution for the matter us-ing a combination of psychological models, affec-tive norm scores for English words, a novel feature representation scheme, and a nonparametric clus-tering to automatically group moods into mean-ingful emotion patterns. We believe that we are the first to consider the matter of data-driven emo-tion pattern discovery at the scale presented in this paper. Secondly, we explore a novel problem of detecting the mood  X  affective lexicon usage cor-relation in the new media, and propose a novel use of a term-goodness criterion to discover this senti-ment  X  linguistic association. Much work in sentiment analysis measures the value of emotion the text convey in a continuum range of valence (Pang and Lee, 2008). Emo-tion patterns have often been used in sentiment analysis limited to this one-dimensional formu-lation. On the other hand, in psychology, emo-tions have often been represented in dimensional and discrete perspectives. In the former, emo-tion states are conceptualized as combinations of some factors like valence and arousal. In con-trast, the latter style argues that each emotion has a unique coincidence of experience, psychol-ogy and behavior (Mauss and Robinson, 2009). Our work utilizes the dimensional representation, and in particular, the core-affect model (Russell, 2009), which encodes emotion states along the valence and arousal dimensions. The sentiment scoring for emotion bearing words is available in a lexicon known as Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) (Bradley and Lang, 1999). Re-lated work making use of ANEW includes (Dodds and Danforth, 2009) for estimating happiness lev-els in three types of data: song lyrics, blogs, and the State of the Union addresses.

From a psychological perspective, for estimat-ing mood effects in lexicon decisions, (Chastain et al., 1995) investigates the influence of moods on the access of affective words. For learning affect in blogosphere, (Leshed and Kaye, 2006) utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict moods for coming blog posts and detect mood synonymy. 3.1 Mood Pattern Detection Livejournal provides a comprehensive set of 132 moods for users to tag their moods when blogging. The provided moods range diversely in the emo-tion spectrum but typically are observed to fall into soft clusters such as happiness ( cheerful or grate-ful ) or sadness (discontent or uncomfortable) . We call each cluster of these moods an emotion pat-tern and aim to detect them in this paper.

We observe that the blogposts tagged with moods in the same emotion pattern have similar Figure 1: ANEW usage proportion in the posts tagged with happy / cheerful and angry / p*ssed off proportions in the usage of ANEW. For example, in Figure 1  X  a plot of the usage of ANEW hav-ing arousal in the range of 7.2  X  8.2 in the blog-posts  X  we could see that the ANEW usage pat-terns of happy/cheerful and angry/p*ssed off are well separated. Anger , enraged , and rage will be most likely found in the angry/p*ssed off tagged posts and least likely found in the happy/cheerful ones. In contrast, the ANEW as romantic or sur-prised are not commonly used in the posts tagged with angry/p*ssed off but most popularly used in the happy/cheerful ones; suggesting that, the sim-ilarity between ANEW usage patterns can be used as a basis to study the structure of mood space.
Let us denote by B the corpus of all blogposts and by M = { sad, happy , ...} the predefined set of moods ( |M| = 132 ). Each blogpost b  X  B in the corpus is labeled with a mood l b  X  M . De-note by n the number of ANEW ( n = 1034 ). Let senting the usage of ANEW by the mood m . Thus, of the ANEW i -th occurrence in the blogpost b tagged with the mood m . The usage vector is nor-malized so that To discover the grouping of the moods based on the usage vectors we use a nonparametric cluster-ing algorithm known as Affinity Propagation (AP) (Frey and Dueck, 2007). AP is desirable here because it automatically discovers the number of clusters as well as the cluster exemplars. The al-gorithm only requires the pairwise similarities be-tween moods, which we compute based on the Eu-clidean distances for simplicity.

To map the emotion patterns detected to their psychological meaning, we proceed to measure the sentiment scores of those |M| mood words. In particular, we use ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999), which is a set of 1034 sentiment convey-ing English words. The valence and arousal of moods are assigned by those of the same words in the ANEW lexicon. For those moods which are not in ANEW, their values are assigned by those of the nearest father words in the mood hierarchi-meaning, to some extent, are in the same level of the tree. Thus, each member of the mood clusters can be placed onto the a 2D representation along the valence and arousal dimensions, making it fea-sible to compare with the core-affect model (Rus-sell, 2009) theorized by psychologists. 3.2 Mood and ANEW Usage Association To study the statistical strength of an ANEW word with respect to a particular mood, the information gain measure (Mitchell, 1997) is adopted. Given a collection of blog posts B consisting of those tagged or not tagged with a target class attribute mood m . The entropy of B relative to this binary classification is where p  X  and p are the proportions of the posts tagged and not tagged with m respectively.
The entropy of B relative to the binary classifi-cation given a binary attribute A (e.g. if the word A present or not) observed is computed as where B  X  is the subset of B for which attribute A is present in the corpus and B is the subset of B for which attribute A is absent in the corpus.
The information gain of an attribute ANEW A in classifying the collection with respect to the target class attribute mood m , IG ( m, A ) , is the reduction in entropy caused by partitioning the examples ac-cording to the attribute A . Thus,
With respect to a given mood m , those ANEW having high information gain are considered likely to be associated with the mood. This measure, also often considered a term-goodness criterion, out-performs others in feature selection in text cate-gorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997). 4.1 Mood Patterns We use a large Livejournal blogpost dataset, which contains more than 17 million blogposts tagged with the predefined moods. These journals were posted from May 1, 2001 to April 23, 2005. The ANEW usage vectors of all moods are subjected to a clustering to learn emotion patterns. After run-ning the Affinity Propagation algorithm, 16 pat-terns of moods are clustered as below (the moods in upper case are the exemplars).
Generally, the patterns 1 X 7 contain moods in high valence (pleasure) and the patterns 8 X 16 in-clude mood in low valence (displeasure). To ex-amine whether members in these emotion patterns Figure 4: Discovered emotion patterns in the af-fect circle follow an affect concept, we place them on the af-fect circle (Russell, 2009). We learn that nearly all members in the same patterns express a com-mon affect concept. Those moods in the patterns with cheerful , pensive , and rejuvenated as the ex-emplars are mostly located in the first quarter of the affect circle ( 0 0  X  90 0 ), which should contain moods being high in both pleasure and activation measures. Meanwhile, many members of the an-gry and aggravated patterns are found in the sec-ond quarter ( 90 0  X  180 0 ), which roughly means that those moods express the feeling of sadness in the high of activation. The patterns with the ex-emplars nauseated and tired contain a majority of moods found in the third quarter ( 180 0  X  270 0 ), which could be representatives for the mood fash-ion of sadness and deactivation. In addition, the grateful group could be a representative for moods which are both low in pleasure and in the degree of activation ( 270 0  X  360 0 of the affect circle). Thus, the clustering process based on the ANEW usage could separate moods having similar affect scores into corresponding segments in the circle proposed in (Russell, 2009).

To visualize mood patterns that have been de-tected, we plot these emotion modes on the affect circle plane in Figure 4. For each pattern, the va-lence and arousal are computed by averaging of the values of those moods in the quarter where most of the members in the pattern are.

To further visualize the similarity of moods, the ANEW usage vectors are subject to a classi-cal multidimensional scaling (Borg and Groenen,
Cheerful
P*ssed
Gloomy 2005) (MDS) and a hierarchical clustering. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show views of the distance between moods, based on the Euclidean measure of their corresponding ANEW usage, using MDS and hi-erarchical clustering respectively. 4.2 Mood and ANEW Association Based on the IG values between moods and ANEW, we learn the correlation of moods and the affective lexicon. With respect to a given mood, those ANEW having high information gain are most likely to be found in the blogposts tagged with the mood. The ANEW most likely happened in the blogposts tagged with a given mood are shown in Table 1a; the most likely moods for the blog posts containing a given ANEW are shown in Table 1b.

The ANEW used in the blog posts tagged with moods in the same pattern are more similar than those in the posts tagged with moods in different patterns. In Table 1a, the most associated ANEW Figure 5: Top 100 ANEW words used in the dataset in the blogposts tagged with cheerful are more similar to those in happy ones than those in angry or p*ssed off ones.

For a given mood, a majority of the ANEW used in the blog posts tagged with the mood is similar in the valence with the mood. The occurrence of some ANEW having valence much different with the tagging mood, e.g. the ANEW hate in the posts tagged with cheerful or happy moods, might be the result of a negation construction used in the text or of other context.

For a given ANEW, the most likely moods tagged to the blog posts containing the word are similar with the word in the affective scores. In addition, the least likely moods are much differ-ent with the ANEW in the affect measure. A plot of top ANEWs used in the blogposts is shown in Figure 5.

Other than the ANEW conveying abstract con-cept, e.g. desire or anger , those ANEW expressing more concrete existence, e.g. terrorist or accident , might be a good source for learning opinions from social network towards the things. In the corpus, the posts containing the ANEW terrorist are most likely tagged with angry or cynical moods. Also, the posts containing the ANEW accident are most likely tagged with bored and sore moods. We have investigated the problems of emotion-based pattern discovery and mood  X  affective lex-icon usage correlation detection in blogosphere. We presented a method for feature representation based on the affective norms of English scores us-age. We then presented an unsupervised approach using Affinity Propagation, a nonparametric clus-tering algorithm that does not require the number of clusters a priori, for detecting emotion patterns in blogosphere. The results are showing that those automatically discovered patterns match well with the core-affect model for emotion, which is inde-pendently formulated in the psychology literature. In addition, we proposed a novel use of a term-goodness criterion to discover mood X  X exicon cor-relation in blogosphere, giving hints on predicting moods based on the affective lexicon usage and vice versa in the social media. Our results could also have potential uses in sentiment-aware social media applications.

Future work will take into account the temporal dimension to trace changes in mood patterns over time in blogosphere. Another direction is to inte-grate negation information to learn more cohesive association in affect scores between moods and af-fective words. In addition, a new affective lexicon could be automatically detected based on learning correlation of the blog text and the moods tagged.
