 . This article is a summary of the panel held at the 9 th International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: KDD-03 on August 27, 2003 in Washington, D.C. The panel pa rticipants included the following: The goal of the panel was to gather representatives from academia and industry and to ponder where the field stands a fter nearly a decade and a half of KDD meetings. We all have seen a significant growth in demand for data mining techno logy driven by a glut in data. We have observed data mining gro wing as a healthy research community. However, we still strug gle on two important fronts: the scientific and the commercial . On the scientific front, Data Mining still needs to reach a stronger level of attracting steady contributions from the related fields. On the commercial fronts, the huge opportunity has not yet been met with adequate tools and solutions. This panel was an att empt to address the possible future directions for Data Mining and KDD. Questions that the panelists considered prior to th is panel included: Will we continue a healthy evolution to b eing a scientific field of study with a healthy contributi ng community? Will we go more down the path of systems and engine ering? What are the next challenge problems? What are the miles tones that define healthy growth and significant advances? Is data mining destined to continue to be a visible area of focus and research, or will it evolve towards embedded technology studied as part of other systems? The presence of a significant set of research challenge problems against which measurable progres s can be made is a crucial component for the growth of a sci entific field. What will these challenge problems be for KDD and D ata Mining over the next 10 years and beyond? Below is a summary of views of the panelists. We fo llow it with a summary of some of the topics discussed during the panel. The field is still vibrant, and the level of intere st in it seems to be increasing dramatically, but many serious challenge s lie ahead of us. My biggest fear about the field is the slow pac e at which we are seriously engaging researchers from different f ields. This is perhaps normal in the beginning, but I worry whethe r we have what it takes to change it in the future. I think that the biggest stumbling block from the scientific perspective is the lack of a fundamental theory or a clear and well-understood statement of problems and challenges. Th is situation from practitioners and people interested in applica tions. These folks come from a large variety of folks. But witho ut the scientific foundation and the continued academic progress, the field cannot grow and solidify. Some of the other worries I have, as a data miner, revolve around the following observations: Let me expand on this last point regarding the envi ronment. The growth in storage and advances in hardware are what is driving demand for data mining, and unfortunately not our g reat success as a field. Stored data seems to double every 9 mon ths, growing twice as fast as the infamous Moore's Law, and this makes demand for data mining and reduction tools increase exponentially, However, areas of particular concern include: On the positive side, I see many applications and I see many companies recognizing the pain associated with doin g data mining and trying to make the process easier. The market i s growing because data sets are growing. If we effectively de velop the science of data mining, tools, companies, products, and services will emerge to do it right because the market is th ere. A list of grand challenges for data mining is impor tant and should be developed. Primarily, we need these challenges o n the scientific level. There are plenty of applications and challenges on the applications side. A list of these grand challe nge problems, at least in my opinion, is a high priority for the fie ld. One such initial proposal for a set of Grand Challe nges in the field is provided in the Editorial to this issue of SIGKDD Explorations. The most significant technical development of the l ast 10 years was clearly the World Wide Web. It ushered a new e ra in communication and processing information, dramatica lly increased the rate of information growth, and creat ed many new fields, including web mining, with its own subfield s of web content mining, web usage mining, search engines, b ots and intelligent agents. After the excitement and growth of 1990-s, followed by dot-com hype and bust period of 1999-2001, the data mining field is reaching a plateau of maturity. We can see it in a ttendance in conferences and state of health of data mining rela ted companies. One indicator, the number of subscribers to KDnugge ts (the leading newsletter on Data Mining), has been growi ng fast in 1996-2001, but remained essentially flat in 2002-20 03. This plateau, however, is likely to produce new growth i n several areas. The few e-commerce companies that have survived the dot-com crash and are doing well, such as Amazon, eBay, and Google, all have active data and web mining programs and are hi ring data mining experts. Here are some of the technical grand challenges for data mining today: 1) "Drop-in" classification. Drop in data set(s) and system produces a good classifier (including data preparat ion) level 1: for one domain level 2: for 3 different domains, e.g. banking, gen omics, fraud detection 2) "What's New and Different" report. What is new in this data compared to past data, past knowledge, past expecta tions? Good progress on this topic was made recently with WSARE system (Wong et al, 2003) 3) A General Theory of "Interestingness". What makes this rule, pattern, finding more interesting than anothe r? Many theories have been proposed here, including objecti ve statistical measures of validity and surprise, and subjective m easures based on user preferences and domain knowledge. However, no general theory has emerged yet. Perhaps, one part of the pr oblem is that what is interesting is intimately tied to domain kn owledge and domain, and instead of one general theory we may fi nd that dozens of little theories would be adequate.
 From a social point of view, the hottest technology and society topic in 2003 year was the controversy over the US government efforts in using data mining for anti-terror activi ties. While data mining has been just one component of those activit ies, the press frequently used "data mining" when used in press ha s been mostly associated with the unfortunately named Total (late r Terrorist) Information Awareness (TIA) program,. See (headline from PC World: PC World, July 18, 2003: Senate Kills Data M ining Program www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,111626,00.asp ; Washington Times, July 18, 2003: Senate votes no to data mining funds http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20030 718-070600-8337r.htm ) Even though Congress has closed TIA, we have not se en the end of this controversy, because there is an inherent t ension between intelligence agencies that see an effective tool in data mining-based application and civil liberties advocates who see only an invasion of privacy. Too often we have seen a very naive criticism of su ch programs, e.g. if there are 5% errors in data, and 300 millio n Americans, then there would be 15 million (=5%*300 million) of false positives. Such criticism ignores the power of rep eated observations and link analysis in reducing false po sitives to acceptable level. People are willing to accept false positives identi fications and some invasion of privacy if they believe that this helps reduce the have removed their shoes and all of them were false positive. Yet few complained about that obvious erosion of privac y (e.g. a hole in a sock was revealed), because most accept shoe i nspections as a way to prevent another shoe-bomber. In addition, there are a number of technical soluti ons for preserving privacy while data mining, such as rando mizing results, removing identifying information, etc (See Technological Solutions for Protecting Privacy, Roberto J. Bayard o, Ramakrishnan Srikant, IEEE Computer, Sep 2003) I believe that it is important to take a balanced view of this issue and consider potential effectiveness of analytic pr ograms and weigh potential benefits versus erosion in privacy.
 Hot applications for data mining next 10 years: Finally, I expect the social issues of data mining, threat detection and privacy will remain a significant concern for d ata miners and for the society at large, The challenges and opportunities facing the data mi ning community are greater than ever, yet it is very dif ficult to claim that the effort has yielded much success. Even wors e, the pejorative connotation that data mining had in stat istics (it ain't science) is now almost universally held in society (tools to invade my privacy). long term, another threat needs to be addressed, na mely the fickleness of the research community. There are, to varying degrees of activity, several emerging fields that a re inherently data mining activities, e.g., discovery informatics and network forensics. These have the potential to peel off lea ding researchers from the data mining field, and more importantly, a ttract the best new researchers. There is the very real possibility that data mining will go the route of expert systems some twenty yea rs ago as the community jumped onto the neural networks bandwagon (gravy train). KDD has a history of being very inclusive, and long -term viability will depend on this model even more in the coming y ears. The field needs to be perceived by the research communi ty as vibrant, exciting, leading edge, and fun. But history contai ns many sad stories of what happens to leaders that are no long er perceived to lead. KDD should take note lest we become a mere fo otnote in the march toward fully realizing the goals of knowledge discovery and data mining. Data mining has several challenges and opportunitie s ahead of it, and I'll bring up some that I think are important, but with no claim that these are the most important issues. My crysta l ball is a little cloudy... I see three distinct kinds of challenges: Technical , social, and economic. The technical challenges consist of iden tifying interesting research thrusts that keep the field vi gorous and moving in high-payoff directions. The social challe nges consist of how to rise beyond the perception that we primarily enable junk mail and other, more serious, intrusions of privacy . The economic challenges consist of making the field pay for itse lf, and achieving widespread recognition of this fact. We are at a c ross roads where the initial enthusiasm has steadied, and these chal lenges are squarely in front of us. The technical challenges that I plan to highlight a re: The social and economic challenges are closely rela ted---if we can enable significant use of data mining techniques th at are seen as positive applications of the technology, and that g enerate significant revenue, we're in good shape. If not, w e have a problem. Can KDD researchers directly influence thi s aspect of the field? We need to consider this, and take concr ete steps in our research, our outreach, and our peer review process . While these are "soft" considerations that we as engineers and scientists often feel uncomfortable quantifying (which means "evalua ting", for most of us!), these are nonetheless difficult chall enges that will have a much bigger impact on the field than almost any technical difficulties that we face. A casual surfing of the web yielded two extreme vie ws of the KDD field. One vendor declared (1997)  X  X DD is obso lete. X  In the other (1998) Arno Penzias claimed that  X  X f you are not doing KDD, you are out of business. X  I suppose the truth of the state of KDD lies somewhere in between. Here is my assessme nt of  X  X DD: Past, present, and future. X  KDD started out to be an application-driven multi-d isciplinary field, and still continues to be so, and I expect i t will also be so in the future. It may not ever become a pure scientif ic area in its own right like Statistics or Database (DB) or Machi ne Learning (ML). This might not have been the original or eve n the current intent. The slow progress thus far and other distr actions caused by the web and vendors to its efforts are moving it away from its possible and potential scientific quest. While fif teen years is too short a time to have a great scientific impact, KDD did make progress and accomplished the following: KDD created a sharp discontinuity in economic affai rs and opened up opportunities for businesses to do things with data that had not been done before, and allowed things to be done in new ways. Three fundamental issues distinguish it from other fields. First, it did bring awareness to the scientific community, th e need to deal with and make sense of ever growing data that the i ndustry and business communities are facing. It is not just th e very large size of the database, but also the very high dimensional ity of the data that demanded new research efforts. Secondly, it al so emphasized the need for a discovery component, the fundamental part of any KDD application and solution. Thirdly, it attempte d to steer practitioners towards a process and system-centric view of KDD for it to be effective in solving real world proble ms. As far as the future of KDD, especially its scienti fic progress, is concerned, it seems easy to predict what will happe n in the next two or three years. These short-term trends will ma ke predicting long-term contributions very difficult. External influences like the phenomenal growth and use of the web and some vendor hype will in the short-term cau se efforts on CRM, Database Marketing, OLAP, etc., tha n on efforts that will cause fundamental scientific KDD advances . The basic research community needs to ignore these temporary distractions and focus on solving the right KDD problems. This brings up the issue of what will happen versus what should happen . The trends in KDD by necessity depend on the trends in its com ponent science and technologies that also depend on progre ss in related areas. The definite trend seems to be the split of KDD eff orts into two parallel areas of progress. Both will demand certa in scientific advances and both will meet some real world needs. I call these two GM-way and Microsoft-way. The Microsoft-way wi ll move the field towards  X  X ata mining for the masses. X  Th e GM-way will move it towards  X  X DD for business and industry, X  wh ere massive have parallels in mainframe computing and desktop c omputing. Looking back ten years, I see there were really no true predictions of things to come, but wish lists. In the interest of making the point, I might take the extreme view and predict th at none of the following important KDD issues will show any measur able and notable scientific progress! Apart from the above Grand Challenge problems to be addressed by the KDD community, the issues facing the field f rom a social/utility perspective are: I envision the convergence of Semantic Web, P2P, In ternet2, Grid Computing, Web Services, and Ontological Engineerin g that will lead to interesting new avenues of KDD research. Mo re importantly, the KDD community should pay attention to  X  X DD for Strategic Intent X  that I believe to be a very p romising high impact business application area. An example is ho w Harrah X  X  achieved significant growth and gains over competin g casinos by formulating strategies based on the results of min ing customer data. The concept of utilizing KDD tools and techn iques to formulate corporate strategies that provide competi tive edge is at the core of the intent of KDD to start with. KDD started as a field by integrating results from other fields like ML, DB and Statistics but it needs to make many tru e contributions of its own. KDD will survive because it solves some immediate business problems and provide measurable benefits and it will do better if the above basic issues are addressed. With today X  X  tools and techniques, it is the case where KDD, while drowning in the data glut, is drowning in opportuni ties. The panel consisted of expansions on the various po sition statements listed above. This was followed by a ser ies of question/statements from the audience. The highligh ts of the discussion section of the panel that are not captur ed in the above position statements are summarized below. Rakesh Agrawal chose to present in the context of t he KDD-2001 panel discussion on a similar topic. He presented a series of comparisons between the problems that the panelists presented then and whether, in his judgment, there has been s ignificant progress over the past 2 year. He noted that there has been little progress made on the front of defining what data mi ning is and evolving a theory behind it. On the front of privac y, he concluded that some progress is being made on the privacy-pre serving data mining, and that this remains an area ripe with res earch and can benefit greatly from randomized algorithms and exis ting research in cryptography. One of his primary themes is that it is a mandate on the field to solve the problems of privacy and d ata mining. (Note: Rakesh Agrawal has recently been honored by Scientific American as one of top 50 leaders for his work on p rivacy and data mining). On mining on the web beyond simple click-stream and simple html analysis, Agrawal noted that there has been so me good recent progress as evidenced by papers, but it is t oo early to judge whether this progress is sustainable and significan t. On the front of mining for actionable patterns and including domain knowledge, some serious progress has been ma de, especially in classification, but we still have a l ong way to go. A similar prognosis holds for several other interesti ng technical problems presented in KDD-01. On the front of what problems judge, as we still know too little. Agrawal concluded by listing his grand challenge as an augmentation to the prior discussion on mining seve ral data sources simultaneously (to which he added new data sources to the 2001 list). His Grand Challenge is summarized b y: Find What X  X  there, What has changed, Across sovereign da ta repositories. R. Uthurusamy gave a colorful presentation drawing on a multitude of analogies. He drew on several industry examples including MCI, Harrah's, GM, and some others. He c oncluded with material from industry analysts covering the v arious  X  X ype X  curves for new technologies and argued that KDD and Data Mining are still in the very early stages despite w hat we think has been a lot of unjustified hype. R. Ramakrishnan discussed the challenges for KDD al ong three major fronts: technical, social, and commercial. He highlighted in particular the challenge of  X  Faster KDD X  versus  X  Faster Algorithms X , focusing on the fact that the human factor in minin g needs much attention. The other major challenge is in what he called  X  Data Minding X  systems: systems that monitor data streams and can maintain themselves and their model s of the world, and automatically manage and retire/purge da ta and models as appropriate. He concluded on a warning note tha t we as a field have a chance to either disintegrate into separate communities, or come together and contribute to the problems as one field. While the job of predicting the future is risky at best and likely a losing proposition, we can learn from discussing an d analyzing the challenges of today. At the highest level, the field is facing healthy and interesting challenges. We do not belie ve any of them are insurmountable. Besides, the opportunity is so large, the need so great, and the advances so far so small in compa rison, than any advance going forward will stand a great chance of being significant. The community is healthy and stands cl ose to a crossroads. The big  X  X ocial X  challenges lie in over coming issues such as privacy concerns and  X  X ad press X  and also i n the KDD community figuring out a way to communicate its pro blems crisply and clearly to other fields. Without active contributions from the other related fields, we stand to miss out on important advances and achievements, and we as a community wi ll be doomed to re-discover and re-invent solutions to pr oblems that have been tackled before. On the technical front, t he wealth of problems and challenges are sure to keep us busy as researchers and applied practitioners. One interesting thought is to work on what appears to be a very effective approach to address both technical and so cial challenges is to formulate a set of grand challenge problems. An initial proposal of what these Grand Challenges might be is provided by Fayyad in the Editorial to this issue of SIGKDD Explorations . These challenge problems can serve as a beacon for researchers in the KDD community as well as a bridge for contribut ors in other fields who can spot and understand these problems. Some of these challenge problems were discussed in the panel. We will follow up with a more crisp statement of the challenge pro blems along with an endorsement from members of the KDD communi ty that this list of problems is worthwhile and significant . We should all be thankful that we work in an area that is rich wi th open problems.
