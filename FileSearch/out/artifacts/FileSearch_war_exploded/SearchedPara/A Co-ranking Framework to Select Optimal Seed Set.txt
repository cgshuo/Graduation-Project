 fluence maximization has been actively researched with applications to viral market-ing. Before applying viral marketing strategies on online social networks, some chal-lenges need to be addressed firstly [1]: (i) how to determine the edge weights (influ-optimal seed set, which has the maximum social influence. This paper mainly concen-trates on solving the third challenge: how to select optimal seed set in heterogeneous network . 
The idea of leveraging social influence maximization for marketing campaigns has been studied extensively [9, 10]. Most curr ent heuristic algorithms are introduced and applied on homogeneous networks which contain only one type of vertex (individual) and edge/link (relationship). By contrast, in the real world, we have to consider multi-ple typed individual and relations simultaneously, e.g., academic network (Fig.1). on social influence analysis have surprisingly largely overlooked this aspect. Alt-hough it is possible to come up with the problem of selecting seed set based solely on a homogeneous social network (e.g., collaboration network) [1, 2, 3, 14], those results publications, and the social network among researchers are not fully leveraged. 
To overcome the above drawbacks, we propose a novel co-ranking framework for selecting optimal seed sets in an iterative process on heterogeneous academic network (Fig.1). In [8, 15], authors and their pub lications (papers/tweets) are co-ranked under such heterogeneous network by simply coupling two random walks, which separately rank authors and their publications under PageRank [7]. We utilized different strategy iterative procedure to achieve global ranking. By utilizing the implicit information in score reflects corresponding extent of influence. Individuals with high ranking-scores influence spread) under influence propagation model in corresponding homogeneous network. 
To summarize, this work contributes on the following aspects:  X 
We formally formulate the problem of influence maximization in heterogeneous problem. Accordingly, the proposed framework could finish selecting seed sets for multiple typed sub-networks (homogeneous networks) simultaneously.  X 
Experimental results suggest that the proposed co-ranking framework is effective: scalable on networks with different types and sizes, even very large network with millions edges; (iii) it provides better performance than other co-ranking frame-works [8, 15] with less numbers of iterations and citation information.  X 
Our framework is flexible because it could be customized by redefining the affinity matrix (i.e., weights) and iterative pro cedure according to specific applications. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 surveys the related researches and we conclude the paper in Section 6. Influence Maximization. Domingos et al. were the first to study influence maximiza-tion as an algorithmic problem [5]. Kempe et al. [10] then formulated the problem as fluence spread, and presented two basic influence models, the Independent Cascade (IC) model and the Linear Threshold (LT) model [9]. Then many heuristic algorithms (IPA) [11], and Kimura and Saito proposed shortest-path based IC models [12]. Chen et al. proposed heuristic using degree discount [2] and MIA/PMIA model [3]. How-ever, most of the aforementioned algorithms only focus on homogeneous networks. Influence Analysis in Heterogeneous Network. Recently, influence analysis in het-erogeneous network begins to attract researchers X  attentions, and many works have tried to combine the sufficient information on heterogeneous networks to analyze knowledge, rare attention has concentrated on influence maximization in heterogene-ous network. Co-ranking Framework. By efficiently taking advantage of the additional infor-mation implicit in the heterogeneous networks, the co-ranking framework has been initially developed for scientific impact measurement [8], tweet recommendation [15], work to the influence maximization task is novel to our knowledge. A heterogeneous network is a special type of information network with the under-edges. D

Note that, although seed sets with multiple typed vertices are selected in heterogeneous network simultaneously, the influence spread is calculat-ed for each type of vertices (in corresponding homogeneous network) respectively. The proposed co-ranking framework operates over a heterogeneous network repre-senting the documents, their authors, and the relationships between them. The concep-tual scheme of the proposed co-ranking framework is illustrated in Fig. 2. 4.1 Data Model We denote the entire heterogeneous graph as  X  X , X  X  X  X  X  , where  X  X  X   X   X  X   X  is the set

Normally, the total number of edges is equal to the number of all the documents they collaborated on. So the element of  X   X  X  , is defined as follows: wherein  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X ,  X   X  represents number of edges between  X   X  and  X   X  . This definition follows the normal observation that, the less people an author collaborates fewer authors strengthens the social ties among the corresponding authors, we define  X  . So, adding up social ties from all documents, we obtain citation behavior. The number of documents is  X   X   X | X   X  | , and we denote the individ-number of documents directly cited by  X   X  .

Wherein  X  is the damping factor. This formula means that the influence of a doc-ument is enhanced if it is cited by other highly ranked documents. 4.3 Co-ranking Framework Based on the construction of sub-graphs (and affinity matrixes), and the design of the iterative procedure, let us sketch the co-ran king framework as shown in Algorithm 1. Wherein,  X  X  X  X 1, X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  denotes difference between the current iteration and the previous one. When the iteration procedure converges, we choose the top- X  indi-viduals (authors or documents) according to ranking-scores, and put them into corre-tion models. To validate the performance of our co-ranking framework, we conduct experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, to compare the results of seed set selection generated from the proposed algorithm with those from various other heuristics. 5.1 Dataset This paper employs the proposed algorithm and compares with other algorithms on mutual real-world networks (details of dataset are shown in Table 1): with vertices representing authors and edges representing co-authorship relations. vertices are documents published by the corresponding authors in Collaboration . 5.2 Alternative Algorithms We compare the proposed method with several heuristics under IC/WC model: DegreeDiscount: The degree discount heuristic developed for the uniform IC model Distance: A simple heuristic that selects  X  vertices with the smallest average distance PageRank: The popular algorithm used of ranking web page [7].

Ran-dom as the baseline performs badly indicating that a careful seed section is important. 
Table 1 shows the performance comparisons with other co-ranking frameworks, using is 5.08% and 2.75% better than Co-Rank-AD and Co-Rank-TR on average, especially in case of small seed set size. However, with size of seed set increasing, the performances introduce social tie function into the co-ranking framework, and the affinity matrix could 10.54 second and is comparable with HITS and DegreeDiscount . 5.5 Influence Maximization on Citation Network Fig. 4 (a, b) show the results on the Citation network.

(ii) Distance performs slightly better than Degree , but Co-Rank has Random performs badly enough as expected. What X  X  more, on both Collaboration and Citation , DegreeDiscount performs worse under WC model than under IC mod-el, because of being specially tuned for the uniform IC model. So, Co-Rank outper-form DegreeDiscount in stability and suffers less limitations. 
As shown in Table 2, Co-Rank still performs better than other co-ranking frame-works. However, Co-Rank-TR provides the similar performance mainly because of balancing popularity and diversity on Citation by using time-variant feature (it favors by [15]). For running time under IC model, we see that Co-Rank only takes less than 6.27 seconds (similar to PageRank ), while CELFGreedy costs about 10 hours. 5.6 Experiments on Synthetic Networks In order to test the scalability, we generate a family of networks with increasing sizes ( | X | ranges from 2K to 256K) using the LFR standard benchmark networks [13], model and compute influence spread for 50 seed vertices in each case. Fig. 5(a) shows the running times of different algorithms on Collaboration networks. large graphs. On the contrary, Co-Rank along with the rest heuristics, in other group in Fig. 5(a), could all scale up quite well and be easily scalable to large graphs. 5.7 Runtime and Ranking-Score Convergence The computational complexity of Co-Rank is  X  X  X | X  X  X  X  X  , while Co-Rank-AD costs The convergence rates of ranking-scores are shown in Fig. 5(b). It is clear that, gener-ally the co-ranking frameworks use less iterations to achieve convergence than tradi-co-ranking frameworks implement several mutual PageRank for reinforcement, which guarantees better efficiency. Although Co-Rank-TR provides similar perfor-mance in Citation network, Co-Rank converges more quickly mainly because of capturing asymmetric relationship between authors and their documents in inter-class random walk, while such relationship in Co-Rank-TR is symmetric. Unlike traditional influence maximization algorithms which solely focus on homogene-structure, the proposed algorithm simultaneously measures each type of individuals in a performance than other co-ranking frameworks with less iterations.
