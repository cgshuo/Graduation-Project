 1. Introduction
Transmission pipelines carrying natural gas or oil are not on secure industrial site as a potentially hazardous plant, but are routed across the land or river, i.e., busy city, a network of superhighways, tunnel, farmland or railways. Consequently, there is the ever-present potential for third parties to interfere with the integrity of these pipelines. In addition, the combination of third-party interference and pipeline route might suggest that people around the pipelines are subject to significant risk from pipeline failure. The hazard distance associated with the pipeline ranges from under 20 m for a smaller pipeline at lower pressure, up to over 300 m for a larger one at higher pressure ( Jo and Ahn, 2002 ).
Taking Shaanxi X  X eijing gas pipeline in China for example, it is not only the longest so far of land-based transmission pipeline for natural gas, but also China X  X  first large diameter, long distance and fully automated gas pipeline. The pipeline starts from west of
Shaanxi to the east Beijing, with length of about 860 km, diameter of 660 mm, across three provinces and one city, i.e., Shaanxi,
Shanxi, Hebei and Beijing. It goes across large rivers 5 times, medium-sized rivers 238 times, large and medium-sized loess gullies 15 times, railways 15 times and trunk highways 86 times. The safety issues of such gas pipeline due to the third-party interference are more prominent with increasingly high occur-rence probability and severe disaster consequence. A major pipe-line failure caused by third-party interference is shown in Fig. 1 . Therefore, regulatory authorities and pipeline managers have endeavored to improve the level of safety of the pipeline by protecting it from third-party interference.

Gas transmission pipelines are buried in utility right-of-ways marked with warning signs. These right-of-ways are well main-tained. Nevertheless, pipelines are sometimes damaged by con-struction equipment not owned by the pipeline company, such as mechanical interference during excavations and other activities close to the pipelines. Referred to as third-party damage, it is the major cause of damage to natural gas transmission pipelines ( National Transportation Safety Board, 1994 ). A single incident can be devastating, causing death and millions of dollars in property loss. One highly publicized incident occurred in Edison, NJ, in 1994. Flames shot 125 X 150 m (400 X 500 feet) into the air near an apartment complex. Nearly 100 people were treated in hospitals as a result of the accident. Damage from the incident exceeded $25 million ( Miura and Mishima, 1995 ).

Active propaganda about the importance of pipeline, advanced pipeline damage inspection technology and greater legal penalties have reduced, but not eliminated, t he number of incidents. A backhoe, trencher, or auger (for digging post holes) can move into the right-of-way, begin excavation, and damage the pipeline in less than 30 min. A boring machine can travel beneath the surface of the ground for greater than 30 m. This type of equipment can damage the pipeline without ever having the aboveground portion of the equipment in the right-of-way.

While third-party damage can be devastating, it occurs infre-quently much less than one hit per kilometer of pipeline a year.
Every year, many intrusions occur in the right-of-way. Most of these are benign with no possibility of injuring the pipeline (e.g., mowing the right-of-way, people walking, motorcycle and ATV traffic).

Another important type of incident inducing pipeline leakage is caused by illegal gas theft. During the pipeline construction, a number of extra valves beyond the scope of official design are embedded through drilling pores by illegal individuals, which help them to steal gas in the future when the pipeline is put into operation after construction. These illegal activities directly cause gas leakage in a large area, and further result in a large area contaminated land, which is easy to cause fire and explosion. In the meantime the pipeline engineers have to shut down or adjust the corresponding upstream and downstream stations rushing to deal with the emergency and repair the pipeline as soon as possible. Each incident due to gas or oil stealer usually causes as little as tens of thousands, and as many as hundreds of thousands, millions or even billions of RMB in economic losses and serious environmental pollution. The site of oil steal is shown in Fig. 2 and the repaired pipeline is shown in Fig. 3 , which provoke safety engineer to take proactive safety-related actions to prevent impacts of third-party interference, not detect after they occur.
The third typical pattern of third-party interference can be shown in Fig. 4 , i.e., the relative and crossing projects, which are very close to the underlining pipeline, and become a serious threat to the existing pipeline. Taking Shaanxi X  X eijing gas pipe-lines as an example, there are 19 intersections between lines 2# and line 3#.
 identify the pipeline sections having high risk of third-party interference and recognize the possible risk sources with field data. The safety operators can make corresponding safety-related actions to reduce risk in advance, which will solve a long-standing problem of the natural gas industry. Concepts have been sug-gested and are in various states of development.
 party damages was studied by Cao et al. (2010a , 2010b) trough hydraulic pressure tests and finite element method (FEM) analy-sis were performed, which manifested the ultimate pressure that the damaged pipeline could bear after being repaired. Brito and de Almeida (2009) present a decision model for risk assessment and for risk ranking of sections of natural gas pipelines based on the multi-attribute utility theory to support the prioritizing of critical sections of pipeline in natural gas companies, and also to allow sections of pipeline to be ranked into a risk hierarchy.
In Gharabagh et al. X  X  research (2009 ), an algorithm is developed using probabilistic and indexing models for the comprehensive risk assessment and management of pipelines. Its algorithm enables the identification of most of the pipeline failure causes. Markowski and Mannan (2009) used the framework of the fuzzy
Layer of Protection Analysis for risk assessment of long pipeline improving the accuracy of risk index. A computer program has been developed by Park et al. (2004) to assess and manage risk for city gas pipeline, and frequency was estimated in terms of major causes of consequences: excavating by third-party work, corro-sion, welding defects and ground movement.

However there is no effective method that is acceptable to the industry for assessing and preventing third-party interference in advance by taking proper safety measures corresponding to different risk patterns. Nor is there a model to classify the concrete pattern of third-party interference (e.g., third-party damage, illegal drilling by stealer, illegal construction, etc.) based on field data.

The contribution of this paper is the proposal of a risk pattern classification method for identifying, prioritizing, classifying and managing perceived risk sources of third-party inference. Risk assessment index system is first developed by fault tree analysis considering different perspectives on the pipeline system in terms of its position, laying conditions, social environment, public relations, prevention and control regulations. Self-organization maps (SOMs) neural network is used further to classify pipeline sections with the same risk level into different risk pattern, which helps to make an effective risk control strategy to prevent third-party interference in advance. 2. Material and assessment index system 2.1. Segmentation of pipeline into sections
Pipeline industry wishes to assess the risks of third-party interference related to its pipelines by arranging the sections of pipeline into a hierarchical ranking of risk and enquire which kind of risk they are confronting. Besides its usual safety and main-tenance activities over the entire pipeline network, the pipeline company usually holds a small budget which is available for a supplementary prevention program. It aims to prioritize the most critical sections of pipeline by taking into consideration the potential hazard from third-party interference and its conse-quences of accidents from the human, environmental and finan-cial point of view, which may happen in any section of pipeline.
Therefore in order to assess risk of pipelines, it is useful to divide them into smaller sections as some conditions change significantly along their route, such as the pipeline failure rate. By understanding the threats present in each segment of pipeline, strategies can be drawn up to mitigate risks more effectively. A
These elements are distinguished by their characteristics, and they sum up to the total length of the pipeline under analysis.
The principle of pipeline segmentation is as follows: (1) A segmentation point should be added, when the change of population or building density, topography, pipeline laying mode and usage age along the gas pipeline occurs. The entire pipeline should be first segmented according to the above 4 factors, respectively, and then the maximum section number is considered as the final pipeline section number for risk pattern classification. (2) The work of pipeline segmentation should be carried out on the basis of the adequate collection and analysis of historical data, following the segmentation principle (1), with
An example of pipeline segmentation of Shaanxi X  X eijing gas pipeline is shown in Fig. 5 , from which the partial pipeline can be segmented into 8 special pipeline sections with complex geology, and each section has its own surrounding characteristics. 2.2. Fault tree analysis of third-party interference
In this work fault tree analysis ( Khakzad et al., 2011 ) is then used for developing the assessment index system and assigning their corresponding index weights. This method describes the logical relationship between possible accident and each kind of reasons with a tree-shape diagram. Through the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the main causes of the third-party inter-ference accident will be found, which will provide beneficial reference for the index system architecture and index weights. All basic events and the fault tree of the third-party interference accident are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6 , respectively.
According to the following equation ( Contini et al., 2010 ), the structure importance of above fault tree is calculated: I  X  i  X  X  where I ( i ) is the approximate structure importance degree of basic event and X i and n i are the number of minimal cuts included in basic event X i . The rank of the structure importance degree of each basic event is determined as follows: I  X  4  X  X  I  X  5  X  4 I  X  6  X  X  I  X  7  X  X  I  X  8  X  X  I  X  9  X  2.3. Risk assessment index of third-party interference
According to the results of fault tree analysis with the results of structure importance, the development of risk assessment index system should focus on the failure probability, possible environmental leakage impacts, damage to properties and effects on the health and safety of people exposed to the damaged pipeline section.

Therefore, the risk assessment index of the third-party inter-ference used in this work consists of the leakage impact coeffi-cient ( C ) and failure probability index ( T ). The leakage impact coefficient further involves m edium diffusion coefficient ( D ), con-sequence and high sensitivity ( C s ) and medium hazard index ( U ). In a another aspect, the failure probability index is further composed of management and misuse index ( T 4 ), destruction and the prevention public relation index ( T 1 ). The entire risk assessment index system of the third-party interference is shown in Fig. 7 .

To estimate the risk of third-party interference related to each pipeline section, the assessment model is developed and the estimated risk value of each section can be calculated as follows: R  X  C T  X  2  X  T  X  T 1  X  T 2  X  T 3  X  T 4  X  3  X  C  X  U D  X  4  X  U  X  N  X  R Q  X  5  X  N  X  N f  X  N r  X  N h  X  6  X  D  X  L H  X  7  X 
H  X  P D  X  C s where R is the relative risk value, T is the total score of failure probability of all related indicators (higher T indicates lower failure probability of third-party interference), the detailed con-tents of which are shown in Tables 2 X 10 , C is the leakage impact coefficient, the detailed contents of which are shown in Table 10 ,
T 1 is the score of social environment and public relations, T score of pipeline laying conditions, T 3 is the score of pipeline destruction and the prevention or control, T 4 is the score of pipeline management and misuse, U is the hazard coefficient of the medium transmitted in the pipeline, D is the leakage diffusion coefficient, N is the current hazard coefficient of pipeline leakage,
R Q is the long-term hazard coefficient of pipeline leakage, N flammability coefficient of the medium transmitted in the pipe-line, N r is the reactive coefficient of the medium transmitted in the pipeline, N h is the toxic coefficient of the medium transmitted in the pipeline, L is the leakage rate coefficient of the medium transmitted in the pipeline, H is the environmental factor coeffi-cient around the pipeline, P D is the coefficient of population density around the pipeline and C s is the coefficient of high consequence and sensitivity around the pipeline. 3. Risk pattern classification of third-party interference
After the risk of third-party interference for each pipeline section is estimated, they can be ranked by the calculated risk value R . As the risk value increases, the corresponding pipeline section should be protected in advance with higher priority.
However the pipeline sections with the same risk level may have different hazard sources, different occurrence probability or different impact of accidents. Therefore the risk assessment model as Eqs. (2) X (8) is not enough for pipeline engineer to take adequate safety-related actions to prevent the pipeline section with high risk from damage.

Therefore risk pattern classification is necessary to further differentiate the pipeline sections in the same risk set by various interference sources, potential hazard, consequence impact, etc.
In this context, the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is used for this purpose. The SOM constitutes a powerful method for exploratory analysis of risk-related data based on dimension reduction approach. The SOM algorithm defines a smooth non-linear mapping from a high-dimensional input space onto a low-dimensional output space (typically 2D) that preserves the most significant information about the input data distribution ( Li and Huang, 2009 ).

This mapping can be used in this work to obtain 2D repre-sentations of the risk assessment variables, i.e., risk mapping, that reveal the main relationships among pipeline sections, allowing to exploit available data and risk-related knowledge in an efficient way for safety management and risk control purposes. In the projected risk mapping, the pipeline sections with similar hazard source or similar consequence impacts could be clustered together in a few cells, which are close to each other in the map. Hence the safety engineer can use the same safety-related action for the pipeline sections in the same cluster in the risk map, which improves the effectiveness of the safety management and helps to perform risk reduction in advance. 3.1. SOM theory
The SOM algorithm ( Kangas and Kohonen, 1996 ; Kohonen, 2006 ) proposed by Kohonen can be described as a non-linear, smooth mapping of a high-dimensional input space onto a low-dimensional output space. In this paper, SOM is applied in the visualization of complex risk composition of third-party inter-ference and discovery dependencies and abstractions from raw data in safety management. The SOM consists of M units; each unit i is associated to an n -dimensional prototype vector m input space and a position vector on a low dimensional regular grid g i in the output space. The SOM algorithm can be divided in two stages: (1) A competitive stage, where the closest prototype (best match-(2) A cooperative stage, where the best matching unit and its neighbors are adapted by Eq. (10). m i  X  t  X  1  X  X  m i  X  t  X  X  a  X  t  X  h ci  X  t  X  X  x  X  t  X  m i where a  X  t  X  is a learning rate shown in Eq. (11) (where t maximal training iteration and C is a positive constant related to output nodes and defined by the users) and h ci  X  t  X  is a neighborhood function between units c and i shown in
Eq. (12) (where g i and g c are the coordinates of the nodes in the output space and 99 g i g c 99 is the distance between neurons i and c on the map grid; s  X  t  X  is the neighborhood radius at iteration t ). In this work we used the Gaussian Neighborhood
Function. This adaptation rule has a cooperative nature since not only the best matching unit but also its neighbors are adapted with a factor defined by the neighborhood function h ci  X  t  X  .Both  X  t  X  and h ci  X  t  X  are varied dynamically learning.  X  t  X  X  C 1 h  X  t  X  X  exp
As a result of this training algorithm the SOM-based risk pattern classification method has several key properties: (1) Dimension reduction. This property results from mapping a high-dimensional input space onto a low-dimensional output space, i.e., the risk assessment variables with high-dimension can be projected onto the 2D map by the SOM algorithm, indicating different risk ranking areas or risk patterns repre-sented by clusters of pipeline sections. (2) Approximation of the density function. Since prototypes are  X  X  X ttracted X  X  towards high density regions in the input space, after training they will be distributed approximately in the same way as the input data. The best matching unit in the risk mapping of the closest prototype estimates the risk distribu-tion of the third-party interference of pipeline sections in the same risk pattern set. (3) Topology preservation, that is, close nodes in the lattice represent close prototypes in the input space. This property is a consequence of the cooperative nature of the algorithm imposed by the neighborhood function h ci , and establishes an essential difference with competitive algorithms. Risk patterns represented by clusters, which are close together (4) Approximation of the input data. The SOM algorithm approxi-3.2. SOM-based risk pattern classification scheme
Risk pattern classification is the process that allocates the most similar risk features to a given risk pattern. In the context of third-party interference, a few risk patterns can be summarized as project disturbance X  X , etc., which connect to different safety-related actions and should be classified in advance. The SOM theory is used here for classification with the purpose that is to find the nonlinear risk assessment scheme X  X  structure that par-tially exists within the system through the use of data mining techniques.

The risk pattern classification scheme based on SOM is shown in Fig. 8 . In this procedure, 3 stages should be further illustrated and expounded as follows: (1) Historical data collection.
 pipeline line 2 # Estimated risk value (b) historical accident records, management code, HSE (c) the physical and chemical characteristics of the medium (d) the report of investigation along the field pipeline, e.g., (e) the expert knowledge and experience used in the model (2) SOM training.

The development of SOM Network involves two key aspects, which are (i) the determination of the number of nodes and the structure of output layer, (ii) the learning rate and (iii) the training epochs. (i) The number of nodes in the output layer depends on how (ii) The learning rate can be set higher at the beginning of the 4. Case study 4.1. Data set and data pre-processing
Shaanxi X  X eijing gas pipeline in China is not only the longest so far of land-based transmission pipeline for natural gas, but also
China X  X  first large diameter, long distance and fully automated gas pipeline. The pipeline is composed of three lines (shown in Fig. 9 ), i.e., line 1#, line 2# and line 3#, which starts from west of Shaanxi province to the east Beijing, with length of about 860 km, diameter of 660 mm, across three provinces and one city. According to the pipeline segmentation principle introduced in
Section 2.1 in this paper, more than 400 pipeline sections of line 2# are obtained. In order to manifest the effectiveness and accuracy of the method for risk pattern classification proposed in this paper, 34 typical sections of line 2# are selected here for
SOM classification training. The information of the 10 out of 34 pipeline sections are shown in Tables 2 X 10 , which present the marking standard for each index and the score of each variable.
One should note that the marking standard is established accord-ing to the structure importance from the fault tree analysis combined with expert experience, while the credits of each item are determined by field investigation, and the score of each variable is calculated by summing up all the credits obtained from various sub-items.

For example, the maximum score of risk variables about warning signs of pipeline is 10 credits, which involves the maximum score of sign position (5 credits) and sign intactness (5 credits). Considering the different level of sign position, the actual score is marked, i.e., the state as  X  X  X omplete vision X  X  is assigned 5 credits,  X  X  X bove 50% vision X  X  is assigned 3 credits, while  X  X  X ess than 50% vision X  X  is assigned 1 credits.

In order to prevent variables from having higher impact as compared to other variables, the normalizing is carried out by transforming all the variables to the range of e.g., 0 X 1, ensuring that all variables have equal importance in the formation of the SOM. 4.2. Risk estimation
Based on the risk assessment model presented in Section 2.3 , the values (or scores) of each risk assessment variable of selected pipeline sections are calculated considering the minimum depth of cover, activity level around pipeline, above-ground facility situation, alarm call system, public education and propaganda schedule, warning signs of pipeline, perambulation frequency and accident consequence impact, which are shown in Tables 2 X 10 .
The estimated risk values based on Eq. (2) of each pipeline sections are shown in Fig. 10 , from which the section 24# has least risk value as 0.23, i.e., it is the safest pipeline section against third-party interference, while the risk value of section 7# is 0.39 corresponding to the most negative combination of high potential damage and severe consequence impact caused by the third-party interference, which needs to be protected by enhanced safety measures.

A few sections have the same risk value, such as section 9#, 16#, 18#, 31# with risk value as 0.28, while sections 33#, 30#, 4# and 8# with risk value as 0.32. Although these pipeline sections have the same risk values, the risk variables corresponding to various hazard and impact should be treated by different safety-related actions. Therefore the SOM-based risk pattern classifica-tion approach proposed in this paper is used further to identify the specific risk pattern of each pipeline section and differentiate the pipeline sections with the same risk value.

The distribution of total score of potential hazard of each pipeline section is shown in Fig. 11 , which involves the factors of minimum depth of cover, activity level, above-ground facilities, alarm call system, public education and propaganda, warning signs of pipeline and the perambulation frequency (7 variables in total), from which the higher score indicates the lower probability of potential hazard. The sections 3#, 7#, 8# and 29# with least scores have the highest probabilities of potential damage. 4.3. SOM results number of neurons in the input layer equals to the number of variables (7 variables used for potential hazard data and 9 variables used for risk data), and the number of nodes in the output layer is determined as 30 (5 34). The number of iterations is usually set at least 500 times the number of neurons in the output layer, i.e., t m  X  15,000 (epochs). The learning rate is used as a  X  t  X  X  0 : 8  X  1 t = t m  X  in this case study. in Fig. 12 , where the inputs variables are minimum depth of cover, activity level, above-ground facilities, alarm call system, public education and propaganda, warning signs of pipeline, and perambulation frequency. In Fig. 12 , the label  X  X  X A X  X  indicates safety condition,  X  X  X S X  X  indicates potential damage by gas theft, and  X  X  X O X  X  indicates potential illegal or relative construction, i.e., three risk patterns are suggested in this case. In the U-matrix, the top right area manifests the  X  X  X A X  X  pattern, with the dominant hazard variables as variables 4, 5 (i.e., the factor about alarm call system and public education and propaganda), the bottom area manifests the  X  X  X O X  X  pattern, with the dominant hazard variables -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 as variables 1, 2, 6 (i.e., the factors of minimum depth of cover, activity level and warning signs of pipeline, respectively), while the middle area manifests the  X  X  X S X  X  pattern, with the dominant hazard variables as variables 3, 4, 7 (i.e., the factors of above-ground facilities, alarm call system and perambulation frequency, respectively).

In another aspect, the top right area in the U-matrix of Fig. 12 shows the clusters of pipeline sections with low probabilities of potential hazard due to third-part y interference, while in the bottom left area, the corresponding clusters of pipeline sections have high probabilities of potential hazard and should be protected by enhanced safety measures to be pr evented from hazards. Therefore the U-matrix can be used as a sort of quantitative probability classifier to differentiate pipeline sections with the same estimated risk value. In this way, it is also deduced that the damage caused by third-party construction ( X  X  X O X  X ) would occur with higher probability than the failure due to gas theft ( X  X  X S X  X ).

Projection of the potential hazard data set to the three risk patterns spanned by its three eigenvectors with the greatest eigenvalues is shown in Fig. 13 . The three patterns have been plotted using different colors. The SOM grid has been projected to the same patterns. Neighboring map units are connected with lines. Labels associated with map units are also shown in Fig. 13 , where blue indicates safety condition (SA), green indicates poten-tial damage by gas theft (GS) and red indicates potential illegal or relative construction (CO).

The seven variables of potential hazard are shown in Fig. 14 with bar-chart in each map unit. In the background, different -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2

Considering both of the potential hazard and damage impact of the third-party interference, nine risk variables including eight hazard variables and one impact variable (score of leakage impact) are organized for risk pattern classification, which are shown in Table 2 . The distribution of total score of leakage impact of each pipeline section is shown in Fig. 15 , from which the lower score indicates the lower leakage impact. The sections 6#, 14#, 15# and 16# with the highest scores have the most significant catastrophic impact of pipeline failure caused by third-party interference, although their total estimated risk values are on a lower level.
 potential hazard and damage impact of third-party interference is shown in Fig. 16 , where the top area manifests the risk pattern of  X  X  X O X  X , with the dominant hazard variables as variables 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, the bottom left area manifests the risk pattern of  X  X  X S X  X , with the dominant hazard variables as variables 3, 5, 8, 9, while the bottom right area manifests the risk pattern of  X  X  X A X  X , with the dominant hazard variables as variables 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. The factors of above risk variables are shown in Table 2 . The projection of the risk data set to the three risk patterns spanned by its three eigenvectors with greatest eigenvalues is shown in Fig. 17 , and the nine variables of total risk are shown in Fig. 18 with bar-chart in each map unit. As the value of 8th variable is extraordinarily large, the left variables except the 8th are shown in Fig. 19 corresponding to each risk pattern.
 matrix in the traditional risk evaluation method since the top area indicates higher risk while the bottom area indicates lower risk and especially the bottom right cluster illustrates the safety unit with the least risk value. Besides it has preponderance than traditional risk matrix, that the U-matrix can further differentiate various risk patterns and present the relationship between each pattern cluster. For example, the pipeline section 11# ( X  X  X S X  X ) with risk value 0.276, section 23# ( X  X  X A X  X ) with 0.277 and section 9# ( X  X  X O X  X ) with 0.286 have similar risk values, so from Figs. 16 and 17 , their clusters are close to each other in the middle of U-matrix and risk data projection map. However the three sections belong-ing to different risk patterns can be differentiated by distinct BMU in the U-matrix, which is so important for safety engineer to take disparate maintenance strategy, which would be more effective and pertinent. The safety-related actions corresponding to differ-ent risk pattern of third-party interference are shown in Table 11 . organizing map reflects the distribution of the complex relationship GS between each risk variables, and can reflect the change in the distribution relationship sensitively for intuitionistic risk analysis and diagnosis without any risk assessment model needed. Risk mappings also enable the pipeline risk state considering potential hazard and leakage impact with visibility, which is conducive to differentiate pipeline sections with similar risk level for the deci-sion-making of safety measures . So the method proposed in this paper as a statistical approach illustrates the characteristics of the nonlinear logic between the variables of input information, which is difficult to understand by other method. It manifests the unique advantages of overcoming the limitation in traditional risk assess-ment method. 5. Conclusion
In this work we have presented a methodology to assess and analyze the risk pattern of the third-party interference of long transmission pipeline by means of fault tree and self-organizing map (SOM). Based on fault tree analysis, an assessment index system has been established, and then SOM is used in multi-parameter risk pattern classification. The power of this metho-dology relies on the efficient synergy between the well known advantages of SOM visualization and the classical tools, allowing to discover relationships between risk-related variables and its risk pattern in pipeline engineering.

A case study for the Shaanxi X  X eijing gas pipeline is illustrated in detail to demonstrate the possibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. It also suggests further work in several areas, such as visualization of multi-pattern in the same pipeline section, and risk pattern monitoring methods based on tracking the dynamic behavior of the third-party interference.
