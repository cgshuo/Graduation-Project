Radio frequency identification(RFID) technology uses radio-frequency waves to transfer data between readers and mov-able tagged objects without line of sight. RFID holds the promise of real-time identifying, locating, tracking and mon-itoring physical objects, and can be used for a wide range of pervasive computing applications. To achieve these goals, RFID data have to be collected, transformed and expres-sively modeled as their virtual counterparts in the virtual world. RFID data, however, have their own unique char-acteristics  X  including aggregation, location, temporal and history-oriented  X  which have to be fully considered and inte-grated into the data model. The diversity of RFID applica-tions pose further challenges to a generalized framework for RFID data modeling. In this paper, we explore the funda-mental characteristics of RFID data and classify RFID ap-plications into a set of typical scenarios. We then propose a generalized RFID data modeling framework with constructs for each typical scenario. These constructs can be combined to model most RFID applications in real world.
Tags and readers are two key elements in RFID applica-tions. RFID tags, uniquely identified by their Electronic Product Code(EPC) IDs stored in memories, range from read-only to read-write including both reader-write (writable by readers) and sensor-write (writable by sensors). Readers can be either fixed or mobile. Fixed readers are statically mounted and observe data from tags within their scopes. Mobile readers, either operated by humans or guided by motion control systems, move around and approach tags to Work done while visiting Siemens Corporate Research. read data. For applications with mobile readers, one special case is that these readers may act as surrogates of operators and observations are used to track operations. In such appli-cations, operation , representing a process or an aggregated event, is a fundamental concept.

RFID applications track objects by tracing their move-ments among different locations through observations. The semantics of a location can be either geographic (e.g., a lo-cation from a GPS system) or symbolic (e.g., a shipping route). RFID observations signify the processes or move-ments of tagged objects in applications, e.g., the movement of products in a supply chain.

Based on the diversity of tags, readers and location se-mantics, we classify RFID application scenarios as shown in Figure 1. Scenarios A-G are fundamental ones: RFID ap-plications in real world are usually combinations of scenar-ios A-G. Scenario A represents applications with read-only tags and fixed readers. Scenarios B, C and D are all for applications with read-only tags and moveable reader, but with different location semantics. Scenario E describes ap-plications in which a reader is attached to an operator and an observation signifies the start or end of an operation. Scenario F (G) is represents applications with reader-write (sensor-write) tags and fixed readers.
In this section, we discuss how to model RFID applica-tions as discussed in Section 2. We first identify the funda-mental entities in these applications and study relationships among these entities. We then propose a general data model for RFID applications.

While there can be many entities in RFID applications, only some of them are directly related to RFID, which we consider as fundamental entities in RFID applications. These include EPC-tagged objects , readers , sensors , operators , lo-cations and transactions . A sensor measures a target and then writes the measurement to its master RFID tag. Op-erators refer to humans who operate with readers. For ex-ample, a nurse wearing a wearable reader may interact with syringes, medicines and patients. The nurse is an opera-tor, and the interactions between the operator and objects represent certain operations.

While the entities are static in general, the relationships among these entities can be either static or dynamic. Static relationships are similar to those in the traditional ER model. For example, the relationship between an object and its on-board sensor  X  OBJECTSENSOR  X  is a static relationship. Most relationships in RFID applications, however, are dy-namic and history-oriented due to the temporal nature of RFID data. Interactions among entities may generate move-ment, workflow, operations, and business logic. The inter-actions are in two forms: state changes and events.
State changes include change of object locations , change of object aggregation relationships , start/endofanopera-tion and change of reader locations . State change history, i.e., the information about during which period an object is in a certain state, is essential to tracking and monitoring applications and shall be captured in RFID data models.
Events generated during entity interactions include:
To model the entities and relationships discussed above, we propose a general d ata m odel for RFID a pplications (DMRA). This model extends ER model for modeling static entities and relationships with the following new features.
In this section, we present a sample data model (Figure 2) for applications with fixed readers and tags writable by on-board sensors, i.e., scenario G. Sensors detect targets inde-pendent of readers and periodically write sensor measure-ments to tags. When a reader interacts with an object, the
Figure 2: Data model for application scenario G reader observes both the EPC of the tag and the logged sensor measurement history.
 This model contains two state-based dynamic relations: OBJECTLOCATION and CONTAINMENT . OBJECTLO-CATION preserves the location history of each object: the period [tstart, tend] during which an object stays in a lo-cation. CONTAINMENT records in what period [tstart, tend] an object is contained in its parent object.
Besides state-based relations, there are also four event-based dynamic relations in this model: OBSERVATION , SENSORMEASUREMENT , S-OBSERVATION and TRANS-ACTIONITEM . OBSERVATION records the raw reading data generated from readers and SENSORMEASURMENT records the measurement data generated from sensors. S-OBSERVATION represents a reader X  X  observations of an ob-ject and its logged sensor measurement history. TRANSAC-TIONITEM records the events generated during the inter-action between a transaction and an item.
RFID technology has emerged for years and poses new challenges for data management [1, 2]. Little research, how-ever, has been conducted on how to effectively model RFID data. Harrison et al [3] summari zed RFID data characteris-tics and provided some reference relations to model the data. In their model, RFID data are modeled as events. Thus, RFID state history and temporal semantics of business pro-cesses are implicit. A RFID data model was developed in [4], which focuses on fixed readers with read-only tags.
In this paper, we develop a general data model for RFID applications in pervasive computing. Such a general data model provides a bridge between the virtual world and the physical world and serves as the foundation for RFID data management and middleware. [1] S. S. Chawathe, V.
