 There has recently been interest within the HCI community concerning both current practices and digital tools for reminiscing. Several sy stems have been developed to trigger and / or capture reminiscence conten t, however very little is known about the overall process of reminiscing or been developed for an older healthy population. For my di ssertation I have investigated when and how elderly individuals reminisce and am developing a prototype system that can enhance and maintain records of their reminiscing. H5.m. Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): Miscellaneous.
 Design, Human Factors Reminiscing, Elderly, Usability, Scenario Based Design The desire and practices for remi niscing ( X  X he act or process of recalling the past [1] X ) can be traced back to early civilizations where community elders were responsible for knowing and sharing the history of their community [2, 3]. However times have changed and the oral tradition of reminiscing has faded into an occasional telling of stories that are heard on special occasions. HCI research in the area of reminiscing has investigated ways to trigger and elicit memories [4-6]. For example, Pensieve is a reminiscing system that prompts users with photos or status that they have previously posted to so cial networks [7]. Palaver Tree Online [8] was a system through which children and elders collaborated on the creation of oral histories. Adtep, Kay and Quigley [9] developed a table t op digital photo sharing system. Other systems have been devel oped to allow individuals to document their entire life [10] as well as being prompted to reminisce based on old posts to social networking sites [7]. There has recently been interest within the HCI community concerning both current practices a nd digital tools for reminiscing [11]. The focus of this research can be viewed as responding to this call with two complementary research elements: an interest in the human-computer interaction (HCI) needs and preferences for  X  Triggers -By triggering older adults to reminisce (as I did  X  Minimalistic -They prefer si mpler communication channels  X  Physicality of Reminiscence Artifact -Older adults still rely  X  Collaborative  X  Reminiscing is not a solitary process. Oral  X  Cross generational -The desire to share information about For more information on the pre liminary finds see [14]. I am currently coding the interviews by theme, starting with the themes already identified but also keeping an open eye for any other themes that may emerge. Once the interviews have been coded the results will be used to create a number of personas that depict current reminiscing. Phase 2  X  Design  X   X  What features of a reminiscing tool can replicate, expand upon, and enhance reminiscing? X  The personas created in phase 1 will then be us ed to develop problem scenarios dealing with the different design requirements that emerge. These documents will be used in a participatory design session, with the outcome being a prototype digital reminiscing system. Phase 3  X  Evaluation  X   X  X hat are the benefits and drawbacks of using this system for reminisci ng? X  This phase involves a mix of lab studies and fieldwork, and will articulate the system X  X  strengths and weaknesses. I anticipate that the system will change reminiscing practices of the elderly who participate in the study. In particular, I will produce findings that address the research questions proposed earlier. The contributions of this research will include:  X  Empirical knowledge of remi niscing motivations and  X  The design and evaluation of a system to support digital  X  The benefits and drawbacks of using the system for [1] Butler, R.N., The Life Review: An Interpretation of [2] Butler, R.N., Foreword: The Life Review , in The Art and
