 1. Introduction
We will be concerned with the graphical representation of informetric data, in particular with relation to concentration aspects. It can be argued that Bradford (1934) provided the original spur to such graphical here. Indeed, we will argue that it has been superseded by the methods described here. Another notable lection, using graphical representations that are essentially equivalent to the Lorenz/Leimkuhler approach our concern here will be with the widespread representation via Lorenz/Leimkuhler curves of concentration.

Once again, let us note the general framework for stochastic modelling in informetrics, namely that of a pers/authors/journals receiving citations X  X  and, in the academic library context,  X  X  X ooks accumulating loans X  X . In the terminology of Egghe (2004) , these are examples of so-called two-dimensional informetrics studies. In this particular study we will not be concerned with the cumulative productivity of sources over time, simply with a set of sources that have produced numbers of items during a period of study and their graphical representation. (For theoretical and empirical examples of such time evolution, refer to Burrell, sufficient to motivate the approach.

In the field of economics, a simple way of illustrating inequalities in such as income and wealth (1970) , Lambert (2001) and Kleiber and Kotz (2003) . In informetrics, where the interest usually focuses on the most productive sources, an equivalent graphical representation is the Leimkuhler curve; see
Burrell (1991, 1992c) . The difference between the two constructions is that for the Lorenz curve in eco-nomics one arranges the sources (individuals) in increasing order of productivity (income), while for the
Leimkuhler curve they are arranged in decreasing order. In both cases we plot the cumulative propor-tion of total productivity against the cumulative proportion of sources. In this paper we will use these distinctions to differentiate between Lorenz and Leimkuhler curves. See Burrell (1991) for a demonstration of the equivalence between the two approaches and a justification for the attribution to Leimkuhler.
More formally, let X denote the number of items produced or, more generally, the productivity , of a ran-domly chosen source and suppose that the distribution of X in the population is given by the probability sion and some of the derivations, we will mostly restrict attention to the continuous formulation in what follows. (With a few exceptions, the carryover to the discrete set-up is straightforward.) 1.1. Notation/definitions (i) l  X  E  X  X  X  mean of X  X  (ii) The tail distribution function of X  X  U  X  x  X  X  P  X  X P x  X  X  (iii) The tail -moment distribution function of X  X  W  X  x  X  X  half-line. [ Note: The investigation of the relationship between the probability density functions f and g constitute what Egghe (2003) termed  X  X  X ype/token-taken X  X  informetrics but as Burrell (2003) pointed out this is most naturally done via Leimkuhler curves, as we shall be doing in what follows.]
The Leimkuhler curve is then given by W = L ( U ) which is the plot of W on the vertical axis against U on ing at (1,1).
Example 1 ( Exponential distribution ). The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution with a single (scale) parameter, k &gt; 0, and pdf f ( x )= k e k x Leimkuhler curve is given by
Note that this is independent of the parameter k . This is to be expected since, as noted, it is a scale c then the Leimkuhler curves of X and Y coincide. Thus the exponential family has a single Leimkuhler and the line of reflection/symmetry U + W =1.

Example 2 ( Pareto distribution ). In its simplest, original form the Pareto pdf can be written Routine calculus (see, e.g. Burrell, 1992c ) then gives the Leimkuhler curve as Note that here the curve does depend on the parameter a &gt; 1. This again should be expected since the
Pareto parameter is not a scale parameter but a shape parameter. Hence each member of the Pareto family gives rise to a different Leimkuhler curve. For examples see Fig. 1 (b). Again we have included the line of equality and the line of symmetry.

We have already remarked that the Leimkuhler curve is scale invariant. The converse is also true, i.e. if X and Y have the same Leimkuhler curves then their distributions are the same up to a change of scale, as can be seen from the following result, possibly originally demonstrated by Thompson (1976) but see also Ar-nold (1987) .
 Proposition 1. The Leimkuhler curve determines the productivity distribution (up to a change of scale). Proof ( Adapted from Lambert (2001) ).

The result follows. (Actually, in the above we need to be careful about the support of the distribution and its end-points but such technical points need not concern us here. From the practical/intuitive point of view, the important thing is that productivity distributions and their Leimkuhler representations are essentially equivalent.) Notes: (a) The striking X  X nd delightful! X  X esult of the Proposition is that it is the shape of the from which it derives. (b) An interesting corollary of the result follows from (5) by noting that L
U = W . h Example 3. From the form of the Leimkuhler curve given by (3) , we find But from Proposition 1 this is equal to x / l where l &gt; 0 is the (arbitrary) mean. Hence we have
The reader is invited to do the confirmatory calculations using the second derivative but it is interesting to note that in this example, the distribution can be recovered directly from knowledge of the slope of the Leimkuhler curve.

Example 4. To recover the distribution from the Leimkuhler curve of the Pareto distribution given in (4) , we again use the Proposition. Note first that from (4) we find Now using the first part of the Proposition we find, after a little manipulation, that and then it follows that a /( a 1). Again we leave consideration of the second derivative to the reader.

Remark. Actually, the proof of the Proposition implies rather more than the Proposition itself states, namely that given any curve satisfying the requirements of a Leimkuhler curve does allow, at least in prin-ciple, a productivity distribution X  X n fact a scale-parameter family of distributions X  X hich would give the simple functional form for the Leimkuhler curve does not necessarily allow the underlying form of the dis-2. Power transformations
The above discussion suggests a simple method to generate  X  X  X ew productivity distributions from old X  X  by choosing a suitable transformation of a known Leimkuhler curve. For instance:
Proposition 2. Let W =L( U ) be a given Leimkuhler curve, then L provided
Proof (i) Clearly, L b (0) = 0, L b (1) = 1, so the curve passes through the origin and (1,1). (iii) L 00 b  X  U  X  X  b  X  b 1  X  L  X  U  X   X  b 2  X   X  L 0  X  U  X  X  For concavity, we require this second derivative to be negative. The term outside the brackets on the
RHS is positive so, after a little algebra on the term within the brackets, we find the condition to be Combining this with the result of (ii) gives the required expression.

Example ( Pareto distribution ). As shown above, the general form for the Leimkuhler curve for a Pareto distribution is W = L ( U )= U ( a 1)/ a . Thus the power transformation is
This is a power function and hence is the Leimkuhler curve for a Pareto distribution of order c if
A little algebra shows that this requires firstly that and, since we must have c &gt; 1, then b &gt; 0. The upper limit given by (6) reduces to b &lt; a /( a 1). Remarks. (a) Let us consider the same power transformation for an exponential distribution, i.e.
This Leimkuhler curve is not of an immediately recognisable form, indeed if we try to apply Proposition 1 to recover the underlying distribution we get a functional equation that cannot be solved by elementary this range, note that
Using Proposition 2 we find that we must have, using (6) , that
The function on the right hand side is increasing in ln U and hence approaches its minimum value as ln U !1 . The minimum value is then 1 and we have that the power transformation is valid for the expo-nential distribution only for 0 &lt; b &lt;1. (b) In a pair of papers that warrant further consideration, Basu (1992, 1995) introduced what she termed the random hierarchical distribution and its generalisation. The former is, as remarked earlier, nothing parameter generalisation, is essentially a power transformation of a geometric distribution expressed in our notation, b = 2. It is clear that this is not valid since the resulting curve is not concave. (c) The power transformation discussed above parallels a similar approach suggested by Sarabia,
Castillo, and Slottje (1999) for generating new Lorenz curves via power (and other) transformations of given Lorenz curves. These ideas carry over and give new methods for generating Leimkuhler curves from known ones including the power transformation described above. It is interesting to note that although this sort of construction has recently received much attention in econometrics, a particular case had already been considered in informetrics by Basu (1992, 1995) . 3. Leimkuhler ordering with the smaller parameter dominates the other (see Fig. 1 (b)). (We will come across other families having this Leimkuhler dominance ordering property in later sections.) The Pareto family can be considered to be just a special case of a power transformation family. Starting with any Leimkuhler curve, L ( U ), we have that for any (allowable) power transformation L b ( U ), either L or L b &gt;1or b &lt;1.

Note that this idea of one curve dominating another does not determine an ordering of all Leimkuhler (see Fig. 1 (a) and (b)).

Another sort of transformation that can be considered is that of the original variable X . We have the following:
Theorem (Jakobsson X  X ellman). Let g be a real function which is non-negative and monotone increasing and let Y = g(X) be such that X and Y both have finite means. Then if g(x)/x is monotone on the range of X, the decreasing.

Rousseau, 1990 ) but has also previously been referred to as  X  X  X inked X  X  informetric processes; see Rousseau (1992a) and Burrell (1992d) . Simple and natural examples for g are power, exponential and logarithmic functions; see Burrell (1992a) . It would seem that there are several lines of enquiry that could usefully be pursued in this area. 4.  X  X  X elf-symmetry X  X  of the Leimkuhler curve
When looking at a Leimkuhler curve, the first consideration is how it compares with the 45  X  -degree line, population of sources, for instance by means of the Gini coefficient which looks at the area between the tion/rotation of the Leimkuhler curve in/around the other diagonal U + W = 1. As an example, Fig. 2 shows exponential and Pareto families all fail. In fact this can be easily demonstrated by using the following: Lemma. A necessary condition for self-symmetry is U ( l )+ W ( l )=1.

Proof. Clearly for self-symmetry we must have that the curve is parallel to the main diagonal U = W where the curve crosses the other diagonal U + W = 1. Thus we need L we have already seen that L 0 ( U )=1 () x = l . Thus it is necessary that U ( x )+ W ( x )=1 at x = l ,as required.
 As an example, consider the exponential distribution with mean l = 1. Then (see Burrell, 1992c ), and when x = l =1,RHS=3e 1 &gt; 1, which confirms that the exponential family does not have the self-symmetry property. Similar calculations settle the case for the Pareto family, where we find U ( l )+ W ( l )&lt;1. h
Remark. Damgaard and Weiner (2000) suggest using S = U ( l )+ W ( l ) as an asymmetry coefficient for Lor-enz/Leimkuhler curves. The basic idea uses the previously mentioned result that the slope of the curve equals 1 at x = l . If this occurs  X  X  X bove X  X  the line U + W = 1 then this suggests concentration is towards the lower end of the distribution, if  X  X  X elow X  X  then towards the upper end. (Note how this interpretation For instance, take two different self-symmetric curves crossing the line of symmetry at the same point.
From these, we can construct a new Leimkuhler curve that coincides with the first below the line of sym-metry and with the second above the line of symmetry.
 The formal requirement for self-symmetry is given by the following: Definition. The Leimkuhler curve W = L ( U ) is self-symmetric if and only if
This follows from the geometry of self-symmetry where reflection in the line U + W = 1 takes the point ( U , W ) to the point (1 W ,1 U ). 5. Examples of self-symmetric distributions 5.1. Singh X  X addala distribution
The Singh X  X addala is a flexible three-parameter distribution that has been widely used in the economics age data. The general pdf of the Singh X  X addala distribution is given by
The parameter b is a scale parameter and, as we are here only concerned with the Leimkuhler curve, we can take b = 1. In the special case where, in addition, q =( a + 1)/ a , the pdf reduces to f  X  x  X  X  is not too difficult to derive the Leimkuhler curve as (This can also be derived as a special case of a family of curves derived by Rasche, Gaffney, Koo, and Obst (1980) .)
Examples of the Leimkuhler curve as in (10) are given in Fig. 3 . Note that this reduced Singh X  X addala family satisfies the Leimkuhler dominance ordering, with dominance increasing with q . Note also that these curves certainly appear self-symmetric. This is confirmed by the following:
Proposition 3. The family of Leimkuhler curves given by ( 10 ) above are self-symmetric. Proof. We will use the definition of self-symmetry given by (8) so consider
Hence the curve is self-symmetric according to (8) . h 5.2. Lognormal distribution The random variable X is said to have a lognormal distribution with parameters h and r if ln X has a
Normal distribution with mean h and variance r 2 . Thus the pdf of X is given by and we write X LN ( h , r 2 ). It is well known that the mean of this distribution is given by E [ X ]= l = exp( h + r 2 /2).

The lognormal distribution has been used in various ways in informetric modelling, most notably in cita-tion age studies. See Egghe and Ravichandra Rao (1992) , Gupta (1998) and Burrell (2002) .
From its definition, we have that the tail-moment pdf is given by i.e. the pdf of LN ( h + r 2 , r 2 ) so that the mean is
Remark. Although we have explicit expressions for the density functions, these do not lead to explicit
Leimkuhler curve. However, many readily available computer packages allow the computation of the cumulative distribution function X  X nd hence the tail distribution function X  X f any lognormal distribution the Leimkuhler curve is concerned there is no loss of generality in taking it equal to 1, equivalently take examples, using the Lorenz formulation, see Kleiber and Kotz (2003, p. 116) .
From such graphs it is apparent that the lognormal family satisfies the Leimkuhler dominance ordering, definition to check this. Instead we make use of the following:
Theorem (Kendall). A pdf f(x) gives rise to a self-symmetric Leimkuhler curve if and only if it can be expressed in the form Proof. See Kendall (1956) .

To apply this to the lognormal case, we can write the pdf (11) as
This satisfies the requirements of Kendall  X  s Theorem and we can conclude that the lognormal distribution has a self-symmetric Leimkuhler curve. h 5.3. Dagum distribution Another three-parameter distribution widely used to describe income distributions is one introduced by
Dagum (1977) . Again this is a distribution that may be useful in modelling citation age data, but we leave consideration of this to another time. The pdf of the Dagum distribution may be written At first sight, this might seem to be simply a reparametrisation of the Singh X  X addala distribution in (9). then 1/ X has a Singh X  X addala distribution and vice versa. They are both members of the family of distri-butions originally introduced by Burr (1942) .

If we consider the special case where p =1 1/ a and b = 1. (Again b is a scale parameter so there is no loss of generality when we consider the Leimkuhler curve.) The pdf then reduces to f  X  x  X  X  tunately the Leimkuhler curve cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions so we cannot use the metric Leimkuhler curve. The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.

Remark. In the early days of informetrics, Leo Egghe (1990) propounded a formal structure in terms of what he called information production processes (IPPs) describing the relationship between items and sources; see Egghe and Rousseau (1990) for a summary. Although this has now been mostly supplanted by representations as brought out, somewhat indirectly, in Egghe (1992), Rousseau (1992b) and Burrell (1993) .
As an aside, Burrell (1993) further showed that, if we write H ( U )= L (1 U ), then the self-symmetry and Weiner (2000) argued in favour of its use as supporting a lognormal model, we would prefer rather more direct support! 6. Concluding remarks
In this paper we have focussed on the geometric rather than the concentration aspects of the Leimkuhler tion in informetrics. Two that we would draw particular attention to are the uses of the power transforma-tion and applications of the Singh X  X addala and Dagum distributions. For the former, we have noted that proved fit via the Leimkuhler curve to data that would traditionally have been presented via a Bradford
Bradford we would argue that the former should hold sway. In particular, it would seem that Basu  X  s power transformation idea warrants further investigation.

In this paper we have been concerned with the graphical presentation, via the Leimkuhler curve, of pro-information sources, various standard families of probability distributions X  X ncluding exponential, Pareto, lognormal, Weibull and log-logistic X  X ave been considered; see e.g. Egghe and Ravichandra Rao (1992),
Gupta (1998) and Burrell (2002) . Given their flexible nature and their success in modelling income distri-butions, consideration of the Singh X  X addala and Dagum families could well prove fruitful in modelling such distributions also. Leimkuhler representations of such distributions appear not to have been consid-ered in the literature.

One important application of the Leimkuhler curve X  X s a representation of productivity concentra-tion X  X as not been considered directly here. Such applications, via the Gini coefficient or index, can be found discussed in such as Burrell (1991, 1992c, 2005) .
