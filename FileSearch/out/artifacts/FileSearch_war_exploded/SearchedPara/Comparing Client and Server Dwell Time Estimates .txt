 Click dwell time is the amount of time that a user spends on a clicked search result. Many previous studies have shown that click dwell time is strongly correlated with result-level satisfaction and document relevance. Accurate estima tes of dwell time are therefore important for applicatio ns such as search satisfaction prediction and result ranking. However, dwell time can be estimated in different ways according to the information available about the search pro-cess. For example, a result reached for the query [Garfield] may involve 145s of  X  X erver-side X  dwell time (observable to the search engine) and 40s of  X  X lient-side X  dwell time (observable from the browser). Since search engines can only observe server-side actions (i.e., activity on the search engine result page), server-side dwell times are estimated by measuring the time between a search result click and the next search event (click or query). Conversely, more detailed information about page dwell times can be obtained via client-side methods such as Web browser toolbars. The client-side information enables the estimation of more accurate dwell times by measuring the amount of time that a user spends on pages of interest (either the landing page, or pages on the full navigation trail). In this paper, we define three different dwell times, i.e., server-side, client-side, and trail dwell time, and examine their effectiveness for pre-dicting click satisfaction. For this , we collect toolbar and search engine logs from real users, and provide an analysis of dwell times for improving prediction performance. Moreover, we show further improvements in predicting click-level satisfaction by combining dwell times with other query f eatures (e.g., query clarity).

 Keywords: Dwell time analysis; Click satisfaction. Click dwell time (the time that the user spends on a clicked search result) is one of the most importa nt implicit measures for improving web search quality [5][15]. Previous work found that this feature is strongly correlated with result-leve l satisfaction and document rele-vance [5]. To identify satisfied ( SAT ) clicks, longer dwell time on a clicked page has been considered as a positive signal, e.g., a click is regarded as SAT if its dwell time equals or exceeds 30 seconds [5]. ing landing page dwell times. Additionally, we utilize these dwell time variants for predicting click-level satisfaction and study the relative utility of server-side, clie nt-side, and trail dwell times for this task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study and compare the various dwell times estimated by server-side and client-side search information. Previous work has extensively st udied the utility of implicit feed-back (e.g., dwell time, scrolling, clicks) as a relevance estimator, e.g., [1][10]. These studies have found that dwell time is an im-portant feature for inferring search relevance. In addition, other researchers have analyzed dwe ll time to understand browsing be-havior or predict click-level satisfaction (e.g., [12][13]). Liu et al. [13] applied Weibull analysis to estimate the underlying distribu-tions of given dwell time data, and more recently Kim et al. [12] proposed a method to model dwell time data based on query-click attributes such as query type, the reading difficulty of clicked pages, and the topical classification of those pages. Research on modeling search satisfaction based on search activity such as clicks and their dwell times is also relevant (e.g., [4][5][7]). Hassan et al. [7] proposed user behavior models for predicting task-level search success. They recognized behavior patterns from la-beled data, and built Markov models to measure the likelihood of each pattern. Moreover, Kim et al. [12] used discriminative models which combine various satisfaction features such as dwell time, topics on clicked pages, and query performance predictors [3][8]. Given the association between search activity and satisfaction mod-eling, we utilize satisfaction prediction as the application domain for our experiments with different dwell time estimation methods. Our click data was sampled from the logs of consenting users of a browser toolbar distributed by the Microsoft Bing search engine. The logs contained web search activities (e.g., queries submitted, subsequent result clicks, etc.). Th e logs were sampled from the U.S. English locale to reduce geographic and linguistic variations in search behavior. Access to these logs enabled the computation of client-side and trail dwell times on clicked search results. Each log entry contained search actions including query submission, search result clicks (i.e., SERP clicks), revisits to the SERP, and other result clicks (e.g., clicks followin g the search result click). Accord-ingly, the timestamp of each logged action is recorded, and using this timing information, we can esti mate the server-side, client-side, and trail dwell times for each SERP click as follows: Server-side dwell time : A server-side dwell time is calculated by measuring the time between a SERP click and the next interaction with the search engine (query or click). If the user is interleaving search with other tasks (e.g. checking email), we would not be able to determine how much time was actually spent on the clicked page (vs. on pages related to other tasks). Also if the user never returns to the engine, we would not be able to compute dwell time. Client-side dwell time : A client-side dwell time is measured by estimating the time between the clic k and the page unload time (i.e. closing the page or navigating to a nother page). Note that the client-side dwell time, while more accurate than the server-side dwell time, does not take into consideration of periods where the page is open but the user is distracted and is not actively attending to the page. Trail dwell time : Given a SERP click, we assume that its search trail consists of the clicked pages and all subsequent page visits originating from clicks on hyperlinks on the clicked page or other We conduct experiments to analyze se rver-side, client-side, and trail dwell times. For this, we develop the click classification model described in Section 4, and examine the effectiveness of dwell times as features for the classification. We first describe how to set up the experiments and then provide their results. As described in Section 3, our c lick data contains 3,204 labeled instances (50% SAT and 50% DSAT ). Our objective is given a query, an associated result click, and diff erent estimates of dwell time on that clicked page, predicting whether the click is satisfied (SAT) or dissatisfied (DSAT). For our learning algorithm, we used Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) [6], and performed 10-fold cross-validation using random partitioning. Our experiments revealed that the results are fairly insensitive to the choice of learning algorithm. For evaluation purposes we measure Precision, Recall, and F1-score for each class. In addition, accura cy (i.e., weighted precision) is used to compute overall classification performance. To analyze the three types of dwe ll times, we first perform the clas-sification using only a single dwell time feature. Table 2 shows the results from this task. From the table it is clear that trail dwell time performs significantly better than th e others in many metrics (e.g., accuracy and DSAT F1). Trail dwell time seems to more accurately capture the true utility that search ers derived from the click, and hence their satisfaction with the click. We also notice that the client-side dwell time estimate performs poorly and is out-performed by the server-side dwell time estimate s. We believe that server-side dwell time performs better because it is a better estimate of the dwell time of the entire search tr ail when compared to client-side dwell time which only considers the time spent on the clicked page, independent of any follow-on activity by the searcher. Interestingly, client-side dwell ti me performs better only in terms of DSAT recall. We believe that client-side and trail dwell times are better than server-side dwell time in terms of DSAT recall because typically dissatisfied pages are less likely to lead to a long trail and more likely to result in the user re turning to the SERP to rewrite the query, and then click on another result or abandon the search. Since client-side instrumentation is more likely to result in a better esti-mate of the time spent of the clicked page only, we notice that it outperforms server-side estimates for DSAT recall. In other words, for satisfied clicks what matters is not only the time spent on the click but also the time spent on all page visits originating from it resulting in a better performance for trail and server-side dwell time estimates. Conversely, for dissatisfied clicks the accurate dwell time of the click only is more important resulting in better performance for both the trail-and client-side estimates of dwell time. Table 3 depicts the mean average and standard deviation for each of the dwell time estimates over the click data used in our study. From Table 3, we can observe that the average difference between SAT and DSAT client-side dwell times is much smaller (i.e., 3.58 vs Category Feature Click dwell time 
Query performance predictor 132.24), which means that client-side dwell time might be less dis-criminative as a classification feature. Another interesting observation is that the mean server-side dwell time is similar to the mean trail dwell time (see Table 3). This fur-ther explains why server-side dw ell time outperforms client-side dwell time in Table 2. In addition, we believe that server-side dwell time is often over-estimated but it is more effective in predicting SAT clicks than client-side dwell time since it captures activity on the navigation trail beyond the clicked page. Next we conduct experi ments by grouping together different types of dwell time features (e.g., using both server-side and client-side dwell times). Table 4 presents the results of these experiments. The addition of each dwell time varian t appears to positively impact classification performance. For example, the results for  X  X +T X  (cli-ent-side + trail dwell times) are bette r than when client-side or trail dwell time are used in isolati on (see Table 2). In accordance with this, the highest performance is ach ieved when all three dwell times are combined. In addition, client -side dwell time becomes more useful when it is combined with trail dwell time, perhaps because this better captures the usefulness of the landing page. In our final experiment, we combin ed the dwell time features with query features used previously to predict click satisfaction [12] (See the  X  X uery performance prediction X  category in Table 1). All exper-iments in this paper thus far have used only dwell time features. In this analysis we combine dwell ti me estimates with the query fea-tures. Table 5 shows those result s and those from a baseline that uses only the query features to pred ict satisfaction. As shown in the table, dwell time features can lead significant improvements over the query performance predictors. We also note that dwell-time only features can outperform query-only features (e.g., the query features accuracy is 0.6344, see Table 5, co mpared to an accuracy of 0.6722 ( X  X +C+T X  system in Table 4). This clearly illustrates the important role of dwell time in modeling search satisfaction. In this paper, we compared three different ways to estimate dwell times (server-side, client-side, and trail) for the task of predicting click-level search satisfaction. Se rver-side dwell time is calculated by using only search actions in search engine results pages (SERPs). However, the other dwell times ar e measured by client-side infor-mation (i.e. the actual time pages are open in the browser). While client-side dwell time measures the time spent on only initially clicked result pages (i.e., the clicked pages displayed in a SERP), trail dwell time also considers th e following clicks originating from the initial click (i.e., the relevant pages not shown in a SERP but visited on the navigation trail following a SERP click). To collect click data, we sampled from toolbar and search logs from a com-mercial search engine, and employed human assessors to review search behavior and identify SAT and DSAT clicks. Using this data, we estimated the dwell time on clic ked results using the three dwell time techniques, and developed a classification model to recognize click satisfaction by featurizing dwell times and search queries. In experiments, we found that tr ail dwell time performs the best in predicting click satisfaction. We al so found that server-side dwell time is better than client-side dw ell time. Server-side dwell time also has the advantage that it is computable for all users of the search engine and does not require any client-side instrumentation. This suggests that using trail dw ell time is the best option when client-side information is availabl e, but when it is not available server-side dwell time is a useful alternative.
