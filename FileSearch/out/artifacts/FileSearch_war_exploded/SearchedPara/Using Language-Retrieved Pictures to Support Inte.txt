 Group brainstorming is a comm only practiced technique to enhance creative outcomes. A close observation of group brainstorming suggests that ensuring the abundance and diversity of stim uli available in brainstorm ing sessions is critical. Cultural differences in knowledge and pers pectives are valuable sources for diversity , while cultural disc repancy in communication sty les and language may impede knowledge sharing. My dissertation res earch aim s to reconcile the tension between the benefits and obstacles of intercultural brains torm ing with pictures that are triggered by verbal ideas. Pict ures provide extra stimulation without explicitly interrupting norm al com munication. Pictures may also mediate concepts in a language-independent manner, which m ay com plem ent the still im perfect m achine translation and make cross-lingual brainstorming feasible. H5.3 Group and Organization Interface: Com puter-supported cooperative work Design, Experimenta tion, Human Factors Intercultural collaboration, computer-mediated communication, group brainstorming, creativity support tools Group brainstorming is a teamwo rk technique for enhancing creativity commonly practiced in organizations. In group brainstorming, group members are encouraged to openly share ideas they think of without worry ing too early about whether thes e ideas are useful or not. The goal is to accum ulate an abundance of ideas first. Quantity may breed quality , so something useful and original may eventually come out through the proces s [3] . In theory , overhearing other peopl e X  X  ideas may help individuals expand their vision and imagina tion, allowing group members to synthesize new ideas that they can never think of individually by exchanging thoughts and combini ng different perspectives. However, the stim ulating utility of overhearing other people X  X  ideas depends on the quantity and quality of available stim uli (i.e., ideas shared in groups). When perceived evaluation pressure (e.g., worry ing that peers won X  X  like the ideas) is great, individuals may not be willing to openly share their ideas [3] . W hen ideas contributed by group members are too few or too similar, the possibility for people to think of unique ideas may decrease due to low stimulation. Consequently , the group may fall into a vicious circle of clich X , genera ting only variations on the same idea. Intercultural brainstorming groups consisting of group members with m ulticultural com positions ha ve the potential to brainstorm better, because cultural differences in knowledge and perspectives may im prove the diversity of ideas and stim uli available. However, the com municative barriers between different cultures could also be large. Non-fluenc y in using a second language to express ideas and withholding of id eas due to evaluation concerns could be common. In my dissertation research, I propose to support intercultural brainstorming with IdeaExpander, a system that augm ents regular brainstorming with extra pictor ial stim uli retrieved based on verbalized ideas [5] . As a com munication channel, pictures are with properties different from la nguage. In general, language may im plem ent propositions com positionally to convey ideas precisely . Pictures, on the other hand, may provide a rich y et ambiguous visual context to enable divers e, m ultiple interpretations in a language-independent manner. Th e paper provides an overview about how language and pictures may be coordinated to cross language and communicative gaps in intercultural groups. It is observed that pictures may benefit intercultural brainstorm ing in s everal as pects . First, presenting pictures to a ugment verbal ideas may provide multiple topics at once (i.e., with a single picture). For exam ple, a picture containing the concept of  X  car X  m ay introduce other topics through the visual context, such as the color of the car, the street view and the traffic patte rn etc. A language statement, on the other hand, ty pically has a narrower conceptual scope (e.g.,  X  X here is a red car X ). W ith cultural differences in attention and perception (e.g., East Asians distributing attention to background objects, while Americans focusing more on the foreground [4] ), a picture may be read and expanded in m ultiple way s and create a valuable basis for conceptual diversity . Second, in terms of communica tive sty les, individuals from a collectivistic culture m ay be more sensitive to evaluative pressure from peers , and thus m ay be les s com fortable to s hare their ideas openly . By using pictures as a communicative channel, one possible design is to provide a separate input interface for group members to enter ideas privately when s haring them precis ely and directly in language may be culturally inappropriate. The sy stem then retrieves pictures based on both public and private ideas. The design allows people to influen ce others X  ideation without making public s tatem ents . Third, pictures are language -independent and thus people speaking different native languages m ay still influence each other through pictures. This is especia lly an important merit of using pictures because com municating across languages is arguably difficult and the current m achine translation technology is still im perfect where trans lation errors are com mon. P ictures m ay provide a visual context to complement and support machine trans lation-m ediated brains torm ing. Showing a car picture to complement broken translations of statements about cars may more effectively stim ulate ideation than having the trans lations alone, as the later would require people to take efforts to parse and understand. The idea of augmenting brainstormi ng conversations with pictures has been prototy ped in [5] . Figure 1 shows both a screenshot and the high-level architecture of this prototy pe, which retrieves pictures based on the content of ongoing conversations. Participants use a chat window on the right side of the window, while the sy stem display s pictures it chooses based on the conversation on the left. The main sy stem components include: Language processor . IdeaExpander m onitors the chat to identify currently activated concepts in the conversation. Because brainstorming conversations in clude both on-task and off-task whether a rem ark contains an idea or not. Pictur e r etriever . IdeaExpander uses key words drawn from rem arks clas sified as containi ng ideas to retrieve candidate pictures to show. The initial prototy pe used a labeled picture database specific to the tasks, but the end goal is to be able to use datasets such as Google images . The sy stem matches remarks it retrieve a relevant set of pictures. Picture chooser. The system then chooses pictures that will optim ize cognitive stim ulation. Here, a utility score is com puted that prefers pictures that m ay stim ulate m any ideas and ideas that are less likely to be generated. An initial evaluation of the prototy pe shows that IdeaExpander improved productivity in a mono-cultural context [5] . The early prototy pe dem ons trated that IdeaExpander is a technology that can be actually built and applied to support brainstorming. This prototy pe, however, focused solely on using pictures to provide extra stimul ation, and did not look at other beneficial uses of pictures in th e linguistic and social aspects. One m ain next s tep of the dis sertation res earch is to focus on using pictures to bridge langua ge and communicative gaps, and enabling people to brainstorm in native languages. To implement this, I propose to combine IdeaExpa nder with machine translation tools, such as the services o ffered by NICT X  X  Language Grid project [2] . In this cross-lingual version of IdeaExpander, ideas shared to the chatroom will be processed in two way s. First, the inputted ideas will be translated by machine translation. So people speaking a different language will see translated ideas. Second, the inputs will also be sent to IdeaExpander for retrieving relevant pictures as vis ual s tim uli. How to s earch the s et of pictures with multilingual queries is a technical issue related to m ultilingual inform ation retrieval (cf. [1] ). A sim ple solution sufficient for the purposes of prototy ping and evalua tion may be to index pictures with m ultilingual tags. I propose to conduct an experimental study to examine of effects of IdeaExpander in the context of m achine trans lation-m ediated brainstorming. In the experiment , participants from two different cultures (e.g., Am erican and Chinese) will brainstorm in dy ads by talking either in a common language (e.g., English) or in their native languages (e.g., English and Chinese) that will then be translated by machine translation. Each dy ad will work on two sessions, one with IdeaExpander and one without. The experim ental design will em pirically verify whether poor machine translation harms brainstorming or not, and if so, whether IdeaExpander helps to improve the performance. Another direction is to investigate the effects of providing people two input areas simultaneously , one public and one private, for them to contribute their ideas . Ideas inputted to the public area will be sent to the chatroom without modification, while those pictures to show. This will help to answer whether cultures differ in selecting where to submit ideas and whether conversational topics (e.g., sensitive issues) influence such behaviors.
