 1. Introduction
The first scientific journals appeared in the 16th century, but the systematic practice of citation was popularized later ( Nicolaisen, 2007 ). With the rapid development of science and technology, researchers have begun to pay more attention tions automatically and conveniently. Thereafter, some important contents and concepts of citation analysis were proposed, promoted the popularization of citation analysis. In the network environment, Webometrics ( Almind &amp; Ingwersen, 1997 ) and Altmetrics ( Wouters &amp; Costas, 2012 ) were proposed, and a new era of the development of citation analysis began.  X 
Currently, citation analysis is widely used in scientific evaluation, scholarly communication reveal, academic behavior anal-ysis, and information retrieval ( Garfield, 1983; Hammarfelt, 2011; Ketzler &amp; Zimmermann, 2013 ).

Citation analysis is the method of examining the frequency, patterns, and graphs of citations in articles and books ( Garfield, 1983 ). However, the development of citation analysis was accompanied by a controversy regarding its effective-vation, deficient citing process, disadvantageous citation analysis methods and data, and limited citation application ple statistical analysis of citation frequency, citation weighted analysis involving Eigenfactors, and a combination of other factors, such as H-index combining citation frequency and paper number ( Bergstrom, 2007; Price, 1965; Yang, Han, Ding, of the mechanism and curves of the citation distribution model in general ( Redner, 1998; Rodr X guez-Navarro, 2011; ple, impact factor is a result of combining spatial and temporal analyses. Ding, Liu, Guo, and Cronin (2013) studied specific ied the geographical knowledge diffusion and spatial diversity by exploring and investigating the spatial properties of cita-tion distances and patterns. Fourth, some researchers have explored the breadth of citation distribution at the macro level. ity of online research (older and recent). Larivi X re, Gingras, and Archambault (2009) challenged the conclusion of Evans by analyzing the changes in the concentration of citations received within 2 and 5 years by papers published between 1900 and 2005. Their results showed that the dispersion of citations is increasing. The conclusions of Yang, Ma, Song, and Qiu (2010) breadth and depth of citation distribution at the micro level and lack indicators that measure the breadth and depth of citation. Thus, we should pay attention to these indicators to strengthen and validate citation distribution analysis ( Yang et al., 2012 ). 2. 4D model of citation distribution
We argue that citation distribution can be divided into four dimensions, namely, spatial, temporal, breadth, and depth distribution. Citation analysis can also be studied in general regardless of the four dimensions, which integrate citations frequency statistics, citations weighted analysis, citations network analysis, and research citations related to the topic (see Fig. 1 ).
 Spatial and temporal distribution are universal. Temporal distribution is the variation in distribution related to time. position in space. In citation analysis, spatial distribution is not limited to geographical space and can be extended to the relationship between various knowledge units, such as country, organization, and journal. The distribution laws of bibliometrics proposed by Bradford, Lotka, and Zipf belong to this type ( Wilson, 2000 ). Furthermore, the networks of scien-tific papers can have a metaphor for topographic maps. According to Price (1963),  X  X  X with] such a topography established, one could perhaps indicate the overlap and relative importance of journals and, indeed, of countries, authors, or individual papers by the place they occupied within the map. X  X  In citation analysis, numerous indicators, such as impact factor, Eigen-factor, and H-index, can be used to measure spatial and temporal distribution.

Breadth and depth are significant factors of citation distribution. Several studies have investigated the curve represented that can be represented through the width and number of lines or edges, respectively. The breadth and depth of citation dis-links to other works or researchers. This type of analysis is one of the most widely used bibliometric methods. A citation influence deeply the knowledge structure of another scholar. The specific knowledge or scholars can be repeatedly cited by another scholar, thereby forming the depth of influence. However, with the development of inter-disciplines, scholars may widely adopt more extensive knowledge from various areas or academic knowledge, which form the width effect of citation.
In the digital and network environment, an increasing number of journals and papers have been made available online by the retrieved and accessed by scholars, and thus, numerous studies can be cited ( Larivi X re et al., 2009 ). However, the articles referenced tended to be more recent as more journal issues came online, and as a result, fewer journals and articles were obvious differences in the breadth and depth of citation distribution. 3. Indices X , Y , and XY
The breadth and depth of citation distribution are easy to understand. However, the principal issue is the proper use of tion analysis proposes breadth and depth as the relevant dimensions along which a citation distribution can be described quite conveniently by Indices X , Y , and XY . 3.1. Index X
Breadth is studied by analyzing the citation scope of a special knowledge unit in a certain scientific field, for example, an author or a journal. The concept of breadth hints that the knowledge unit influences the widening range of other knowledge.
Index X , which represents the breadth of citation distribution, is the number of different knowledge units that cite special knowledge units. Index X is considered a special and independent measure of citation distribution. Index X concerns the number of different knowledge units, say, authors, that cite a specific author. The lines in Fig. 2 represent citation. Index X can be represented through the number of lines, whereas index Y can be represented through the maximum width of lines. two different degrees. One is the in-degree, which is the number of incoming edges, and the other is the out-degree, which is the number of outgoing edges. Accordingly, index X has two values, namely, index X right and left side in Fig. 2 , respectively. 3.2. Index Y
Depth is studied by analyzing the degree to which a knowledge unit cites another knowledge unit. For example, an author unit on another knowledge unit. Index Y , which represents the depth of citation distribution, is the maximum number of citations among several knowledge units that refer to specific knowledge units. However, why is the maximum number of citation received/reference made by a specific knowledge unit (e.g., journal and author) a measure of depth? Why would
Y be the maximum number of citations and not the sum? First, citation analyses have been based on how many times the deeply influenced the former. The maximum number of citation received/reference made by a specific unit, which represents the maximum effect of a knowledge unit. However, a special person is influenced by different knowledge in different degrees. More influence implies more citations. Second, scholars often pay more attention to the maximum number of cita-tion than the sum in bibliometrics because the maximum value is more statistically significant. For instance, index H syn-thesizes the maximum number of citations and publications. The sum of citation/reference has been widely used, but it cannot distinguish and measure the breadth and depth of citation distribution. For example, Author B1 and Author C1 ref-erenced Author A1 twice and thrice, respectively; Author B2, Author C2, Author D2, and Author E2 referenced Author A2 once, once, twice, and once, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Overall, the number of times authors A1 and A2 were cited is the same. curve. We discuss the related content in the fourth paragraph in Section 4.2.1 . 3.3. Index XY Index X represents the influence scope of citation distribution, whereas index Y represents the influence degree or level. The influence of knowledge units has different characteristics, that is, some are good at breadth and some are good at depth.
For example, a universal knowledge can be referenced through knowledge of more different kinds, whereas these citations of a specialized and particular knowledge are concentrated in a few knowledge units. How is statistics measured and conducted of citing units and the number of citations that reference special knowledge units. If one has two numbers, one can divide them or multiply them or do anything else with them. We argue for dividing them because this indicates the ratio of breadth and depth. A stronger argument in addition to the argument is the shape of the cumulative citation distribution. XY combi-between the Y -axis and XY 1or XY 2in Fig. 3 .
 able and easy. Similarly, we can study the breadth and depth from the perspective of reference or citing, such that X repre-tions exist, they can also be normalized because they are well-known outliers.

Indices X , Y , and XY are useful in measuring citation distribution. These indices can be applied to the productivity and
X , Y , and XY are easy to obtain and represent a single number, which makes them easy to compare. These indices can be found in the Thomson ISI Web of Science database and can even be automatically calculated by citation index databases. For example, the X dimension (breadth) can be observed in the Web of Science database with the Citation Analytic Tool.
The three proposed indices can be used to measure the effect of the work of an individual or a journal, which prevents certain disadvantages of previous indicators of citation analysis. For example, two individuals with a similar H-index are comparable in terms of the calculating breadth and depth scientific influence, even if they have the same total number of citations. Conversely, in comparing two individuals with different total citation counts or H-index values, the individ-ual with the higher H-index or total number of citations does not necessarily perform better in the breadth or depth influ-ence. As Fig. 3 shows, knowledge units at different locations vividly demonstrate the depth and breadth of influence. Thus, certain professional knowledge units (journals or authors) have a relatively narrow effect, whereas others have wide effect. Certain knowledge units (authors) have far-reaching implications on specific areas. Others can have a significant effect on both breadth and depth, which can be easily calculated by index XY , as represented by the slope of A1 and A2 in Fig. 3 .
 The breadth and depth of citation distribution have a wide range and can expand indices X , Y , and XY in numerous aspects.
Knowledge units can comprise different analysis objects in bibliometrics. The width and breadth of citation can be ana-lyzed between different knowledge units, such as scholar, organization, journal, and literature. They can also be analyzed between two papers, such as a paper cited several times by another. Breadth and depth can be combined with time, a measure of the absolute and relative relationship, and can be used to comparatively analyze similarities and differences from the perspective of cited and citing. We can also calculate the relative and absolute values of the breadth and depth of citation distribution. A comprehensive analysis that combines the four dimensions of spatial and temporal, as well as breadth and depth, can also be conducted with Indices X , Y , and XY . 4. Empirical analyses of breadth and depth of journal citation
In this section, we analyze empirically the breadth and depth of citation distribution through Indices X , Y , and XY . This objective can be achieved by addressing the following research questions: Question 1: Can Indices X , Y , and XY reflect the actual breadth and depth of citation distribution? Question 2: Are these breadth and depth indices of citation distribution different?
Question 3: Are these indices different from other bibliometric indicators? Can these indices be replaced by other biblio-metric indicators? 4.1. Dataset
In principle, a knowledge unit can be an article, author, institution, or a set of something. However, we conduct our tion and reference distribution of 84 journals from the  X  X  X nformation science and library science X  X  category. The reference distribution of 84 journals uses the Indices X in , Y in , and XY
X knowledge. These relative values of Indices X , Y , and XY can be obtained by dividing the total number of knowledge units cited in MIS QUART in 2012. The absolute value of X in (1677) is the number of journals cited in MIS QUART in 2012. The rel-ative values of X in (0.35) is the absolute value of X in (432) is the maximum number of citations among all journals cited in MIS QUART in 2012. The number of self-citation in
MIS QUART in 2012 is also 432. The relative values of Y in in MIS QUART. XY in (3.88) is X in / Y in ; the relative values of XY relative low concentration in the reference distribution of a journal. The maximum value of XY which shows LIBR J referenced to a relatively large number of different journals but failed to focus fully on one or several journals.

We often analyze the correlation of two variables by measuring Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients. The Pear-between these variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of statistical dependence between two variables. It is appropriate for both continuous and discrete variables, including ordinal variables. Hence, we select
Spearman correlation coefficient because we are mainly concerned about the numerical rank. 4.2. Results and discussion 4.2.1. Question 1
We analyze the cited and citing distribution of journals to validate whether Indices X , Y , and XY reflect the breadth and 1992 ). Based on JCR, a distribution curve that shows the sum of cumulative citations is a function of the amount of cited journals ( Garfield, 1983 ), which illustrates that the centralized tendency of citation is more obvious than the paper distribution according to Bradford X  X  Law. According to previous statistical data, Garfield conducted a deep exploration and more than 1% of the SCI coverage) were cited in 24% of all references, 152 journals were cited in 50% of all references, 767 journals were cited in 75% of all references, and approximately 2000 were cited in 85% of all references ( Garfield, 1983 ).
We analyze these distributions of journals cited by the 84 journals from the  X  X  X nformation science and library science X  X  highly dispersed among numerous journals.

Eighty-four journals from the category  X  X  X nformation science and library science X  X  are arranged in descending order by impact factor in 2012. Information Processing &amp; Management is an information science journal and ranks 41st, whereas (1.35%). That is, approximately 70% citations are provided by 19% of the journals. However, 30% citations (526) are spread in

 is the number of different knowledge units that cite special knowledge units, as represented by the last point of X axis in
Figs. 4 and 5 . Index Y is the maximum number of citations among several knowledge units that refer to specific knowledge reveals the citation distribution characteristic when considering Y and XY can be diachronically analyzed to present the pattern and evolution of citation distribution in some journals.
Overall, Indices X , Y , and XY are easy to calculate. They reflect the actual breadth and depth of citation distribution. 4.2.2. Question 2
Table 1 and Fig. 7 show the differences among various indicators. Obvious differences exist between the indicators of breadth and width. Symmetric matrices are formed through the Spearman correlation analyses of each index. However,
Fig. 7 does not show symmetric matrices. Correlation values exist between the absolute value of Indices X , Y , and XY and others indices in the upper-right part, whereas correlation values exist between relative values in the bottom-left part.
Fig. 7 presents the Spearman correlation among the indices of citation distribution. Spearman correlation represents the relation of the rank order. First, the absolute and relative values of indices XY of other indices. Most values exhibit a negative correlation. A low correlation (0.298) exists between XY of X in is correlated with Y in (0.689), whereas the relative values of X values of X in are less closely correlated with indices XY correlated with X in ( 0.26) and Yin ( 0.281). Third, the correlation between the absolute values of X (0.762), whereas that between the relative values of X out lated with indices XY out (0.193). Fourth, relatively high correlation is also noted among the absolute values of Indices X
XY in and X out , Y out . The absolute values of Y out is highly correlated with Y maximum number a journal cited another and has been cited by another is often similar, particularly when the maximum the relationship among Indices X in , Y in , XY in and X out 4.2.3. Question 3 Fig. 7 show high correlations among Impact Factor, Eigenfactor, Total reference, and Total citation, especially between Eigenfactor and total citation (Spearman rho = 0.962). This result is consistent with that of Davis (2008) . son rho &gt; 0.9). For example, Eigenfactor are highly correlated with X
X tige is measured by a weighting mechanism in the citation network, which maybe explains that the influence of breadth is correlated with prestige. In addition, total reference is highly correlated with X low or negative correlation with indices XY .

Second, the relative values of Indices X , Y , and XY are weakly correlated with those of other bibliometric indicators, and some of these indices exhibit negative correlation. Some relationships are also weak because the correlations are insignifi-cant at the 0.01 or 0.05 level. 5. Conclusion
This study reports that citation distribution can be generally divided into four dimensions, namely, spatial, temporal, breadth, and depth distribution. We introduce a 4D model of citation distribution. The significance and differences in the breadth and depth of citation distribution are analyzed. With Indices X and Y , index XY is proposed to measure the breadth knowledge units that cite special knowledge units. Index Y , which represents the depth of citation distribution, is the max-imum number of citations among several knowledge units that refer to specific knowledge units. Index XY , which synthet-
Y . Indices X , Y , and XY can be used for the statistical analysis of absolute and relative values in citation and reference distribution.

We analyze empirically the citation and reference distribution of 84 journals under the  X  X  X nformation science and library indices X , Y , and XY , as well as between these indices and other bibliometric indicators. Thus, these indices cannot be total reference, and total citation. However, index XY and the relative values of indices X and Y are a new aspect of other bibliometric indicators. They have low and even negative correlations with other bibliometric indicators. Certain relation-ships between these indices are insignificant at the 0.01 and 0.05 level.

In summary, this study proposes the use of easily computable Indices X , Y , and XY to estimate the breadth and depth of citation distribution. However, further studies must be conducted to verify our results. In the next stage, we intend to con-duct the following: (1) In-depth study at the theoretical level: This study will include citation distribution mechanism, citation motive, valid-(2) Empirical study at different levels: This study will consider the numerous knowledge units in bibliometrics such as (3) Optimization or improvement of these indices: H-index has gained widespread recognition.
