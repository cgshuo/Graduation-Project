 Athulang Mutshewa * 1. Introduction The purpose of this study was to examine the use of information by environmental planners. The study used the
Grounded Theory method to develop a theoretical model that explains the reasons for using information and the factors that motivate such use. Self-empowerment was found to be the main reason for using information by environmental planners.
However, the environmental planner X  X  perceptions and impressions of projects, and experiential knowledge were found to be influencing the self-empowerment behaviours of the planners.

Two main questions guided the study, and they are: (a) What are the critical factors that influence the information activ-ities that help the planners to meaningfully guide the environmental planning process; (b) What is the main theory that ex-plains the information behaviour exhibited by environmental planners committed to the production of environmental plans acceptable to multiple stakeholders? The study used a qualitative research design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data from environmental planners in municipal councils in Botswana. The study used Grounded Theory techniques for analysing the data and developing the model that explains the use of information by the environmental planners. The study highlighted some critical aspects of information behaviour of people working in highly political environments, such as environmental planning. Further, the study makes a modest contribution to furthering our under-standing of the way people approach and handle information, taking into account the context in which information is used. 1.1. Use of information
People engage in a number of activities in relation to information. Examples of such activities are seeking information, searching for information and processing information. We regard information use as the last of these activities in the se-quence and it is the actual indication that information was needed (Choo, Detlor, &amp; Turnbull, 2000 ). The use of information (or information use ) refers to what people do with information after they have acquired it and it involves  X  X  X ngaging mental schemas and emotional responses within a larger social and cultural context X  (Choo et al., 2000: 14 ).

Information is used to satisfy information needs that arise from the  X  X  X roblems, uncertainties, and ambiguities encoun-tered in specific organizational situations and experiences X  (Choo, 1998 ), Taylor (1986) argues that these needs determine the use to which information is going to be put. Consequently, the factors that determine the ways in which people use infor-mation are many and varied because the needs that have to be satisfied are many and varied as well. These factors can be example, studied the impact of various information types in policymaking and found that policy makers prefer information that is produced within their agencies. In their seminal paper in which they analysed some cases of the use of information in previous studies, Feldman and March (1981: 174) made six observations about the gathering and use of information in organisations. They found that:  X  Much of the information that is gathered and communicated has little relevance to decisions that are made.  X  Information is very often used to justify decisions that have been made and is often collected after the decision has been made.  X  Information is often used for purposes for which it was not requested.  X  Much more information is often requested regardless of the information that may be available at the start of the decision-making process.  X  People will complain about the unavailability of information to make a decision while they continue to ignore information that is available.  X  People will often collect more information than they can actually use or expect to use for a decision and the relevance of the available information is not always clear because the decision-makers appear to be constantly needing information, requesting more information while complaining about the inadequacy of the information (p. 174).

Beyer and Trice (1982) and Todd (1999) analysed research on the use of information. They observed that the ways in which people use information can be classified into three categories. These categories are instrumental use , conceptual use and symbolic use . Deshpande and Zaltman (1982) suggest that instrumental use of information refers to a direct application of information for solving a problem or making a decision. Conceptual use of information refers to a situation where the appli-cation or use of information is indirect. Information is used to broaden the user X  X  knowledge base and does not serve a par-ticular project ( Todd, 1999 ).

Symbolic use of information occurs when the user uses information to legitimise his/her views. It presupposes that the information user has a pre-conceived idea that needs to be supported by the available information. Information can be used to support a decision that has already been made (Diamantopoulos &amp; Souchon, 1999; Goodman, 1993; Piercy, 1983 and
Knorr, 1977 ). When people use information in a symbolic way, they may hoard information that does not support their thinking and deliberately reject information that is contrary to what they hold as the correct view. Alternatively, they may just distort the information to suit them. An example of symbolic use of information is when people decide on a project, locate it and thereafter look for information to convince other people to support the project. This may even mean distorting the information to win support for the project. Another example of symbolic use of information is the use of information for political gains (Feldman &amp; March, 1981: 177 ). In such situations, information is used to strengthen the political or power bases of the individuals.

The discussion above shows that information use is complex, and as Vakkari (1996) also notes, it is hardly ever studied in an analytical way. Some of the complications with information use are brought about by its nature, where, for instance avail-ability and uptake of information does not necessarily translate into use. Further, even when used, it is very often difficult to link the outcome to the information that was used. To get around this information use dilemma, Davenport (1997) suggests that information use should studied by analysing the information behaviour of people.
 Information behaviour is a multifaceted construct focusing on some form of people X  X  behaviour in relation to information.
The different facets of information behaviour are the experiencing of information needs, the seeking of information and the using of information ( Wilson, 2000; Allen, 1996 and Choo et al., 2000). Devanport (1997: 83) defines information behaviour as  X  X  X ow people approach and handle information. This includes searching for it, using it, modifying it, sharing it, hoarding it and even ignoring it X . Wilson (2000: 49) on the other hand defines information behaviour as  X  X  X he totality of human behav-iour in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information seeking and informa-tion use. Thus, it includes face-to-face communication with others, as well as passive reception of information as in, for example watching advertisements, without any intention to act on the information given X .
 1.2. Self-empowerment and information behaviour
Self-empowerment is an individual or group choice, as people consciously select what they think will benefit them to control of their environment. It is a way of gaining a power advantage and thereby improving ones situation. We need to note that power is pervasive and it is involved in all aspects of human endeavour, and is normally very much pronounced when there are political inclinations amongst those involved. This is particularly so when considering relationships emanat-ing from people X  X  work roles. As Berghout, Nijland, and Kevin (2005) note, politics will always be part of the decision-making process of organisations. Hence, it influences the power relations involved in those work situations. Introna (1997) also notes that the typical power relations experienced by people can be exhibited in the work process they are involved in. The work processes reflect how power shifts backwards and forwards during the course accomplishing work goals. In this regard, the ways people acquire, package and give out information may be a reflection of their response to various power relations that emerge and evolve during the work process (Mutshewa, 2007 ). Consequently, the information behaviour exhibited by indi-viduals can be viewed as a way of shifting power relations in the individuals favour to empower themselves (self-empow-erment process) to participate meaningful in the work processes. 1.3. Environmental planning
The concept of environmental planning can be understood from a very technical perspective. It can be explained by a vari-ety of models and concepts, some of which are rooted in planning theories and environmental studies. Environmental plan-ning refers to the process in which the environmental issues are included or considered in the development planning process. The process is characterised by debates and negotiations among groups with different interests and interpretations of an environmental planning problem (Karacapilidis, Papadias, Gordon, &amp; Voss, 1997 ). Naturally, a decision made in such a situation leads to the disempowerment of other interest groups and or change in the distribution of power amongst the stakeholders. In this regard, as the process progresses, there will be potential  X  X  X inners X  and  X  X  X osers, X  with the  X  X  X inners X  gaining power, which reinforces their social power base regarding the environmental problem. Consequently, the difference (see Wergin, 1976 for a fuller discussion). 1.3.1. The political nature of environmental planning
The political nature of the environmental planning process cannot be overemphasized ( Gezelius &amp; Refsgaard, 2007 ). The political perspective to planning is based on finding compromises and trade-offs that allow a group of people with varied interests to move forward on some action (Innes and Rongerude, 2005). To achieve this, all interest groups are involved, to make planning a more realistic activity to those who will be affected by the plan. The political view further underpins that planning is characterised by an active and continuous negotiation process between the planner and other interest groups. There are power relations, which continuously shift asymmetrical between the various interest groups and or individuals.
Innes and Gruber (2001: 11) note that a  X  X  X eader or agency works with the players on a one to one basis, keeping them per-sonally attached and cooperative with a larger agenda by offering them things they each want. The system depends on per-sonal loyalty, cemented by reciprocity between the leader and those who are benefiting. It depends on promises being kept X . They further state that defections are punished, but loyalty lasts only as long as benefits keep coming.

Accordingly, information is considered as an important ingredient in the environmental planning process. However, the issue of how, when, why, where and for what purpose information is used has been sparingly investigated in an analytical way in information research. For instance, studies have shown that good supporting data is required for what has already been proposed. Information is also required to help in the political tasks of selling the programs to the public, raising funds and getting support for the planning agency. In addition, information is required to know who is powerful, who knows what, who wanted what, and who is loyal (Innes, 2001 ). If we go by the idea that politics is entrenched in the environmental plan-ning process, then it is understood that the way information is utilised will be determined by the political situation at any given time. This means the way information is conceptualised and applied would be informed by the political nature of the planning process. In this study, the political model of environmental planning served as the orienting theory to developing a theory of the use of information.

The political nature of environmental planning requires that planners have to position themselves to deal with power relations emanating from such situations. The success of planners depends how they are empowered to deal with those power relations. However, the fact that the planners are regarded as experts, who are leading the planning process, they need to prepare themselves to stand up to the challenge. To this end, self-empowerment through the use of information becomes a critical aspect in their roles. The approach that one adopts to handle information can be a tool for strengthening a political position (Zuboff, 1984 ).

Information researchers have begun to realise the importance of the social dimensions in researching the way people ap-proach and handle information and many have begun to explore the information practices of communities taking cognisance of the social aspects within groups (e.g. Schiff, Van House, &amp; Butler, 1997 ; Widen-Wulff and Davenport, 2007 and Van House, a selected set of behavioural factors. The investigations focused on the end behaviour in relation to information and failed to capture the means that produced such end behaviours. Many theoretical models of information behaviour relied heavily upon these behavioural factors as dependent variables and study designs following such approach examined these variables across different categories of information users (Wilson, 2000; Allen, 1996 ; and Choo et al., 2000 ). The studies fail to acknowledge variables such as politics or power relations as defined in the symbolic use of information. Power relations or politics are critical in shaping how the individuals approach and use information and if not explicitly mentioned in these studies, it cannot be assumed that such study could pay attention to them.

Data for this study were collected from people working on environmental planning projects. These projects were selected because they were characterised by a lot of politics, thus making power issues more pronounced as the planners attempt to develop environmental plans acceptable to various stakeholders with different interests in the outcomes of the planning pro-cess. Power relations among environmental planning stakeholders is critical and drives the process that lead to the produc-tion of environmental plans, hence influencing the information behaviours of those involved ( Mutshewa, 2007 ).
This paper is organised as follows; in the next section, the methodology used in the study is discussed. This is followed by a presentation of the findings, starting with a description of the categories and the model developed. The development of the categories is illustrated using tables which appear as appendices to the paper. However, within the text, the identified cat-egories are illustrated using quotations derived from the interview data. The findings of the study are then discussed before presenting some concluding remarks. 2. Methodological approach
The Grounded Theory method, which emphasises process and capturing complexities of the context in which actions un-fold, was adopted in this study. The method enables the researcher to understand all that may be involved in a particular substantive issue (Locke, 2001 ) without predetermined independent and dependent variables. Grounded Theory is a method of qualitative research that puts emphasis on the generation of a theory from data ( Wimpenny and Gass, 2000; Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998 and Goulding, 2002 ).

In accordance with the cannons of Grounded Theory espoused by Glaser (1978), Glaser and Strauss (1967) and Strauss and Corbin (1998) , data from which the concepts and categories that describe the use of information by environmental plan-ners were gathered using interviews, and analysed using the constant comparative method. Data was grouped together and conceptually labelled, the concepts were then categorised, linked, organised by relationships and conditions and dimensions developed, and finally the theory explaining the use of information by environmental planners developed.

The study started with preliminary consultations involving talking to researchers in the information systems, infor-mation science, social development, and environmental sciences domains of knowledge. Environmental practitioners holding senior positions in government agencies were interviewed with the objective to get insights of environmental planning practice.
 From the preliminary consultations,  X  X  X ich data points X  which formed the basis for purposive sampling were identified.
Various contexts, organisations, and individuals from which to collect data were identified. Municipal councils were identi-fied as the main institutions driving the environmental planning process. Other institutions may be generating information and providing expertise when required, but ultimately it is the councils whose efforts determine the overall success of the environmental planning process (see also Blowers, 1992; Baldwin, 1985: 4 and Botswana Government, 2000a, 2000b ). Five councils in Botswana were purposively selected based on the variations in the environmental issues, communities and the type of development projects present in the areas of jurisdiction of the planners. 2.1. The study area
Botswana has a relatively small population with most of the people living in the eastern part of the country along the railway line that runs from south to north. According to the population census of the year 2001, Botswana has a population of approximately 1.7 million people, with an estimated annual growth rate of 2.4% (Botswana Government, 2002 ; Gaolathe, 2004).

Botswana has 10 district councils, two town councils, and two city councils. The districts that cover wide geographical areas are further divided into sub-districts, which also perform the function of an administrative division in areas of their jurisdiction. These administrative divisions are responsible for planning for local development as well as the implementation of national policies. 2.2. Data collection and analysis
Forty-four people were interviewed from the councils to provide data for the development and validation of the theory of the use of information for environmental planning. It should be noted that it was not the number of respondents that was important but the examples that they provided relating to the use of information when they consider environmental issues in the development process. Considerable care was taken to ensure that the respondents answered questions in their own words and choose what they consider important in relation to using information. The interviewer limited himself to introducing the topics using phrases such as  X  X  X ell me about  X ,  X  X  X alk about  X ,  X  X  X ell me more about  X  X . Data were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis.

The criterion for selecting respondents was that the person: (i) should be involved in development projects that have environmental concerns and participates in the commissioning of the project through implementation and thereafter; (ii) should have participated in at least one development project where an environmental issue was under consideration, (iii) should be willing and available to participate in the interview and also; (iv) should give informed consent to participate in the research.

The purpose of sampling was to get diverse experiences among the participants. As noted by Barbour (2001) , diversity in the respondents is essential to get a variety of examples relating to the phenomenon that is being studied. This diversity adds more dimensions and properties of the concepts and categories that are discovered, thus, leading to a better understanding of the phenomenon (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998 ). In this study, respondents were drawn from the various departments of council which deal with projects that have some environmental concerns. The cadres from which the respondents were selected evolved as I gained more insight into the way information is used and the working habits of the respondents. The final selec-tion included technical officers, operational managers, inspectors and technicians who are implementing projects in the field, as well as heads of council departments. Table 1 below provides a summary of the respondents from the council departments.

The evidence provided by the planners was corroborated by interviewing 10 people outside councils. These interviews were held to confirm the claims by the planners. For example, when a planner claimed that the project was successful, it was also important to find out from those who were participating in different capacities to find out if they share the some view. Another example was when a planner claimed that he disseminated information to some people. In such cases I wanted to find out from those who were given information to confirm if the activity took place. The evidence provided by the 10 respondents showed that the claims made by the planners were credible. These people were identified by the plan-ners. An important thing to note is that these are people who were not serving the interests of councils in those projects.
Data from these people was not included in the analysis. 2.2.1. Theory validation process
The theory discovered in this study was validated by the respondents during the last stages of the data collection, and it was carried out in two different ways. First, the theory was shared with the respondents by presenting it to them in the form of a diagram showing the categories and their relationships. The respondents were then allowed to make comments based on the diagram. In the process, there were some discussions with a view to get the opinions of the respondents. In the second instance, the respondents were not shown the theory but were guided in a discussion to talk about the categories. This pro-cess followed an open discussion format, with the planners freely expressing their views and opinions regarding the theory.
The two ways of validating the theory showed that the planners were in agreement with how it explains the way they use information when they address environmental issues in the development planning process. 2.2.2. The data collection process
Data were collected in stages which alternated with the analysis so that subsequent stages could be theoretical informed by outcomes of the previous analysis (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998 ). Table 2 (see Appendix A ) provides a description of how the data collection and analysis processes progressed. The first stage which comprised of five interviews, served the purpose of defining in general terms, how information use related factors are located within the processes of environmental planning.
The analysis aimed at developing the appropriate terminology, topics and the general profile and the responsibilities of the various officers who are dealing with environmental issues in the development planning process. The second stage had the main objective of exploring the topics that were discovered in the first stage in more detail. Twelve planners were inter-viewed during the second stage. Stage 3 concentrated on developing relationships between the categories as well as finding more examples to illustrate the categories and the relationships. There was also a focus on refining the categories and iden-tifying the core category. Again, 12 planners were interviewed. Stage 4 focused on the search for any evidence that could refute the findings (negative cases). One of the main activities was to share the findings with the planners, so that they can make inputs as well confirming whether the categories describe what they do. Eleven interviews were held during this stage.
In the last stage, the findings were shared with the planners in a more open discussion, rather than asking for more infor-mation from them. The objective was to get a confirmation of the findings by the respondents. Only four people were interviewed. 2.2.3. Coding process
The initial coding yielded several concepts and categories. The process involved reading through the data several times and giving it conceptual labels. After several trials of examination, the data in different ways possible, the concep-tual labels on the data translated first into 70 concepts and categories, then 44 concepts and categories. The initial stages of analysis were considered to be transitional and concepts and categories derived were mostly direct quotations of the interview text. 2.2.4. Developing the theory of the use of information
The concepts and categories were constantly compared with the incoming data, searching for data sets that describe both similar and diverging concepts. The following questions were used to further interrogate the discovered categories: Who is engaged with the situation that the category is describing? What is the reason behind the engagement? How are they engaged? What resources are consumed when they are engaged? What are the time and the spatial attributes for the situation described by the category? A further analysis focused on refining the categories and developing the model for the use of information by the planners.
The identified categories were examined against incoming data to gain more insights into their properties, dimensions, and relationship. The following questions guided the coding in relation to each category: What is the category; i.e. how is it defined from the data? When does the category occur? Where does the category occur? Why does the category occur? How does the category occur?
What is the consequence of the occurrence? 3. Findings
The section on findings is divided into two subsections. First, is the presentation of the main categories identified? The section presents development of the central category and linkages of the categories into a theoretical model of the use of information by environmental planners. 3.1. The main categories discovered The initial data analysis resulted in regrouping the concepts and categories, and reducing them to eight categories (see
Table 3 Appendix A for details of how the main categories were developed from the data) which provide broad definitions of factors involved when planners address environmental issues in development projects. These categories were named: Motivators  X  Factors motivating the planners to use information.
 Dynamic project information context  X  Defining an information profile of a project.

Experiential knowledge  X  Obtained from participation in projects and training, and is enhanced by routine information-related habits of the planners.

Pattern of information use  X  Information tasks, actions and activities characterised by ways of acquiring, packaging and ver-ifying information.

Role context  X  Determines the kind of information the planner should act upon, as well as how the planner should act upon the information to participate effectively in the environmental planning process.
 Informational power  X  Power generated when the planners engages with the information required for the planning process.
Strategy for participation  X  Used to embrace relevant participation and assessment of the environmental issues in the project.

Situated power  X  Derived from supporting policies and the institution. These supporting policies and the institutional sup-port provide legitimate and coercive power base for the planner.
 3.1.1. Motivators
The category motivators defines the motivation of the planners to engage in information related activities in environmen-tal planning situations. It starts off as an internal desire when the planner wants to prepare for an encounter  X  the desire to see other stakeholders seeing the problem in the same way the planner sees it. This predicament tends to be more pro-nounced at the beginning of a project when there is a lot of anxiety about the outcome. Although the motivational drive tend to come from within the planner, it is influenced and shaped when the issues are discussed with other stakeholders, both formal and informal. Because the planner wants appear to be competent in handling the project, he or she prepares for the project to go through with minimum resistance. Further, the planner wants to uplift his/her image and avoid embarrass-ing situations. The planner views other stakeholders, especially the politicians as having the power to  X  X  X lock X  projects. As one responded pointed out,  X  X  X t is like they have superfluous powers X . This shows that there is an asymmetry in power rela-tions in favour of the politicians and this can negatively affect the planner X  X  ability to facilitate the environmental planning process. The planner wants to change the behaviour, attitudes and beliefs of the stakeholders towards the project. He or she perceives his or her competence and ability to minimise resistance as the ultimate means to success. Consequently, he or she engages in activities that will enhance his or her competence and confidence by mobilising support, influencing other stake-holder and orientating himself or herself for the encounter. Thus, empowering oneself for success.
 Projects that require sanctioning from stakeholders with different views tend require more strategies of influencing.
Projects that attract more environmental experts motivate the planners to acquaint themselves with issues more than, if the stakeholders were non-experts. This means the drive on whether to focus on orienting oneself or on influencing strategies is to a certain extent determined by what the planner perceives to be the interest and characteristics of the stakeholders and what they are able to do in terms of influencing the planning outcome. When the planners find that they are relatively uninformed about an environmental issue, they feel  X  X  X owerless X  and are at a disadvantage in terms of facilitating the environmental planning process. In order to shift power relations and gain the advantage, the planners engage in a learning endeavour. This is an orientation that the planners give themselves through engaging in information behaviours that would help shift power relations in their favour. Further, the competencies and confidence to deal with the situation improves.

With regards to influencing stakeholders, planners build information networks with those who  X  X atter X , educate the ential people to influence stakeholders and ensure that a positive image is kept in the eyes of the stakeholders. It should be noted that the influencing of other stakeholders is a way of mobilising support for the project and it prompts certain infor-mation behaviour or informational strategies. In expressing their intentions to influence others, some of the respondents used such phrases as: talk our language  X  ,  X  X  X how them the sense  X  . 3.1.2. Role context
The category role context emanates from the setting in which environmental decisions are made and the way the role is perceived determines how the planner gets involved in the facilitation of the environmental planning process. The role con-text is influenced by the agencies for environmental decisions; communities served and of course the reasons bringing the planners to be involved in the project. The environmental planning process requires that planners play a facilitating role and other stakeholders taken on board to participate in the decision-making process. The way a planner perceives the require-ment of the job and the circumstances driving the agency to assign the job are critical in determining what and how the planner would play the role. The planner should appreciate the power distribution, anticipate level resistance or acceptance and prepare accordingly. Further, the value of information in the process is determined in the context of the role and the information strategies that are put in place by the planner within the context of the role. For instance, the way the planners perceive their role determines how they see power distribution amongst the stakeholders. Accordingly, the planners select information and use it in accordance with the perceptions they hold about the power distribution. For instance, one respon-dent who was involved in a landfill project pointed out that:
My role in this project is just to provide the stakeholders with information. They send me to look for information when they need it. In XXX [name withheld for anonymity of respondent], I was appointed a team leader. And you see there was a lot of pressure on me. The way I sought information was totally different from the current project because I wanted information that would support my position or let me say our position as professionals. I did not want the councillors to overpower me, so, I have to try different ways of convincing them to follow my direction .

As can be noted from the above quotation, the planner see his role as just providing information and has no influence in how the information get used. Extant literature supports the above finding. For instance, a study by Baugh, Verderber, and Green (1984: 236) found that  X  X  X  variety of role types would be differently attuned to information sources X  used in general.
For example, the analysed data showed that some projects place more demands on certain types of information because of the value of the information in that particular situation. If the planner perceives his role as advising stakeholders who in-clude experts, the demand for information may be different from when the stakeholders have no environmental background.
In the former case, the requirement for information will be to counter the expert power. Secondly, when a planner perceives his role as advisory in a project that is politically unpopular, he or she will use information in ways that will counteract the political power. 3.1.3. Dynamic project information context
This category relates to the information environment of a project. The dynamic project information context occurs as a background entity defining the information profile of a project. It emerges and evolves with the project. Planners have cer-tain expectations and anticipations of the helpfulness of the information environment in terms of information access and availability, conduciveness of the conduits through which the information is transmitted (communication channels) as well as the sources available and accessible to project participants. Planners form impressions about the information environ-ment and these impressions continually change in response to the ease at which information can be obtained to drive the environmental planning process. Two dimensions characterise the information environment and relate to its ability to either enable or un-enable actions or activities of the environmental planning process.

The dynamic project information context , as the name implies, is a dynamic entity within the project context. It is created by the planner as a response to situations emanating from the project. This finding is supported by Heywood (1997: 7) : who suggests that  X  X  X n many cases we do not know exactly what kind of information we need to assess until some situation arises that makes it evident X . This finding is also comparable to the suggestion by Rauscher (1999: 179) (even though his argument is not backed up by empirical evidence), that a decision support system should be developed during the decision-making processes of the management of ecosystems if it is to be relevant to the needs of the decision makers. A respondent from the current study described the environmental planning process as follows: ... it is like you are in a black box which opens once in a while to give a bit of light ...

The way environmental planning situations present themselves determine the kind of impression that the planners create in relation to the information environment. Planners analyse the environmental planning situation and relate it to the infor-mation environment. This helps them to create an impression of the information environment X  X  potential to support their effort to deal with the project. For example, one respondent pointed out that: taken well. So we usually ... anticipate the resistance and plan for it... but sometimes the available information can improve your chances. Other people sometimes come to help you. But if they do not take your decision, you can always tell yourself that there is a next time. The most important thing is that you need to explain to them the consequences of ignoring your recommendations X 
What are the impressions made by the planners? The planners make impression about the information sources, commu-nication channels and access, including people who may provide the necessary information that may help to facilitate the environmental planning processes. The planner X  X  impressions change as new situations arise, with some cases when the information environment being unsupportive, thus, making the planners to operate at a disadvantage. For example, certain information sources can be made available through other council authorities. Creation of information through consultants depends on the willingness of council to fund that. The use of people as information sources depends on their availability and willingness to participate. The examples given above show the basis for the imagined potential helpfulness of the infor-mation environment of a project.

A enabling or supportive or enabling information environment is desirable in environmental planning. It is regarded as empowering as it creates positive impressions on the planners. It enables or enhances behavioural actions of acquiring and verifying information, packaging, as well as giving information. As an enabler, the project information environment should be flexible to accommodate the changing demands for information by the planner which may become necessary be-cause of the changing situations arising during the environmental planning processes. The project information context may be  X  X  X nformation rich X , providing access to rich information sources that may include experts and information sources that are amenable to easy manipulation such as computer held information. Various literature sources support this finding and they show that people, access contexts and information sources and communication channels are essential in the infor-mation behaviours of people (Johnson, 1996 and Wigand, Picot, &amp; Reichwald, 1997 ), with different communities of users having various preferences for different information sources and channels of communication ( Taylor, 1991 ).
Secondly, when the information environment of a project is unsupportive, planners struggle to get the work done. For instance, when talking about a situation where the information is difficult for the planner to understand, one respondent said that:  X  but at times you find that you just make those decisions without understanding. And you are actual inviting trouble for your-self. But you have to do it anywhere with that feeling or wish that somebody else could be doing it and answerable to that because you rely on their information .

As it can be seen from the above quotation, the information environment described is not supportive and creates negative impressions on the planner. This results in the planners struggling to get work done.

Data showed that planners use a variety of information sources and communication channels in a complementary man-ner to support the environmental planning processes. Written reports and meetings are used more often in the exchange of information. People, including experts and the community form an essential component of the project information environ-ment because the planners consult them when gathering information. The planners also regard the access as a fundamental component of the dynamic project information context because it is directly linked to the acquisition of information. Plan-ners can only acquire information that they have access to it. The lack of easy access to information can inhibit its acquisition (see also Johnson, 1996 ). 3.1.4. Experiential knowledge
Experience is critical in facilitating the environmental planning process. Experienced planners are more adept and use enhanced common sense to accomplish work. Further, experience enhances the confidence and the feelings of being empow-ered to handle the environmental planning process. Planners accumulate valuable knowledge over time. This knowledge has been named experiential knowledge because it is acquired through one X  X  involvement in the environmental planning projects.
It was found that opportunities are available for the planners to have hands-on experience in areas were projects similar to the ones that they may be doing have already started or are being implemented, and such knowledge has been reported to be very useful. For example, a planner who was facing resistance in convincing stakeholders to re-zone a farming area to be used for a landfill reported that he used his experience to put forward a convincing argument. He pointed out that using his experience, he was able to provide examples from the past to strengthen the ideas that he was presenting. Another re-sponded referring to the importance of experience in their work situations, reported that: ... I think my confidence, like I said before, maybe, it comes from long experience. I have been in this job for the last twenty years. I have been in very different parts of Africa  X  I have worked as a consultant  X  I have worked with consultancy firms  X 
I have worked with central government  X  I have worked with local authorities. So, the interaction of different people, different organisations, interaction with the community  X  it gives you the confidence to deal with many situations.

This means experiential knowledge could change the outcomes of environmental planning. It may lead to environmental planning outcomes which otherwise would not have been possible if the environmental planner did not have that knowl-edge. It enhances the planners X  authority and confidence to select strategies that have proven to work in similar situations. 3.1.5. Pattern of information use and informational power
Pattern of Information use as discovered in this study defines the observable behavioural activities that planners engage in duringthecourseofaprojecttocreateanenvironmentconduciveforinterpretationoftheenvironmentalplanningsituationfor allstakeholders.Thefollowinginformationrelatedaction,tasksandactivitieswerediscoveredandtheyincludeextracting,col-lating,summarising,translating,collectingorgatheringinformation,verifyinginformationanddisseminatinginformation.The outcome of these information behaviours is informational power , a power base that allows the planners to guide the environ-mental planning process. During the environmental planning process, the planner acts as information  X  X  X ub X  and he/she con-trols the participation in the process. The planner links the stakeholders to the appropriate information because he/she better understands the situation. The informational power gives the planners a better bargaining power to influences the process.
The informational power is the dominant power base of the environmental planners. Although it tends to be visible throughout the duration of the project, it tends to be more pronounced when the information flows between the planners and other stakeholders. The function of the informational power is to counter the power bases of other stakeholders and seems to be the dominant power base the planners use to drive the environmental planning process. It gives the planners the authority, confidence and support to select and execute a strategy that will ensure the success of the planning.
The packaging of information, acquiring and verifying information and giving information are central to the generation of information power . As one respondent notes: cess] ... makes you feel prepared and ready to face them. Councillors have too much power over administrators ... sometimes they just refuse our recommendations with no good reasons ... .
 Margerum (1997) also noted that these activities facilitate interactions among the stakeholders. In a similar argument, Innes (1999) suggested that the roles of planners are to find and present formal information designed to suit their audiences.
To achieve these goals, they need to acquire relevant information, package the information properly, and give it to the stake-holders in a manner that will make it possible for appropriate interactions to take place and generate relevant actions and decisions relating to the environment. Through these activities, the planners are able to give direction to the environmental planning. Raven (1993: 229) refers to such function as  X  X  X nformational influence X  and is an essential factor in understanding the use of information.

Data shows that the interest of the planners is to shape the behaviour, attitudes, beliefs and values of the stakeholders with a view to guide and direct the environmental decisions. Information is used to give the planners the authority and con-fidence to win the support of the stakeholders. This is a form of empowerment to the planners because it is through these information actions and activities that planners are able to  X  X  X ope with the demanding situation X  ( cf . Wilson, 1997: 554 ) cre-ated by the environmental planning requirements. Further, consistent with extant literature, data showed that the use of information is not an event but rather a process with iterations that take place in multiple directions ( cf . Dervin (1992) .
The users of information engage in the processes of using information by performing a number of tasks, actions and activities which enable them to move (empowered) on with the environmental planning processes. Solomon (1997: 1136) also shares the same view when she noted that there are no logical steps where the planner would determine an information need, then gather, organise, use information and then decide on the actions to take. The processes emerge and can follow any sequence regarding acquiring and verifying information, packaging information and giving information. 3.1.6. Strategy for participation
Strategy for participation was discovered to be an important aspect of the environmental planning process. It focuses on the stakeholders. It is about who, when why and how to involve stakeholders in the development of the environmental plan.
This activity takes place throughout the duration of the project. It adds value to project decisions as well as increasing the level of acceptance of the environmental plans. The strategy for participation is behavioural in nature and spells out the way the planners develop a power of choice/selection of appropriate strategy and executing the strategy. Planners as facilitators in the environmental planning processes make choices affecting the stakeholders X  participation.

A variety of strategies are used during the course of a project to facilitate the participation process. For instance, planners could choose to hold workshops, seminars or just meetings with the stakeholders. They can invite experts to lead some deci-sion-making processes. They can, during the production of reports; work out a strategy on how other council members could contribute. The way the planners handle the participation was found to be essential in the processes of environmental plan-ning. This sentiment is shared by Beierle and Cayford (2002: 7) , when referring to participation of the public in environmen-tal projects, they remarked that it is the  X  X  X rocess of participation, rather than its context X  which is largely responsible for success or failure. By selecting appropriate strategies, the planner can largely influence the outcomes of the projects.
The planners reported that the strategies that they select largely depend on their capability. For instance, the outcome of the selected strategy depends on how the planner is  X  X  X elf-empowered X  to execute it within the emerging power relations.
Data showed that the success of a meeting forming part of an environmental planning process would depend on how the planner is able to manage and control the deliberations of the meeting. The way the participants value the contribution of the planner is also critical. This makes self-empowerment a critical factor because an empowered planner will be more productive and will have a more successful meeting than a planner with a weak power base. Therefore, the success of a strat-egy that a planner uses depends on the extent to which he/she is able to derive informational power from the information tasks, actions and activities. 3.1.7. Situated power
Situated power defines the punitive measures external to the planning process but brought in when the planners have run out of options, and they want to force change, and punish defaulters and change stakeholders X  behaviour. This kind of behaviour ensures that the planners X  interests face less direct resistance and the defaulters learn their lessons the hard way. It gives the planner a temporary stronger power base to force the change. The power base for applying punishments is derived from policies and legislative acts which give the planner the authority to take certain actions to enforce environ-mental decisions. The data showed that this is a form of coercion and I called this coercive force situated power . This power base is always available to the planners, but in a dormant form. The planners use the situated power when the  X  X  X nformation influence X  of facilitating the environmental process is failing. Situated power has no other correlation with the information. I named this power base  X  X  situated power  X  because it is situated within the role regardless of the individual who is playing the role or the information tasks performed. Hemmati (2002) also expressed the same view that there are times where literally force is necessary to ensure good practices. Force is not used on everybody but on those that planners have identified as devi-ants to the norm or established polices of the country. In such situations, situated power becomes an instrument of enforce-ment, and punishments are sanctioned against the deviants.

This finding (i.e. the use of situated power) may seem to be undermining the superiority of the informational power base, but as one respondent remarked, this is invoked as a last resort when the information influence has not yielded positive re-sult. Beierle and Cayford (2002) also dismiss its effectiveness in dealing with environmental related issues. In fact, as pointed out by one respondent in this study, it (power derived from regulations and policies) should not be referred to because reg-ulations are imperfect and when brought to the foreground people will always find some loopholes to use to fight back. This may even involve lawsuits that may curtail the environmental planning process.

However, this finding contradicts a suggestion by Van Woerkun and Van Meegeren (1990) who seem favourably disposed towards external motivations in the form of legal and financial punitives as essential and reinforcing the information-based motivation. Their argument was not, however, backed up by any empirical evidence. With empirical evidence, their findings might be different.

Situated power may influence the development of a strategy for participation . In such cases, the respondents may work with the law enforcement officers including the police. Data showed that drawing from the situated power base, the planners may also tactically create conditions that put social pressure on the clients who may be having a different view. In such a situation, those who hold the same view as the planners are encouraged to denounce the opinions and intentions of those with differing viewpoints. 3.2. Model development
The outcome of the analysis which resulted in further refinement of the categories used in the development the model of the use of information by environmental planners is presented in a matrix form (see Table 4 in Appendix B ) for the purposes clarity. The table shows how the main categories were further developed to identify the central category. Fig. 1 below shows how the main categories discovered in this study are related. As can be seen from Fig. 1 below, self-empowerment is the central category and is defined by the confidence, authority and gained support which emanate from information activities involving packaging, acquiring and giving information. These informational activities generate the informational power base for implementing the strategy of participation in the environmental planning process. Self-empowerment and strategy for participation characterised by behavioural activities. Outside the behavioural factors in information use are perceptions, impressions and experiential knowledge which influence the planners to engage in those behaviours that lead to self-empowerment. The perceptions that influence self-empowerment are related to ones X  competences, resistance of the stake-holders and the overall work requirements. Impressions are related to the information environment, that is, the extent to which it is supportive of the informational activities for self-empowerment. Experiential knowledge relates to the individ-ual X  X  experience, adeptness, and use of common sense to gain confidence, authority, and support to perform the environmen-tal planning activities. The strategy for participation is also influenced by both the experiential knowledge and the situated power, i.e. the power gained from rules, regulations, and legislations governing the environmental planning process. 4. Discussion
The political nature of the environmental planning makes power relation central to the process. Hence, the finding of this study that self-empowerment is central in the use of information is not surprising. The self-empowerment behaviour of the planners is influenced by the need to gain control of the environmental planning process. Self-empowerment gives the plan-ners the power with which if they do not have will lead to an uncontrolled processes of environmental planning.
Thus, the factors that describe the way the planners use information represent the ways in which they empower them-selves ( self-empowerment ) to address asymmetrical power relations or experiences emanating from the environmental planning processes (see Fig. 1 above). In order to empower themselves, planners engage in certain information activities and the information enables them to cope with the emerging situations. Self-empowerment and the activities thereof are a consequence of impressions about relevant information environments and focus on the value that the available informa-tion sources and communication channels would have on the project processes. Secondly, the way the planners perceive themselves and their role, and other stakeholders make them to choose certain behaviours that generate informational power base. The actual behaviour exhibited by the planners is characterised by ways of acquiring and verifying information, pack-aging information and giving information. The informational power gives the planners the authority and confidence to come up with a productive strategy for participation to generate a desirable environmental planning outcome. Examples of ways in which the empowered planners use the informational power are through their influence on the selection of participants, the agenda items for meetings and the activities that lead to the final production of the plan. For instance, the planners deter-mine when a project is ready for discussion and put it on an agenda for a meeting. Experiential knowledge was also found to be a critical factor affecting the use of information by way of enhancing the confidence of the planner to deal with the sit-uations they are facing.

The foregoing discussions show that self-empowerment is the main factor defining the use of information by environ-mental planners and is characterised by behavioural actions involving; acquiring, packaging and giving information. The planners engage in these behaviours to facilitate the environmental planning related projects (see also Margerum, 1997 ).
In a similar argument, Innes (1999) suggests that the roles of planners are to find and present formal information designed to suit their audiences. To achieve these goals they need to acquire relevant information, package the information properly and give it to the stakeholders in a manner that will make it possible for appropriate interactions to take place and generate relevant actions and decisions relating to the environment.

Data from the present study shows that the self-empowerment activities of the planners make it possible for the stakeholders to take environmental actions and decisions. They give meaning to the environmental planning process by enabling the stakeholders to interpret the situations using the information that planners package and give them.
In this regard, the value of the information is realised in the manner in which it enables the stakeholders to interpret the environmental planning situations. Similar sentiments can be drawn from the work of Choo et al. (2000: 119) when they pointed out that the value of information lies in its ability to enable actions and this becomes possible after the information has been given  X  X  X eaning and significance in the minds of the actors X . Therefore, by packaging information and giving it to the stakeholders, the planners create an environment conducive for an interpretation to be made, thereby creating meaning of the situations arising from the environmental planning process. It is through these pro-cesses that the decisions on the environmental issues relating to development projects are informed and facilitated by the planners.

That self-empowerment is central to the information use related behaviour of planers has been supported by a substantial amount of evidence from the data. For example, a planner who was involved in a project that was addressing environmental health issues in the small business sector pointed out that: know my work involves politics, because we deal with people, we are providing a service to people out in the public, of which some find it difficult to understand issues. Sometimes they just want to be different.
 In addition, another respondent planning for civil engineering projects in a city pointed that:
Because, unfortunately as managers we don X  X  give the councillors the directions which to take. When you deal with them, it is like they have superfluous powers whereby you just simple present your case and they make decisions. It is not like you go and stand on decisions and you go with it. You give them the information and they make the decisions. ... Personally, I think you know with information, I think with information you can be empowered in many ways. ... Which means you have more power, you have more expert power, you can influence decisions, you advise as and when you are called upon. Without the information, with information, you end up having a competitive advantage over you colleagues, also because once you need information, you look for it, you source for it: you have competitive advantage in terms of your performance. It also enables you to perform with-out being held at ransom by anybody.

As it can be seen from the above quotation the planner considers himself as operating in a situation where power rela-tionships between him and the planners play a critical role in his work activities. To succeed the planner relies on the infor-mation and if effectively applied gives the planner a  X  X  X ompetitive edge X . Thus, shifting power relations in favour of the planner and making him to be able to steer the direction of the planning process.

How does the information contribute to self-empowerment of the planner? The activities involving; acquiring and ver-ifying information, packaging and giving information define the actual observable behaviours exhibited when the planners are involved in environmental planning. These behaviours generate an informational power base which is the source of plan-ners X  self-empowerment  X  which is actually spelling the basis for using information by the planners to influence the envi-ronmental planning processes. Further, as Raven (1993: 229) points out, the  X  X  X nformational influence X  is an essential factor in understanding how people use information. As one respondent pointed out that:
You see ... when you have the write information, it becomes easy to convince the counsellors to agree with you. And you find that the decisions taken are in line with what we propose as professionals even though some times they can just use their pow-ers to overrule you. But with time you get used to them, and you can caucus with some of them and your colleagues so that they can support you once the presentation has started. But you need to have the right information, otherwise you embarrass your-self. ... with scanty information, that is when you can see that theses people are difficult.

As it can be noted from the above quotation, power is an important ingredient in the environmental planning and plan-ners work to counteract the power base of the other stakeholders.

It should also be noted that experiential knowledge is an important factor in the environmental planning process. It helps planners to intelligently use their common sense to enhance their proficiency (adeptness) in facilitating the environmental planning process.

This self-empowerment behaviour is informational in nature and involves acquiring information, packaging it as well as giving it to stakeholders. Informational power is generated from the self-empowerment behavioural activities. The informa-tional power, is the main power base for planners that keeps them meaningfully involved in environmental planning pro-cesses. It leads to the selection of a strategy for participation in the environmental planning processes. The empowered planers have authority, confidence, and the gained support to execute the strategy for participation.

The strategy for participation spells out the choices that the planner makes to involve the other stakeholders in the envi-ronmental planning processes. This includes how the stakeholders are informed of the project X  X  process, how they can also contribute information and ideas to the environmental planning process, as well as making decisions. The strategy for par-ticipation is normally characterised by a discussion that the planners initiate to get approval or disapproval of a project. I argue that the process of getting approval of the plans is actually a play of power mechanisms for  X  X  X chieving or restoring agreement and redeeming validity claims X  (see, Byrne, 2004 ; and Ngwenyama &amp; Lee, 1997 ). In the process, a debate is opened with the stakeholders aiming at getting a common understanding of the proposals. Proposals are evaluated and sub-jected to questioning of the beliefs and knowledge on which they are based. This result in the establishment of the legitimacy of the claims on which the plan is based ( cf . Hirschheim &amp; Klein, 1994 ).

The outcome of applying the strategy for participation is an approval or disapproval of an environmental plan. A plan that is approved is then binding, and implementation has to be as agreed. Likewise, disapproval leads to the plan not being imple-mented or altered for further consideration. In this regard, the strategy for participation is a way of exercising informational power .

Situated power operates as an intervening factor to the development of a strategy for participation . It is not directly linked to information, but may be an alternative power base for the planners. This is particularly so when they are dealing with external agencies, groups or individuals and require supporting policies and institutional support to administer some puni-tive measures to those who fail to comply with the policy requirements that are in place. Situated power is coercive in nature and manifests itself in the form of policy enforcement. This power base always exists but is dormant until situations ap-proach a crisis level. The situated power base is not so much a preferred alternative, but necessary when dealing with situ-ations that are problematic and require the use of force because the information related means of handling environmental processes are failing.

From the above findings, we can draw the following propositions: (a) There is a relationship between information activities selected and performed by the planners and the informational (b) The perceptions that planners have on their competences, resistance of stakeholder, job requirement have a direct (c) The impressions (positive or negative) of the planners on the information environment of a project will determine the (d) The experiential knowledge of the planners influences the information activities that they engage in during the envi-(e) The experiential knowledge of the planners will determine the kind of strategy of participation adopted in the envi-(f) There is a relationship between the strategy of participation used in environmental planning and the situated power.
These concepts impressions, perceptions, self-empowerment, experiential knowledge, situated power, information envi-ronment are used in the above proposition as defined in the findings of this study. 5. Conclusion
The present study found that the use of information by planners is linked to their perceptions; of the job requirement, resistance of the stakeholders and the planners X  competence to deal with the projects. The impressions planners have or cre-ate on the ability of the information environment to support the planning process with the necessary information sources and communication channels are critical determinants of the use of information during the environmental planning process.
The study showed that whether we choose to understand the planners X  use of information in terms of the information con-text, context of the roles, motivating factors, experiential knowledge of the planners or participation process, self-empow-erment constitutes the central determinant of the information behaviour exhibited by the planners. The observable behavioural actions of planners generate informational power, which is the main power base of the planners. The empow-ered planner is able to select and execute the strategy for participation during the environmental planning process. Therefore, we can conclude that the strategy for participation embodies mechanisms of power through which the planner exercises the strategy for participation are the ones in which power is exercised. These mechanisms are themselves sources of power and give the planners the capability to influence the environmental planning decisions through information actions and activities ( cf . Pfeffer, 1981 ). All these are possible through the self-empowering activities that characterise the environmental plan-ning process. Appendix A See Table 2 .
