 1. Introduction
Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is a task of retrieving documents in one language with re-spect to the user query in another language. With a CLIR system, a user can obtain useful information from a document collection in a language different from that of the queries. There are two approaches for CLIR: a query translation approach and a document translation approach, depending on whether the queries or documents are translated for matching. A hybrid method is also possible where both queries documents, query translation is often preferred.

For query translation, a variety of tools and resources are used, such as a machine translation system, can perform well. Two types of bilingual corpora can be used for CLIR: parallel corpora and comparable corpora. A parallel corpus is constructed for two or more languages, where the words or sentences in one language are aligned with words or sentences in other languages. Xu and Weischedel (2000) have tried to results in the TREC-9 English X  X hinese CLIR task.

A comparable corpus consists of documents in one language aligned with documents in another lan-guage, where each pair of documents is considered to cover a similar topic. Query translation methods lishing associations between words occurring in one language and those in another. such a thesaurus requires labor intensive work. As a result, the method of using a bilingual thesaurus is limited to a few language pairs with such a thesaurus and has not been widely used in practice.
Compared to the machine translation system, bilingual corpora, and bilingual thesaurus, bilingual dic-tionaries are more readily available and can be applied easily in CLIR. However, as there are multiple appropriate ones, often by using the corpus in document language. Chen, Jiang, and Gey (2000) selected two translation equivalents per query that occur most frequently in the document collection. Kang, Kwon,
Lee, and Lee (2000) assigned weights to every translation equivalent by using a term reweighting method and then retrieved relevant target documents based on these weights. Ballesteros and Croft (1998) , Jang, Myaeng, and Park (1999) , Gao et al. (2000) , Lin, Lin, and Chen (2000) and Seo, Kim, Kim, Rim, and
Lee (2002) translated query terms into those in the document language using the translation equivalents able in a target language corpus. Jin and Wong (2000) and Adriani (2000) selected the correct translation
In our work, we focus on a query translation method using a bilingual dictionary, which is a common approach in many CLIR systems. In particular, our interest is in improving upon the current methods for would be misleading.

As such, this paper proposes a new method where all possible combinations of translation equivalents the total goodness value for each sequence comes from the association values for individual pairs consti-candidates.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes previous query translation methods and explains their problems, and Section 3 proposes the new query translation method. In Section 4, we present the re-sults of English X  X orean CLIR experiments using the NTCIR-3 collection. Finally, we discuss the contri-butions of this work and directions for future work in Section 5. 2. Previous query translation methods
In general, previous query translation approaches carry out the query translation task through a re-peated selection process among the possible translation equivalents of each query term. The most appro-the resulting target query term s ( s i ) for the i th source query term s among the translation equivalents of the i th source query term e where Q s is the source query, Q t is the target query, and r ( e the i th source query term. r ( e ij ) can be any function or method that computes its goodness value. For example, Gao et al. (2000) and Adriani (2000) define the r ( e ij ) as the sum of the highest association scores between e the translation equivalent of the adjacent user query term s where a ( e ij , e kl ) is the association score between two terms e occurs in a predefined window. On the other hand, dice similarity coefficient measures how much two vec-score to a pair of terms that have similar term distribution patterns.

However, this query translation method has a problem. Let  X  s consider an example in Fig. 1 , where the user query consists of four query terms (i.e. s 1 , s 2 , s among the translation equivalents of each user query term. However, the target query is composed of the translation equivalents in the dark circle (i.e. e 13 , e the query translation method focuses on selecting a translation equivalent of each query term, not con-structing an entire target query. Therefore, other terms that are not chosen as part of the target query the target query.

Our approach to this problem is to generate all possible candidate target queries first and then evaluate each of them by calculating the association scores among the terms in the target query. For example, the score of the candidate target query ( e 13 , e 23 , e 32 , e terms. Because e 23 does not have high association scores with other terms (i.e. e date target query, the candidate target query ( e 13 , e 23 query. 3. New query translation method 3.1. Overview
While the previous approaches attempt to find the appropriate translation equivalent of each query term, our proposed query translation method tries to select the most appropriate target query as a whole ing term pairs involved in a candidate target query. Therefore, the target query selected consists of the translation equivalents where the sum of the pair wise associations is the greatest. The proposed query translation method generates all the candidate target queries for the source query
Q , assigns the scores to them and then selects the candidate target query Q follows: where / ( c i ) is the score of the i th candidate target query c the association score between the query terms c ij and c ik
Candidate target queries are generated by combining possible translation equivalents of each query term as follows: where T ( Q s ) is the set of candidate target queries corresponding to the user query Q the candidate target queries of the user query represented in Fig. 1 can be enumerated:
The score of the candidate target query ( e 11 , e 21 , e
Hence, the proposed method calculates the score of a candidate target query by summing over all asso-the candidate target query composed of e 13 , e 23 , e 32 target query if the term e 23 has low association scores with the other terms (i.e. e target query. 3.2. Association measures
In this work, we have employed two different measures for computing association scores between two terms: one is total divergence to the mean ( TDM ) similar to dice similarity coefficient used in Adriani (2000) , and the other is weighted mutual information ( WMI ).

TDM measures the divergence between two vectors by calculating the Kullback X  X eibler ( KL ) divergence compute the divergence between them using TDM that is calculated as follows ( Lee, 1997 ): divergence as calculated: where H q  X  ~ x  X  is the cross entroy as defined: ~ q  X  i  X  is the value of i th element of vector ~ q . Hence, Eq. (10) can be rewritten: of element values of each vector must be 1 in this formula. We choose TDM because it is very effective measure in the word clustering ( Dagan, Lee, &amp; Pereira, 1997 ; Lee, Seo, &amp; Rim, 1998 ).
According to Adriani (2000) , the distribution pattern of a term is represented by the documents in which the term occurs. However, the terms occurring in short documents tend to have a higher weight than those (2000) , considering the length of documents: where ~ t i is the term distribution vector for the i th term t number of documents in a collection used to calculate the term distribution patterns, Pr( t ability that the term t i occurs in the j th document d j quency tf ij of term t i in document d j and document length dl and
On the other hand, WMI generally measures how frequently two terms co-occur in a predefined win-dow(usually a sentence) and is calculated: where WMI( t i , t j ) is weighted mutual information between two terms t the terms t i and t j co-occurred in the same sentences, MI( t and t j ,Pr( t i , t j ) is the probability that t i and t where  X  cs  X  is the corpus size. And Pr( t i ) is the probability of t 2000 ; Jang et al., 1999 ; Lin et al., 2000 ).

TDM prefers the term pairs that have similar distribution patterns in documents, while WMI prefers the tion in TDM and WMI are a document and a window, respectively. As a result, some terms with high TDM may have low WMI, and vice versa. For example, if two terms co-occur frequently in the same documents, but do not co-occur in the same sentences, TDM between them is high, but WMI is low. On the contrary, if two terms co-occur in the same sentences only but never co-occur in some distance within documents, TDM would be lower than WMI in a relative sense. 3.3. Embellishment for efficiency considerations
The proposed query translation method selects the best one among all candidate target queries. How-age, there are 10 20 candidate target queries. 1
In order to make the computation more practical, we cut down the number of candidate target queries
The query translation process goes through the following steps: 1. Filter out some improbable translation equivalents of each query term. 2. Segment the user query to produce multiple target sub-queries. 3. For each sub-query, generate all candidate target sub-query translations. 4. For each sub-query, select a candidate target sub-query translation with the highest score. 5. Construct the target query by combining the target sub-query translations.

In order to filter out some improbable translation equivalents, we use the score assigned to each trans-lation equivalent based on the following equation: where r ( e ij ) is the score of the j th translation equivalent of the i th term, a ( e mentation. Only the top m ranked translation equivalents are selected in constructing a candidate target query. As a result, we can reduce the number of translation candidates by m / n where m is the number of candidates chosen and n the number of all the candidates.
 ess. The sub-query size is decided as follows: where s q is the query size, s sq is the segment size, and n where MAX( s sq ) is the maximum segment size. For example, if the maximum segment size is five, and a query contains 19 terms, the number of sub-queries n sq is four and the sub-query size s is split into three sub-queries with five terms and one sub-query with four terms.
Once sub-queries are generated, the same procedure described earlier for whole queries is applied to pro-by combining the sub-query translations. 4. Experiments in English X  X orean CLIR
We tested the proposed query translation method using the NTCIR-3 English X  X orean CLIR test collec-tion. In this experiment, we have applied some performance improving techniques such as phrase transla-tion, proper noun translation, and query expansion to the CLIR system we developed. For comparison tion methods: monolingual information retrieval, CLIR with a simple query translation method, and CLIR with a machine translation system. Furthermore, a previous query translation method and the proposed method are also compared with both the TDM or WMI association measures to see their relative merits in different systems. 4.1. Test collection and evaluation measures The NTCIR-3 English X  X orean CLIR test collection we used contains 66,146 Korean documents and 30
English topics. The document set consists of Korea Economic Daily News newspaper articles published in 1994, and the query consists of title, description, narrative and concept fields ( Chen et al., 2002 ). We used the same evaluation measures used in NTCIR-3: 11-point average precision and R-precision. relevant X  X  for commonly used binary judgments, when the Relaxed Relevance criterion is used. On the other hand, Highly relevant and Relevant documents are considered relevant when Rigid Relevance criterion is used, making partially Relevant and Irrelevant documents non-relevant. In our experiment, we used both
Relaxed Relevance and Rigid Relevance criteria. 4.2. Other techniques employed
There are some techniques that have been shown to improve the retrieval performance of CLIR, such as phrase translation, proper noun translation and query expansion. Ballesteros and Croft (1998) showed that successful query translation. Fujii and Ishikawa (2001) presented that proper noun translation improves the performance of Japanese X  X nglish CLIR system. Query expansion methods are also shown to be very experiments, we also implemented these three performance improving techniques for English X  X orean
CLIR. 4.2.1. Phrase translation
Phrases help reducing the number of possible translation equivalents of query terms. More impor-into a single Korean word or a phrase with m words where n is not equal to m . Since it is critical to we decided to implement this technique in this work. As some Korean words can be translated into an
English phrase and these English phrases can be included in some English queries, a Korean X  X nglish bilingual dictionary can be used for translating at least those English phrases. Our phrase translation, therefore, is based on the Korean X  X nglish bilingual dictionary as well as English X  X orean bilingual dictionary. 4.2.2. Proper noun translation We translated English proper nouns using the bilingual dictionary that had been expanded by collecting for the CLIR task is Korean documents, we collected the pairs related to the Korean. They include: Korean place names (e.g. Seoul , Pyongyang ), Korean company names (e.g. Samsung , Hyundai Mobis ), Korean uni-versity names (e.g. Korea University , Information and Communications University ), Korean hospital names sukung ). The total of 2640 English X  X orean proper noun pairs were added to the bilingual dictionary.
As some English queries may include Korean person names in the English X  X orean CLIR task, English translations of Korean person names must be translated back into Korean. For this purpose, we con-structed an English X  X orean biographical dictionary in a semi-automatic way. Korean person names consist
For example, Korean person name is transliterated as Lee Cheol Soo , a concatenation of Lee for , Cheol for , and Soo for . Hence, if pairs of Korean syllables and English transliterations exist, an
English X  X orean biographical dictionary can be constructed by taking combinations corresponding to a name. We have collected Korean person names from the Internet, extracted syllables from them, and con-structed Korean X  X nglish syllable pairs by transliterating the Korean syllables into English manually. The transliteration of Korean person names were then automatically generated using the Korean X  X nglish syl-lable pairs, resulting in an English X  X orean biographical dictionary. 4.2.3. Query expansion
In order to expand a query, every term that occurs in more than one document among the top 10 doc-Walker, 1999 ): the relevant documents (in this experiment, we set R to 10, since we use the top 10 documents), r number of the relevant documents in which the term t occurs, N is the size of the collection, n logarithm is the number of ways we can choose r t from R , and can be calculated as R ! terms that belong to the top 30 ranked terms and whose relevance weights are larger than 10 are added to the original query.

For pre-translation query expansion, the Financial Times English corpus from the TREC collection is used because its subject is similar to the target corpus consisting of economic newspaper articles. For post-translation query expansion, we used a corpus whose documents are also newspaper articles in Korea Economic Daily, which is the same as NTCIR-3.

Because English acronyms (e.g. WTO , GATT , APEC ) frequently occur in the Korean documents, we index English acronyms as well as Korean terms so that English acronyms can be added to the user query and to the Korean target query. For example, APEC and Taiwan in the English query are translated into recognized by the Korean noun extractor NE2000 ( Lee, Lee, &amp; Rim, 2001 ). 4.3. Experimental results methods.  X  Mono-IR: Korean queries in the test collection were used.  X  Simple QT: All translation equivalents of each query term were used.  X  MT-QT: Translations from a machine translation system 3  X  TDM-QT: A TDM based query translation (previous method) was employed.  X  I-TDM-QT: A new TDM based query translation (proposed method) was employed.  X  WMI-QT: A WMI based query translation (previous method) was employed.  X  I-WMI-QT: A new WMI based query translation (proposed method) was employed.
 WMI-QT and TDM-QT translate the user queries using Eq. (2) , and I-WMI-QT and I-TDM-QT using
Eq. (6) . 4.3.1. Performance of baseline methods
This section describes the performance of Mono-IR, Simple QT and MT-QT. The experimental results are shown in Table 1 , where the number in the parenthesis indicates the ratio of the performance of the method over that of Mono-IR. According to the table, the performance of MT-QT is better than that of Simple QT, but is less than 50% of Mono-IR. In English X  X orean CLIR, a MT system is not likely to be as satisfactory as a MT system in other CLIR, such as English X  X hinese CLIR ( Yang &amp; Ma, 2002 ) and English X  X apanese CLIR ( Jones et al., 1999 ). 4.3.2. Parameter setting
Two parameters are used in this experiment: the number of top ranked translation equivalents m and the maximum segment size MAX( s sq ). We experimented with various values of the parameters on I-WMI-QT, and then chose the values that have achieved the best performance. According to the experimental results represented in Fig. 2 , m and MAX( s sq ) are set to 2 and 5, respectively. 4.3.3. Improving query translation with TDM measure Table 2 presents the experimental results of I-TDM-QT and TDM-QT. According to the table, I-TDM-
QT gave a better result than TDM-QT consistently for the description and narrative queries, but a similar result with TDM-QT for the title queries. Since the title queries usually have few terms frequently, the query translation method for the title queries works relatively well, even when TDM-QT is used. We expect that our proposed method I-TDM-QT will be more useful, especially when the user query is more verbose like natural language or long expanded queries.
 Table 3 presents the performance of TDM-QT and I-TDM-QT with a query expansion technique. While
TDM-QT and I-TDM-QT have similar performance in the title query, the proposed method I-TDM-QT rative queries but also for the title queries when a query expansion is employed. 4.3.4. Improving query translation with WMI measure
We conducted similar experiments with the WMI association measure, and the experimental results are shown in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively.

As shown in Table 4 , I-WMI-QT outperforms WMI-QT in many cases. However, there is no significant difference between two methods. When the query expansion technique is used, moreover, the proposed we employed the Okapi relevance feedback method, which selects the terms associated with the top R doc-uments regarded as relevant documents to the user query. However, the query expansion does not guaran-tee that the added terms co-occur with the original query terms in a context window (a sentence). where the conventional WMI-QT method is used for translating the expanded new terms. For the compar-Tables 6 and 7 presents the experimental results of the two compromised methods respectively. level statistics, not the information about co-occurrence within the sentences, the expanded new terms can be translated more precisely by I-TDM-QT than by TDM-QT. 4.3.5. Comparison of query translation methods
Finally, we compared every query translation method based on the average precision. The query trans-lation methods with or without a query expansion method are compared as shown in Fig. 3 and 4 , respectively.

Fig. 3 shows that query term disambiguation is useful in CLIR when compared with Simple QT, and that the methods using a bilingual dictionary achieve much better performance than MT-QT in English X  X orean CLIR. Among the query translation methods we compared, I-TDM-QT shows the best performance, which is further improved by the query expansion technique. The performance of I-TDM-
QT + QE is 79.93%, 91.63%, and 79.28% of Mono-IR for title, description and narrative queries on the relax relevance, respectively. It should be also noted that based on our experimental results, the query expansion always improves the performance of CLIR, particularly for the description queries. The per-formance of our proposed method is better than that of the best system
CLIR, whose average precision was 21.26% on Relax Relevance criterion and 20.05% on Rigid Relevance criterion in the description field only ( Seo et al., 2002 ). 5. Conclusions and future work
Our proposed method for CLIR with query translation using a bilingual dictionary was motivated by the perceived problems of previous approaches. In selecting the best translation equivalent of a query term, of adjacent query terms. Our hypothesis was that the association information obtained this way would be are irrelevant in providing the context for association information. It would be more appropriate to con-term.

The new method we proposed attempts to remove the influence of the noise made by the irrelevant trans-terms. In this process, we consider associations between candidate translations corresponding to remote query terms, not just adjacent ones. Some heuristics helped to cut down the computational cost caused by combinatorial explosion.

We tested our proposed method using the NTCIR-3 English X  X orean CLIR test collection. In order to establish a strong baseline, we implemented some techniques known to be effective, such as phrase trans-lation and proper noun recognition. The experimental result show that the proposed approach improves ciation measure called total divergence to the mean (TDM) was used. We also observed the same kind of improvement when a query expansion technique was applied. And our proposed method outperforms the best system in NTCIR-3 English X  X orean task.

Despite the consistent improvement made by the new method, with which we consider the new method is the method work better than others and the other way around, to make some embellishment on the current approach. In addition, we plan to apply a more sophisticated algorithm for selecting the best translation equivalent and employ a more advanced query segmentation method such as bracketing and parsing.
