 Compact composite descriptors (CCDs) are global image features, capturing more than one types of information at the same time in a very compact representation. Their qual-ity has so far been evaluated in retrieval from several homo-geneous databases containing images of only the type that each CCD is intended for, and has been found better than other descriptors in the literature such as the MPEG-7 de-scriptors. In this study, we consider heterogeneous databases and investigate query-time fusion techniques for CCDs. The results show that fusion is beneficial, even with simple score normalization and combination methods due to the com-patibility of the score distributions produced by the CCDs considered.

Fusion in image retrieval goes hand-in-hand with prac-tical, viable system development, which is critical for the future of image retrieval research [3]. Two main approaches to fusion have been taken: early fusion , where multiple im-age descriptors are composed to form a new one before index time [8], and late fusion , where result-lists from individual descriptors are fused during query time [4, 5], as in text meta-search. While early fusion has been common, late fu-sion still remains an under-explored possibility.
Compact Composite Descriptors (CCDs) are global image features for content-based image retrieval. CCDs capture more than one types of information at the same time in a very compact representation. An example of early fusion is the Joint Composite Descriptor (JCD), created by combin-ing two CCDs [8]: the Color and Edge Directivity Descrip-tor (CEDD), and the Fuzzy Color and Texture Histogram (FCTH). The CEDD and FCTH can be seen as products of early fusion themselves, since they both combine color and texture information. Both descriptors are developed for color natural images, and experiments have shown that they perform better than the MPEG-7 descriptors and other de-scriptors in the related literature.
 The Brightness and Texture Directionality Histogram, or BTDH, is proposed for grayscale and medical radiology im-ages [7], and has been found to perform better than other descriptors in several benchmarking databases. The recently proposed Spatial Color Distribution (SpCD) combines color information and its spatial distribution in a quantized his-togram [9]. The SpCD is considered suitable for colored graphics, since they contain a relatively small number of colors and less texture regions than natural color images.
The quality of the aforementioned CCDs has so far been evaluated in retrieval from homogeneous benchmarking data-bases, containing images of only the type that each CCD is intended for. For example, the JCD is tested on NISTER [6] and Wang databases which contain natural color images, the BTDH on the IRMA database consisting of grayscale med-ical radiology images, and the SpCD on two benchmarking databases with artificially generated images.

In this study, we evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of late fusion techniques which enable the combined use of the JCD, BTDH, and SpCD, on heterogeneous databases.
We created a heterogeneous database with 20230 images by joining the following: 9000 grayscale images from the IRMA 2005 database; 10200 natural color images from the NISTER database and 1030 artificially generated images from the Flags database [9].

We used 40 queries: The first 20 natural color image queries from the NISTER database and the first 20 grayscale queries of the IRMA 2005 database.

Fusion methods consist of a score normalization and a score combination component. We mainly focus on the nor-malization, using each time the combination method more natural to the normalization at hand, although we investi-gated other possibilities in initial experiments not reported here. Five fusion methods were tested: We evaluate with two measures: the Average Normalized Modified Retrieval Rank (ANMRR), and the Mean Average Precision (MAP). ANMRR is the evaluation measure used in all the MPEG-7 color core experiments; it ranges between 0 and 1, with 0 being the maximum effectiveness.
Since the goal of fusion is to achieve better results than those achieved by any of the CCDs in isolation, we use the performance of SpCD as baseline, as shown in Table 1. Descriptor / Fused 40 Queries JCD 0.3554 0.5899 BTDH 0.4015 0.5555 SpCD 0.3081 0.6311 CombSUM 0.2491 0.7121 BC + CombSUM 0.2678 0.6848 Z-score with Mean + CombSUM 0.2400 0.7194 Z-score with Median + CombSUM 0.2420 0.7193 IRP 0.2729 0.6674 HIS + multiplication 0.2664 0.6846
All fusion methods beat the baseline. Best effectiveness overall is achieved by Z-score which beats the baselines of the individual CCDs by wide margins. Both versions (with the mean or median) perform similarly.

While HIS performs better than IRP and close to BC, it lacks behind Z-score and the bare CombSUM. We tried us-ing more than 50 historical queries (up to 1000) in order to deduce smoother normalization functions, but the effective-ness of HIS did not improve. This is in line with [1], where 50 queries were deemed sufficient to achieve a performance plateau.
 The performance of the bare CombSUM is remarkable. Although it is considered a naive method [2], it is found effective and robust. On a further investigation it turned out that the reason for this is the similarity of the SDs, in both shape and range, across the CCDs (Fig. 1).

We investigated methods for fusing retrieval results ob-tained from an heterogeneous image database using multiple descriptors individually. This type of fusion, known as late fusion, is found to be a viable method for retrieving from heterogeneous databases, which improves effectiveness over single descriptor baselines even with simple score normaliza-tion and combination methods.

While [2] postulates that effective normalization methods should be non-linear taking into account the shape of SDs X  especially for non-text descriptors where a wilder variety of SDs is assumed X  X e found these claims to be not necessar-ily true. By using compatible descriptors from the family of CCDs, combining by adding bare or linearly normalized scores with Z-score works best. [1] A. Arampatzis and J. Kamps. A signal-to-noise [2] A.
