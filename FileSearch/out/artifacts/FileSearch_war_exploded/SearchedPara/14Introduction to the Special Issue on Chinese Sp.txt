 Research and development in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications for education continues to progress, building on diverse techniques, such as statisti-cal learning, rule-based analysis, and hybrid methods. The research community has organized a series of workshops on the Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications (BEA) to improve existing capabilities and to generate creative ways to use NLP in educational applications for writing, reading, and assessment. In addition to research papers, several shared tasks have also been organized. For example, Help-ing Our Own (HOO) [Dale and Kilgarriff 2010] is a series of shared tasks in correcting textual errors. HOO 2011 investigated a diverse range of grammatical error types in a small set of documents written by non-native English speakers [Dale and Kilgarriff 2011]. HOO 2012, hosted by the 7th BEA Workshop at NAACL-HLT 2012, focused on preposition and determiner error correction in a large collection of non-native speak-ers X  texts [Dale et al. 2012]. Recently, grammar checking for learners of English as a foreign language has attracted more attention from the NLP research community. The shared tasks at CoNLL 2013 and CoNLL 2014 related to grammatical error correc-tion [Ng et al. 2013, 2014]. In summary, all of these competitions have increased the visibility of educational application research in the NLP community.
 However, the workshops and shared tasks mentioned predominantly focus on English language learning. Unlike the English learning setting for which many learn-ing technologies have been developed, learning tools to support Asian language learn-ers are relatively rare. In response, the Chinese Spelling Check Bakeoff was organized as part the 7th SIGHAN Workshop, which was held in conjunction with IJCNLP 2013 [Wu et al. 2013]. This shared task is the first of the open evaluations for automatic Chinese spelling checkers. A second version of this bakeoff was collocated with the 3rd CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing [Yu et al. 2014]. A third has been organized in conjunction with the 8th SIGHAN Workshop at ACL-IJCNLP 2015 [Tseng et al. 2015]. The main purpose of these bakeoffs is to provide a common setting so that researchers who approach the tasks with different linguistic factors and computational techniques can compare their results. Through such techni-cal forums, researchers can exchange their experiences to advance the field and even-tually find the best solutions to the tasks.

The SIGHAN-7 Bake-off attracted the participation of 17 international research teams. Each team could submit at most three sets of results in the formal run, so we received 63 systems X  results in total. This special issue contains articles that were selected and extended from 13 technical reports of the participating teams in the SIGHAN-7 Bakeoff for Chinese Spelling Check [Wu et al. 2013]. In the remainder of this introduction article, we provide an overview of the technical articles in this special issue (Section 2). We then present conclusions along with future work in Section 3. Spell checking in Chinese is relatively less studied than for English, and very few tools are available. For example, although Microsoft Word has provided spell-checking for English for many years, there is no such function in Word for Chinese. Spell-checking is particularly challenging for Chinese, in part, because whether or not a Chinese charac-ter is correct depends on its context. For example, the character  X   X  (cuo4) is correct in the word  X   X  (cuo4 shi;  X  X easures X  in English), but it is incorrect in the word  X   X  which instead should be  X   X  (cuo4 zhe2;  X  X rustration X ). Empirical analysis shows that most Chinese spelling errors arise from phonologically similar, visually similar, and semantically confusable characters [Liu et al. 2011]. Automatic spelling check-ers should be capable of both error detection and correction, that is, of indicating the various types of spelling errors and suggesting the correct characters for the detected errors. In addition to achieving promising detection/correction rates on erroroneous characters, reducing the false alarm rate is also important [Wu et al. 2010].
The SIGHAN-7 Chinese Spelling Check Bakeoff provided an evaluation platform for developing automatic spelling checkers [Wu et al. 2013]. Two subtasks were or-ganized: (1) The error detection subtask focused on judging the ability of systems to detect erroneous characters. The resulting systems should identify if there are spelling errors in a given sentence and point out the locations of the incorrect characters. (2) The error correction subtask aimed to improve the effectiveness of correcting spelling errors. This task is a follow-up to error detection. In addition to indicating the error locations, the spelling checkers developed should also identify the corresponding correct characters. Through such evaluation campaigns, advanced Chinese spell check-ing techniques have emerged. This special issue includes four articles that present novel systems for Chinese spell checking from the SIGHAN-7 Bakeoff. We briefly describe them as follows.

Chen et al. in their article,  X  X  Probabilistic Framework for Chinese Spelling Check, X  propose a probability-based framework that augments a trigram language model with a substitution model and topic language modeling. The topic language model aims to enhance local n -gram constraints with longer-distance semantic information. Web resources are also integrated within this system to improve candidate set generation. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework for correcting Chinese spelling errors.

Liu et al. in  X  X  Hybrid Ranking Approach to Chinese Spelling Check X  adopt both a statistical machine translation model and a language model as the components of their proposed framework for correction candidate generation. A support vector machine is employed to rank the generated candidates for Chinese spelling error correction. Results of extensive experiments indicate that their framework outperforms other sys-tems which use the same or similar resources and it obtains competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art systems.
 In the article  X  X hinese Spelling Checker Based on an Inverted Index List with a Rescoring Mechanism X , Yeh et al. propose a ranked inverted index list-based approach for Chinese spelling error detection and correction. An inverted index is used to rep-resent a word lattice constructed using phonologically and visually similar charac-ters. The scoring mechanism, which is composed of a language model and a correction model, is adapted to select the near optimal path in the inverted index list. Maximum entropy is also employed to simultaneously integrate character-level, word-level, and contextual-level features. Experimental results demonstrate that using three-level information can improve the performance of Chinese spelling checkers.
 Hsieh et al. in the final article entitled,  X  X orrecting Chinese Spelling Errors with Word Lattice Decoding X , develop a word lattice decoding model that simultaneously executes word segmentation and error correction to overcome the difficulties caused by unclear word boundaries in Chinese. They extract samples of spelling errors from the Google Web 1T Chinese corpus to collect a realistic distribution over errors. A methodology of producing n -best suggestions for spelling error correction is introduced to make the spelling checker more practical in real-world applications. In this introduction, we looked into the production and trends of NLP applications for education. We summarized the technical articles in this special issue to review their approaches and designs for Chinese spelling checkers.

We also identified some possible future directions. In the Bake-off, texts are pro-cessed in batch mode; nevertheless, detecting and correcting spelling errors while people are typing can be quite challenging for software design. Furthermore, re-searchers may want to extend their work to tackle more types of grammatical errors, including permutation, insertion, deletion, and substitution errors in Chinese texts. Chinese grammatical error correction is a highly challenging issue with many avenues for future research.
