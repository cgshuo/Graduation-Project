 The goal of interactive cross-lingual information retrieval systems is to support users in formulating effective queries and selecting the documents which satisfy their information needs regardless of the language of these documents. This dissertation aims at harnessing user-system interaction, extracting the added value and integrating it back into the system to improve cross-lingual information re-trieval for successive users. To achieve this, user input at different interaction points will be evaluated. This will, among others, in-clude interaction during user-assisted query translations, implicit and explicit relevance feedback and social tags. To leverage this input, explorative studies need to be conducted to determine bene-ficial user input and the methods of extracting it.

Digital Libraries which aggregate and provide access to collec-tions in different languages are confronted with problems of mul-tilingual information access (MLIA). The most challenging aspect is the search capability of the system, which is referred to as cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). CLIR is characterized by dif-ferences in query and document language [3]. The main difficulties for CLIR are the disambiguation of the query term in the source and target language and the identification of the query language. Tools for CLIR such as dictionaries are not universally available in every language needed or in every domain covered in digital libraries.
This dissertation aims at harnessing user input for improving and extending existing CLIR processing tools and consequently CLIR systems in their entirety. The goal is to bridge a gap between re-search on interactive cross-lingual information retrieval and studies focusing on establishing sustainable ways to leverage user input.
In this context, user interaction and collaboration comprises so-cial tagging and other system interaction components like query reformulations and relevance feedback.
