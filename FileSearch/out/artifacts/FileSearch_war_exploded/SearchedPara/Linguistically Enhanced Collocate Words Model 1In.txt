 It has been reviewed that ba g -of-word (BOW) approach i g nores the context of occ u r-str u ct u re and context information are lost with BOW [2,3]. Similarly, the employment of a fixed size window in word co-occ u rrence identification [1], [4-9] is also lackin g on linear word proximimity which act u ally has i g nored the lin gu istic properties of the related is called collocation [10]. Words extracted based on collocation can represent Lapata [13] shared similar view that the g ist of a doc u ment can be better modeled by [20,21,22]. Accordin g to Seretan [23], syntax-based approach has the advanta g e over the syntax-free approach for collocation identification since there is no limitations on the maxim u m distance that collocation components can be fo u nd. The main objective of this paper is to propose a semantic window of words to address the needs in pro-sis. The semantic window of words has lin gu istic elements which can be injected for collocate word identification. vidin g the lin gu istic frame of reference for collocation identification.

 semantic bo u ndaries (which will be called  X  X emantic window of collocate words X ) is proposed. The followin g section describes the tasks employed for the model. Semantic dependency parsin g is the process of obtainin g a semantically labeled P AS ind u ce P AS for semantic dependency parsin g . It is claimed that the dependency str u c-t u re can provide a simple and transparent encodin g of P AS [37-41]. The availability of P AS scheme corpora for semantic roles like FrameNet [42], semantic dependency parsers to be developed. A core task that has almost become a (SRL) [36]. The recent semantic dependency parsin g researches have been fostered thro ug h CoNLL Shared Tasks 2006, 2007, 2008 [46,47,48] and CoNLL-X Shared Tasks 2009 [49]. Malt parser [50] and MST parser [47] have obtained state of the art performance in CoNLL Shared Tasks 2006 and 2007 while LTH parser [51] has the best performance in CoNLL Shared Tasks 2008. LTH parser is u sed for semantic dependency parsin g in this research. The characteristic of CoNLL Shared Tasks 2008 and CoNLL-X Shared Tasks 2009 is the employment of an inte g rated syntactic and semantic approach for dependency parsin g . The different tasks employed in the proposed semantic window of collocate words identification are: (a) semantic dependency parsin g , (b) semantic window of word, (c) collocate window, and (d) collocate words. These tasks are described below. 4.1 Semantic Dependency PAS Based on semantic dependency P AS, the semantic event inherited the followin g properties: u sed as the semantic window of word in this paper. 4.2 Semantic Window of Word These ch u nks represent the semantic window of words in this paper. Fi g . 1 ill u strates the semantic window of words formation. 4.3 Collocate Window mantically related windows are defined as collocate windows. The collocate windows have a predicate-ar gu ment relation. This collocation has been enhanced with lin gu is-tically injected elements in the form of thematically related predicate-ar gu ment. Words that exist within a seman tic window are collocate words. Fi g . 2 ill u strates the formation of lin gu istically injected collocate window. 4.4 Collocate Words the lin gu istically injected collocate window is u sed to identify collocate words in this sively nested word-word binary collocation is an identification of complex colloca-tions [10]. Fi g . 3 ill u strates the collocate words identi fied based on collocate window. 5.1 Data and u sed in this research. 5.2 Sliding Window text as shown in Fi g . 4. This is u sed as the baseline for comparison with the proposed semantic window. 5.3 Method In this research, each sentence is represented as a g raph network consistin g of linked of the link. The collocate words are identified based on the proposed semantic words resemble more to a nei g hbo u rhood network. P a g erank, a nei g hbo u rhood based centrality meas u re, is u sed to comp u te g raph centrality scores. 
Rankin g words are comp u ted u sin g the g raph centrality meas u re based on adjacen-cy matrix prepared from slidin g window and the semantic window of collocate words. A window span of five words is recommended for word extraction [10],[29] u sin g slidin g window. Besides, three experts are involved to annotate the same set of data to reliability and inter-rater a g reement. 5.4 Relative Prominence of Semantic Role theories for SRL by Grimshaw [53] defined external ar gu ment as the most prominent in two hierarchies within lexical-semantic str u ct u re, which are g iven below: 
The parentheses reflect prominence and least embedded means most prominent, more deeply embedded means less prominent. For example, the verb ann o un ce has an other more embedded ar gu ments. In the context of relative prominence to each other; the Goal is more prominent than the Theme. 5.5 Discussion a g reement at a precision of 0.8 amon g all three annotaters are selected from the data tance of words in a sentence based on semantic window of collocate words u sin g P a g erank centrality meas u re. A s u mmary for the case st u dies based on both semantic and slidin g window in comparison with the three annotaters  X  top five content words is shown in Table 1. 
Based on the analysis in Table 1, it is observed that semantic window of collocate overall precision is comp u ted by comparin g the top five content words obtained from 
Semantic window of collocate words for case w sj_06 7 5_2.txt and w _0019_0.txt tracted by semantic window of collocate words. Th u s, a combination of relative prominence for verbal predicate and freq u ency of collocate content words has enabled semantic window of collocate words to model the extraction of top five content words very closely to the annotators. 
Both semantic window of collocate words and slidin g window have avera g e preci-taters. This shows that semantic window of collocate words can perform eq u ally well window of collocate words is depended on the combination of relative prominence of verbal predicate and collocate content words. This approach takes into consideration the str u ct u re and relationship between words in a sentence. One drawback of slidin g window is that the linear word proximity approach act u ally has i g nored the lin gu istic criteria of the words [11]. The val u e added feat u res of the proposed semantic window of collocate words over slidin g window are shown in Table 2. This section will describe q u antitative eval u ation of word collocation extraction based sentences were extracted from TimeBank1.2 corp u s to be u sed as the raw text for data take into consideration the freq u ency and relative prominence of collocate words based on semantic window of collocate words are defined.
