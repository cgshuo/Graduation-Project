 Vehicular networks have recently attracted much attention from both academia and on-vehicle entertainment. As far as wireless communication technology is concerned, while the majority of the existing work on vehicular networks focuses on IEEE 802.11 as specified by wireless access vehi cular environment (WAVE) [1], fairly (MRS), which relays data between base station (BS) and MS X  X  [3]. MRS in vehicular networks can be fixed on a large vehicle such as a coach or a shuttle bus. The advent of MRS can not only enhance the signal strength but also significantly reduce signal-ing overhead by handing over multiple service connections simultaneously, i.e., group handover (GHO). A better network selection algorithm for group handover is pro-proposed channel borrowing algorithm an d adaptive QoS platform, which an acceptor this donor cell has some channels available after satisfying a minimum QoS level. 
This paper proposes a GHO scheme with channel borrowing. The number of chan-release some channels for borrowing when the BS have no enough free channels re-source. In the rest of the paper, by GHO we mean GHO with the support of channel and evaluation of GHO for the first time to the best of our knowledge. As the typical application of GHO scheme is for vehicular networks, there are two possi-ble communication situations: (1) a single MS connecting to a BS directly can hand over to a target BS individually; (2) a group of MSs connecting with BS through an intermedi-ate MRS is considered as one single unit and hands over to the target BS in one go. This paper considers the situation where both situations coexist, as shown in Fig. 1. The proposed GHO scheme with channel borrowing can adjusts the grade of service requested channels for handover, B avb is available channels in the target BS. Then the BS can provide some borrowed channels from the existing service connections by probability (HBP), we must ensure denotes the number of channels that should be borrowed from the existing connections. 
In the proposed scheme, we use the following parameter definitions: The maximum number of channels borrowed from other connections in the target BS can be calculated as channels for borrowing. The rtPS in the MRS and others connections X  channel in this calculated as when ) ( ) ( ) ( MRS are needed to release channels. The released channels are then used for GHO, in which the released channels of every nrtPS can be calculated as when ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( which the released channels of every nrtPS and rtPS can be calculated as nrtPS in the BS and MRS are requested to decrease to the minimum number of chan-nels that can sustain a service just as equation (4) shown, and all of rtPS in the BS and MRS are also requested to releases some ch annels for GHO. The released channels of every rtPS for group handover MSs is calculated as Otherwise, because of user X  X  differences, some users X  nrtPS connections will be blocked to release more channels and guarantee the group MSs rtPS handover. consider that all types of service calls arrival follow a Poisson process with rate  X  , the channel holding time is an exponential distribution with service rate  X  , the user dwell-group MSs is composed of fixed multiple times as many as the single one. composed of two parts. Therefore, two types of handovers need to be considered means group MSs X  calls using GHO scheme. And we assume the number of group denotes the sum of used channel by all of the single MS and group MSs. We represent the state of reference BS with a three-dimensional Markov chain with all state transi-tions shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, where

So we should reduce the HBP using the GHO scheme with channel borrowing. In SHO and GHO scheme simulation, we assume that the number of total channels is channel number range occupied by one rtPS is from 2 to 4. The channel number range have the following parameters: the new calls arrival rates of rtPS and nrtPS for single MS and group MSs in GHO are 2 /  X  for GHO initial value are respectively , 3 . 0 calls completion rate be exponentially distributed with mean values N R  X   X  = =0.5. With the traffic loads increasing, we compared the performance of the proposed GHO scheme with SHO scheme. Fig. 4 shows the average HBP using the two differ-ent schemes.

With settled traffic load and average number of group MSs, the results the results, we can conclude that the decrease of HDP improves the connection QoS for group users in vehicular networks. for the IEEE 802.16j-enabled vehicular networks. Then we used the Markov chain model to conduct the performance analysis for SHO and GHO. The proposed GHO scheme reduces the HDP and handover delay to satisfy the the QoS in handover process. The analysis results show that GHO scheme has better overall system per-formance than the conventional SHO scheme. In the future, we will make further optimization in GHO process by considering dynamic two-level resource allocation.
