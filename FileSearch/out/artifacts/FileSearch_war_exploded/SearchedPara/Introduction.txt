 INTRODUCTION Latifur Khan  X  Valery Petrushin data mining area, such as automatic image annotation by exploiting association rule mining, clustering complex data based on density, real time classification of motion data, mapping mechanisms of hierarchical media, and indoor surveillance through the exploitation of domain knowledge.
 pers presented at the Fifth International Workshop on Multimedia Data Mining (MDM/KDD 2004), which was held in conjunction with the 10th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining, Seattle, Washington, August 22 X 25, 2004.
 ing using multi-relational associations X  by Ankur M. Teredesai et al., proposes a framework for generating auto annotations of test images by exploiting as-sociation rules between low level features of training images and correspond-ing annotated keywords. The paper  X  X eal-time classification of variable length multi-attribute motions X  by Chuanjun Li et al., proposes an effective approach for classifying motion data in real time by considering singular value decompo-sition (SVD) for feature reduction and using support vector machine for clas-sification. The paper  X  X iscovering mappings in hierarchical data from multi-ple sources using the inherent structure X  by K. Selc  X uk Candan et al., devel-ops a systematic framework for automatically discovering mappings in hier-archical media data, metadata, and ontologies, by exploiting the structural in-formation inherent in these types of data. The paper  X  X xtending metric index structures for efficient range query processing X  by Karin Kailing et al. presents multi-step query processing techniques including index structures to improve the performance of range queries in the domain of complex data. The paper  X  X ultiple-camera people localization in an indoor environment X  by Valery A. Petrushin et al., presents an indoor surveillance system which is using multiple cameras, agent-based technology and knowledge-based techniques to identify and track people and summarize their activities.
