 Bilingual web pages contain abunda nt term translation knowledge which is crucial for query translation in Cross Language Information Retrieval systems. But it is a challenging task to extract term translations from bilingual web pages due to the variation in web page layouts and writing styles. In this paper, based on the observation that translation pairs on the same web page tend to appear following similar patterns, a new extraction model is proposed to adaptively learn extraction patterns and exploit them to facilitate term translation mining from bilingual web pages. Experiments reflect th at this model can significantly improve extraction coverage while maintaining high accuracy. It improves query translation in cro ss-language information retrieval, leading to significantly higher re trieval effectiveness on TREC collections. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Performance, Design, Experimentation. Query Translation, OOV pr oblem, Web Mining, CLIR Bilingual lexicons are crucial resources for Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). One of the major reasons that CLIR does not perform as well as monolingual IR is the presence of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) term s in the queries, which cannot be translated with a regular dictionary. An analysis of a query log in a real world Chinese search engine reveals that 82.9% of the top 19,124 high frequency query terms were not included in the LDC Chinese-English dictionary. Due to the fact that the average length of web queries is short, even a single occurrence of an OOV term in the query may severely de teriorate the relevance of the retrieved documents by CLIR systems. However traditional bilingual dictionaries are manua lly crafted which is very expensive and time-consuming, and cannot be updated timely when new words appear. It is worthwhile to automatically construct bilingual dictionaries from text collections for translating Out-Of-Vo cabulary (OOV) terms. This perspective is more attractive than ever as the web has become a huge repository of translation knowledge. Much research has been devoted to mining parallel text from the web [8], and the parallel corpus then can be used to train a generi c translation model (or bilingual dictionary). However, parall el corpora cove rs only limited domains, and only common terms can be extracted from parallel texts. [3] learns bilingual knowledge from comparable corpus. Compared with parallel text, comparable corpus is easier to acquire. But comparable texts are not strict mutual translations, and hence mining term translati ons from comparable corpus has low accuracy. [5] treats anchor texts pointing to the same web pages as translations. Though it reports high precision, only a small number of term translations can be mined by this method. [2] leverages search engine X  X  quick re sponse. In these approaches, the source language term is provided a nd search engines are used to find the translation from the we b. Though interesting, these approaches are not feasible to build very large bilingual dictionaries. 
In this paper, we exploit bilingual web pages for translation mining. On the web, there exis t a large number of bilingual web pages, where terms and their tran slations co-occur in the same page written in a baseline language (figure 1). Existing methods [7,9] to exploit such resource le verage a set of manually defined rules that try to capture the la yout patterns between translation pairs (such as English terms followed by parenthesis of a Chinese term). Despite the merit of simplicity, this method suffers from major drawbacks in both mining accuracy and coverage. The hard rules assume they apply everywhere but in practice it X  X  hardly true. In many cases, a valid rule in some pages may only extract noises in others. And a finite set of handcrafted rules can never be complete to cover all bilingual web pages due to the diversity and sheer volume of the whole web. 
We propose a method that can adaptively identify the layout pattern for each bilingual page. It exploits the observation that when presenting foreign terms and their translations, authors exhibit very strong tendency to use the same layout pattern in the same page (figure 1). So if a term pair shares similar patterns with other pairs on the page that are known to be translations, the pair is likely to be translation as we ll and this pattern could offer useful clue for us to identify term translations in this page. It first extracts a set of possible candida te patterns from the page and a statistical ranking model is empl oyed to pick the most probable one for the page based on severa l criteria. Then a discriminative classifier leverages the discovered layout pattern to extract translation pairs from it. E xperiments show significant improvement of mining precision a nd recall using our approach. Our approach to term translat ion extraction goes through two steps. The first step deals with how to identify the translation layout pattern of the bilingual pa ge. It extracts all the bilingual term pairs in the page. A bilingual te rm pair consists of an English term and a Chinese N-gram within the window of size n around the English term. Some of these bilingual term pairs may be translations and some of them not. But at this stage we think all of them could potentially be transla tions and the layout pattern of each of these bilingual pairs is a candidate pattern. We evaluate the probabilities of these candidate patterns being the true pattern of the real translations pairs by using a statistical ranking model based on several criteria. These criteria are used as features in the ranking model and they will be described in section 2.1. The statistical model calculates the probability for each candidate pattern and the pattern with the highest probability is chosen to extract translation pairs in the ne xt step. The second step deals with leveraging the patterns found in the previous step for translation extraction. We pro pose a discriminative learning model that considers the pattern as a feature and combines it with other features for transla tion pair classifications. Given a candidate translation pair, their pattern is extracted in the following manner: the English term and Chinese candidate are first converted into the tokens &lt;eng&gt; and &lt;chi&gt;. Tokens between saved, while Chinese and English characters are converted to pattern as well, with only tag labels saved. For instance, &lt;a href= X  X bcd.com X &gt; is saved as &lt;a&gt;. Below shows some examples how patterns are extracted from candidate pairs. The underlined is the candidate translation. The reason why tokens between the pair are saved as its original form rather than a general token of translation are close in distance and tokens between them provides very indicative clues. Replacing the original tokens into &lt;b_chi&gt; or &lt;b_eng&gt; would make it too general to be distinctive. To match a pair with a pattern, the English term and the candidate translation are matched with &lt;eng&gt; and &lt;chi&gt; in the pattern first, and then the tokens between, prior to and next to the pair are matched with their corresponding positions in the pattern. The token &lt;b_chi&gt; and &lt;b_eng&gt; can be matched with any Chinese and English words. If all tokens of the pair can be matched with the pattern, then we consider it a fit with the pattern, or otherwise a rejection. Candidate patterns are extracted from candidate translation pairs and the key is to choose which one is the best pattern for translation extraction. For the candidate pattern we collect all the matching bilingual term pairs, and based on them we generate a set of features to measure the patt ern X  X  quality or its probability of being the right pattern. Below list all the features we use for pattern ranking with their description.  X  Number of bilingual pairs matching the candidate pattern.  X  The ratio of matching bilingual pairs that are translations  X  The ratio of matching pairs not included in an existing  X  Average translation probability of matching bilingual pairs.  X  Average transliteration score of matching bilingual pairs.  X  Average length similarity of matching bilingual pairs.  X  Web co-occurrence of fitting candidate translation pairs We employ the Maximum Entropy model to estimate the probability of the candidate patterns based on the above features, and the one with the highest probability is picked as the pattern for translation extraction from this page. Parameters of the maximum entropy model are traine d with iterative scaling on 200 training bilingual web pages where the correct patterns are manually annotated among the set of automatically extracted candidate patterns. Instead of dire ctly applying the pattern as a hard rule to match translation, we rather propose a discriminative model that could incorporate additional features for more accurate term translation identification due to the fact that pairs matching the rule may not always be translation and many pages do not even have translations while the pattern ranker still generates a best pattern which will only ex tract noises on such pages. If we consider all Chinese N-gr am in the bilingual page as possible translation candidates, then the translation mining process from a bilingual page is for each English term in the page to pick one of the Chinese N-grams as its translation or choose N/A if none of them is. Normally the number of all Chinese N-grams in a page is large, and he nce we only consider those within a window around an English term since the translation pair appear in close distance. We can consider this as a set of independent classification problem for each English term and a Maximum Entropy classifier can be used to choose the candidate with the highest probability. 
We go further by viewing term translation extraction on a page as a sequence labeling problem in stead of multiple independent classification problems. Such a view can model correlation between translation selections fo r different English terms. One correlation is that a Chinese term in the bilingual page tends not to serve as the translation for more than one English term in the same page. Another useful correla tion is that the relative spatial order of the translations tends to be the same as the order of English terms. If an English term occurs after , then  X  X  translation tends to appear after  X  X  translation as well. From the training data, the model can learn that translation pairs with reversed spatial order is rare and will give penalty to this case during testing time. We employ the Conditional Random Field (CRF) [7] for the sequence labe ling task. CRF defines the probability of a labe l sequence S given an input sequence X as where label sequences sum to 1. is an arbitrary feature function over the input sequence x , the current label and the previous label when the first-order Markov independence is assumed. maximizing the log likelihood of training examples. In our discriminative model, the obs erved data are the text on the web pages, and we want to identify translations (or N/A ) for the set of English terms from their translation candidate sets. Though the adaptively identified pattern is a very important feature, our discriminative model can incorpor ate other relevant feature to further improve extraction accuracy. Below we describe the set of features used in our CRF model fo r term translation extraction. Pattern Feature: It is a binary feature with 1 indicates that the layout of pair matches the patter n picked by the previous pattern identification step; otherwise the feature value is 0. Dictionary Feature : Two terms are likely to be translations if many of their composing words are translations according to an existing dictionary. So we divide the number of word pairs found in the dictionary with the total number of words of both terms as the score of the feature. Transliteration Score : Transliteration score is useful to measure is defined as where A is the alignment of their sound letters and . letters and is estimated via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm [4] on 592607 proper name transliteration pairs. Length Similarity : the length of true translation pairs is often proportional. We consider the normalized length difference  X  of the terms x and y to be normal distribution N(0,1) Distance Feature : This feature counts the number of words between the term and the translation candidate as the distance feature. The closer, the more likely they are translations. SCPCD : SCPCD is proposed in [3] to identify lexical boundaries of terms. It combines Symmetric Conditional Probability (SCP) and Context Dependency (CD) as th eir product. SCP is defined as: where is the word n-gram and freq is the frequence of the n-gram on the re turned snippets. SCP measures whether the n-gram should be regarded as a term. Context dependency (CD) measures whether the n-gram could be merged with its context to form an inde pendent term. It is defined as (or right) adjacent words. Transition Features : the transition features capture the non-overlapping and spatial order rela tions between translation pairs described in Section 2.3. The spatia l order feature is set to 1 if the translation of the current English term appears before that of the previous English term , otherwise 0. Similarly, the overlapping feature is set to 1 if the translation candidate of the current English term has overlapping characters with that of the previous English term. The only exception is the case of N/A. If an English term chooses N/A, the select ed translation of the previous English term is used for the next English term to compute its transition feature. We have conducted several e xperiments to evaluate the performance of our method. First we compare the mining precision and recall of our method with existing methods on bilingual web pages. Since CLIR is one of the major applications of bilingual lexicons, we evaluated the effectiveness of the mined dictionary on query translation and cross language search relevance. We implemented the pre-defined pattern based method (Fixed pattern) following [15] as our baselines. We also implemented several variants of our proposed methods using adaptively learned patterns. One is to directly apply the learned patterns as regular expression rules  X  X daptive (RULE) X . Another one is the Maximum Entropy model  X  X daptive (ME) X  and CRF model  X  X daptive (CRF) X . For the CLIR experiment, we trained a IBM model 1  X  X T X  with the GIZA ++ toolkit on parallel text. We first evaluate the accuracy of the term translation mining. We randomly selected 300 Chinese E nglish bilingual web pages as the test set, from which 13259 term translation pairs are manually annotated. We measure precision, recall and F-score of the mined translation pairs by each method. Experiment results are shown in table 1. The performance of the fixed pattern based method is poor in both precision and recall compared with other mining approaches. The fixed pattern based approach exhibits a low recall and this can be explained by the fact that the fixed pattern set cannot adapt to pages written in various styles. Methods using adaptively learned patterns sign ificantly outperform the baseline system. Among our adaptive methods, Adaptive (RULE) has the lowest precision and many of its errors are caused by noises without considering other features such as translation probability to filter them out. Adaptive (CRF) achieves the highest performance. In particular, it shows marked improvement in precision over the Adaptive (ME). OOV terms account for a large portion of the query terms in the web search engine. We prepared two query sets from Yahoo X  X  query log for this experiment. Th e first set consists of the 200 most frequently used English queries. The other is the randomly selected 200 English queries from the whole query log. First, a standard bilingual dictionary (ce3 from LDC) is used to translate the English queries into Chinese. We find that 61% of top queries and 47% of random queries contain OOV terms. Then, the remaining OOV terms are translated with the bilingual dictionaries mined by different mining approaches. The results are shown in table 2. The performance of the fixed pa ttern based method is relatively poor in both scenarios due to its limited adaptability to diverse web page styles. Methods usi ng adaptive pattern learning demonstrate significant advantag es in OOV translation coverage over the above two baseline methods. given that the higher query translation quality usually results in better relevance of the retrieved documents  X  we measure the retrieval relevance of the translated queries. Since we only focus on translating OOV terms, after tr anslating the te rms covered by the regular dictionary, we compare the CLIR performance before and after OOV terms are translated with the mined bilingual dictionaries. The test collection used in this evaluation task is the TREC-5 and TREC-6 Chinese collection. We take the  X  X itle X  section in each English topic as our queries. These queries are translated into Chinese and Lemur is used as our IR engine. We measure the MAP (Mean Average Precision) for the relevance of the returned retrieval results of the test queries. In the first run (Mono), we perform a mono-lingual retrieval using the Chinese titles of the TREC topics as queri es. In the second run (Dict), the LDC dictionary is employed to translate the English queries. All the English queries consist of 445 words, and there are 27 OOV terms. They are translated by the bilingual lexicons mined by different approaches in subse quent runs. Table 3 presents a comparison of the relevance of our English-Chinese CLIR experiments. The results show that query translation with the regular dictionary (D ICT) without translating OOVs offers the lowest relevance which amounts to 64.4% of the monolingual IR. Methods translating OOV terms show improvement in CLIR performance over this baseline method. The performance of the best method  X  X daptive (CRF) X  is significantly higher than that of the  X  X ict X . As shown in table 3, there is a gradual improvement in relevance from the fixed pattern based method to the adaptive CRF approach because the lexicon can cover more OOV terms while making less error. Adaptiv e CRF produces the best result. In this paper, we propose an ad aptive web mining scheme for acquiring term translations. This method is able to adaptively learn translation extraction patterns from individual bilingual web pages and exploit the learned patterns in a probabilistic framework for term translation ex traction. It can greatly improve coverage over pre-defined pa ttern based method while maintaining high accuracy. Since the patterns and our adaptive pattern learning procedures ar e language independent, it can be easily ported to other language pa irs. Experiments show marked improvement in query translation accuracy and cross-lingual IR performance with our proposed term translation mining method. [1] P. F. Brown, V. J. Della Pietra, S. A.
