 1. Introduction
Typically researchers evaluate Website usage in terms of the number of hits made or the number of pages viewed but there is, in fact, a much more meaningful use metric, and that is the number of sessions conducted.
A session delineates a number of related information actions, like searching and displaying. In general parlance a session is a  X  X isit X . In addition to providing simple counts, as a complimentary activity metric to page views, sessions can also be used to denote the amount of time that a user spends on a site and the number of pages viewed. Given the difficulties of identifying users in a virtual space it also acts as a proxy for user counts. A Web session can be described as  X  X he group of activities performed by the user from the moment they entered the site to the moment they left it X  ( Berendt, Mobasher, Spiliopoulou, &amp; Wiltshire, 2001 ). Unfor-tunately, despite the undoubted value of this metric in identifying online activity and denoting information seeking behaviour, there are real problems associated with identifying sessions in the logs because there is no way of telling from the transactional log file that a user X  X  session has come to an end. Hardly anyone logs off from a site, they simply leave the site and this is conducted quite anonymously as far as the logs are con-cerned. Therefore researchers have to resort to special techniques in order to reconstruct session data. Spili-opoulou, Mobasher, Berendt, and Nakagawa (2003) explained that session reconstruction must fulfil two tasks: First, all activities performed by the same physical person should be grouped together. Second, all activ-ities belonging to the same visit should be placed into the same group.

Session based metrics are important and can tell us about the extent of the user X  X  engagement or interest in the site. Thus, arguably, those spending more time at the site or viewing a greater number of pages during a session can be said to demonstrate a stronger interest, and they might well constitute core users. There are also additional powerful metrics that only become apparent at the session level, for example, how many different subjects or journals are viewed during a visit to a digital library and how people navigate through a site. Hence the identification of session delimiters is important as the correct identification of a session will result in better and more robust session based metrics. 2. Sessionization approaches In order to take advantage of the information that session-based metrics can reveal about use and users of
Websites, researchers have developed session identification methods and sessionization heuristics. Sessionizing is the process of segmenting the user activity log of each user into sessions. A sessionization heuristic is a method for performing such a segmentation on the basis of assumptions about users X  behaviour or site char-acteristics ( Spiliopoulou et al., 2003 ). Although the constructed session employing sessionizing techniques might be different from the real session conducted by the user, the aim is to minimize the error and get as close as possible to the real sessions. There are a few basic approaches to sessionization, of which we shall describe the main ones briefly here (based on: Berendt et al., 2001; Spiliopoulou et al., 2003 ): 1. The proactive approach . This utilises a cookie or a session identification mechanism. A cookie is a small piece of code associated with a Website; it installs itself on the user X  X  host and associates a cookie identifier with the user X  X  browser. Whenever the user requests a page from the Web server, the cookie identifier is attached to the request and returned to the server. This method has its own problems, for example, users can turn cookies off on their browser. Servers can also use a  X  X ession identification mechanism X . This mech-anism is usually implemented as a Web server software option that associates a unique identifier to each client process accessing the server. This identifier is attached to each request made by the user X  X  client to the server, thus allowing for the unique assignment of requests to users during one visit. The identifier expires when the user X  X  client process is terminated, when the connection is broken, or when a timeout occurs. But the main problem remains unsolved here as the real end of the session is still unclear. 2. The reactive approach . While the proactive approach is an attempt to map activities to a user while (or actu-ally even before) the user accesses the site, the reactive approach attempts do the mapping from the server X  X 
Web log after the user has accessed the site. Two of the main strategies in the reactive approach are time oriented heuristics and navigation oriented heuristics. Navigation oriented heuristics do not consider the time a user spends on a page or at a site but rather exploits behavioural habits associated with Web nav-igation. Reactive approaches are not commonly used and assume that user behaviour is consistent in that session termination will occur at particular points in the search process.
 It is commonly used practice (see Section 5 ) to mark a session as having ended after a period of inactivity. That is a single time out delimiter is selected and if the page view time exceeds that cut-off the session is clas-sified as having ended. Incorrectly specifying the time out delimiter can result in one of two types of error: the marking of a session as having ended when in fact it has not (session addition error) or accepting a session as continuing when it has ended (session subtraction error). However, a single time out delimiter cannot do much to minimise both errors. If the single time out delimiter is set for users who terminate a session on a page viewed for a short time then user terminations on a page viewed for a long time will be subject to a session addition error and a single session will incorrectly broken into two or more session as the user X  X  actual page view time exceeds the delimiter value. Alternatively if the single time out delimiter is set for sessions terminated on a page viewed for a long time then there is a risk of a session subtraction error for users actually terminat-ing their session on pages viewed for a short period.

The way Internet connections are made can also increase the likelihood of a session subtraction error or a failure to mark a session as having ended. The use of proxy server connections means that there will be a num-ber of computers that connect to and share the same Internet protocol (IP) number. In these cases there is an increased chance that the previous session will be taken over by a following user. Here there are potentially a number of users connecting via the same IP number. Only the IP number is recorded in the logs and the users connecting via the IP number are not identified. As one user leaves, an event that is not recorded in the logs, another user may take up or continue the last user X  X  session. This is more likely to happen the higher the cut-off period is set for delimiting sessions.

The setting of the time lapse that marks a session end will impact on session metrics. Setting the delimiter length long will increase a session subtraction error and fails to mark a session as having ended. The number of sessions would be deflated as sessions are rolled into one but session length and the number of views in a session will be inflated. If, however, too little time is allowed and the session delimiter is set short there is a greater chance of breaking up a user X  X  session into two or more sessions resulting in an inflated count of ses-sions and a deflated session length and lower number of views in a session.

To date researchers have tended to view the time out signal that marks the end of a session as a single value, usually as a number of minutes or seconds of inactivity. However, the authors argue in this paper that the period of inactivity is dependent on what the user is actually viewing. That is some pages take longer to view than other pages and cut-off values need to reflect this. This implies that a number of timeout signals should be applied in the calculating of session endings. 3. Case study
This paper originates from a major, three year long 3 international study, MaxData, conducted by Univer-sity College London (UCL) and the University of Tennessee. The project is funded by the U.S. Institute of
Museum and Library Services and its broad aim is to compare the costs and benefits of various methods of usage data collection and analysis in selected libraries in the U.S. What we present in this paper is the results of one its research strands which set out to show what usage data could be obtained from a powerful emerging methodology, deep log analysis, developed by the CIBER team at UCL. A case study, big enough to portray the methodology X  X  ability to process truly massive volumes of data and provide a range of very big picture, pertinent analyses was required. OhioLINK, The Ohio Library and Information Network, provided the per-fect vehicle, supplying as it does a single digital platform containing nearly 6000 full-text journal to more than 600,000 people. OhioLINK 4 is a consortium of Ohio academic libraries in both the public and private sector. 4. Aims and objectives
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how to define sessions more accurately by setting multiple cut-off times for identifying the end of a session The setting of the time out delimiter for the identification of a session termination is of vital importance as this directly impacts on session level metrics. In particular it will: 1. demonstrate how arbitrary set time out thresholds impact on page view time metrics and estimates of the number of sessions; 2. establish the correct statistic for estimating the delimiter; 3. put forward a robust method for defining a session delimiter and, lastly, 4. adapt the proposed model to take account of additional factors, such as actual read time and the presence of proxy servers.

This research is undertaken with reference to the logs of the OhioLINK consortium. 5. Literature review
A session consists of a number of related page views and transactional log files give the time of the page delivered from a server to a requesting client computer and from this can be calculated page view times. How-ever as He and Go  X  ker (2000) point out because logs do not record a session termination there is no data for the last page viewed and therefore no marker of a session end. In order to overcome this researchers have applied a time out signal after which the session is assumed to have ended. Such a methodology has been used in con-nection with OPAC logs ( Tolle, 1984 ), digital kiosk logs ( Nicholas, Huntington, &amp; Williams, 2003 ), digital TV tronic journal logs ( Nicholas, Huntington, &amp; Watkins, 2005 ) and digital library logs ( Cooper, 2001 ). Catledge and Pitkow (1995) established a 25.5 min session time interval based on their user experiments. They modified a Web browser to record the time interval between user actions on the browser X  X  interface.
One result was that the arithmetic mean time interval between two consecutive events, the estimate of page view time, by a user was 9.3 min. They argued that the most statistically significant events occur within 1.5 standard deviations from the mean and therefore, they recommended 25.5 min as the threshold for session identification. This has been rounded to 30 min and is used in many applications as a rule of thumb for maxi-mum session length ( Berendt et al., 2001; Cooley, Mobasher, &amp; Srivastava, 1999; Spiliopoulou et al., 2003 ).
Several researchers have also used the 30 min time out rule, including Zawitz (1998), Mahoui and Cunning-ham (2000) and Mat-Hassan and Levene (2005) . The authors believe that Catledge and Pitkow X  X  approach is most appropriate but they based this approach on statistics which generated bias estimates. The approach adopted was that the session end terminator needs to be set based on statistically significant events. Catledge and Pitkow argued this to be 1.5 standard deviations from the mean. However, the arithmetic mean and stan-dard deviation are sensitive to skewed data and log time metrics are particularly skewed hence estimates of the mean and standard deviation will be biased.

Nicholas et al. (2005) in a analysis of an electronic journals library have shown that page view time is not normally distributed and is highly skewed and that the mean and standard deviation estimates will be biased and provide incorrect values. Studies ( Nicholas et al., 2005 ) have shown that Web pages are routinely viewed on average (median) for less than 1 or 2 min. A page view time that would suggest that the Catledge and Pit-kow (1995) estimate of 9.3 min is grossly inflated as a result of the data being skewed.

Cooley et al. (1999) proposed a session reference length. This method explores the idea that pages are viewed for different periods and opted for a single cut-off time value based on an average over the view times to the different types of pages, for example, menu and content pages. The cut-off value varies according to the number of each type of page on a site. The model placed limits on the number of content pages that could be viewed. Huang, Peng, An, and Schuurmans (2004) criticised this method in that only one content page is included in each session. They believed that this may not be a good model for real sessions because users may obviously look at more than one content page for a single retrieval purpose.

Another way of denoting a session end is to do this on the basis of user actions. Thus Chen, Park, and Yu (1998) proposed a method for session identification, which they called maximal forward reference. In the case of their method, each session is defined as the set of pages from the first page in a request sequence to the final page before a backward reference is made. Here the use of a backward reference triggers a session end. Huang et al. (2004) however notes that this method assumes that backward navigation is recorded by the server and this is unlikely to be the case as these pages would have been cached by the local client computer. Further-more, in many cases, the user may go back to a menu page to visit additional pages but the system proposed by Chen et al. (1998) would define this activity incorrectly as a session end. Huang et al. (2004) proposed a variation of this model based on an information theoretic approach. This is complex and derived from lan-guage modelling. It looks at following use patterns and in a simplistic example creates markers where we would expect sessions to begin, for example, when the user views a content page.

Related research has been undertaken into session termination with regard to search server logs. These logs record user searches and differ from Website logs in that they record search statements made using either the internal or external search facility while Website logs record the pages delivered or viewed by the client. Sil-verstein, Marais, Henzinger, and Moricz (1999) used a cut-off of 5 min in a study of AltaVista search engine logs. Jansen and Spink (2006b) criticised the 5-min cut-off for being too short and argued that research (e.g.
He, Go  X  ker, &amp; Harper, 2002; Jansen &amp; Spink, 2003 ) had shown that the typical search session was about 15 min. In another study Spink, Park, and Jansen (2006, p. 267) did not impose a session time limit in study of search engine logs. Instead they considered session as  X  X  X he entire series of queries submitted by a user dur-ing one interaction with the Web search engine, session length varied from less than a minute to a few hours X  X .
Jansen, Spink, and Koshman (2007) adopted a similar approach in a study of Dogpile.com metasearch engine logs. They analysed just a single day X  X  (24 h) worth of logs. They explained that they  X  X easured the session duration from the time the first query was submitted to the time when the user departed the search engine for the last time (i.e., did not return) X . This is problematical as all the sessions might have conducted by a user who returned to the search engine during the studied day and this would have been considered a single session.
Thus 3.8% of the sessions were more than 4 h long with the longest session being just under 24 h (23:57:51). He et al. (2002) in a  X  X hat is viewed X  approach to session termination grouped a user X  X  consecutive search activities on the same search topic into one session. However, the weakness here is that users will search for more than one topic in a session. Furthermore, this approach cannot be applied to Website logs as many pages do not have a subject classification.
 Researchers have also experimented with shorter values of inactivity as delimiting marking a session end.
Thus He and Go  X  ker (2000) conducted an experimental study using the timeout method on two sets of logs. In their experiments, the threshold was set large initially and then gradually decreased. The authors concluded that a time range of 10 X 15 min was an optimal session interval threshold. In another paper, Go  X  ker and He (2000) focused on detecting boundaries of sequences between related activities (sessions) that would group the activities for a learning purpose. Their research was based on a set of transaction records of searches by Reuters Intranet users. They compared the generated boundaries with human judgement and the compar-ison confirmed that a meaningful session threshold for establishing these session boundaries was confined to an 11 X 15 min range. He et al. (2002) used intervals in the range 8.6 X 15 min for session identification in a study of Web search logs. They used time intervals in a different way. Instead of trying to find one particular session interval that would identify most session shifts, they calculated the probability of a particular time gap between activities containing a session shift given its time interval. They argued that the choice of 8.6 X 15 min was due to the results of their previous research ( Go  X  ker &amp; He, 2000 ) that showed that using time intervals between 10 and 12 min produced the lowest number of errors. The errors occur when two adjacent activities for related search statements are allocated into different sessions; or when unrelated activities are allocated into the same session.

As problematical as it is, the accurate or inaccurate identification of sessions have great impact on the results and findings of log studies. However, as the literature review shows, there is still need for improved session identification methods. 6. Research design This is a methodological paper that examines the benefits of conducting log analyses be deep log methods.
Deep log analysis, a methodology pioneered by the authors and featured in an earlier article in this journal ( Nicholas, Huntington, Jamali, &amp; Watkinson, 2006b ). Digital information platforms have a facility by which logs are generated that provides an automatic and real-time record of use by anyone who uses them. They represent the digital information footprints of the users and by analysing them information seeking behaviour can be tracked and mapped, in our case sessions conducted. When these fingerprints are enhanced by relating them to searching behaviour and datasets containing user information -we call this deep log analysis (DLA).
DLA works with the raw log data, not the processed, pre-defined and selective data normally provided to pub-lishers and libraries. That way more accurate, detailed, and panoramic pictures of digital information seeking behaviour can be produced. 6.1. Data collection
The raw OhioLINK logs were obtained for the 12 month period January 2005 to April 2006. These were standard logs and detailed the Internet protocol (IP) address, date, time and the page viewed by a user. The following gives an example of the log supplied.
The first field (129.22.7.22) details the user X  X  Internet protocol (IP) number. Users are not required to enter a user name or password to enter OhioLINK. OhioLINK authenticates entry based on the user X  X  specified fixed IP addresses or range of IP addresses. The second field [31/May/2004:00:06:39 -0400] details the date and time of the transaction and how many hours off Greenwich meantime this is. The third field details the item delivered in response to a request from the user:  X  X  X ET /cgi-bin/sciserv.pl?collection=journals&amp;jour-nal=02663538&amp;issue=v61i0006&amp;article=889_tdpogerdp&amp;form=pdf&amp;file=file.pdf. The number 02663538 is the ISSN number of the journal, although the hyphen after the fourth digit is missing. The number v61 i0006, in the logs, specifies the volume and issue number in this case the number relates to volume 61 issue 6. The alpha-numeric sequence 889_tdpogerdp identifies the article. Lastly  X  X  X ile.pdf X  X  tells us the file was sup-plied in a PDF format, in fact almost all article documents were supplied as PDF. The fourth field details the status of the download. The delivery status field records whether the page was delivered without any problems.
The fifth field records the browser details and is the record of the browser that the client is using to attach to the Internet. 6.2. Data analysis Log files were subject to deep log techniques and processed by SPSS. For more details of the methods, see
Nicholas, Huntington, Lievesley, and Wasti (2000) . 7. Results 7.1. Defining a session
A session time out signal is defined as a value defined in seconds or minutes and if a page view time exceeds that value then the session is deemed as having finished. To identify a session time out the page view time first needs to be calculated. Page view time is calculated as the difference between time stamps. Each item delivered by the server to the requesting client is date stamped. Page item time is estimated by the difference between one time stamp and the next. To illustrate all this Table 1 gives the transactional item record of one user with the
OhioLINK service. In the 15 month period studied this Internet protocol (IP) reference number appeared twice, once on 28th September 2005 and again about 4 months later on the 27th February 2006. On both occa-sions an earth science journal was viewed but only one journal was viewed on each occasion, River Research on the first visit and Geomorphology on the second.

On the first visit the user entered the site viewing the issue list and spent 3 s viewing this page before viewing (at the time) the article list for the most current volume of River Research, volume 21 issue 7; they viewed this page for 7 s. Both these pages were viewed for a very short period and possibly suggest that this user was both competent and knowledgeable about the service. The user then went on to view three articles from volume 21 issue 7; the first was viewed for about 2 min (114 s) the second for 20 s. The time view of the last article is classified as not being estimated as the following page viewed by this user comes some four months later.
It should be noted that at least some of the pages that the user viewed have not been recorded by the server and this is because the user made use of cached pages. These are previously viewed pages temporarily stored by the client machine and subsequent views were from this local store. We can see from Table 1 that to have viewed the additional articles the user would have had to have returned to the article list and selected another article option.

On the second occasion (27th February 2006) the user again examined the issue list page, viewed the page for 5 s and then viewed the article list of three Geomorphology issues, volume 74 issue 1.4, volume 73 issue 3.4 and volume 73 issue 1.2. The first was viewed for 40 s, the second for 31 s. The third cannot be estimated as the following time view relates to a different Internet protocol (IP) number and does not relate to the current user.
Further for the user to have viewed additional article lists the user would have had to have returned to the issue list however these views have not been recorded by the server as these were cached on the client X  X  machine.

There are three possible signs that indicate that a session is over once the data has been sorted by IP num-ber, date and time. These are:
A change of IP number: clearly a change of IP number represents the usage and time values of a new user and hence is a strong indicator of a new session.

A date lapse of greater than one day: here if the user comes back at some later date then if the date value difference exceeds one then a new session is said to have started. The value one is chosen to allow for the midnight user. The setting of session by a one day difference assumes that there will be no user who uses the service for a continuous 48 h period.

A time lapse within a 48 h period, here a user might complete one or more sessions within a day. Typically a single time value is selected and if the user exceeds this value looking at any one page then the session is deemed to be over. 7.2. Session delimiting, session length and page view time
There is a strong relationship between page view time and the setting of a cut-off value for delimiting ses-sions. A session termination is generated if the page view time exceeds a predefined cut-off value. This impacts on page time estimates because no page can have a view time in excess of the cut-off value. This assumes that
Web pages are all viewed for about the same amount of time and that a single cut-off point can be applied. If pages are viewed for different length of times then applying a single cut-off point would increase errors. In particular for pages that are viewed below the cut-off point there is an increased risk of a session subtraction error or failure to mark a session as having ended. While for pages of downloads that are read for longer than the cut-off point there is an increase in a session addition error or of breaking up a user X  X  session into two or more sessions.

Fig. 1 breaks down page view time by type of item viewed for menu items including hyperlink lists of jour-nals and issues, the use of the internal search facility, abstracts and article views. Estimates were based on applying a twelve and half minute time out session end and then grouping the page view time values. Articles recorded the longest view time, with just under a quarter (22%) being viewed for three or more minutes and half being viewed for greater than 1 min. Only 18% of users viewed abstracts for longer than a minute and about 8% of users viewed menus for longer than a minute.

Fig. 1 demonstrates that there are considerable variations between viewing times for the various types of pages. However, there may also be substantial variation within page types. With articles in particular the user
A recent unpublished study ( Tenopir et al., 2006 ) found that only just about a quarter (23%) of faculty users and a third of students (35%) fully read an article online. Most faculty staff will print out the online article  X  two thirds (68%) are estimated to do this, while about 10% will read a copy on screen that they have previously saved to disk. About half (54%) of students will print to paper, while 12% will view a previously saved version to screen off line. Tenopir X  X  study did not include articles viewed briefly and rejected as material to be read or saved and only relates to articles fully read. It is apparent though, from Fig. 1 that some users were viewing articles for very little time. About 14% viewed an article for 15 s or under and 28% viewed an article for less than half a minute. Note if we factor into Tenopir X  X  figures those users who briefly viewed an article and decided not to read it we might expect the percentage of those users actually reading an article on screen to make up between just 10 X 15% of article usage.

The above Figure was computed by setting a timeout figure to twelve and half minutes. That is if there has been no request for additional items sent from the client to the server within twelve and half minutes the ses-sion was classified as being over. The setting of a time out signal will impact both on estimated page view time and the classification of the number of sessions. As page view times with a higher value than the cut-off point are classified as a session end then these values are not included in page view time metrics; hence the metric of page view time is partially dependent on the setting of the cut-off point. Further, the cut-off point will impact on the number of sessions count. A session is terminated if the page view time exceeds a predefined cut-off point. However, as there are fewer pages at increasingly higher values of page view time it is reasonable to suppose that there will be fewer session terminations as the cut-off page view time increases. As the time out signal increases the estimated article view time increases and the estimated number of sessions fall, as the above table illustrates. Table 2 lists the view time for all items, the article view time and the number of sessions for six time out signals from seven and half minutes to thirty minutes. The last column indicates the metrics where no time out signal is specified.

It should be noted that the distribution of page view time is very skewed. This can be observed by the very high value of the arithmetic mean compared to the median where no time out signal is applied (the last col-umn). For all items viewed the mean is twenty times larger than the median and for article view time it is about 11 times higher and we would expect the two values to be quite similar if the data set was not skewed. Because of the skewed nature of the distribution the arithmetic mean will be biased so in addition robust estimates, the median and Huber X  X  M-estimate, are also included. Fig. 2 charts the time out signal against Huber X  X  M-estimator of the mean view time for articles. The figure shows that as the time out signal increases so does the estimate of page view time but this increases at a decreasing rate. From the lowest to highest time out signals, from seven and half minutes to 30 minutes, page article item view time increased from about 67 s to 85 s an increase of about 18 s, an increase of about 26%. In terms of all items this increase was 16%.
Fig. 3 charts the number of sessions against a range of time out signals. As the time out signal increases the estimated number of sessions decrease but at a declining rate. From the lowest to highest time out signals, from seven and half minutes to 30 minutes, the number of sessions decreased from 365,682 s to 276,618 s a decrease of 89,064 sessions or a fall of about 24%. 7.3. Session limiter and proxy servers
If the time out signal is set to too high a value there is a chance that a following user will take over the previous user X  X  session. This could be repeated a number of times with one user taking over a previous session who in turn had taken over the session before and so on resulting in a chain of piggy backed sessions. This can occur with any shared computer or where a network of computers shares the same Internet protocol (IP) num-ber. Such a situation occurs in the case of proxy server networks. A proxy connection describes a network of computers that all link to the Internet on the same Internet protocol (IP) number. The importance of proxy connections is that many users will be connected but will appear in the transactional log file as a single user.
For example many library networks access the Internet via a proxy from a single user. Further in a library environment computers will be shared and a number of users will have used the same terminal through out the day. In such a situation the likelihood of a piggy backed session X  X  increases. Spink et al. (2006) in their research on search engine logs, used a query cut-off to deal with a similar problem. All sessions with 100 or less queries were separated into an individual transaction log. The 100 query cut-off was almost 50 times greater than the reported mean search session for human Web searchers, assuring that they were not excluding any human searches. They maintained that although this cut-off probably intro-duced some queries by Web agents, they were satisfied that they had retrieved a subset of the transaction log that contained queries submitted primarily by human searchers in a non-common user terminal, yet broad enough not to introduce bias by too low a cut-off threshold.

Table 3 records the estimated number of sessions between networks labelled as proxy and networks not identified as proxy computers. Network administrators may identify proxy machines by including the word proxy in the connecting computers X  address. 6 In the table, proxy identified networks made up about 10% of all other identified networks and the percentage is thought to be small compared to the expected number of proxy servers.
As can be seen from the table the percentage of sessions for proxy servers is, for every cut-off point, less than that for servers not identified as proxy. We expect this as proxy servers will have a higher incidence of piggy backed sessions with users jumping on the back of the last user session. It is also apparent from the table that the fall in the number of session from the seven and half minute cut-off to the 30 minute cut-off is more severe for proxy servers compared to accesses not identified as being proxy. The number of proxy sessions more than halved (55%) from 21,881 to 9855 while for non-identified proxy connections sessions declined by about a third (33%) from 232,022 to 156,171. Proxy servers will have an impact in that the inci-dence of users taking over the previous users, session as a result of a too short a cut-off signal is higher com-pared to computers not identified as proxy servers. The existence of proxy servers results in a deflated count of sessions. 7.4. Multiple session delimiters
To date researchers have discussed the issues of a time out signal to a single distribution  X  that of page view time. However this distribution is in fact an aggregate and that what is really being observed is a number of view time distributions. For example the page item view distribution of those viewing an abstract will be dif-ferent to the page view time distribution of those viewing an article. Further the time view distribution of those reading a complete article online will be very different to the distribution of those viewing an article item and then printing that article out or those that view an article and then decide not to proceed with reading it in any form. Table 4 gives the median and mean metrics for various page items.

There is substantial variation in item view time. Menus on average (median) take about 7 s to view while articles, on average, take about a minute and half or about 15 times as long. Abstracts take about 20 s to view.
Clearly taking a single time out signal is inappropriate. Setting it according to articles would increase the like-lihood of piggyback sessions occurring for those users who viewed a list or abstract and then left. However setting the timeout signal according to a menu view would risk a session addition error or of breaking up a user X  X  session into two or more sessions. The solution is to set a different timeout signal for each type of item.
Articles present particular problems with the setting of a timeout signal. The problem with article views is that the groups making these views are diverse and have different sets of behaviour patterns. Some users are checking the material and leaving almost immediately, some take a little longer in reading and this group may in addition be saving or printing the content and the last group are reading an article item on screen. A ques-tionnaire study conducted by Tenopir et al. (2006) on online reading found that faculty members took about quarter (15 min median) of an hour to read an article completely on line, that is half the respondents took longer than this and the maximum recorded reading time value was 2 h and the shortest was 5 min. Students took slightly longer, about 20 min (median) with the longest taking about 2 h and 15 min.

It was decided to examine those articles with an online reading time falling within reading reference time points and argue that those falling within these time points were likely to have been read online. Two time points were considered 5 min and 2 h and a smaller range of seven and half minutes to one and half hours.
The smaller time span was selected as we would expect fewer read online articles to have either a value lower or higher in the range with most articles being read having a median value (see Table 5 ).

In terms of online reading falling between 5 min and 2 h the median read value of these articles would be just under 13 min (767 s) and this falls below the expected median of between 15 and 20 min as estimated by self-report data ( Tenopir et al., 2006 ). Taking the slightly reduced period, seven and half minutes to one and half hours, the estimated average (median) reading time is about 17 min (1019 s) and falls in the middle of the faculty and student median as estimated by Tenopir et al. (2006) . However this reduces the percentage of arti-cles being read online from 17% to 12%, quite a difference. In part this is the result of the setting of the lower boundary. At the point of 5 min this may well include users who are not reading the whole document perhaps these users are cherry picking, reading just one or two sections or have taken a long time in deciding to print the article out.

It was decided to set the article timeout signal at the 90% percentile of those reading, an article for between 7.5 min to one and half hours or 56 min (3356 s). We cannot tell from looking at the logs if an article is being read or printed. There will be instances where a user would have say printed an article off and then terminated their session. We would not be aware of the termination and the recorded article time would be high. In this case we would misclassify this article as having been read and the session would have been deemed terminated after a 56 min lapse. However this error is thought to be a lesser error compared to setting the timeout signal low. This would have been the case by taking the 90% percentile, a value of about 22 min (1321 s), of all article view time. Taking this value would have increased the risk of imposing an inappropriate session end of those who read an article on line.

Table 6 gives the 90% and 95% percentile values for menus, lists, search screens and abstracts. The 90% quartile that excludes 10% of the cases would be a more severe cut-off compared to the 95% quartile.
It would be better to apply the more severe cut-off, of 90%, in the case of a proxy server as here there is an increased likelihood of a session being taken over, while the less severe 95% cut-off can be applied in other cases. However there is no easy way of identifying a proxy server. While there are instances of system admin-istrators labelling a proxy server with the word proxy in the sub network address this is not universal. In fact we would expect few proxy sub networks to be labelled in this way. For this analysis it was decided to split the dataset into two groups those IP numbers that viewed less than 500 items in the period and those that viewed over 500. It is argued that a larger number of views associated with an IP number may be indicative of a proxy server and as such should attract a cautious approach as to the time out setting. Applying a 95% percentile timeout signal for IP numbers that viewed less than 500 and a 90% quartile for higher use IP numbers and a cut-off point of 3356 s for articles resulted in the identification of 339,041 sessions, about 15.1% of usage. 8. Results summary
The main results of this paper are: 1. That the arbitrary set time out signals impact on view time metrics and the estimated number of session. In particular, as the period of inactivity marking a session delimiter increases the article page view time increases and the estimated number of sessions decreases. The study identified two errors: a session addition error causing the breaking up a user X  X  session in to two or more sessions and session subtraction error that arises from accepting a session as continuing when in fact it has ended. Because users view pages for dif-ferent lengths of time a single inactive time out delimiter cannot minimise both errors. If the single time out delimiter is set for users who terminate a session on a page viewed for a short time then user terminations on a page viewed for a long time will be subject to a session addition error. If, alternatively, the single time out delimiter is set for sessions terminated on a page viewed for a long time then there is a risk of a session subtraction error for users terminating on pages viewed for a short time period. 2. It has identified the correct statistic for estimating the delimiter. The time out signal for a session delimiter is in fact a page view time. Web log page view time statistics are skewed. The arithmetic mean in such cases generates a biased result and the correct metric to use is the median or robust estimates such as the 5% trimmed mean or Huber X  X  M-estimator may be used. 3. A robust method for defining a session delimiter has been established. This paper proposes that the time out signal is set according to the page being viewed at point of session termination and at the 95% percentile of page view time. The percentile levels are the correct metric to use in the case of skewed data. 4. The exact percentile can be adjusted and the proposed model can be adapted to take into account addi-tional factor such as information on actual read time values of a particular item and the impact of proxy servers.

Users do not use the Web in predicable ways. In particular, users are employing multiple windows and hence are engaging in multiple sessions and this is likely to have an impact on estimates of page view times and session terminations. Particularly if the user decides to read the content of one browser window this is likely to generate a session termination in the other window. However, generally, the impact of the user util-ising multiple browser windows would be to increase both average view time values and percentile values.
Hence, although there will be an impact of users using multiple browser windows, the effect will not be so great as the metrics will tend to reflect these changes. 9. Conclusion
Metrics derived from a user X  X  session provide a significant insight into online behaviour, the most important being the length of a session and number of views in a session. However, the estimation of a session is fraught with difficulty in that there is no way of telling from a transactional log file when a user has terminated their session. The current procedures for identifying a session end are poor and inaccurate. The authors have dem-onstrated a method of identifying session ends based on the type of page being viewed and one which also (partially) takes account of proxy servers. Traditionally a single timeout signal has been applied and a session deemed to have ended if the page view time exceeded this value. The main disadvantage of a single cut-off point is that it assumes all items are viewed for roughly the same amount of time. However, our virtual scholar research programme has confirmed time and time again that the duration that pages are viewed for, are not the same. Thus, an article may have been read online for up to 2 h, while a menu page might be read in less than 10 s. By setting a single time out signal you risk setting too high a value for items being viewed for a relative short period and too low a value for items attracting a longer view time. The first increases the risk of a session being taken over by another user while the second increases the likelihood of applying a session termination signal when in fact the user session is still active. The solution proposed by the authors is to set the timeout signal according to the page being viewed. The actual timeout signals can be set with reference to per-centile values.

Proxy servers or Internet access points shared by a number of users present particular problems in that in these cases there is an increased risk of a user taking over a session of a previous user. Traditional methods of applying a cut-off point do not take into account the possible presence of a proxy server. In part this is a result of the difficulty associated with identifying this type of connection. However proxy servers will be single IP addresses associated with a relatively large volume of use. The authors in this paper took a usage figure of 500 as the deliminator and determined that those IPs associated with less than 500 views over a 14 month per-iod were probably not proxy computers while those IPs associated with a higher usage were more likely to be proxy type connections. Based on this split a more severe cut-off was applied to the possible proxy connections and a less severe cut-off to those IP numbers recording less than 500 item views.

The setting of a session timeout can never be perfect. The authors argue that procedures should be adopted that minimises the problems associated with setting a session time out signal and leads to much improved met-rics that will benefit the whole web community.
