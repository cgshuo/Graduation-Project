 It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the ACM Fourth International Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO'10), in conjunction with the 19th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM'10). The rapid development of bioinformatics techniques is tigh tly coupled with development within several fields in computer science, including data mining, information retrieval, and da tabase manageme nt systems, among others. A fundamental topic of research within bioinformatics is how to make effective use of the tremendous amount of biological and biomed ical data to improve the understanding of biological systems. Such data include, but are not limited to, gene and protei n sequences, gene expression profiles from microarray experi ments, protein structure predictions resulting from high-throughput computational methods, protein-protein inter actions from proteomic studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms profiles from SNP arrays, and much bibliographic information from electronic medical journals. The need to automatically and effectively extract, understand, integrate, and make use of information embedded in such heterogeneous unstructured da ta drives the current research in bioinformatics.This year X  X  workshop continues the tradition of bringing together researchers that work in the field of data mining, text mining, and comput ational biology and providing a forum to present and discuss current research topics at the interface of the related fields. The mission of DTMBIO is to promote a tighter connection between literature search and data analysis within biomedical inform atics. In particular, this year we focus on the following two themes: (1) Data and text mining for biomedical applications, and the identification of relevant background knowledge in database annotations or in text documents, such as scientific publications.. And (2) Knowledge discovery through the integration of heterogeneous biomedical data collected from electronic bulletin boards, scientific publications, and any type of expe riments. Furthermore, we put more focus this year on the integration of bioinformatics and medical informatics toward translational research. The papers accepted for presentation and publication in this volume cover a variety of topi cs, including bio-text mining, translational bioinformatics, syst ems bioinformatics, bio-ontology management, sequence analysis fo r massively parallel sequencing, protein-protein interactions, biom edical data classification, and biomedical information retrieval. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable and up-to-date reference about the application of data-and text-min ing techniques within biomedical informatics. Putting together DTMBIO X 10 was a team effort. First of all, we thank all the authors as well as our invited speaker, Dr. Ming Li from the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada, for providing the contents for the workshop. We would like to also express our gratitude to the program committee and external reviewers, who worked very hard to review all the papers and provided valuable suggestions for their improvements. Many thanks also go to Dr. Manabu Torii, our Publicity Chair, and to Mr. Sejoon Lee, our Web Mana ger, for maintaining the DTMBIO X 10 web site and for their efforts in advertising the symposium. We hope that you will find DTMBIO X 10 program useful, and that the conference will offer ample opportunity to interact with researchers and practitioners who work at the interface of data mining, text mining, and bi omedical informatics.
