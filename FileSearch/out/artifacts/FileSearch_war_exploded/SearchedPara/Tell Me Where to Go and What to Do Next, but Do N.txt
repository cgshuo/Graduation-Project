 In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices X  abilities, users X  privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses X  trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hi dden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user X  X  own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the  X  X ianPing.com X  POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility. H.3.4 [ Systems and Software ]: World Wide Web (WWW). LBS; Recommendation; Hi dden Markov Model It would be really embarrassing if we totally have no idea of where to go and what to do next when hanging out with best friends. Nowadays location-base d recommender system may be helpful in this situation because of its ability in mining users X  life patterns (e.g. behaviors and preferences) from the history trajectories [1]. With the help of additional information like places of interest (POI) or ev en user comments, location-based recommenders can recommend possible activities as well as interesting locations. The traditional approaches for recommending locations try to choose statistically popular neighbor ing locations that extracted from all the users X  trajectories [2]. Such approaches do make sense for recommending locations that are general-purpose (touring sequences are suitable for most of the common tourists) and coarse-grained with apparent boundary (tourist attractions like the Forbidden City). As users X  life patterns are not taken into consideration in these approaches, personalized recommending results are still not available. Obviously, involving the user X  X  actively specified activ ities for certain loca tions (e.g. shopping at the shopping mall, eating in the restaurant, or seeing a movie in the cinema) or alternatively employing places of interests (POI) data may improve the performance of recommendations. In this way, the user X  X  life patterns could be learnt and used for future locations and activities recommendation. However, people are always lazy or unwilling to share their actual activities by writing comments though equipping GPS devices e.g. smart phones are very common. Moreover, there are other more cases make user involved labeling of activities not available like restrictions on mobile devices X  abilities, users X  privacies, or business secret. Therefore, a new question emerges that is it possible to perform location and activity recommendations only depending on trajectories and PO I data? In this demonstration (http://www.neunavy.com:8088), we try to positively answer the question by proposing an appro ach that recommends locations and activities with GPS trajectories and places of interest when no user comments are available. Our system consists of four stages. 1) Firstly, as the basis of the location-based recommendation, stay points are extracted offline according to uses X  trajectories. After the stage of Stay Point Extraction, the output is a sequence of stay points. 2) Then, we label the stay points with the semantics from a POI category dataset, Dianping.com which is the most famous Yelp like web site in China containing more than 6 million of local businesses covering 10 categories (food, en tertainment, shopping, beauty, wedding, family, sports, hotel, auto motive, and local services). According to the API of DianPing.com, a query to the possible activities given the GPS coordinates of a stay point will return a list of candidates. We evaluate the most likely top-k activities by the value of each label. In this way, after Location-Semantics Information Extraction, each stay point may have k activities. Therefore, the output is changed to a sequence of stay points with possible activities. 3) Next, we exploit HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to find a sequence of activities that most likely explain the observed sequence of stay points. He re, we regard a stay point as an observation and an activity as a hidden state. As we know, HMM is a double stochastic process, which can be represented as  X  = ( N , M ,  X  , A , B ). To create the HMM, we need to prepare the basic parameters such as the number M of observations, the number N of the hidden states, the transfer matrix of the hidden states A , the confuse matrix between of hidden states and observations B , and the initial hidden state vector  X  . Then we can train the HMM for each user with all of her/his semantic sequences offline. 4) Finally, after the data modeling and the parameters learning, a HMM base d recommender is available for recommending locations and activities according to each user X  X  preferences. Two types of recommendations can be performed in terms of the differences of the results. They are History Based Recommendation and Similarity Based Recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user X  X  own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. Figure 1 shows the user interface of our demo Web application. The left side of the user interface consists of three parts, 1) User Selection, in which the user can browse their own history trajectories by selecting different date. After the selection, the right side of the user interface will show all the trajectories of the date with different colors on the map; 2) Current Stay Point, shows the GPS coordinates of the stay point selected on the map by which our system can recommend the next possible stay points; 3) Recommended Results, gives the recommendation stay points based on the current stay point or any user mouse selection on the map. A map is displayed on the right side of the user interface on which several parts of trajectories in one day are represented as consecutive curved lines in different colors. The red and purple balloons stand for the current stay point and the recommended stay points respectively. The possible activities associated with a specific recommended stay poin t and corresponding probabilities are listed in a popup menu near the stay point. In Section 2.2 and 2.3, we exemplify the two types of recommendations provided in our sy stem, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. According to our extensive analysis on the GPS trajectory data, the POI data, and common user beha viors, we got an interesting finding that usually the history based recommendation is effective on workdays while the simila rity based recommendation is meaningful on weekends. The r eason is that our behavior on workdays is quite regular while we would like to try different activities during weekends. For example, as shown in Figur e 2, at the beginning of the trajectory the user (id 0 of GeoLife, and date 2009-05-15) might in his dormitory which is a history stay point in our system marked with red ball in Figure 2. Based on the current stay point and the GPS signal of user X  X  curr ent movement, our system try to guess what he has done in current stay point (in this example is break) and infer what he will do next. Taking into account that it was workday afternoon and his histor y trajectories, as a result, our system recommended the user to go to swimming pool for swimming. After a period of swimming, the user might get out of the swimming pool, because of the prior stay point is in the dormitory, and according to the same situation of the history trajectories, our system guess the would go to her/his laboratory for work. Another example is the same user X  X  trajectory on weekends (2008-10-23), which is shown in Figure 3. At the beginning of the trajectory the user was in the Concert Hall, and maybe accompanied with the boyfriend or girlfriend. We believe that during the weekend, the university X  X  Concert Hall must be welcomed. After enjoying some music, the user left the hall. Taking into account that the day was weekend and maybe some friends were together with the user, it was quite different from the workdays. So trying to recommend based on hi s history trajectories may not work well. Therefore, our system tried to recommend based on the same situation of other users in the system having similar history activities and the GPS si gnal of the user X  X  movement. Finally, our system inferred that the user might tour the famous sight spot near the universit y, i.e. the Summer Palace.
