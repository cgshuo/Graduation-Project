 The goal of this research project is to understand the relationship between spatial-technological feat ures of interactive museum exhibits, and youth visitors X  meaning making experiences and interactions. Through collaboration with the National Gallery of Norway, I led the design and installation of an interactive project room connected to the artist E dvard Munch. A sociocultural perspective on meaning maki ng frames both the design and research of this project room. Th e study explores the interactions of small groups of teenaged museum visitors as they engage with the interactive stations in this project room and across their entire visit. This short paper introduces the research project, describes the data collection and analysis methods, and concludes with the current status and future directions of the project. K.3.1 [ Computer uses in Education ]: Collaborative learning informal learning, museum, collaboration, multitouch table, interactive exhibits, digital media, space Museums have, in recent years, become a setting for innovative digital media that are embedded in contexts of public space and learning. Exhibits and activities in these museums have reflected a shift in conceptions of digital media interactions from that of a solitary user in front of a computer screen to include a broad range of interactions that incorporate mobility, gesture, and collaboration. Accordingly, the relationship between these media and the physical spaces in which they are embedded becomes much more significant. In contexts of learning, this shift becomes especially relevant because of new possibilities for social interaction and engagement with content. The overarching research questions guiding this project include: The methods for this research, as well as the entire project design, are grounded in a sociocultural perspective on meaning making. Accordingly, an emphasis on talk and social interaction as well as mediating tools and resources fra me this research (Wertsch, 1998). This research project has also been developed and framed as a  X  X esign experiment X  (Brown 1992, Krange &amp; Ludvigsen 2009), whereby the goal is to design an educational activity, technology, or setting and then simultaneously research aspects of this innovation in situ. Design experime nts lend themselves quite well to exploring the complexities of such a museum context and allow for a fluid relationship between the design features and research goals (Hall &amp; Bannon, 2005). I recruited teenaged visitors to visit the museum in small groups of 2-4 in an out of school context. In addition, I collected data on the general public that happened to visit this project room on their own. Drawing on previous res earch on investigating museum visitor experiences and interactions (vom Lehn et al, 2001; Gjedde &amp; Ingemann 2008), I have incorporated a variety of data collection methods. These include: video and audio recordings of the space, as well as  X  X alk-videos X  (Gjedde &amp; Ingemann 2008) captured through camera glasses worn by visitors. I supplemented video and audio data with: data logs from the interactive stations, interviews, and field notes. The video recordings will be analyzed using methods from interaction analysis (Derry, et al., 2010; Hall, 2000; Jordan &amp; Henderson, 1995). To date, I have collected, reviewed, and broadly sorted video data of target visitors X  trips to the in teractive stations in the project room and the rest of the museum. Next, interactions in front of thes e individual stations will first be interpreted before situating them in the contexts of the broader museum visits. The goal is to contribute to a better understanding of learning in the settings of technology supported museum
