 There is a growing number of service providers that a con-sumer can interact with over the web to learn their service terms. The service terms, such as price and time to com-pletion of the service, depend on the consumer X  X  particu-lar specifications. For instance, a printing services provider would need from its customers specifications such as the size of paper, type of ink, proofing and perforation. In a few sec-tors, there exist marketplace sites that provide consumers with specifications forms, which the consumer can fill out to learn the service terms of multiple service providers. Unfor-tunately, there are only a few such marketplace sites, and they cover a few sectors.

At HP Labs, we are working towards building a universal marketplace site, i.e., a marketplace site that covers thou-sands of sectors and hundreds of providers per sector. One issue in this domain is the automated discovery/retrieval of the specifications for each sector. We address it through ex-tracting and analyzing content from the websites of the ser-vice providers listed in business directories. The challenge is that each service provider is often listed under multiple ser-vice categories in a business directory, making it infeasible to utilize standard supervised learning techniques. We ad-dress this challenge through employing a multilabel statisti-cal clustering approach within an expectation-maximization framework. We implement our solution to retrieve speci-fications for 3000 sectors, representing more than 300,000 service providers. We discuss our results within the context of the services needed to design a marketing campaign for a small business.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Clustering Algorithms, design, experimentation Statistical classification, multi-label clustering, web forms, e-commerce
There is a growing number of service providers, in sectors such as printing, marketing, IT and finance, with which a consumer can interact over the web to learn their service terms (i.e., information such as the price and time to deliv-ery of their services). The service provider typically presents the consumer with a web form that includes entries on the specifications for the service. For instance, a printing ser-vices form would include entries on the size and type of paper, quantity to be printed, color and type of ink, folding, drills, proofing and perforation. The customer makes her specifications by filling out the form, and, in response, the service provider e-mails the consumer their service terms.
Ideally, the consumer should interact with most (if not all) of the service providers that can potentially meet her service need, so that she can make an informed decision as to which service provider offers the best terms for her specifications. However, interacting with multiple providers is a very time consuming task as the consumer needs to fill out a separate web form for each service provider. Further, many service providers include only partially complete forms on their websites with the expectation that they are going to follow up with the consumer by phone.

There are a few  X  X arketplace X  sites, such as the printin-dustry.com of the printing services sector, that provide the consumer with the ability to compare multiple service providers. The marketplace site presents the consumer with a specifica-tions form. The consumer makes her specifications by filling out the form, and submits the form to the marketplace site. The marketplace site e-mails the filled-out form to multi-ple service providers, each of which, in response, e-mails the consumer their service terms. Unfortunately, there are only a few such marketplace sites, and each such site is limited to only one or a few sectors.

At HP Labs, we are working towards building a  X  X niversal X  marketplace site, i.e., a marketplace site that covers thou-sands of sectors and hundreds of providers per sector. The consumer navigates through the different sector names and service providers in the site. She then selects one of the sec-tors, and is presented with the specifications form for that sector.

We obtain the sector names (e.g., printing, telemarketing, call centers, etc.) and the lists of service providers (and their contact e-mails) for each sector from a business directory such as Yellowpages.com. The challenge is to automatically retrieve a specifications form for each sector. The automa-tion is necessary as the number of sectors is large (e.g., over 10,000 sectors in Yellowpages.com) and the specifications for some sectors may evolve over time, making it is infeasible to attempt generating forms manually.

To address this challenge, we crawl the websites of the service providers listed in the business directory, and retrieve the service providers X  web forms (the forms are distinguished from non-form content based on HTML tags). We select a specifications form for each sector from among the retrieved web forms. We note that the selection (of a specifications form) is a challenging task since our observations indicate that only a few of the retrieved web forms in each sector cover most (or all) of the service specifications.
In a business directory, each service provider is typically listed under multiple sectors. Thus, the mapping from ser-vice providers to sectors is many-to-many instead of many-to-one. Further, a service provider X  X  website may include multiple forms, each for a different sector. For instance, the website of a provider of telemarketing services typically has two forms, one for the outbound telemarketing sector and the other for the inbound telemarketing sector.

The many-to-many mapping between service providers and sectors and the one-to-many mapping between service providers and web forms make it impractical to use standard supervised learning techniques, where each training sample (a web form) is labeled with a single label (a sector). In our setting, each web form is labeled with multiple sectors (i.e., the multiple sectors under which the service provider is listed in the business directory); we do not know which of these multiple labels is the true label of the form. Further, standard supervised learning techniques cannot be employed to address the issue that if a service provider X  X  website has multiple forms, the forms are likely to represent different sectors (e.g., one for inbound and the other for outbound telemarketing for the telemarketing services provider).
We devise a constrained, multi-label statistical learning algorithm to address the two issues of multiple labels and of multiple forms from a single serv ice provider. In particular, we cluster the web forms so as to maximize the probability of a service provider X  X  form being a member of a cluster that is labeled with one of the sectors under which the service provider is listed in the business directory, and to minimize the probability that two forms from the same provider are mapped to the same cluster. Following the clustering, the most representative form in each cluster is selected as the specifications form for that cluster.

We note that previous work focused on related problems such as the retrieval, classification and generation of web forms [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 11, 2]. However, they differ from our work in that they do not focus on the problem of providing specifications forms to consumers within a marketplace set-ting. Further, the previous work focus on semi-automated techniques, i.e., techniques that require either the labeling of the attributes/concepts in the forms or the labeling of the categories of the forms.

We apply our approach to discover specifications forms for services needed to run a marketing campaign for a small business. Wefocusonservicessuchasprinting,telemar-keting, graphic web design, direct mailing and outdoor sign advertisement as part of the marketing campaign. Our sim-ulations indicate that the specifications forms discovered by our approach capture the essential service specifications more accurately than alternative, manual or automated ap-proaches to the same problem.
We design an automated tool, which provides the con-sumer with a specifications form for any sector in a business directory. In section 2.1, we describe the repository of web forms, i.e., the set of all forms that we retrieve from service providers X  websites. We retrieve the forms by crawling the service providers X  websites, and distinguish the forms from non-form content using HTML tags. In sections 2.2 and 2.3, we employ a statistical approach that groups the forms in the repository into clusters and selects a specifications form for each cluster (and hence, for each sector).
For each service provider listed in a business directory (such as Yellowpages.com), we crawl the website of the ser-vice provider and retrieve its web forms. A form is distin-guished automatically from non-form content through the HTML tags (in particular, the  X  X orm X  tag) used in the forms. A web form typically contains the specifications that the service provider asks for from its customers. For instance, the forms retrieved from printin g-related service providers might include specifications such as color, ink type, ink size, drilling, perforation and proofing.

Each service provider in the business directory is listed under one or more sectors. While some service providers are listed under only one sector, most are listed under multiple sectors as they serve more than one sector. For instance, it is not uncommon for a service provider listed under printing to be also listed under advertising.

The repository consists of N service providers, where ser-vice providers are indexed by i ,1  X  i  X  N .The j th form of the i th service provider is denoted by x i,j , and its cluster is denoted by s i,j .

We let W be the total number of distinct words used in all forms in the repository (except for the stopwords such as  X  X nd X ,  X  X f X , etc.). The form x i,j is a W -length binary (0 or 1) vector, indicating which of the W words appear on the form.

We index the clusters by m ,1  X  m  X  M ,where M is the number of sectors in the business directory. Thus, s i,j  X  X  1 , 2 , ..., M } . We denote, by Z i ,thesetofsectors under which the i th service provider is listed in the busi-ness directory. Thus, Z i is a set, whose elements are in { 1 , 2 , ..., M } .

We label each cluster m with a sector in the business di-rectory. There is a one-to-one mapping between the sectors and the clusters. Thus, throughout the discussion, we are going to use the terms  X  X ector X  and  X  X luster X  interchangeably.
We employ a statistical clustering algorithm that deter-mines the amount of membership of each form x i,j in each cluster m , through maximizing a log-likelihood function L In particular, we have two goals: ii. The probability that s i,j = s i,l should be small (unless
The goal (i) is to make sure that the forms of the service provider i have most of their memberships in the set Z i , i.e., in the clusters (or sectors) under which the service provider is listed in the business directory. The goal (ii), on the other hand, is to enforce that two forms from the same service provider do not have large memberships in the same cluster (or sector).

We model the statistical relation between the form x i,j and the cluster m through a distribution, parameterized by  X  ,as where x w i,j ,1  X  w  X  W ,isthe w th element of x i,j ,and 1  X  w  X  W ,isthe w th element of the parameter  X  m . In (1), we normalize x i,j such that normalization would allow for the use of generalized iterative scaling in estimating the parameter  X  m .

Towards achieving the goals (i) and (ii), we construct the log-likelihood function, L (  X  ), as L (  X  )= where  X  p is the  X  X -priori X  probability of the form x i,j member of cluster m .

Maximizing the log-likelihood given in (2) enforces the goal (i) since (2) takes into account the probability, p ( m | x i,j , X  m ), only if the cluster m is in set Z i ,thesetof sectors under which the service provider i is listed. The goal (ii) is enforced through  X  p as discussed in section 2.3. Before attempting to maximize (2), we re-express it as where L j (  X  )= i.e., we re-express the L in (2) such that it is sum of the components, L j ,whereeach L j represents the log-likelihood associated with the j th form of each service provider.
The log-likelihood, given in (2), can be maximized within the EM framework [7, 13] by observing that provides an upper bound on L j . Hence, setting, for a given j and for each i ,  X  p ( maximizes L j . The step in (6) corresponds to the E-step in an EM framework. Once (6) is performed for each j ,the M-step can be achieved through the generalized iterative scaling, i.e., by setting  X  where  X  w m,r refers to the w th element of  X  m at iteration
In section 2.2, L (  X  ) is maximized through an EM frame-work, taking into account the fact that multiple labels (sec-tors) are included for each service provider in the business directory. However, this does not address the issue that a service provider X  X  website may include multiple forms, each for a different sector. In this section, we make use of the  X  term in (2) to address this issue.

We employ an iterative approac h, where, at each iteration t , we maximize L (  X  ) through (6) and (7), with  X  p where t = t  X   X  ,and  X  &gt; 0 is pre-defined. In (8),  X  refers to the  X  p at iteration t ,and  X  m,t  X  1 refers to the iteration t  X  1. We use t to denote the iterations, which is not to be confused with the r used to denote the iterations of the generalized iterative scaling of section 2.2. In (8), the goal (ii) of section 2.2 is enforced as the term encourages the j th form of the i th provider to have a low amount of membership in a cluster if other forms of the i th provider have high amounts of memberships in that cluster.
 Higher values of t in (8) enforce the term more. However, starting with a very high value of t can cause (2) to converge to highly sub-optimal solutions. Thus, we employ an iterative approach, starting with low values of t , and increasing t gradually at each iteration.
This is analogous to simulated annealing [9], where, at iteration t , the current state,  X  t ,isreplacedbyanearby state,  X  ,if i.e., if the difference between the energy, E (  X  )of  X  ,andthe energy, E (  X  t )of  X  t , is less than some pre-defined threshold R . The threshold is gradually decreased at every iteration, i.e., R t +1 &lt;R t , so that, the algorithm ultimately converges to a low energy state. The high tolerance for uphill energy moves in earlier iterations (i.e., relatively high thresholds at early iterations) saves the method from being stuck at local minima.
 In our formulation, the  X  p assumes the role of the threshold R ,  X  t is the EM solution at each iteration t ,and E (  X  t be viewed as the value of (2) at iteration t .
In particular, in our case, during the initial iteration (i.e., t = 0) of the training algorithm, we compute  X  p with 0 =0, and maximize L (  X  ) through the E-step of (6) followed by the M-step of (7). At iteration t = 1, we compute  X  p with 1 and maximize L (  X  ) through (6) and (7). At each subsequent iteration t , we compute  X  p with t = t  X   X  , followed by the maximizations of (6) and (7). The algorithm stops after a pre-defined number of iterations.

Following the clustering, for each cluster, we form a W -length binary (0 or 1) vector such that each element of the vector represents one of the W words in the repository. We assign a value of 1 to an element if at least 25 percent of the forms in the cluster contain the corresponding word. We then select the form that is closest in Euclidean distance to the binary vector of the cluster as the specifications form for the cluster (and hence, for the sector).
The retrieval, classification and generation of web-based forms using statistical techniques have been explored in [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 11, 2]. The approach taken in form retrieval has been the use of focused web crawlers [1, 5, 4, 8]. A focused web crawler does not retrieve links from every visited page; instead, it estimates the probability of the visited page being relevant to the focus topic, and retrieves the links only if the probability is sufficiently high. A supervised page classifier is often used to estimate the probability that a page is relevant to the focus topic. A special case of focused web crawlers is the form-focused web crawler, which is designed to focus on and retrieve web forms [1]. The form-focused web crawler consists of a form classifier in addition to the page classifier. The form classifier is used to distinguish forms from non-forms based on form tags. It has been shown, however, that the accuracy of focused crawlers (even the form-focused crawler) is low in terms of retrieving relevant forms. For instance, in an experiment conducted for database domains, it has been shown that the accuracy of the form-focused crawler is around 16 percent [1, 5, 4, 8].

The statistical classification of web forms based on form content and structure has been considered in [6, 12, 11, 2]. In [6, 2], web forms are classified into two classes, searchable forms and non-searchable forms, using statistical classifica-tion based on the structure of the forms. In [11, 12, 2], web forms are classified based on their textual content using statistical clustering methods. In [11, 12], the techniques re-quire manual pre-processing: labeling form attributes. Thus, the techniques discussed in [11] and [12] are semi-automated and not scalable. While the approach in [2] does not re-quire a manual labeling of form attributes, it does require the manual labeling of forms to specify the categories or domains that they belong.

Statistical techniques for generating forms have been ex-plored in [12] in the context of web-based services. In [12], a web-form has been modeled as a four-level hierarchy: service categories (e.g., books, education, travel), domains (e.g., search a book, find a school, query an airport), data types (e.g., book title, school type, destination airport), and terms (e.g., title, liberal arts, city). A statistical model has been generated for each form domain based on the terms used in the forms of that domain. This model can then be used to generate the specifications form for the domain. However, the approach is only semi-automated since the domains and data types need to be extracted and labeled manually. Fur-ther, it does not address the issue of the retrieval of the relevant forms.

Multilabel statistical learning has been explored in the context of text and scene classification [10, 14, 16, 17, 3], where the text or scene is assumed to be composed of multi-ple classes. Our setting is different in that each sample (web form) is assumed to arise from one class; however, it is la-beled with multiple classes in the training set. The setting, where each sample has a single, true label, has been focused in [13]; however, [13] does not treat the case, where some training samples need to be constrained to be assigned to different clusters (i.e., multiple forms from the same provider being assigned to different sectors).
The repository is constructed using 3000 sectors and 400 service providers per sector, obtained from the business di-rectory Yellowpages.com. A broad range of industries are represented, including advertising, marketing, consulting, IT, and human resources. Some of the sectors that are in-cluded are business consulting, catering, computer services, direct marketing, document imaging, enterprise cleaning, event management, graphic web design, internet advertis-ing, IT staffing, payroll outsourcing, plumbing, printing and sales outsourcing.

There are N = 315 , 226 service providers represented in the repository. Each service provider has one or more forms. We note that N&lt; 3000  X  400 since many service providers are listed under multiple sectors.

In our simulations, we focused on the problem of running a marketing campaign for a small business. We identified that a small business customer, willing to run a marketing campaign, would need services from a number of sectors, including
In our simulations, we compare the following five approaches:
The ground truth for each sector is a form that we con-structed manually based on 500 service providers in that sector. Specifically, we took the following steps to construct the ground truth for a sector: ii. Retrieve forms from the webpages of these 500 service iii. Build a list of concepts (e.g., service offerings, service iv. Construct a list of specifications from the list of con-
For each of the five sectors (printing, telemarketing, graphic web design, direct mail marketing, outdoor advertisement) in the marketing campaign, we compared the specifications forms outputted by the approaches discussed in section 4.2. The comparisons are included in Table 1. Each cell cor-responds to the true detection rate for the corresponding approach and corresponding sector. The true detection rate refers to the ratio of the number ground truth specifica-tions present in a form to the total number of ground truth specifications. Overall, the multilabel approach outperforms the remaining 4 approaches. For the printing, telemarket-ing, graphic web design and outdoor advertising sectors, the true detection rates for the forms outputted by the multil-abel approach are 1. For the direct mail marketing service, the multilabel approach leads to a detection rate of 0.92.
We provide detailed comparisons of the random, aggre-gate and multilabel approaches in Tables 2-6. In each table, the first column lists the set of ground truth specifications. The second (labeled M) and third (labeled A) columns rep-resent the specifications included in the forms outputted by the multilabel and aggregate approaches, respectively. The remaining 20 columns are for the specifications included in the 20 forms randomly selected for the aggregate approach. An  X  X  X  mark in a table indicates that the specification is included in the corresponding form.

In each sector, the true detection rate for each of the ran-domly selected forms is low compared with that of the multi-label approach. While the random selection provides a spec-ifications form without much effort (i.e., just pick a service provider listed under the sector from the business directory, and use its web form), the randomly selected forms have an average detection rate of only 0.21 with the highest detection rates in the sectors being .52 (or 11 out of 21) for form 1 in printing, 0.83 (15 out of 18) for form 9 in telemarketing, 0.36 (4 out of 11) for forms 4, 5 and 15 in graphic web design, .67 (8 out of 12) for forms 10, 12 and 16 in direct mail market-ing, and .29 (2 out of 7) for forms 2, 5, 8 and 18 in outdoor sign advertisement. Thus, for the sectors considered, the randomly selected forms are not very representative of the ground truth specifications.

For the printing, telemarketing and direct mail marketing sectors, the 20 randomly-selected forms together span all the ground truth specifications, thus, for each of these sec-tors, the aggregate approach has a true detection rate of 1. However, for the graphic web design and outdoor sign adver-tising sectors, the detection rates of the aggregate approach are low when compared with the multilabel approach. For the graphic web design service, the detection rate is 0.55 (6 out of 11), while for the outdoor sign advertising service the detection rate is 0.57 (4 out of 7) for the aggregate ap-proach. We should also note that the aggregate approach is manual; it requires one to spend considerable time and ef-fort, including extracting terms and concepts manually from the forms in service providers X  websites, and construct a list of specifications manually from the terms and concepts.
Table 7 lists the false alarms in the specifications forms outputted by the multilabel approach. The false alarms re-fer to the entries present in the specifications forms, but not in the ground truth. For the graphic web design and outdoor sign advertisement sectors, we do not observe any false alarms. For the remaining three sectors, there are false alarms. However, for the telemarketing and direct mail mar-keting services, the false alarms are not specifications; in-stead, they are additional service options (which may ac-tually be informative to the customer). For the printing service, on the other hand, we observed three specifications not present in the ground truth.
The inbound telemarketing sector (a.k.a. the call cen-ter sector) and the outbound telemarketing sector are two sectors of the telemarketing industry included in our reposi-tory. While the two sectors share a number of specifications, they also differ in some specifications. The multilabel ap-proach correctly partitioned the forms such that the inbound Operating system X X X X X Domain Name/ISP X X X X X X X X X X Location properties X X X X telemarketing forms and the outbound telemarketing forms were assigned to different clus ters,eachwithitsownspec-ifications form. The inclusion of sectors (labels) into the clustering process guided the clustering process so that the two sets of forms were assign ed to different clusters.
One may argue that the inbound telemarketing forms and the outbound telemarketing forms would be clustered sepa-rately even without the inclusion sectors (labels) since the two sets differ in some specifications. However, it is not uncommon for statistical techniques to fail to capture all of the clusters present in a given data set; often, guidance (either supervised or semi-supervised) help the statistical techniques in discovering clusters. In fact, in our case, the unsupervised approach failed; it clustered the telemarketing forms into a single cluster without differentiating between inbound telemarketing and outbound telemarketing. This accounts for the relatively low detection accuracy of the un-supervised approach for the telemarketing sector.
As shown in Table 1, the detection rates for the supervised clustering approach are lower than those for the multilabel approach for 4 of the sectors. In each of these 4 sectors, many service providers are listed under multiple sectors, which causes the supervision to be misleading. For instance, many providers of the direct marketing sector are also listed under sectors such as printing, shipping and advertising; thus, the supervised cluster for the direct marketing sector includes many web forms with specifications from sectors such as printing, shipping and advertising. As a result, the spec-ifications form selected for the direct marketing cluster is not necessarily representative of the direct marketing sector. The multilabel approach, on the other hand, uses the sector names only to guide the clustering by taking into account sector relations. Consequently, the multilabel approach is more accurate.
An important parameter used in the multilabel approach is the step size,  X  , in the annealing process. Each of the five curves in Fig. 1 illustrates how the true detection rate for the multilabel approach varies, for a sector, as  X  in-creases. Each curve corresponds to one of the five sectors, and in each curve, we show the detection rate for 6 step sizes. Fig. 2 illustrates how the false alarm rate for the multilabel approach varies, for each of the 5 sectors, as  X  increases. Similar to Fig. 1, each curve corresponds to one of the five sectors, and in each curve, we show the false alarm rate for 6 step sizes. We have not counted the  X  X dditional service options X  mentioned in section 4.6 as false alarms. Finally, in Fig. 3, we illustrate the number of additional service options observed for each sector for the different step sizes.
We are working towards building a universal marketplace site that provides consumers with forms (with entries, ques-tions, etc.), which consumers can fill out to make their ser-vice specifications. This would allow the consumers to in-teract with multiple service providers, to learn their service terms and to compare them without much effort. We ex-pect that, for some sectors, the form may not span all the specifications, and the service providers may need to corre-spond with the consumer to ask for specifications beyond Figure 1: Detection rates for the multilabel ap-proach for different epsilon step sizes. The blue, red, black, green and yellow curves are for print-ing, telemarketing, graphic web design, direct mail marketing and outdoor sign advertisement sectors, respectively. those covered in the form. However, even in such cases, the presence of a filled-out form, covering most of the specifi-cations, would be helpful by reducing the time spent in the correspondence.

While the consumer has the option of randomly picking a web-based form to learn the specifications, our simula-tions indicate that most randomly retrieved web forms miss a large proportion of the specifications. Most forms included in the service provider websites cover only a subset of the specifications needed for the engagement. Another approach that the consumer might take is to visit multiple sites and learn the specifications by aggregating the concepts covered in multiple forms; however, our simulations indicate that even the aggregate approach misses many of the specifica-tions for some sectors unless the number of visited sites is very large.

We formulated the form discovery problem as a retrieval or selection problem. While one can pose the problem as an ag-gregation (of multiple forms) problem instead of a retrieval or selection (of the best form) problem, the state of the art is far from being able to automatically generate meaning-ful forms by aggregation for services. Generating a form by aggregating the entries and questions in multiple forms often requires multiple manual steps, including attribute-value pair extraction, labeling of the attributes and labeling of the categories of the forms. While statistical techniques to addressing some of these problems have been proposed [15], it is still a challenge, for instance, to present the ex-tracted attributes, concepts and keywords as a meaningful and well-ordered set of questions. Figure 2: False alarm rates for the multilabel ap-proach for different epsilon step sizes. The blue, red, black, green and yellow curves are for print-ing, telemarketing, graphic web design, direct mail marketing and outdoor sign advertisement sectors, respectively.

We add that our approach has limitations. First, the sites, from which we retrieve the web forms, need to be machine crawlable. For instance, our approach is not applicable to the sites that require login, or the sites that break forms into multiple successive pages. Second, the approach is not suitable for all types of sectors and services. As an exam-ple, engaging with a professional service such as a physician would require other considerations beyond factual specifica-tions. [1] L. Barbosa and J. Freire.
