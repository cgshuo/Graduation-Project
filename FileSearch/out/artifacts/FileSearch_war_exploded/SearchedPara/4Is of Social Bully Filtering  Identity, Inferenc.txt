 As the increasing of popularity of social web, cyber bullying has become a more and more serious issue among children. Bullying causes huge negative effects on children, even sui-cide. SocialFilter is a realtime system that helps parents and educators track children X  X  messages on Twitter, espe-cially in order to detect whether they have been bullied or bullying others. The aim of the system is 4 I X  X , i dentity of bullies, i nference of bullying message, i nfluence of bully be-havior, and i ntervention. We solve this problem by using machine learning technique. The current system is tracking tens of thousands of active children users on Twitter and automatically detect bullying messages at real time.

Social web sites such as Twitter and Facebook are among the most popular web sites on the Internet. While the im-pact of the social web can be positive, there can be a dark side as well. One example is cyber bullying, which can have huge negative effects on children [11], possibly lead-ing to serious social, psychological and health effects. Vic-tims experience depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, suicidal ideation, poor grades, and negative physical health symp-toms[10][3]. The impact could be even further, reaching bystanders, who might keep silent due to the fear of be-coming the next victims if they do interfere, and make them feel powerless, loss self-respect and self-confidence. What is worse, they might not be aware of that these negative ef-fects are caused by others. Instead, they blame themselves. Unfortunately, cyber bullying can easily go undetected due to a lack of supervision. For this reason, we have developed SocialFilter (http://kideroo.net/), a social web bully mon-itoring program to help parents and educators track chil-dren X  X  social network, and detect potential bullying messages and mentioning the accounts will be tracked by our sys-tem in realtime. For educators, they can create profiles to track tweets posted at a specific location, such as a school, a community, or any other locations of interest. Then all the tweets related to the profile will be tracked by our sys-tem. They can also create several child specific profiles and location/community related profiles.

Every message is classified by our social bully filtering model as either normal tweet or bullying tweet. Parents and educators can see a list of potential bullying tweets identified by our system. They can also browse those bullying tweets on a Google map. For each potential bullying tweet, a user can provide their feedback by judging where it is bullying tweet or not in his prospect. SocialFilter learns from these feedback in realtime for further improve the online classifi-cation accuracy.

Bullying may involve conversation style of tweets between bullies and victims, and may also involve bystanders, as-sistants of bullies, and defenders of victims. Our system will show the bullying conversation among them, and the social network graph of them. Parents and educators can get a whole picture of the bullying process with more de-tails. Furthermore, sentimental analysis on the tweets of the child before, during, and after the bullying instance, will be used to see whether the bullying instance have affected him/her. In addition, a user can provide her email address, and SocialFilter will send alerts of potential bullying tweets to the email in realtime.
The major components of the current SocialFilter are: 1) a live data streaming collecting module that collect tweets in real-time way from Twitter; 2) a user account manager for a user (parent or teacher) to manage their account; 3) a new adapted filtering module that detects bullying tweets in real time; 4) a filtering result presentation module that shows the results as a list (updated in real time) or on a map; and 5) an intervention component that helps alleviate the problem through interaction and intervention.
Our demo system is motivated and informed by research findings in social science about bullying, especially cyber bullying. Early research has shown that bullying or cyber bullying are associated with various factors (gender, race, age, etc.). Goldbaum et.al. found that boys have a higher prevalence of bullying than girls and bullying behavior peak in middle school [4]. Researchers also found that girls are more involved in indirect bullying (excluding others from a group, etc.) [1] [8], which are usually hard to be discovered based on self-report data [6]. Wang et.al. [12] and Nansel et.al. [8] found that certain races more likely to bully and less likely to being victims. These factors suggested by so-cial scientists might be very useful features for our machine learning algorithms to use.

Motivated by the earlier research, we introduced various features for our filtering system, including the content of the tweets, sentiment analysis features, the demographic infor-mation about twitter users, and the context of the tweets. Because tweets are very short (every tweet is limited to 140 characters), and full of abbreviations, typos, emotional ASCII characters, hashtags, and URL X  X , we use regular ex-pressions, character n-gram, unigrams, and n-grams to rep-resent the content of each tweet. The context includes previ-ous tweets, along with Twitter user modeling features from LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) [9]. LIWC cal-culates how people use different word categories such as psy-chological processes, personal concerns and more. We also perform social network construction of a Twitter user and use network information as features.
Bullying message filtering can be viewed as a special case of the well studied adaptive information filtering task, while the focus here is semi-structured documents. Document structures convey important information, which might be useful for the filtering tasks. However, most existing content-based filtering algorithms such as Rocchio, Language Mod-els, and BM25 assume incoming documents are unstruc-tured and treat each document as a bag of words. There are some limitations with these algorithms as a result of ig-noring document structural information. For example, these algorithms mainly focus on the topic relevancy and cannot handle a user X  X  information needs with faceted constraints well.

On the other hand, social science researchers found differ-ent bullying behaviors (physically, verbally, socially, elec-tronically etc.) have different characteristics (prevalence rate, how it relates to other variables etc.). They also found the types of bullying are associated with the demographic information of the bullies and victims, [4][1][8]. We ex-pect a learning algorithm that can integrate various features (texts, demographic information, social context characteris-tics, etc.) and capture the interactions between features which are needed for effective bully detection on the social web. The demo system uses Gradient Boosting Tree model (GBT) as our learning model, because GBT has the advan-tage of being able to handle deep interactions among fea-tures, and has been shown to perform well in other tasks such as learning to rank [7].
