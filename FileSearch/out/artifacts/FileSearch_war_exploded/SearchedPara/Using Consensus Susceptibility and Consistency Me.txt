 knowledge from different resources for realizing the task. Nowadays owing to modern computer technologies gathering knowledge is not a hard task at all, but there may be two features of this knowledge, which often make the decision making process difficult. The first feature is related to the big amount of knowledge which on one hand contains many useful elements, but on the other hand it often contains also a lot of useless elements. For these problems many methods for information filtering or gathered knowledge. Some elements of this knowledge may refer to the same subject, knowledge as situations in which one obtains  X  X oo much X  information. knowledge often leads to conflict uprising. For example in multiagent systems, where sources of knowledge are as various as methods for its acquisition, the inconsistency on some matter, which are generated by different resources such as agents functioning in sites of a distributed system or experts of some field including this matter. version of knowledge for the common matter. This final knowledge version is called a susceptibility for conflict profiles and the second refers to measuring up the degree of some divergences in various occurrences. Researchers often use this term but they do not define what it means. The definition has been provided by Helpern &amp; Moses [2] and Nieger [5]: Knowledge consistency is a property that a knowledge interpretation has with respect to a particular system . The need for measures of knowledge consistency has been announced earlier in the aspect of solving conflicts in distributed environments [9]. 
The formal investigations on conflicts have been initiated by Pawlak [13]. In work classical logics such as paraconsistent logics [3] or four-valued logics [4]. define the notion of consensus susceptibility (Section 3) and show several consistency functions (Section 4). In Section 5 the relationships between consensus susceptibility directions for future works are included in Section 6.  X  and let  X   X  ( U ) = structure of this universe is a distance function which satisfies the following conditions: Let us notice that the above conditions are only a part of metric conditions. Metric is a space . Definition 1. By a consensus choice function in space ( U ,  X  ) we mean a function denote the set of all consensus choice functions in a space s = ( U ,  X  ). 
In the following definition symbol denotes the sum operation on sets with repetitions, and symbol  X  denotes the multiple occurrence of an element in a set with repetitions (that is a multiset). Definition 2. The consensus choice function c  X  C s satisfies the postulate of: ( c ( X 1 )  X  c ( X 2 )  X   X  ) " ( c ( X 1 X 2 ) = c ( X 1 )  X  c ( X 2 )) Below we present some results of postulates' analysis [8]. following formulas, in which the names of postulates are treated as atomic predicates: 
But S should be the model for the following formulas: important role. They satisfy a large number of postulates, such as Condorcet Proportion. Therefore, these 2 choice criteria are the main subject in the consideration of consensus susceptibility in this paper. universe U. In consensus theory some object structures of have been investigated, for example, linear orders (rankings); n-trees; semillatices; partitions of sets etc. one may always determine its consensus (for example using consensus function O 1 or O ). However, one should give the answer for the following question: Is the has not been investigated up to now. Below we present an example illustrating the above problem. objects of some type, and distance function  X  is given as result of some voting, in which 100 voters take part, each of them gives one vote (for good consensus, because there is lack of a compromise in this conflict situation. Let should be b and it seems to be a good consensus, that means this profile is susceptible to consensus. 
The above example shows that although consensus may always be chosen for a profile' susceptibility to consensus. following values: The interpretations of these values are the following: only if the following inequality takes place : 
The idea of the above definition relies on such intuition that because value ) (  X  X i  X  other words, opinions represented by thes e elements are consistent enough for determining a good compromise. Henceforth if i = 1 then we will not write the index i. follows: and 
Of course X ' we have the following: and is O 2 -susceptible to consensus. Definition 3 is then consistent with the intuition. only if for each pair of objects x , y  X  U the following equality takes place : is not i -regular (or i -irregular) for i = 1,2. Below we present some results of the analysis [10]. consensus for i = 1,2 .

Theorem 1 implies that if a profile is regular, then it is not worth to determine the consensus. is i-regular , then profile X ' is O i -susceptible to consensus for i = 1,2 . of this theorem is the following: if in given conflict situation any of the opinions does then it is possible to determine a sensible consensus. 
Thus profile X can not be O 1 -susceptible to consensus. In Example 1 for profile X nor O 2 -susceptible to consensus. context of other profile. and ) (  X  max X  X   X  ) (  X  min Y  X  . 
The above definition serves in such situations when profile X is not susceptible to conflict represented by profile Y . In this case the consensus determined for profile X could be acceptable. following signature: where [0,1] is the closed interval of real numbers between 0 and 1. work [12]. follows: profile X is a homogeneous one. We introduce the following parameters: -The matrix of distances between the elements of profile X : -The vector of average distances between an element to the rest: -Diameters of sets X and U : -The maximal element of vector W X : representing this element of profile X , which generates the maximal sum of distances to other elements. -The average distance in profile X : 
These parameters are now applied for the defining the following consistency functions: 
Values of these functions reflect accordingly: In this section we present some dependencies between profile consistency and consensus susceptibility. These dependencies show that in general the two notions are coherent. The following properties are true: consensus in relation to postulate O i for i= 1,2 . 
This property shows the coherence betwee n consistency measures and consensus necessarily it should not be susceptible to consensus. The following properties show consensus in relation to postulate O i for i= 1,2 . consensus in relation to postulate O i for i= 1,2. 
The reason of the property included in Proposition 2 is that function C 1 takes into C has many practical applications. 
Another aspect of the relationship betw een consistency meas ures and consensus when a profile is susceptible to consensus. It turned out that the behaviors of defined consistency functions are not similar. then : a) C 3 ( X ) &gt; 0.5, C 4 ( X ) &gt; 0.5, and b) C 2 ( X ) &gt; 0, C 5 ( X ) &gt; 0. relationship to functions C 2 and C 5 ; and very weak relationship to functions C 1 . 
The proofs of the above propositions are given in the technical report [11]. notions of consensus susceptibility and consistency measures for conflict profiles and The future works should concern the deeper analysis of the dependencies between the two criteria for consensus reasonableness.
