  X  X hat other people think X  has always been an important piece of information for most of us during the decision-making process. Today people tend to make their opin-ions available to other people via the Internet. As a re-sult, the Web has become an excellent source of consumer opinions. There are now numerous Web resources contain-ing such opinions, e.g., product reviews forums, discussion groups, and blogs. But, it is really difficult for a customer to read all of the reviews and make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It is also difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and manage cus-tomer opinions. Also, focusing on just user ratings (stars) is not a sufficient source of information for a user or the manu-facturer to make decisions. Therefore, mining online reviews (opinion mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction. Extracting aspects and the corresponding ratings is an important challenge in opinion mining. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, e.g.  X  X oom X  for a digital camera. A rating is an intended interpretation of the user satisfaction in terms of numerical values. Reviewers usually express the rating of an aspect by a set of senti-ments, e.g.  X  X reat zoom X . In this tutorial we cover opinion mining in online product reviews with the focus on aspect-based opinion mining. This problem is a key task in the area of opinion mining and has attracted a lot of researchers in the information retrieval community recently. Several opin-ion related information retrieval tasks can benefit from the results of aspect-based opinion mining and therefore it is considered as a fundamental problem. This tutorial covers not only general opinion mining and retrieval tasks, but also state-of-the-art methods, challenges, applications, and also future research directions of aspect-based opinion mining.

Samaneh Moghaddam is a PhD candidate in the school of computer science at Simon Fraser University. Her main research interests include information retrieval, text min-ing, machine learning, natural language processing, and so-cial network analysis. Samaneh is a senior member of SFU Database and Data mining lab under supervision of Dr. Martin Ester. Her PhD thesis is  X  X spect-based Opinion Mining from Online Product Reviews X . She has proposed some novel techniques for extracting product aspects and estimating their ratings from product reviews. Samaneh Moghaddam has published several papers in top interna-tional conferences such as ACM CIKM, ACM SIGIR, and IEEE ICDM. Her publications are mostly related to her re-search on information retrieval and machine learning models for mining opinion from product reviews.
 Martin Ester received a PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, in 1990 with a thesis on knowledge-based systems and logic programming. He has been working for Swissair developing expert systems before he joined Uni-versity of Munich as an Assistant Professor in 1993. Since November 2001, he has been an Associate Professor, now Full Professor at the School of Computing Science of Si-mon Fraser University, where he co-directs the Database and Data mining research lab. He has published exten-sively in the top conferences and journals of his field such as ACM SIGKDD, VLDB, ICDM and ICDE, and his work has been very well-cited. His most famous paper on DB-SCAN received more than 2900 citations, and his H-number is 34. His current research interests include social network analysis, recommender systems, opinion mining, biological network analysis and high-throughput sequence data anal-ysis. Martin Ester X  X  interests in applications have resulted in various collaborations with research labs, industry and government agencies.
The tutorial will draw information retrieval researchers and students who want to make themselves familiar with opinion mining as well as practitioners who want to develop state-of-the-art methods for different tasks of opinion min-ing. We expect participants to have a working knowledge of basic information retrieval and machine learning meth-ods. Basic natural language processing techniques used in opinion mining will be discussed during the tutorial.
