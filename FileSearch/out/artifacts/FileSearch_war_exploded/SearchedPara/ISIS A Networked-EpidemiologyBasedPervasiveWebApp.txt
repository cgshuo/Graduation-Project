 We describe Isis , a high-performance-computing-based app li-cation to supp ort compu tational epidemio logy of infectious disea ses. Isis has been dev eloped over the last seven years in close coordination with pub lic health and p olic y exp erts. It has been used in a nu mber of important federal plann ing and resp onse exerc ises. Isis grew out of years of exp erien ce in developing a nd u sing HPC-o riented models of complex socially coup led syst ems. This id entified the guiding princi-ple tha t complex models will be used by domain experts only if they can do realistic analys is without bec oming c omputing experts .

Usin g Isis , one can c arry out detailed compu tational exper-imen ts as they pertain to plann ing a nd response in the event of a pand emic . Isis is desig ned to supp ort networked ep i-demio logy  X  stud y of epidemic processes over social contact networks. The current syst em can h and le airborne infec-tious disea ses such as influ enza, pertussis, and smallp ox. Isis is comprised of the followin g basic components: ( i ) a web app that serves as the user-interface, ( ii ) a middlew are that coo rdinates user interaction via the web app with b ackend models and da taba ses, ( iii ) a ba ckend compu tati onal mod el-ing framewo rk that is comp rised of highly resolved ep idemi c sim ulations combined with h igh ly realistic c on trol st rategies that includ e ph armaceutical as well as non-pharmaceutical in -terventions and ( iv ) a bac kend d ata manag emen t framework that manag es complex un structured and semi-s tructured data.

Isis ha s been used in o ver a do zen case stud ies defin ed by the DoD, DHHS, NIH, BARDA and NSC. We describe three recent stud ies illu strating the use o f Isis in real-world settings:

A pand emic is an infectious disease outbreak affect ing a large popu lation across the entire globe, for exam ple, the re-emerg ence of H1N1 influ enza in 2009 . Certain modern trends exacerba te the speed and sev erit y of pand emics . This includ es: ( i ) increased glob al popu lation, ( ii ) increased mo-bilit y, both on locally and interna tionally , and ( iii ) increased popu lations of older and imm un ocompromised ind ivid uals. In sp ite of these factors, over the last 50 years, pub lic health ag encies across the world have made rema rkable strides in reducing the social, economic and h ealth impacts of such pand emics. Comp ut ational epidemio log y is the develo pment and u se of compu ter models for und erstand ing the spatio-temporal diffusion of disea se through popu lations. Controlled exp erimen ts used to unde rstand scien tific ph enomen on are much h arder and often imp ossible to do when stud yin g epi-demio logy, du e to ethical, and often practical reasons. As a result , compu tational models p lay an important role in elu cidating the space-time dynamic s of epidemics . They also serv e an imp ortant role in ev aluating various interventi on strategies, including ph armaceutical and n on-ph armaceutical interventions [20, 14 , 19 , 18 ]. The role of ind ivid ual behavior and pub lic p olicies is critical in und ersta nd ing a nd controllin g epidemic s.

Traditional mathema tical models for studying epidemic s focused on rate-based differential equation models [15 ]. In this app roach, one partitions the popu lation into subgroup s based on various criteria (e.g., demog raph ic characteristi cs and d isease states), and u se differential equa tion models to descri be the disea se dynamics across these group s. Although usefu l, the app roach fails to capture the complexit y of hu man interactions and b ehaviors. The diversit y of hu man b ehavior makes plann ing a nd response complicated and motivates a mea sure-project-intervene modelin g cycle. This naturally motivates a n interaction based approa ch . It involves a cc urate modelin g of the social in teraction n etwork and the disea se dynamics. It uses an endog enous represen tations of ind ivid u-als tog ether wit h exp lici t interactions between these ag ents to g enerate and capture the disea se spread across the social interaction n etwork; see [23, 24 ]. In th is sen se, th e app roach goes beyond the mathemat ical modelin g techn iques discu ssed earlier, which a ssu me ho mogeneo us interact ions wit hin each segment of the popu lation. It raises new techn ical difficu lties though, includ ing ( i ) synthesis of city and n ational scale social contact networks, ( ii ) high p erformance computing models to study disea se spread and interventions over these networks and ( iii ) bigdata challenges spann ing the abilit y to carry out comp lex comp ut ational experimen ts, data man-ag emen t and analyti cs. Nevertheless, recent advances in computing tec hn ology, mac hine learning, data minin g and network science have made this app roach a rea lity [10, 12 , 22 , 21 , 11 ].

Public health epidemio logy provid es a n imp ortant societal app lication to app ly computationa l t hinking and exploit big data. The big data challen ges come in nu mero us forms: ( i ) a large nu mber of diverse data strea ms pertaining to social, health, economic, policy and infras tructure rea lms that need to be syn thesiz ed to develo p realist ic social contact networks; ( ii ) the size of data sets ; ( iii ) modelin g the epidemic s sp read, and the impac t of interventions, requires sub stantial comput-ing re sources; furthermore this produ ces data th at is several orders of magnitude larger than the inpu t data; ( iv ) t he mea sure-model-analyz e-act-mea sure loo p implies that t he inpu t data a nd d ata g enerated by models has to be analyzed in near-rea l time. Here we desc ribe Isis ( Interface to Synth etic Information Sys tems ): a web-browser based mode lin g a nd d ecision sup-po rt enviro nment for pub lic health epidemio log ists . Isis can be u sed for plann ing, situation assessmen t, coun ter-factual analysis and response as it p ertains to infectious disea se epidemio logy. The current syst em can hand le airborne infec-tious disea ses such as influ enza, pertussis, sma llp ox, etc. Isis is a part of a larger integrated cyber-environment and is com-prised of the follo win g basic c omponents: ( i ) a web-browser based u ser-interface (i.e., a w eb app) , ( ii ) a middlew are th at coo rdinates user interaction wit h the UI a nd with the back-end models and d atabases, ( iii ) a backend compu tational modelin g framework that is comprised of highly resolved epidemic sim ulations combined with h ighly realist ic con-trol strategies th at includ e both ph armaceuti cal as well as non-ph armaceutical in terventions and ( iv ) a backend d ata manag emen t framework that manages complex un structured as and semi-s tructured data. Isis can supp ort interaction based compu tational epidemio logy discu ssed earlier.
Isis is design ed specifically so that pub lic health analysts can focus on d esig n and analysis of complex computer exp er-imen ts to s upp ort plann ing a nd control of epidemic s rather than b ecomin g computer scien tist s. Neverth eless, the back-end is comprised of powerful high p erform ance computing based modelin g a nd d ata manag emen t methods. The group has been d evelo ping models for large complex social syst ems for over a decade. The motivation to develo p such p ervasiv e computing web app s providing seamless acc ess was deriv ed from our earlier experien ce, wherein we realized that complex mode ls although scientifically interesting a re of litt le use if they cann ot be made acc essib le to a domain expert who is usually not a compu ter scien tist .

The supp orting und erlyin g mathematical models have been reported in our earlier work  X  our focus here is on computa-tiona l and da ta infrastructure tha t enab les the development and d eploymen t of the pervasiv e and scalable web app so that it can b e used by pub lic health analysts . The focus of this paper is on p roblem description, design d ecisio ns, and deploymen t challeng es.

Isis has been used to supp ort a nu mber of federal plan-ning and d ecision suppo rt exerc ises. W e describe three such stud ies: ( i ) use of the too l du ring the H1N1 pande mic out-break, ( ii ) supp orting a DOD plann ing exerc ise for milita ry preparedness, and ( iii ) socio-eco nomic analysis of anti-viral distribution. We have chosen these examples for three rea-sons. First, they d emon strate the range of computational exp erimen ts that can b e carried out usin g the too l. Second , they demo nstrate the use o f Isis in important real-world set-tings as opp osed to a n academic exerc ise. Finally , each of the stud ies identified new challen ges that served as requ iremen ts for further develop ment of the tool.
The web app is an interactive, easy to use, graph ical user interface and is design ed to supp ort the runn ing o f exp erimen ts consist ing o f nu merou s simu lations that generate distributions of outcomes to ga in an app reciation of the time-varying sta te (t he dynamic s) of an epidemiol og ical event. The too l specifically supp orts exp loration of the variabilit y of outcomes in this highly stochastic process. Experimen tal outcomes are used in analysis reports, which are a kind of distribution of nu mero us replicates of an experimen t and are generally view able a s plotted graph s. The Isis tool is intended p rimarily to facilit ate both th e planning a nd course of action of analysis activiti es for analysts .

The Isis web app allows a user to set up d etailed facto-rial exp erimen ts. Usin g a simp le interface to a n und erlyin g digital lib rary, a user can sp ecify the follo wing for their exp er-iment: ( i ) a social contact network; ( ii ) a within-host disease progressio n model; and ( iii ) a set of interventions. Each intervention requi res addit ional details su ch as complia nce level, sub -popu lations to which the interventions are app lied and intervention triggers. An exp erimen t consists of sweep-ing o ne or more parameters across a user-specified range of values. See Figure 1 for an illu stration of Isis exp erimen ts. After setting up the exp erimen t, the user is provid ed access to the resu lts of the sim ulations. A set of basic analyses are performed automatically and the resu lts are displayed. See Figure 2 for an illu stration of Isis analyses. The stand ard plots and epidemic c urves provide very detailed information about the epidemic. Addit ional inform ation such as the spatio-temporal dynamics and d isease dendrogram (h ow the disease moved over the social network) is also a vailab le. A key aspect of Isis is its simplici ty  X  we can train pub lic health analyst s to make effecti ve use of the system in about t hree hours. Somewh at coun ter-intuitively, by hiding the compu ta-tional models from the end u ser, Isis makes them much more acc essib le. See http://ndssl.vbi.vt.edu/apps/isis/ for further details.
In terventions implemen ted in our HPC sim ulations can b e descri bed with the combination of a set of trigger con ditions, a set of subp opu lations, and a set of actions. They are usu ally in the form of:  X  X hen trigger conditions are satisfied, app ly actions to subpopulations  X . Table 1 describes how an inter-ven tion can be represen ted. There may be multiple trigger condit ions, subp opu lations, and actions in an intervention. There may be multiple different interventions in a sim ulation.
Representin g a nd analyzing disea se dynamics over large un structured and ti me-v arying social contact networks re-quires new work in h igh p erformance compu ting as well. Table 2 shows the data sizes o f a few examples of synthetic popu lations and n etworks and simulation resu lts supp orted by Isis . In an effort to a dd ress the scalin g problem typical in algorithms implemen ted for high p erformance compu ting, our group h as develop ed three different parallel algorithms and their implemen tations over the last t en years: EpiSim demics , EpiFast , and Indem ics [3, 31, 7]. These differ in the tradeoff they provide between computation speed, model realism and soph istication, and ease of introdu cing new behavio r and interventions. A c ompariso n b etween the simula tions can b e found in [5]. We briefl y describ e them belo w.
EpiSim demics [3], and its predecesso r EpiSim s [13], is an interaction-based, highly reso lved modelin g and simulation syst em for represen ting a nd reasoning a bout contag ion d if-fusio n across large networks. The EpiSim demics algorithm is ba sed on contag ion d iffusion a cross a social network. The network is represen ted as a bipartite graph , with p eople and locations as the nodes, and edges between t hem represen ting a person  X  X  presenc e at a location. We refer to this as a person-location graph . This represen tation allows location b ased interventions su ch as sc hoo l closure to remo ve some contacts (e.g., contacts at a specific schoo l) and replace them with contacts at a replacement location (e.g., home). EpiSim -demics can represent virtually all the exist ing models of between-host disea se propaga tion. It supp orts fully dynamic social networks (nodes a nd edges can be add ed and remo ved in response to disease propaga tion). Through the use of its scenario scripting languag e [9], it also has the abilit y to represen t a large collec tion of behavio ral and pub lic policy specifi cations, includ ing the use o f ph armaceuticals (e.g ., vac-cines or antivira ls) a nd change of plann ed activit ies (e.g., sch oo l closure, quarantine). Contag ion and b ehavio r are modeled as coup led Probab ilistic Timed Transition S ystems (PTTS ). Written in C ++ , EpiSim demics initially used MPI bu t has recently been modified to use the Charm ++ parallel framew ork [17, 4], which h as led to impro ved scaling a nd exec uti on ti me [31 ]. It can sim ulate the entire popu lation of the Unit ed States, a person-location n etwork with 30 0 million p eople and 1 . 5 billio n edges. On the 352 ,000 core NCSA BlueWaters system , 120 days of an epidemic on this scale can b e simu lated in 12 seconds, as shown in Figure 7. To the best our of knowledg e, this is the largest ag ent-based epidemic sim ulation, in terms of scalin g.
EpiFast [7] differs from EpiSim demics in the followin g ways: ( i ) The und erlyin g person-perso n social network is exp lici tly giv en, whereas EpiSim demics bu ilds it imp licitly usin g the p eople-location n etwork [13]; ( ii ) EpiFast imple-men ts a simple lin ear multi-stage with in h ost disease progres-Figure 7: Exec utio n time of EpiSimdemi cs on Blue-waters for United State s population ( 300 million people) for 120 simul ated days. sio n m odel, e.g ., Su sceptib le Exp osed Infect ious Reco vered (SEIR) disease model for epidemic simula tions; ( iii ) EpiFast runs in bu lk-s ynchronous mode; ( iv ) Interventions in Epi-Fast are coded as structural changes in the network (e.g., non-ph armaceutical in terventions) or nodes X  properties (e.g., infectiviti es and vulnerabilit ies). EpiFast is implemen ted in C ++ , usin g MPI for commun ication. It is simila r to EpiSim -demics in that it can run on any distri bu ted memo ry syst em, so long a s the total of all available memo ry can h old the whole network and modelin g parameters. The computin g architecture is comprised of one master process and multiple worker processes. The syste m runs in a bu lk synchronous parallel mode.
Indemics [6] is an interactive, database driven HPC frame-work for epidemic simula tions. It consist s of ( i ) a simu lation engine for computin g epidemi c dynamics, ( ii ) a situ ation assessmen t and intervention simula tion engine supp orted by a rela tional database, ( iii ) a client ( Indem ics clien t) for user interactions, and ( iv ) a middlew are platform ( Indemics serv er) that conn ects the above components to provide on-line epidemic dynamics to the user for makin g decision s on interventions and to provid e adaptive interventions to the sim ulation engine. Indem ics uses EpiFast or EpiSim demics as its und erlying diffusio n engine but is specifically desig ned to be interactive: a user can sto p the simula tion at any point, measure system state, and then proceed based on this inform ation. The sim ulation is also allo wed to roll-back to a previo us time point if needed . Another notable feature of Indem ics is its rich intervention set. In addit ion to a nu mber of pre-defined interventi ons, a user can u se SQL-based scripting languag e to defin e complex interventions [6]. The interventions can b e based on the sta te of the disea se and the dynamic , la beled p eople-location n etwork (including ind ividu al att ributes). Desig ning Isis to expose this rich set of interv entions is a part of ongo ing resea rch.
Isis is hosted on the Sim fras tructure service oriented middleware syst em [8], as shown in Figure 8 . Sim fras truc-ture serv es as a mult iplexer for four types of components that make up the integrated pandemic prepared ness platform:
Sim fras tructure is desig ned to add ress many of these challen ges. For exam ple, disease diffusio n models have been optimiz ed so that t hey can b e used to und ertake studies over large urban regions. Multiple concurrent users are also current ly supp orted bu t further scalin g is requi red.
The Synthetic Information Libra ry (SIL ) contains all of the information n eeded to create, run, and analyze exper-imen ts in Isis , and well as the results of past experimen ts. SIL enables structured and effici ent manag emen t of data sources which may be located on a collection of hardware and stored in multip le formats. A registry maintains an index of all the data sources as well as the specifications of the data. Computational meth ods can map existin g data sets to new data sets, and the registry records these processes to track data depen dencies and also to supp ort reprodu cible science. The registry may be compared to a lib rary index provid ing central acc ess all meth ods, data sets and their full specifications along with metadata.

SI L also provides servic es, from very generic to a pp lic ation specific, th at allows high level operations on th e data. Some exa mples of these services include provenance tracking, data curation, browsin g a nd searching. One particularly inter-estin g servic e is called memoization . When a requ est for computation arriv es, it is looked up to see if that compu ta-tion h as already been performed. If so, the stored resu lt is returned immedi ately. If the request has not previo usly been seen , it is run and the results st ored for further use.
Isis has been deployed and u sed in d ozens of user defined stud ies, all mainly focused on specific pand emic plann ing stud ies a nd exerci ses. Sp ecifically users from DHS, DoD and DHHS have used Isis to st ud y the impacts of a variety of intervention s in response to outbreaks of influ enza or o ther resp iratory disea ses, assess the characteristi cs of emerg ing epidemic s, and to o ptimize the allo cation of exist ing medical reso urces. The stud ies have guided the continued evolution of Isis both in terms of its usabilit y fo r the design and exec ution of sim ulations as well the deliv ery and consumption of the sim ulation resul ts themselv es. The studies also help ed us identi fy new researc h questions at t he interface of multi-ag ent modelin g, data mining, network scien ce, and h igh performance compu ting.

Non-Pharmac eutic al Targeted Layered Contain-See http://ndssl.vbi.vt.edu/apps/ and http://ndssl.vbi. vt.edu/supplementary-info/vskumar/cacm2012/ for add i-tional examples. In the subsect ions below w e elab orate on three of the stud ies.
This effort was in d irect resp onse to the initial repo rts of the emerg ence of the H1N1 influ enza virus in April 2009 , which eventually caused a g lobal pand emic . In the early days of th e outb reak, infections were confin ed to Mexico, Califo rnia, and Texas and then sprea d to New York. The rapid spread combined with initial overest imates of its mortalit y rate raised seriou s concerns of a repeat of the 1918 influ enza pand emic .

Init ial reports about t he disea se characterist ics were un -relia ble, with wide variations placed on imp ortant disea se parameters lik e the p roportion of symp tomatic individu als and the du ration of infec tious periods. Havin g developed the Isis too l for just this pu rpose, we were able to quickly run a series of studies exp loring the impa ct of the variation in these parameters in a large US p opu lation. A quick report was drafted about t he impa ct of disea se characterist ics on the size and shape of the expected epidemic c urve. Several varia nts of disea se models were a dd ed to the Isis too l. As H1N1 influ enza continued to spread in the US, the Departmen t of Health and Human S ervice s teamed up with the Defense Threat Redu ction Agency to p lace the Isis too l in the hand s of US go vernmen t analyst s to provid e day to day modelin g result s. This integration inside the 24-hour decision cycle runn ing the federal go vernment X  X  resp onse to this emerg ing crisis would n ot have been possib le wit hout the developm ent of highly optimize d modelin g soft ware as well as the web-enabled interface [16]. The analyst s were able to perform course-o f-action analyses to estima te the impact of closin g sch oo ls and shutt ing down workpl aces. Better sit uational awareness was also enabled by calib rating the model to newly availa ble data from the real world about to the New River Valley area o f Virginia to a dd ress this critical problem. The ec onomic c osts includ ed not only the loss in p rodu ctivit y du e to sic kness bu t also the ind irect cost incurred through d isease avoidance and caring for depen-dents.

People with d ifferent socio-economic constraints follow dif-feren t behavio ral stra tegies to avoid getting infected. These strategies are based on h ow ind ivid uals perceiv e both the sta te of the larger society around them and the partially observ able a ctions taken by their immed iate peer group or demog raphic c lass. The general principle being that high income ind ivid uals, youn g child ren and seni ors have a lower toleran ce of risk as compared to the rest of the p opu lation. Once the nu mber of infected people in the popu lation or in a perso n X  X  class reaches the personal thresh old value, the individua l is triggered to mod ify his behavio r. For mem bers of affluent househ olds, the modified behavior is reflect ed through the pu rchase of antivira ls. The mem bers of the middl e income class elimin ate non-essen tial activities such as shopp ing trips and recrea tional activit ies. Those in the poo rest income class people find it too expensive to pu r-chase antivira ls, or redu ce cont acts and h ence take no direct actions.

Public strategies include the distri bu tion of antivira l kits and schoo l closures. The trigg er thresh old for the pub lic intervention is set at 1% of the total popu lation b ecoming infected. The pub lic stockpile of the antivira l kits is limit ed to 10 ,00 0. These kit s are distri bu ted to the individu als based on one of four selec tion criteria: rand omly selec ted individu als, poo rest ind ividu als, first sic k ind ivid uals, and the most vulnerable individu als. Each time the  X  X lose schoo l X  strategy is used, the schoo ls are closed for a period of two weeks.

In order to a ssess the social and economic impac t of the intervention strategies, we develo ped elev en distinctive sce-narios based on ind ivid ual and go vernmental actions. A base case was includ ed to determin e the siz e of the epidemic in the absence of interventions. The resu lts show that t he most imp ortant factor responsib le for preventing income loss is the modification of individu al behavior; it drops the total income loss by 62 % compared to the base ca se. The next most imp ortant factor is the closure of schools, which reduces the total income loss by another 40%. Studies showed that the preventive behavio r of private citizens is the most impor-tant factor in controllin g the epidemic . The most effective interventions requ ire schoo l closures, pub lic distri bu tion of ant ivira ls to th e most vulnerable, and b ehavior modific ation by private citizens. The work app eared in [1] and was also men tioned as a part of the CDC report on school closures.
The requiremen ts to complete a st ud y of this nature re-quired the extension of one of the core sim ulation engines used b y Isis . Sp ecifically the need t o effici ently assess the state of disea se and acti ons across several scales, as well as deliv ering fin e control of thresholds for different classes of individu als. This extensio n b rings the e xpressiv e power of SQL queries to the specification of both triggerin g con ditions and targeted popu lations of interventions, greatly enhancing the realism of the interv entions Isis can represen t. Data challenges . The data involved in Isis and the backend sim ulations are of very large scale, and d ynamic, ambiguous, and h eterogeneous in nature. The experimen ts on Isis usu-ally consist of dozens of sim ulations, each of which simula tes dynamics in synthetic contact networks of millio ns of nodes and b illi ons of edges, and p rodu ces dynamics of each of the nodes du ring each of hund reds of simula tions days. The siz e of the inpu t and outpu t data files of each sim ulation are in gigabytes. The outpu t data is increasin g a s more experi-ments are run; the inpu t data also keeps increasing because users are often intereste d in calib rating synthetic p opu lation, disease model, initial cond itions, and interventions to do sen siti vit y analyses. It is impossib le to consider a ll possib le confi gurations users could come up wit h and p re-load them in Isis .

We add ressed these challen ges rela ted to data volume, velocity, variet y, and veracity wit h the Synthetic In formation Lib rary in Isis . This is different than the other syst ems, e.g ., VecN et , Ep iC and Glea mviz do not model perso n lev el details; DiC on does not have a GUI; FRED naviga tor allo ws one to acc ess a database of previou sly compu ted scenarios. FRED Mobile App is the most simila r to Isis bu t works only at a coun ty level. Furthermore the current version of FRED allo ws limite d nu mber o f interv entions [27].
 Lessons learne d . The use of Isis in real world studies yield ed imp ortant lesso ns and h elped improve the syst em. First, early v ersio ns of Isis (includ ing the dynamical models) were slow and somewh at cumbersome to use  X  the current versio n is si gnificantly fast er and easy t o use imp rovin g the overall time it takes to desig n and analyz e a case stud y.
Second , what we learn ed in d esig ning a nd u sin g Isis is the tradeoff between functionalit y and u sabilit y. While the backend HPC simula tion t oo ls (EpiSimdemics, EpiFast, and Ind emic s) c an h and le very comp licated scenarios, defined by their scenario descripti on languag es, only limited features can b e acc ommo dated in a web app lication. We have worked with Isis users to includ e only the most useful features, while allo win g exp ert users to a ccess a few more complex functions.
Third, we learned to d ist ribute the computation on multi-ple clusters. The use of cloud computing paradigm is quite app ropriate for this pu rpose. the Sim fras tructure mid-dleware achieves this goa l by seamlessly mapp ing jobs on vario us clusters availab le for the study.

Finally, as Isis becomes availa ble to the broader commu -nity, there is a need to develop a scalable data management syst em includ ing a digital lib rary to supp ort collab orative decision making. While the current system ha s a ba sic da ta manag emen t syste m, future versio ns will need to provide a ric h set of servic es to achieve this goa l.
 Future work . Curren tly in Isis , exp erimen tal da ta is man-ag ed by an Oracle database server and outpu t data is writ ten in d isk files. We are exploring usin g parallel databases to manag e the simula tion ou tpu t data. We are also working on integrating Isis wit h FluCaster , a web app we develop ed for epidemic forecastin g [26]. Finally , we are working o n integrating optimal intervention strategies that would allow users to evalua te the effic acy of strategies that are currently implemen ted.
