 Reciprocal recommender is a class of recommender systems that is important for tasks where people are both the subject and the object of the recommendation; one su ch task is online dating. We have implemented RECON, a reciprocal recommender for online dating, and we have evaluate d it on a major dating website. Results show an improved success rate for recommendations that consider reciprocity in comparison to recommendations that only recommendations. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Information filtering Algorithms, Experimentation Recommender systems, Online dating, Reciprocity RECON is a reciprocal recommender system for online dating. It has been evaluated on a large dataset from a major Australian dating website. Reciprocal recommenders [1] recommend people to people and a successful recommendation only occurs when both parties like each other. In addition to online dating, other important applications of reciprocal recommenders include matching employers with job app licants, matching mentees with mentors and identification of business partners. A reciprocal recommender does not imply social matching, but it does relate to computer-human interaction issues raised by Terveen and McDonald [2] such as privacy, trust, relation and interpersonal attraction. Users create online profiles which typically consist of a predefined list of attributes a bout themselves and their ideal partner. A user expresses intere st in another user by sending a predefined message, such as  X  X  like you, do you want to talk? X . The receiver can reply with a positive or negative message, e.g. Figure 1 shows a sample run of RECON. The top part presents information about an example user U for whom recommendations are made; this includes a summary of U  X  X  preferences based on the messages sent and the ideal partner profile, and also a summary of U  X  X  activity on the site. Th e bottom part shows the generated recommendations for U and if they are likely to be successful. A lip symbol in the lower left of a recommended user symbol indicates that V has shown interest in U by replying positively to U 's message while a green cross and black question mark indicate a negative reply. A drop down list allows the selection of different ranking criteria. To view the recommendations for a particular user (example processing, the example user's in formation is displayed followed by his recommendations. The exampl e user's information includes statistics about his previous inter actions with other users and his recommender. The recommended user s have a basic profile and previous interactions with the ex ample user listed, with a link to show a popup box displaying detailed profile information for the particular user. There are several options for ranking of the recommendations and they can be selected from a drop down box. The number of recommendations to be generated can also be selected similarly. A link is also provided with each recommended user to view the recommendations generated for that user. This is another way to specify a user to generate recommendations for without using the user_id .
