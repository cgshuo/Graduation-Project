 Topics that involve competing viewpoints are interesting and may be reported by hundreds of documents. Generally, topic documents cover every detail of different polarities (stances) and provide a balanced view of the topics. However, readers often have difficulty assimilating the information in numerous topic documents that cover various perspectives. Thus, several topic mining techniques have been developed to help readers. Existing topic mining approach es focus on extracting important themes from documents, and summaries of the themes are provided to help readers digest topics quickly. For instance, Mei and Zhai [13] developed a mixture of unigram models to extract salient themes from topic documents; while Nallapati et al. [16] and Feng and Allan [4] grouped topic documents into clusters, each of which represents a unique theme in a topic. Even though the extracted themes and summaries distill the topic contents clearly, readers must still expend a great deal of time in comprehending the extracted information if they are not familiar with the topics. Basically, a topic is associated with specific times, places, and persons [16]. Identifying the polarity of important persons in topics that involve competing viewpoints can help readers construct the background of the topics and facilitate reading. For example, if readers know the important persons of the competing political parties in a presidential campaign, they can learn about the campaign more easily. Chen and Wu [1, 2] proposed a PCA-based method to identify the polarities of topic persons, and showed that the signs of the entries in the principal eigenvector of PCA are effective in partitioning topic persons into different polarities; however, the viewpoints may contain more than two polarities, i.e., multi-polarities. We define the person name multi-polarization problem in this paper and propose an effective method for identifying the multi-polarities of person names in topic documents. The identified person polarities function as character descriptions of novels and fictional stories to help readers construct the backgro und of the topics and facilitate reading. A challenging issue in the multi-polarization of topic person names is that the polarity of the individuals is context-dependent. For instance, politicians often change their policies for the sake of expediency, so their polarities change accordingly. In such cases, no external knowledge source is available for person name multi-polarization. To solve the problem, we propose a model-based EM method that polarizes person names in an unsupervised manner. As the method only considers the word usage patterns of person names in topic documents, it does not require external knowledge sources and it can capture the polarity dynamics effectively. We also present off-topic block elimination and weighted correlation coefficient techniques to eliminate off-topic blocks and reduce the text sparseness problem respectively. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can identify multi-polar person groups of topics effectively. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a review of related works. We describe the proposed method in Section 3, and evaluate its performance in Section 4. Then, in Section 5, we present our conclusions. Although person name multi-polarization is closely related to sentiment analysis [17], which focuses on discovering textual units with bipolar orientations, it differs from sentiment analysis in a number of respects. First, most sentiment analysis approaches identify the polarity of adjectives, adverbs, and verbs because the syntactic constructs generally convey sentimental semantics. For instance, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown [6] employed language conjunctions, such as and , or , and but , to judge the polarity of conjoined adjectives. Ganapathibhotla and Liu [5] investigated the polarity of comparative adjectives (e.g., quick) or adverbs (e.g., quickly) combined with product features (e.g., run time) to identify the pros and cons of products discussed in product reviews. Ding et al. [3] also considered sentiment verbs, such as like and hate , to extract further sentiment comments about a product. In contrast, person name multi-polarization considers the polarity of person names, which are nouns that rarely express sentiment information. Second, sentiment analysis generally classifies textual have a positive or negative meaning. Specifically, people with different polarities take opposing stances regarding a certain topic, while people in the same polarity group reach a consensus or have the same goal. Finally, sentiment analysis usually requires external knowledge sources or human-composed sentiment lexicons. For example, Turney and Littman [21] manually selected seven positive and seven negative words as a sentiment lexicon and used pointwise mutual information (PMI) to calculate the polarity of a word. Kim and Hovy [10] and Hu and Liu [8] determined a word X  X  polarity by classifying the synonyms and antonyms of the word in WordNet [14]; while Ku et al. [11] dealt with Chines e sentiment analysis by considering the sentiment words in the General Inquirer lexicon [20]. However, as a person X  X  polarity is dynamic and context-dependent, no external knowledge source is available for person name multi-polarization research. The property of context-dependence and the lack of knowledge sources make the person name multi-polarization task a challenging research issue. 3.1 Model-Based Person Name Multi-polarization Given a set of documents about a topic that involves competing viewpoints with K polarities, we first decompose the documents into a set of non-overlapping blocks B = { b 1 ,..., b L }. A block is a content coherent unit, i.e., a document or a paragraph, which b , is the frequency of person name i in block l . Let N = { n 1 ,..., n M } represent a set of topic person names. A person name n i is an L -dimensional frequency vector whose model-based approach to identify the polarities of person names. Let  X  = {  X  1 , ...,  X  K ,  X  occurrence data N , the topic person name multi-polarization task searches for an appropriate polarity model. The task can be formulated as the following model search problem: As the number of polarity models is infinite, we assume that all models have the same prior probability [15]; then, using Bayes theorem, Eq. (1) can be converted into the following form: make contexts coherent. Consequently, if the occurrence of a person name are coincident with those of a polarity X  X  members, the person should be a member of that and use a correlation coefficient to discover the joint behavior of person names. However, as the range of the correlation coefficient is [-1,1], to avoid negative probabilities, we convert the range of the correlation coefficient by using the following equation: where corr (.) denotes the correlation coefficient between the frequency vectors of within [0,1]. It returns 1 when person i and polarity k are positively correlated, and 0 when they are negatively correlated. Next, we define P ( n i |  X  k ) as follows: The denominator in Eq. (4) is a normalization factor; hence, persons positively correlated with polarity k would be members of  X  k . Then, our objective, i.e., Eq. (2), is to cluster persons into positively correlated groups. person i belongs to polarity k ; otherwise, z i,k = 0. As person name multi-polarization is an unsupervised problem, the values of the variables are unobserved. Here, we employ an EM method to search for appropriate person polarities. First, we randomly initialize the model parameters, and execute the following EM steps iteratively until convergence. The E -step computes the expectation of an unobserved variable z i,k , by using the current polarity model. The M -step re-computes the polarity model as the maximum likelihood estimates given all the calculated expectations. Wu [22] proved the convergence of model-based EM methods. When converged, E [ z i,k ] indicates the probability that person i belongs to polarity k . We then assign person i to the polarity with the maximum probability. 3.2 Off-Topic Block Elimination While collecting the experimental data, we observed that topic blocks are sometimes off-topic. Since persons tend to be absent from the blocks jointly, including the blocks in the dataset would cause the EM method to overestimate the correlation between opposing persons and polarities. To reduce th e influence of off-topic blocks, we propose an off-topic block elimination (OBE ) procedure. For each topic, we construct a topic representation vector by averaging b l  X  X . Then, the blocks whose cosine considered off-topic blocks and excluded from the process of the EM method. 3.3 Weighted Correlat ion Coefficient Although OBE eliminates off-topic blocks , the proposed EM method is still affected by the text sparseness problem. Based on the principle of least effort [23], document authors tend to use a small vocabulary of common words to reduce the reading (writing) effort of readers (the authors). Consequently, the frequency distribution of person names follows Zipf X  X  law [19] that is, there are only a few frequent (important) person names, and most person names rarely occur in topic blocks. Consequently, many frequency vectors of topic person names contain a lot of zeros, which affect the calculation of the correlation coefficient. The absence of person names from topic blocks could cause overestimation (or under estimation) of the correlation between persons and polarities. We therefore propose the following weighted correlation coefficient, called wcorr (.), to weight absent blocks: where co ( i , k ) denotes the set of blocks whose frequencies in both n i and  X  k are non-n polarity k respectively. Parameter  X  , whose range is within [0,1], weights the influence of non-co-occurring blocks when we calculate the correlation coefficient. A large  X  makes non-co-occurring blocks important for multi-polarization. Like correlation coefficient, the range of wcorr (.) is within [-1,1]. We therefore employ Eq. (3) to avoid negative probabilities when calculating P ( n i |  X  k ). In the experiment section, we examine the effect of  X  on person name multi-polarization. In this section, we first introduce the data corpus and the evaluation metric. Then, we examine the effect of the system components. Next, we compare our model-based person name multi-polarization method with well-known clustering algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate multi-polarization results via case studies. 4.1 Data Corpus and Evaluation Metric In natural language processing, evaluations are normally based on official benchmarks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no official corpora for person name multi-polarization because the research subject is relatively new. We therefore compiled a data corpus for evaluations. As shown in Table 1, the corpus comprises eight topics with competing viewpoints about 4 sports tournaments and 4 global business events. All the topic documents were downloaded from Google News 1 . We selected the topics for evaluation because they are all related to global news events, so readers can comprehend the multi-polarization example presented in Sec. 4.4 without specific cultural or background knowledge. To compare our method with Chen and Wu X  X  bipolarization approach , we prepared four bipolar topics (i.e., Topics A ~ D ). Topics E ~ H are multi-polar topics, each of which involves four basketball teams competing in a tournament. For each of the eight topics, we extracted all the person names mentioned in the topic documents by using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer 2 . Given an input text, the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer extracts all possible named entities from the text. The recognizer also tags an extracted entity as a person name, a lo cation name, or an organization name. We used the extracted person names for evaluation. Since there is no perfect named entity recognition approach, the recognizer identified false person name entities, e.g., person name typos. To evaluate the true multi-polarization performance, we removed the false entities comprised of the name of a person and the name of an organization (or a location) because they were ambiguous. We did not remove any typo entities because they refer to specific (unambiguous) persons and retaining them for the evaluations helps us test the robustness of our method. We counted the frequency of each extracted person name. We observe that many of the extracted person names rarely occur in the topic documents and the rank-frequency distribution of person names follows Zipf X  X  law, as shown in Figure 1. The low frequency names are usually persons that are irrelevant to the topic (e.g., journalists), so they are excluded from the evaluation. For the evaluation, we selected the first frequent person names whose accumulated frequencies reached  X  percent of the total person name frequency count. In other words, the evaluated person names accounted for  X  percent of the person name occurrences in the examined topic. In the following experiments, we assess the system performance under  X  = 60%. All the evaluated person names represent important topic persons. 
We asked two experts to annotate the person polarity and to establish a reliable ground-truth for evaluations. We utilized the rand index [12], a conventional evaluation metric frequently used to compare clustering algorithms, to evaluate the performance of our multi-polarization method. Specifically, the rand index is based on name pairs. After a set of person names are partitioned into K polarities (clusters), the index measures the percentage of clustering decisions that are correct (e.g., placing a name pair with the same polarity in the same polarity). As large topics generally dominate small topics in micro-averaging [19], we use the macro-averaging to average the multi-polarization rand indices of the evaluated topics in order to compare the global performance. Paragraph tags are not provided in the evaluated topic documents, so a block is a topic document in our evaluation. 4.2 Effect of System Components In this section, we examine the effect of system components. As the performance of our method depends on EM initialization, we run the method twenty times with random initializations. For each EM experiment run, we examine the performance difference with and without off-topic block elimination. The OBE threshold  X  is set at 0.3 as the setting produces superior performances under a validation process. The the effectiveness of the weighted correlation coefficient. To prevent overestimation by our method, we take the average rand indices of the twenty EM runs under various settings, as shown in Figures 2. 
Although eliminating off-topic blocks improves the multi-polarization performance overall, the improvement is small under some parameter settings. We observe that the blocks eliminated by OBE only account for 8.6% of the topic content. As OBE just excludes a small portion of the topic conten t, it only corrects the correlation between persons and polarities slightly. Consequently, the improvement derived by OBE is small. We observe that some of the evaluated person names seldom occur in topic blocks. Since the purpose of the weighted correlation coefficient is to reduce text sparseness, the weighted correlation coeffici ent is effective in identifying the polarity of infrequent person names. Figure 2 shows that a small  X  generally yields inferior multi-polarization performances. We observe that many topic blocks, especially in the sports topics, are recaps of polarity competitions, which tend to mention persons of different polarities together. As a small  X  makes such co-occurring blocks important, the corresponding rand index is inferior. It is noteworthy that a large  X  produces superior multi-polarization performances. This is because a large  X  makes non-co-occurring blocks important for multi-polarization and non-co-occurring blocks between persons and polarities provide useful information in determining polarity relationships. To summarize, by eliminating off-topic blocks, a large  X  generally produces superior multi-polarization performances. Hence, the proposed o ff-topic block elimination and weighted correlatio n coefficient polarize topic person names effectively. 4.3 Comparison with other Methods The person name multi-polarization task is a special clustering problem that groups persons into polarity-coherent clusters. Here, we compare our method with the following four clustering algorithms: 1) the K-means algorithm [19]; 2) the PLSI algorithm [7]; 3) the HAC algorithm [18]; and 4) Chen and Wu X  X  PCA-based method, which polarizes persons by examining the sign of the entries in the principal eigenvector of PCA. In addition, a naive method, which considers all the person names as a single polarity, serves as a baseline to evaluate the efficiency of the clustering-based multi-polarization appr oaches. Both the K-means method and the HAC method represent a person as a high-dimensional frequency vector (i.e., n i ) and employ a cosine similarity measure to group similar person names into clusters. experiment, a term w is a person name. For our method, the parameter  X  is set at 0.6 based on the experiment results in Section 4.2. As the clustering performance of PLSI, K-means, and our method depends on cluster initialization, we randomly initialize the algorithms twenty times and examine their best, worst, and average results. For each of the algorithms, we also show the rand indices of the runs (denoted as obj-best and obj-worst) that produce the best and worst objective function values for a fair comparison. As the PCA-based method cannot polarize multi-polar topics (i.e., Topics A -D ), Table 2 compares the multi-polarization rand index and the bipolarization rand index. As shown in the table, the proposed method outperforms the compared algorithms in terms of the rand index. Although the PCA-based method yields comparable rand indices, it cannot deal with multi-polar topics. We observe that the performance of the K-means approach is inferior when popular persons are selected as the centroids of initial clusters. The frequency vector of a popular person usually contains a lot of non-zero entries, which tend to produce a hi gh similarity score because the cosine similarity is the inner product of the norm alized vectors. Under K-means, selecting such a person as the centroid of the initial cluster would merge cosine-similar but opposing persons together, and therefore impacts the multi-polarization performance. The inferior performance of the HAC single-link strategy also reflects the shortcomings of the cosine similarity measure. This is because the strategy determines the similarity between two clusters by examining the cosine similarity of the most similar persons in the clusters. Consequently, a high cosine similarity score between popular but opposing persons would result in opposing person groups being merged together. The PLSI algorithm also groups popular but opposing person names persons that co-occur frequently in topic blocks. Consequently, popular but opposing persons would be grouped together. By contrast, the proposed method determines person-polarity relationships in terms of th e correlation coefficient, which indicates how the occurrences of persons and polarities vary jointly. Therefore, it can identify the relationships between popular persons correctly and achieve a better multi-polarization performance. 4.4 Multi-polarization Example Due to space limitations, we only provide a multi-polarization example in Table 3. The table shows the multi-polarization results of Topic E . The first column of the expectation E [ z i , k ] generated by our method. A person belongs to the polarity with the maximum expectation. The results show that the proposed method polarizes the important players of the conference finals perfectly. It is noteworthy that, in Topic E , our method correctly polarizes Chauncey Billups as a member of the Detroit Pistons, as shown in Table 3. However, in Topic F , Billups was traded to the Denver Nuggets which also played in the 2009 conference finals. As our method polarizes person names in terms of word usage patterns in topic documents, it captured the polarity dynamics and polarized him correctly as a member of the Denver Nuggets. The examples show that our unsupervised method is context-oriented and can identify polarity dynamics without using any external knowledge source. A topic that involves competing viewpoints usually creates a lot of interest and generates a large number of documents. Identifying the polarities of the important persons mentioned in the topic documents can help readers understand the topic quickly. In this paper, we have defined a topic person name multi-polarization problem and proposed an effective EM method to identify person polarities without using external knowledge sources. The number of topic polarities is pre-defined. In our future work, we will incorporate the number of polarities into a multi-polarization objective function to determine the appropriate number of polarities and polarity members automatically. In addition, effective model initialization techniques will be investigated to produce high quality multi-polarization results. Acknowledgements.
