 long time. MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) has been used to map non-controlled vocabulary to controlled vocabulary: i.e. mapping synonymous or related terms (En-try terms) to standard terms (Subject Headings) [1]. It is a thesaurus which groups all the medical terms with the same meanings into one concept and provides the hierar-chy of the concepts. 
Korean MeSH (hereafter K-MeSH) has been developed as a translation of MeSH and variations. It can be used for indexing Korean medical documents [3, 4]. One of the problems in developing K-MeSH is translating the English terms and gathering synonym lists. Because one English term can be translated into many different Korean terms, finding corresponding translations is the same as gathering a synonym list for the word. 
In this paper, we propose a method to extract translation pairs from the English phrase used in the parentheses and in the keyword field in Korean medical docu-guage within parentheses; for the document retrieval of foreigners, English keywords are used in keyword fields and their corresponding Korean words usually appear in the abstract texts. 
Bilingual alignment methods are used for the large size of corpus to extract auto-matically translation word pairs. There are many approaches for the alignment; a pure spelling similarity in the same language family [9] and so on. 
Because the alignment of the translation pairs enclosed within parentheses or in keyword fields is limited to a sentence or a few paragraphs, a pure statistical approach, and English words. For the unregistered terms, approximate phrase matching method is Korean words, and partial matching probability for compound words. 2.1 Parentheses Translation Pair Extraction The phrase enclosed within parentheses is used for various purposes. We focus on the case in which the phrase is used to represent the same meaning in different language, either English or Korean, in this paper. We define English phrases as EP and Korean phrases as KP. Either EP or KP may be enclosed within parentheses. Figure 1 shows an example of the KP(EP) case, where  X   X  is the translation of  X  X egenerative X ,  X   X  is that of  X  X rain X  and  X   X  is that of  X  X isorder X . In order to extract the translation pairs, the translation relation between EP and KP should be recognized first. Matching EP with KP is not always direct even though we proximate phrase matching is needed, which is described in section 3. In case of open parenthesis. The cut position is the point that makes the maximum probability of APM (approximate phrase match) between KP and EP. If the probability of APM is translation pair. In case of EP(KP), finding the cut position is relatively easy because acronyms, it should be removed in the preprocessing step. 2.2 Keyword Translation Pair Extraction Keyword translation pairs can be extracted by using as a sub-method the parentheses put temporarily the English keyword, EP, into every word in the abstract and find the best matching KP among all possible KP candidates. Because Korean is an agglutina-tive language and Korean phrases are actually noun phrases, EP should be inserted Figure 2 shows some hypothetical insertion points to find the keyword translation pair. If no noun part is found in a word phrase, the approximate phrase matching skips to the next word phrase. 3.1 Word Matching Probability words and the translation words in the documents are matched with one entry word and one of the corresponding translation words in the dictionary, the probability is 1. Otherwise, it is 0. 
In reality, a bilingual dictionary does not include all the translation words used in documents. In order to solve the unregistered translation word problem, syllable simi-larity and phonetic similarity are used. Syllable similarity is to match lexically similar words, which are usually similar in meaning. For Korean translation words, word over the number of unique syllables in two words. Phonetic similarity between two words can be learned from English-Korean transliteration word pairs. Each English word and Korean transliteration can be divided into pronunciation units, and the units [11, 12]. 3.2 Compound Word Match Probability While the spacing in English text is relatively firm, a Korean compound noun can be spaced in many ways. Therefore, one Korean compound word can be partially matched with one English word. We propose a compound word partial matching method as a sub-method for approximate phrase match. It is calculated by the match-ing probability between an English word and a subpart of a Korean word. The match-ing probability is calculated with both syllable similarity and phonetic similarity, and the partial matching is reflected by the weight factor  X  where 0  X   X   X  1. Formula (1)  X   X  (cakepmeymoli) are given to match, all possible substrings of KP are generated and are tried to match with  X  X orking X ; they are  X   X ,  X   X ,  X ,  X   X ,  X   X ,  X   X ,  X   X   X   X  ...  X   X , and  X   X . SSIM(E, K) is syllable similarity between E and K. PSIM(E, K) is phonetic similarity between E and K. 3.3 Approximate Phrase Match Probability The phrases, EP and KP, are composed of a word or several words. The alignment of the words is not always 1:1 and it can be across [5]. For the calculation of alignment probability, we borrowed the idea of Model 2 in [8], which simply uses both lengths of the phrases and positions of the corresponding word pairs. The approximate phrase compound word match probability multiplied by the alignment probability. The for-mula is in (2). penalty for unmatched K i and k is the number of the unmatched K i . The experiment was done against a set of medical article summaries within home doctoring field, extracted from a Korean medical database (KMBASE) [2]. For the evaluation, 100 summaries from the collection were tested. A medical multilingual dictionary for Korean, English and Japanese, was used as a base dictionary, which was compiled from a Korean medical terminology dictionary [13] with about 14,900 transliteration probability calculation, we used the 1,500 English-Korean translitera-tion pairs used in [11]. And for the calculation of alignment probability shown in (2), we extracted the training data from 100 summaries in KMBASE. 
We used 2 evaluation criteria: 1. Exact Extraction (EE), which counts only the ex-actly matching pairs, 2. Recognition of Pairs (RP), which counts both Exact Extrac-tion and other translation pairs extracted with incorrect cut position. The measures are recall, precision and f-measure that combine recall and precision equally weighted. As a baseline method, we used dictionary matching for the component words matching in phrases. 
The parameters are approximately optimized by trying every 0.1 intervals for best performance. The parameters, however, were not so sensitive in this experiment. The the result of keyword translation pair extraction (KTP extraction). The baseline method was very low in both results. That means the entry words, both English and its performance was much better. The EE of KTP extraction is much lower than that of PTP extraction, but the RP of KTP extraction is close to the RP of PTP. The perform-ance of PTP is better than that of KTP; KTP has more possibility to match incorrectly every possible phrase in the text while PTP searches only the word sequences in front of parentheses. We have presented an approximate phrase match method to recognize and extract translation phrases from English phrases enclosed within parentheses or in keyword approximate phrase match method improved significantly the performance of transla-tion pair compilation, because it handles unregistered translation words by combining syllable similarity, phonetic similarity, and a compound word partial matching method. The method can be used not only for medical translations but also for other general field translations.
