 In information retrieval, it is not easy for users to recollect appropriate query terms to obtain retrieval results that u sers expected. Thoug halotofinforma-tion recommendation system have been pr oposed, the recommendation for users who want to find out novel information o r unexpected relativity between docu-ments is quite difficult. Additionally in r ecent years, there are users who retrieve documents on the Web without having a clear search request. It might be not irrelevant to daily use of the search engine and the expansion of use from a cell phones that has only poor input method.

In a community that composed by users who reside in certain regions or who interests to something special, e.g. weblogs, BBS, and mailing lists, the word that runs only among companions tends to be multiused, and the content is not understood easily for an outside user.

To deal with those problem, a new approach like exploratory search is needed 1. Navigation is one of the methods of bringing users a new retrieval experience without demanding a specified input.

We propose a web navigation system t hat aims to access various documents by the small distance. In the previous r esearch, the existence of the network that can be able to reach various nodes in the small distance, called small-world network, is known 2. The small-world character is defined as the case that average path length( L ) is almost equal, and that average clustering coefficient( C )isvery large, comparing with random graph that has equal number of nodes and links. In recent study, it is clarified that the co -occurrence word graph in the document collection shows a sma ll-world character 3.

The proposal system applies this character. To make the user reachable to various documents in just a small distan ce, our method generates small-world network that consists of hyperlinks be tween each document and related docu-ments, each keyword and related keywords, and each document and each key-word. And we show the effectiveness of t he method in exploratory search by the experiment with subjects.

In this paperCwe describe our aproach in section 2, experiment and evaluation in section 3, and conclude. There is a problem that is difficult to sp ecify an appropriate retrieval word by users themselves. To deal with this problem, a number of query expantion systems was proposed. However, it is still difficult for users who didn X  X  choose the apt word to select the apt word from among words that the system presents. In addition, if user X  X  query is vaguer, the recommendation becomes harder. On the other hand, being classified as expected by user is rare in topic clustering systems because overlaps of each topic expressed in documents are large, and it extends over two or more classifications usually. So, we propose a navigation system to present relation of those over lapped topics as a small-world network based on co-occurence words graph of documents.

The proposed system has following advantages: 1. Because only the amount of characteristic observed within document set is 2. By enabling to transit between related documents tied by co-occurence words 3. The system presents only some hyperlinks for the item that user focused. The system is intelligent in that it can automatically mine the network of co-occurring words and construct the navigation network based on only features that the document set has. Then we describe about each processing on our system along the flow shown in Fig.1. 2.1 Extraction and Classification of Keywords In the proposed system, character strings that might be keyword are divided in every turn of the kind of characters (e.g. Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana), and they are filtered with their repetit ion level and document frequency.
Index terms are extracted by morphological analysis g enerally, but it is needed to deal with unknown words or complex words. We gave priority to being able to extract keywords stably rather than precisely because we are trying to apply the proposal system to documents like weblogs in which unknown words and complex words occur frequently.

In Japanese text, the words expressing concept, operation, or relation are often written in Kanji, Katakana, and alphanumeric characters. This system extracts the character string that consists of Kanji and Katakana characters or of alphanumeric characters and assumes them as keyword. But, the string that can be interpreted as a URL, or that c onsists only of numeric characters is excluded. The string that consists of only one Kanji or Katakana character or only two or less alphanumeric c haracters are excluded, too.

Although the pointed measures (like tf i df )thatsiftoutafew X  X op X  X erms has been used to extract index terms in traditional information retrieval, in the web navigation that intends to exploratory comprehension, comprehensive words (the words that leads exhaustive search results) have to be able to extract independently from specific words (the words that identifies topic or concept). For that reason, it is appropriate in weighting terms to use the index that shows the amount of characteristic of each word as directly as possible.

In this system, we use document frequency ( df ) and repetition index (adap-tation) of terms often used in extractio n of technical terms 4 or automatic sum-marization 5 that is not intended to narrow the retrieval result. Especially, it is known that the repetition index has strong relation with whether it is con-tent word 6. In this paper, we use the repetition index that is shown as the formula (1). df ( t ) means the number of documents where word t appears once or more. df 2 ( t ) means the number of documents where word t appears twice or more.
 The proposal system classifies the extra cted keywords into four divisions by the range of each value indicated in Table 1.  X  X pecific words X  is useful to tie local related documents.  X  X omprehensive words X  is useful to bridge between topics that have unexpected relation.  X  X order words X  is vaguer than previous two, but it have the level of repetetion index that shouldn X  X  be disregarded.  X  X ther words X  is all of the rest. Though it is thought that these roles are originally distributed continuous and have overlap, but to simplify implementation, the overlap of division is not considered in this paper.

Then, a phased score is given to each wor d. The experimental system uses the threshold and the score that is shown in the table. 2.2 Generation of Hyperlinks The proposal navigation system gener ates hyperlinks between each keyword, each document, and between keywords and documents by using the co-occurrence and the score given to each word.
 First, the hyperlink between documents is generated by following methods. All documents including any words that co-occurs between the base document that becomes a starting point of navigation are assumed as the candidate of related document. The rank of each rel ated document is decided according to sum of scores co-occurred words have. The relation level of each document is calculated by the formula (2). d is a base document. d j is a related document. r ( d i ,d j ) is the level of relation is the score of t k . Related level r is calculated about all the related documents in which one or more words co-occurred with the base document d i . The system generates constant number of hyperlinks from d i to d j that r is high. In the experimental system, 8 or less hyperlinks are generated within 20% of all related documents per base document. This number was decided in consideration of the visibility for users.
Next, the hyperlink between keywords is generated by following methods. The relation level of each word is calculated by the formula (3). t score of t k . Related level r is calculated about all the r elated words that appears in one or more documents in D i . The system generates constant number of hyperlinks from t i to t k that r is high. In the experimental system, 8 or less hyperlinks are generated within 20% of all related words per base word.
Finally, the hyperlink between documents and keywords is generated by fol-lowing methods. In generating the hyperlink from document to keyword, all words that occurs in the base document are assumed as the candidate of key-word for transit to another document. The importance level of each keyword is decided according to sum of the score of the word and its document frequency. the level of relation between t i and t k . D i is documents in which t i appears. The keyword is acquired from T i in order of division I, II, III, and IV. The keywords of division I are sorted in the descending order of df , and the keywords of other division are sorted in the ascending order of df . The system generates constant number of hyperlinks from t i to t k that is early in the order. In the experimental system, 8 or less hyperlinks are generated within 20% of all keywords per base document.

Then, in generating the hyperlink fro m keyword to document, the importance level of each document is calculated by the formula (4).
 t is a base word. D j = { d 1 , ... ,d m } is documents in which t i appears. T j = { t 1 , ... ,t n score of d j . w k is the score of t k . Importance level S is calculated about all documents in D j . The system generates constant number of hyperlinks from t to d j that S is high. In the experimental system, 8 or less hyperlinks are generated within 20% of all documents per base word.

As a result, the network that has the nodes consists from documents and keywords and has hyperlinks between each document and each keyword is generated. 2.3 Presenting Related Items The proposal system presents related do cuments and keywords according to the context of the retrieval by users.

Related words are presented for a document or a word that user focused, and related documents are presented for a document or a word that user focused. Related words are also presented for a document that is related to a word that user focused.
Figure 2(a) shows a example of presenting related items for a word that user focused. In this screen, related words and articles to the keyword  X  X 157 X  are presented. Some keywords that relate to presented articles are also presented at the same time. Users reach this scr een by a click of green hyperlink that is related words from current word or article.

Figure 2(b) shows a example of presenting related items for a document that user focused. An individual article is displayed. Some keywords that relate to this article are presented under the subject. Some related articles are presented under the text. In this system, 8 keywords or articles are presented in maximums. 3.1 Dataset In this experiment, 7,770 news articles on the economic pages of  X  X he Asahi Shimbun X  in 1996 were used as a document set. The number of keywords that the system had extracted was 20,103. The system had generated 61,987 of arcs between documents, 158,251 arcs between words, and 366,126 arcs between doc-uments and words. It is confirmed that the network that consists of these arcs is a small-world structure by our previous work 7. 3.2 Problems and Evaluation Method It is the purpose of this study to verify effectiveness of the navigation system in exploratory search.

We got four cooperators for this experiment, had them impose a retrieval task, and do the search that used the proposal system. The task is  X  X iscover articles about commodities or services that sales increased because of influence of O157 X . This means that the testees have to find out the unexpected articles while articles that sales fell occupied th e great number. Additionally, it was not explained that  X  X 157 X  is a Escherichia coli.

We prepared the relevant document set for this experiment by following method. We judged relevance of 68 articles that include the word of  X  X 157 X ,  X  X ood poisoning X ,  X  X nti-bacterium X , or  X  X in X (one Japanese Kanji character that means bacilli). Table 2 is list of relevant documents. Higher score is given to documents that are unexpected or harder to find. Whether to find the article easily is judged from whether the keyw ord appear in title or first sentence. 3.3 Experimental System The proposal system and the baseline system were used for the experiment. Table 3 shows functions that each system has.

The usage of each function is shown in table 4. On the proposal system,  X  X etrieve X  is frequently requested by user A, and  X  X rchive X  is by user C. All users never requested  X  X eywords X . On the baselin e system,  X  X etrieve X  has the majority. The most of  X  X etrieve X  is requested by user B. 3.4 Results Table 5 is shown statistics of user X  X  behavior. The number is the one of distinct documents. d(rel)/trial sh ows the efficiency of the retrieval per trial frequency. s(rel)/trial shows it of considering the relevance score. The efficiency in proposal system roughly exceeds in baseline syste m. Especially, difference of user D is large.

User A and B used in order of proposal system and baseline system, while user C and D used in order of baseline system and proposal system. It entrusted to the user X  X  judgment how long time is spent on each task. The proposal system has the navigation, and the baseline system doesn X  X  have it. Four testees (from A to D) use both proposal system and baseline system alternately.

Figure 3 shows F-measure in each trial point of two remarkable users. Al-though F-measure is used as an index that shows efficiency of search engines usually, we are using it as an index that shows the efficiency of user X  X  search behavior in this paper. Invariable points mean display of inrelevant document or retrieval result, or return to article that has already been browsed. Decreas-ing points mean that user accessed distinc t but inrelevant document. In proposal system, standing up is early. In baseline s ystem, to exceed proposal system, time and a lot of long trials were required. User B (on baseline system) had needed 6.25 times of trials to reach same level as user C (on proposal system).
Figure 4(a), 4(b) shows transition route of users. The following special tran-sitions by using the navigation were observed in the proposal system. 1. Transition in ralated words (from word to word) 2. Approaching to relevant documents gradually (shuttling in word and docu-3. Transition between related articles (from document to document) Figure 4(a) shows transition route of user D on proposal system. The user ap-proached relevant documents by using sev en keywords presented by system. The relevant documents that user approached by using the navigation is bordered by boxes, and selected words is bordered by circles.

Figure 4(b) shows transition route of user B on baseline system. The user only shuttles between  X  X etrieve X  function and individual article because the baseline system doesn X  X  have the navigation function. It is demand that the user prepares a different query whenever failing in the retrieval.

Table 6 is shown precision, recall, an d F-measure of each user. On the av-erage, F-measure in proposal system ex ceeded in baseline system. Especially, it is remarkable raising the value of user D to an average level. User A and B are previously using proposal system. The possibility that F-measure of them in baseline system has risen because they retrieve with understanding important keywords is thought. In this paper, we proposed a web navigation system called  X  X -node X  that enables users to transit related words or documents effciently. The system offers users an average search experience using small-wo rld navigation network that consists of constant number of hyperlinks. We showed in the experiment that users viewed more documents in less time by proposal system than by baseline system.
