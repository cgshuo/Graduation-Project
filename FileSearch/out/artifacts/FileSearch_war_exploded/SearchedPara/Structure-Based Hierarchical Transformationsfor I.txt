 It can be difficult to understand and interpret data mining results. One of the goals of visual mining is to combine visual and analytic approaches to give users the ability to manipulate the data and better understand the data space. When investigating large social networks, a need exists to identify common structures in the network. For example, if we know that an individual in the network has an important role in the network, we may be interested in finding others that play a similar role in the network. The role may be based on relationships to others in the network (one or more graph invariants), as well as on features of the individual.

In this paper, we propose an alternative view of traditional social networks based on hierarchies that support the exploration goals of visual data mining. While hierarchies have been used extensively for visualization of  X  X op down X  se-mantic relationships, they have not been used to identify structural similarity based on node expansion within social networks. The hierarchical visualization clusters or group together nodes with similar structural properties in the net-work. It is a complement to traditional network visualization and gives users the ability to quickly understand how structure is distributed throughout the net-work. Further, the structural similarity is based on a node X  X  view of the entire network, not just it relationship to its immediate neighbors. We will illustrate that determining this structural similarity using the traditional graph view is a complicated visual exploration task, particularly if the network contains more than a handful of nodes. By considering a complementary hierarchical view of the network, the similarities are more apparent to the user.

There are a number of important benefits to these hierarchies including a easily interpretable clustering based on expansion vectors of structural properties associated with network nodes, a simple construction algorithm, and interactive exploration using both a hierarchical and a traditional graph representation of the social network. Finally, the contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we introduce a novel network structure-based hierarchical transformation of a graph that is based on expansion vectors. Second, we demonstrate the utility of this transformation by using it within a visual mining tool to explore real world social networks.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 begins with a motivating example and background that describes when our hierarchical transformation is benefi-cial for analysis. We describe the hierarchy semantics and clusters in section 3. Section 4 presents a brief visual mining case study using the Invenio network mining software. Finally, Section 5 presents conclusions and final observations. 2.1 Social Network Graph Models When analyzing social networks, both attribute data and relationship data are important for gaining insight about the dynamics or patterns within the network. Examples of social networks include blog networks, email networks, disease trans-mission networks, and communication networks. Typically, a social network is modeled as a graph, G =( V, E ). Here, the actors are represented as a set of n vertices or nodes, V = { v 1 ,v 2 , ...v n } , and the relationships between actors are represented as m edges or links between the nodes, E = { ( v i ,v j ) | v i, v j  X  V, i = j, i  X  n, j  X  n } . While we can use hierarchical transformations on multi-mode graphs with multiple node types, we will focus our discussion on uni-mode networks with a single node type.

We further extend this representation to include attributes or features asso-ciated with each actor or rel ationship. If we consider V to be a relation and each node in V to be an instance of a tuple, then we can specify the relation as associated with each node in V . We will refer to this attribute data as semantic content since it is domain specific. Similarl y, we can specify a set of attributes for the edges E ,where E is an associative relation. Here, E = { e id ,b 2 ,...,b l } and each edge is an instance of a tuple in E .

We will refer to social network measures or graph invariants that are calculated using the topology of the network as structural properties .Somewellknown centrality structural properties include: (1) Degree degree ( a ego )-thenumberof nodes directly connected to a ego . (2) Betweenness between ( a ego )-thenumber of shortest geodesic paths that pass through a ego . (3) Eigenvector ev ( a ego )-The number of  X  X mportant X  nodes connected to a ego is used to measure the importance of a ego . We refer you to Wassermann and Faus t for a detailed discussion of these and other centrality social network metrics [5].
 2.2 Expansion Values for Centrality Measures One extension of any centrality measure is to take the average value of the measure for all the nodes in the network. Instead, we investigate a different extension we call expansion . Informally, expansion is a node X  X  view of the network at different distances. The view is based on the calculation of some centrality measure of a node and its neighbors. The node has a value for the measure, the node X  X  neighbors have a value of the measure, the neighbor X  X  neighbors have a value of the measure, etc. Expansion aggregates this measure for all the neighbors at a particular distance from the node to create a vector of centrality values.
To make our discussion more concrete, we will focus on a particular expan-sion value, hop expansion , an expansion vector for node degree. The centrality measures previously described give little insight into the connectivity patterns or landscape of subgraphs in the network. The landscape can be seen more easily using the hop expansion measure because it is not a single scalar value, but a vector of values. For hop expansion, it is a measure of the number of nodes at different distances from a particular node, a ego . We refer to the evaluation of a centrality measure at different distan ces from each node in the network as an expansion vector .
 Definition 1. The  X  -hop level of a node a ego is the set of nodes N  X  ( a ego )= { v 1 , ..., v j has length  X  .Formally, We refer to the size of this set as a node X  X  hop degree, H  X  ( a ego ) ,where H (  X , H  X  ( a ego )) for all hop levels up to the diameter of the network: This measure shows us the hop expansion for a node in the network. Each element in the vector is a pair of values, the hop level and the hop degree. Hop expansion is an extension of degree and gives insight about the network connectivity of the entire graph from a si ngle nodes perspective. This measure captures the influence of other nodes on a ego .Is a ego surrounded by a tightly bound network (characterized by early large values) or does it go through several medium increases?
The vector for each node contains up to diam ( G ) elements, the diameter of the network. It has been shown that the degree distribution of social networks is not random. Instead, many large graphs, including the web, follow a power law distribution and have a small diameter ( 50) [1]. Therefore, the size of H ( a ego ) is small relative to the size of the network. Also, the calculation is straightforward and can be completed by calculating all-pairs shortest path. We are investigating alternative heuristics for this sparse data set. Definition 2. The hierarchical transformation approximation G  X  is based on the set of hop expansion vectors for every node in the network, G .Formally, G  X  = { H ( v G  X  is the set of hop expansion values for every node in G . This transformation is potentially very powerful. We will use thi s new representation as a way to create hierarchies of the original network. We note, that while we have illustrated the concept of  X  X xpansion X  using  X  X op expansi on X , any centrality measure can be used as the basis for the expansion vector. If t he centrality measure is a real value, then rounding and/or binning ranges of values is an option. 2.3 Motivation Traditional visual analytics tools let us filter this network based on attribute val-ues or centrality measure, e.g. display nodes with degree greater than 3. While this provides some insight, we are still not able to readily identify nodes with structural similarity based on a node X  X   X  X iew X  of the other nodes in the net-work. If instead we had a rooted graph approximation that contained centrality aggregate values for neighborhoods a particular distance away, nodes with the same expansion vectors could be represented as the leaves of the same branches of a tree. With this structural similarity information clearly illustrated, social scientists can investigate questions such as:  X  How do nodes with the most influence compare structurally and semanti- X  How does information propagate through the network?  X  Do nodes with a similar structural position have similar attribute values?  X  How diverse is the structural landscape of the network?
Therefore, in this paper, we propose giving users the ability to create hier-archical transformations of the original network based on structural properties of the nodes in the network. Each level of the hierarchy approximates a level of neighborhood structural information. For example, suppose that we build a hierarchy based on the hop expansion values of each node in the network. If two nodes have the same hop expansion vector, then their overall view of the network is similar, e.g. the two nodes have the same number of neighbors; their neighbors have the same number of neighbors; their neighbor X  X  neighbors have the same number of neighbors, etc. Using this information, sociologists can then compare these nodes semantically by coloring ba sed on attribute value(s). They can also use this information to help identify potential similar community clusters in the network. When investigating large social networks , a need exists to iden tify common struc-tures in the network. We accomplish this by transforming the traditional node and edge graph representation to another meaningful structure, hierarchies that approximate a structural property in the network. However, unlike the hier-archies proposed in previous literature [3], these structural hierarchies take a traditional network structural property, e.g. degree, and show the expansion of that property across the network, where expansion is defined in Section 2. These hierarchies can be viewed as path prefix t rees containing ego network structure vectors for each node in the network.

Once the hierarchy is built, nodes with similar structural properties are chil-dren of the same branches. Each level of the hierarchy maps to a distance level  X  for the actors in G . Each node label in the hierarchy corresponds to a hop degree, H  X  , of one or more nodes in G . The value associated with each key in the tree is the number of nodes in the social network with the prefix.
We will now go through an example for hop expansion of the toy social network illustrated in Figure 1. In that network, there are 5 nodes. The hop expansion Figure 1 shows the hierarchy for our example graph. For clarity of the example, we show the node label mapping to the hop expansion vectors in the hierarchy in the hierarchy, p = 2. Each node in the hierarchy contains the number of nodes with the prefix hop expansion vector. Also, since the network contains a single connected component, the sum of key values for each path from the root to a leaf node is n  X  1. For our example, the sum of each path is 4.

For this example, nodes A, D, and E have the same structural hop expansion vector. This means that nodes A, D, and E connect to the same number of nodes and their respective neighbors also connect to the same number of nodes. Therefore, A, D, and E are said to have the same  X  X op expansion X  position in the network. For this case study, we used a coauthorship network of scientists studying net-works. The data set was created in 2006 and contains 1589 scientists and 2742 edges [2]. The network is shown in Figure 3 on the left size of the window using the Invenio visual mining interface [4]. Invenio is a visual mining tool for interac-tive exploration of social networks. To incorporate the hierarchical transforma-tion, we implemented a dual screen that allows a user to explore the hierarchical representation and see the results of the exploration on the full social network.
Using the traditional social network graph layout, we can highlight nodes with certain degree values. We then select the n odes of interest to us of a particular degree. At that stage, we can look at the neighborhoods of our neighbors and see how they compare. This process can co ntinue iteratively until we feel that the view of the network is similar for the nodes being analyzed.

The process of analysis using hierarchical transforms begins with the user selecting an option to build a hierarchical transform of the graph using expansion values. The user then selects the structural measure that will be used for the transformation and the maximum distance of interest. The tool then uses the selections, generates an expansion vector and places each node in the hierarchy based on the vector values. We use a classical tree layout where children nodes are positioned below th eir common ancestor.

The screen is then split so that both the hierarchy and the original network can be seen. Initially, only the root of the structural hierarchy is expanded. Then the user can focus on different parts of the hierarchy by selecting them and seeing where the nodes are in the original graph. For this example, we follow one branch multiple levels and then highlight the nodes in the original graph as shown in Figure 2. The larger nodes in the original graph correspond to the nodes with the shown expansion subbranch. We see that the nodes with expansion vector 3and3in G  X  appear in different parts of the full network G . A sociologist can use this as evidence that like regions or structural redundancy exist in different areas on the network. Various  X  X acro X  le vel pieces of informat ion can be gathered from the hierarchy. For example, if the different branches of the hierarchy have similar hop expansion values, then information flow is relatively even thoughout the network. Hierarchies have been used to analyze net works containing parent child rela-tionships. Here, we consider using hierarchies to understand the structural re-lationship that exists among actors in traditional social networks. We build the hierarchy based on graph invariants of different actors or nodes in the network. We are then able to easily identify like structures across a network.
There are a number of future extensions including merging branches next to each other to create larger bins of similar nodes and incorporating attribute semantics into the hierarchy expansion process.
