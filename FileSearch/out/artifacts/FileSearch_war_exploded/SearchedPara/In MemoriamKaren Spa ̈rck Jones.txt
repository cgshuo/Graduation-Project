The death of Karen Spa  X  rck Jones in April 2007, a leading figure in at least two research fields, was a sad loss to the world.

Since 1991 she was a member of the Editorial Board of Information Processing and Management. Over the years she published significant articles in this journal, the last one appearing in this issue. Research beginnings
Karen X  X  research career was based entirely in Cambridge (the UK one). It began when, shortly after com-pleting her degree there, she joined the Cambridge Language Research Unit, run by Margaret Masterman, and started her PhD. The CLRU was something of an unusual organization. It was funded in part by the
US National Science Foundation in the days when the NSF was able to fund research outside the US, but it had no official affiliation with Cambridge University (or with any other institution): the University had no time for such an oddball institute, or indeed for such an oddball subject.

The initial academic home for Karen X  X  research was Philosophy, which she had studied in her last year as an undergraduate. The title of her PhD thesis, Synonymy and Semantic Classification (1964), might indeed have represented a dry philosophical treatise, devoid of pragmatic implications. However, this was far from the case; when eventually, twenty-two years later, it was published as a book ( Spa  X  rck Jones, 1986 ), it was recog-nised as a seminal step in the developing treatment of language as a computational object, and the developing understanding of the potential of combining statistical analysis of corpora with more traditional linguistic methods.
 Computation at the CLRU in the early 1960s was restricted to a Hollerith punched-card system, which
Karen used for an analysis of Roget X  X  Thesaurus. However, Karen had married Roger Needham in 1958, and this gave some unofficial access to the EDSAC II computer system in the then Mathematical (later Com-puter) Laboratory of the University. Thus she began to perform computational experiments based on her ideas. In 1965, she obtained a research fellowship at one of the Cambridge colleges, and in 1968 a prestigious
Royal Society funded research fellowship in the Mathematical Laboratory. By 1965 she was also running her own experiments on the next generation machine, the Titan.

In 1966, the second Cranfield project was completed. This was the project which first established the current dominant notion of an experiment in information retrieval  X  a collection of documents, a set of queries, human relevance judgements, and a range of measures to represent the ability of a system to identify the relevant documents. Karen recognised very early the importance and usefulness of such experimental raw material, the more particularly because she was not in a position to generate it herself. She made extensive use of the Cranfield collection for experiments in the very late 1960s and early 1970s, mainly for testing the term clustering ideas that had arisen from her thesis, combined with the theory of clumps of which Roger had been one of the authors.

These clustering experiments seemed to reveal benefits of certain carefully chosen term clustering methods, and formed the basis for the book Automatic Keyword Classification (1971) . However, later work with other test corpora cast doubt on this analysis  X  and at the same time reinforced Karen X  X  interest both in the exper-imental approach to IR and in the detail of experimental methods and materials. She was to carry this interest with her, and take it into many other areas, for the rest of her research life.
 Core information retrieval
Around this time she also became interested in very simple term weighting techniques. Her idf paper of 1972 ( Spa  X  rck Jones, 1972 ), which remains one of the most highly cited papers in the field, is the classic exam-ple. Salton X  X  group at Cornell were already using tf (within-document term frequency) in their vector space system; the tf * idf combination became the most common default weighting scheme for many years. Idf also led on to the relevance weighting ideas, based on a probabilistic model, developed with Robertson in the mid-dle 1970s ( Spa  X  rck Jones &amp; Robertson, 1976 ) (no tf here  X  the model was based on term presence X  X bsence only). A series of well-founded experimental investigations of term weighting followed.

But the issue of the availability of high-quality test corpora began to loom large. The middle seventies also saw an attempt by a consortium of UK-based researchers, led by Karen, to elucidate suitable criteria and methods for the development of a new  X  X deal X  test collection, one designed not just for a single experiment (as had been the norm), but as a tool to support all kinds of foreseeable experimental research in IR. The quotes around  X  X deal X  were there from the beginning, not as a characterization of what might be achievable, but as an aspiration. (We might compare the TREC Million Query track, which at the time of writing is using 10,000 queries!)
Karen (with van Rijsbergen and others) produced a basic design for the  X  X deal X  collection, and also did some careful work on a number of important details, such as the pooling technique for obtaining relevance judge-costing was also made. However, the financial support available for IR research in the UK in the late seventies was insufficient to set the project in motion, and the proposals went on the shelf for more than a decade. Karen then masterminded (and wrote two of) a collection of papers on the subject of experimental research in IR, which was published in 1981 as Information Retrieval Experiment ( Spa  X  rck Jones, 1981 ). This was, and remained until the publication of a book on TREC in 2005 (to which she also contributed), arguably the only book devoted primarily to experimental method in the field.
 Natural language processing
The 1980s saw Karen diversifying somewhat her research interests, in particular going into other areas of natural language processing (NLP). As always with Karen this was stimulated by real interest in research problems in those areas, but perhaps also there was a slight feeling of disappointment with the state of the IR field.

Karen began a programme of work spanning summarising, question answering, NL querying for databases and also component technologies, especially parsing and generation. She was greatly influential in the Strate-gic UK Alvey Research Programme, initiating an  X  X  X ntelligent Knowledge-Based Systems X  X  theme, in which
NLP found a place. In turn this led to the production of the integrated suite of Alvey Natural Language Pro-cessing Tools and helped move NLP research on from individual researchers doing toy experiments to one in which large scale efforts predominate by exploitation of existing tools and resources is critical.
However, the most lasting influence of this period of work may well come to be seen to be the book Karen produced with Julia Galliers ( Spa  X  rck Jones &amp; Galliers, 1996 ) which continues to be the framework within which most empirical NLP work is discussed. The big experiments
In late 1991, The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) was announced. This was the  X  X deal X  test collection writ large, and with serious US funding. The  X  X deal X  test collection reports had been taken off the shelf and dusted down, and Karen X  X  work of the middle 70s finally came to fruition. This had the effect of reviving
Karen X  X  enthusiasm for IR, and she got involved in TREC in a number of ways. She was an informal advisor to the organisers during the first TREC, and became a member of the programme committee in TREC-2. She also advised the City University (Okapi) team which participated in all the early TRECs. This last enabled her to contribute to the work on the BM25 term weighting function, which was the next stage in the probabilistic model work started in the 1970s, and resulted in a major two-part paper in 2000 ( Spa  X  rck Jones, Walker, &amp;
Robertson, 2000 ). Characteristically for Karen, this paper was a retrospective review of the development of the model and the resulting weighting schemes, but reporting an entirely new set of experiments using the far better test data now available from TREC.

Karen also took part with Cambridge colleagues in the TREC track devoted to retrieving spoken docu-ments, based on combining speech recognition with text retrieval. But perhaps her most significant contribu-tion to TREC was a wonderful series of summary performance comparisons and  X  X  X eflections on TREC X  X , in which she attempted to extract broad lessons from the multitude of disparate results reported by TREC par-ticipants. The last of these appears in the TREC book already mentioned ( Spa  X  rck Jones, 2005 ).
Both Karen X  X  interests in Natural Language and Information Processing (her terminology), and her exper-imental bias, came together strongly in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC), the core task of which is summarisation. Karen was closely involved in DUC from its beginning in 2000, and just shortly be-fore she died completed a substantial review paper on the state of the art of automatic summarisation ( Spa  X  rck Jones, 2007 ).
 Karen the person
Karen married Roger Needham in 1958, and they built a house together, from scratch  X  while living in a caravan on the building site and also working on their respective PhDs. Later they restored and sailed boats on the East Coast of England, in particular an 1872 Itchen Ferry Cutter, Fanny of Cowes . Karen was an accomplished sketcher, and created many other kinds of art objects. One might find her in strange cities sketching some architectural detail which took her fancy. She enthusiastically read about the history, art and architecture of any place she was going to visit.

She took seriously her responsibilities as a prominent figure in her various fields of research and profes-sional endeavour, and in particular as a prominent woman. She said  X  X  X omputing is too important to be left to men X  X , and encouraged, supported, and promoted the interests of women in the computer and information sciences. She was frequently asked by public bodies to join committees or take on other responsibilities, and when she did accept, it was always (despite occasional frustration with the ways of public bodies) with a whole-hearted commitment to some significant end. In the early 1990s she was quite heavily involved in the
Association for Computational Linguistics, serving as president in 1994. In the UK she was a Fellow of the British Academy  X  somewhat unusually for a computer scientist, since the BA is a scholarly body for the arts. Frequently, she ended up as the driving force behind some official initiative  X  applying the same energy and enthusiasm as she showed towards everything else in her life.
