 Abstract Dependency grammar is considered appropriate for many Indian lan-language. We have categorized these relations in three different levels, namely levels is further categorized and an annotation scheme has been developed. Both syntactic and semantic features have been taken into consideration for describing the relations. In our scheme, there are 63 such syntactico X  X emantic relations. We have verified the scheme by tagging a corpus of 4167 Bangla sentences to create a treebank (KGPBenTreebank).
 Keywords Dependency structure Syntactico X  X emantic relation Paninian karak Modern Bangla grammar and language 1 Introduction In this paper, we present a dependency annotation scheme for Bangla language. The relations are prepared taking into account modern grammatical and language structures of Bangla mostly studied from Chatterji ( 2003 ) and the dependency relations used in other Indian languages like Hindi and Urdu (Sharma et al. 2007 ; Bhatt et al. 2009 ). Most of these existing Indian language treebanks follow Paninian grammatical model which is discussed in Bharati et al. ( 1999 ).

By observing these grammatical models and dependency relations, we have tried The relations are described by the syntactic and semantic features occurring between the words.

In Bangla, syntax is not a strong aspect in identifying the relations. This is because the word order in Bangla sentences are relatively less rigid and suffixes and considered a balance of syntactic and semantic features to define the Bangla dependency grammar.

Computational processing for Bangla is challenging because of the scarcity of annotated resources. In the absence of treebank of Bangla the work of parsing and some other studies which could have helped in machine translation, question answering, etc. have been hindered.

Different grammars have been advocated for building treebanks in different languages like phrase structure grammar [in Penn Treebank Marcus et al. ( 1993 )] and dependency grammar [in Prague Dependency Treebank Hajic  X  et al. ( 1996 )]. We have used a dependency grammar based scheme to build a treebank of Bangla sentences. The scheme has been evolved by studying carefully the corpus considered for annotation (4167 Bangla sentences) as well as other corpus. The treebank created for these 4167 Bangla sentences is referred to as KGPBenTreebank 1 .

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Some related work has been discussed in Sect. 2 . In Sect. 3 , we have discussed some assumptions used to define the scheme and in building the KGPBenTreebank. The relation set of the scheme have been categorized and defined in Sects. 4 and 5 , respectively. In Sect. 6 , we have analyzed relations in KGPBenTreebank and Anncorra. Finally, Sect. 8 contains the conclusion. See  X  X ppendix 1  X  for the comprehensive dependency relationship set of the scheme. In the paper, examples are written in  X  X  X ndian languages TRANSliteration X  X  ( itrans ) Chopde ( 2000 ) encoding and the mappings of the itrans encoding with glyphs in the Bangla and Hindi scripts are shown in  X  X ppendix 2  X . Each example contains a Bangla sentence followed by the gloss and translation in English. Glosses contain root and features separated by X (dash) symbol. Here, gen (genitive), loc (locative), acc nf (nonfinite) and neg (negative) are the verbal features. 2 Related work Major treebanks are created on the basis of phrase structure or dependency structure of the language. The phrase structure grammar also known as context free grammar was used to build some English treebanks. In these treebanks, the intermediate nodes are phrasal nodes and the leaf nodes indicate the words.
 One of the earliest such attempt was the ATR/Lancaster Treebank project by Black et al. ( 1993 , 1996 ) for the American English corpus of 730,000 words. Another contemporary attempt was made in Penn Treebank Marcus et al. ( 1993 ) with the same concept and tags to annotate the spoken and written American English corpus of 4.5 million words. The tags used in these two treebanks include 14 phrase structures: Adjective phrase, Adverb phrase, Noun phrase, Prepositional phrase, Simple declarative clause, Clause introduced by subordinating conjunction or 0, Direct question introduced by wh-word or wh-phrase, Declarative sentence with subject-aux inversion, subconstituent of SBARQ excluding wh-word or wh-phrase, Verb phrase, wh-adverb phrase, wh-noun phrase, wh-prepositional phrase, constituent of unknown or uncertain category. The Penn Treebank includes four NULL elements namely *, T, 0(zero) and (rarely) NIL for four empty subject positions. The uses of these NULL elements are described in Santorini and Marcinkiewicz ( 1991 ).

The annotation tagset of the above phrase structure treebanks have been widely used by others to annotate other treebanks. For example, a Chinese treebank was created in Xue et al. ( 2005 ) based on the Penn Treebank annotation scheme. Three year Wall Street Journal (WSJ) collection of approximately 30 million words was annotated in Charniak et al. ( 2000 ) with the same structure as Penn Treebank, except for some additional co-reference marking.

Besides phrase structure treebanks, attempts have been made to build treebanks by collecting the framesets for each lexeme of the sentence. The English Proposition Treebank (Propbank) (Palmer et al. 2005 ) used the semantic roles of the verbs and analyzed the frequency of syntactic or semantic alternations in the annotation of the Penn Treebank comprehensive corpus.

However, phrase structure grammar is not so appropriate for annotating the treebanks for all languages. Certain Indian languages, some Roman languages (Italian and Spanish) etc., where word structure is not so rigid are some examples of them. For these languages, dependency grammar has been considered as an alternative to phrase structure grammar. Nevertheless, dependency grammar has McCord ( 1990 ).

The Prague Dependency Treebank Hajic  X  et al. ( 1996 , 2000 , 2001 ) is one of the pioneering work in this direction. In this treebank, 40 syntactic dependency functions has been defined between governor and its dependent nodes, such as: actor/bearer, addressee, patient, origin, effect, cause, regard, concession, aim, manner, extent, substitution, accompaniment, locative, means, temporal, attitude, cause, regard, directional, benefactive, comparison; there are also specific functions for dependents on nouns, for example material, appurtenance, restrictive and punctuation mark has been considered as one node. No extra node has been inserted in the tree except root node.

A Quranic Arabic corpus was annotated (Karlsson et al. 1995 ) with the help of dependency relations of traditional historical Arabic grammar known as ira  X  b. Here, 45 dependency relations 2 are categorized into 5 top categories of dependencies: nominal, verbal, phrases/clauses, adverbial and particle.

Bhatt et al. ( 2009 ) have annotated a multilayered treebank for Hindi and Urdu based on the dependency relations of Paninian grammatical model Bharati et al. ( 1999 ). In the model, the dependency relations in the sentence were defined between the modifier and the modified words. In the treebank named, Bharati et al. ( 2002 ) and Sharma et al. ( 2007 ) have considered the chunk as the basic unit of a dependency structure. They have also annotated the corpus using phrase structure grammar with a limited set of category labels: NP, AP, AdvP, VP and CP.
The treebanks are created both manually and semi-automatically. For example, to build the Penn Treebank, the POS tagged sentences were automatically parsed to yield a skeleton syntactic structure and then corrected by human annotators. The aim was to develop a large sized annotated corpus with minimum human effort. The Prague Dependency Treebank was created using 3 level annotation process: morphological annotation, syntactic annotation and linguistic meaning annotation. Here, the trees contain three parts of each node: original word form, morphological information and syntactic tag. The online annotation of Quranic Arabic corpus was verification, and online supervised collaborative proofreading. There were approx-imately 100 unpaid volunteer annotators and a small number of expert annotators (or supervisors or reviewers) annotating through a popular attracting website. 3 Categorization of the relation set complete proposition is an independent clause, whereas a dependent clause depends on another clause for making the proposition complete.

A sentence can be either a single independent clause or it may contain, along with an independent clause, one or more dependent clauses. We have considered both the shallow level intrachunk relations and deep interchunk and interclause relations to give a complete analysis of the Bangla sentence.

A word-chunk (chunk) in a sentence is a syntactically correlated non-overlapping group of words. In Bangla sentences two chunks can interchange their places by keeping the meaning of the sentence unaltered. Within a chunk some words are content words while some are function words. A content word is a word which carries meaning independently. One of the content words of a chunk is the head of the chunk.
We have categorized the relation set into three levels of relations. The relations inside a chunk are tagged as intrachunk relations at Level 1. At Level 2, we have tagged the relations between the chunks within a clause. There are three such relations are tagged at Level 3. Each level of relation is further classified based on syntactico-semantic features. We have used syntactic features like suffix, postposition, and morphological features and semantic features like the type of action, obligation in doing action, and animacy. We use syntactic features till syntax is able to analyze. In case of ambiguity, it goes for semantic features.

The categorization of relations are mentioned below along with the relation tags of the classifications. Each class of relation is defined in Sect. 5 starting from Level 1 relations to Level 3 relations.
 Level 1: Intrachunk Relations: Intrachunk relations are ppl, stc, vx, pof, redup, and Level 2: Interchunk Relations: karta (k1d, k1e, k1p, k1s, and k1g), karma (k2t, Level 3: Interclause Relations: Interclause relations are ref, clausal*, clausalcomp,
A dependent clause in a sentence is either a complement of the main clause or may modify the main clause. Interclause relations indicate the role of dependent clauses. Independent clauses are joined by a conjunct word and no interclause relation is used in such cases. 4 Some salient features of the relationset and the KGPBenTreebank In the process of building the KGPBenTreebank, we have defined the relations of the scheme and used them to annotate Bangla sentences. The annotated sentences are represented in two ways. In the textual representation, the dependency relation between the pair of words has been shown in the format DEP(CHILD, PARENT) meaning that there is a dependency relation DEP, where the dependent contains the word CHILD and the head contains the word PARENT. In the graphical represen-tation, each sentence is represented in a rooted directed tree structure where each edge and node are labelled. In the structure, head words are used as label of the parent nodes, dependents are used as label of the child nodes and the dependency relations are used as label of the edges. The directions are from parent to child nodes.
 During this exercise, we have considered certain features to simplify the task. These are discussed in the following subsections. 4.1 Syntactico-semantic relation set In the scheme, the head word can have many dependents, but a dependent is related only to one head. A word which is not dependent to any head word is called the root of the sentence. Dependency relations between the head word and its dependents can be explained syntactically as well as semantically. We have considered the defined syntactico-semantic relation set [incorporating thematic and functional semantic relations occurring at the sentence level] with the major inclinations towards logical relations to capture the dependency relations. 4.2 NULL node insertion Bangla, like most of the Indian languages, has in general a subject-object-verb sentence structure with verb being the root of the sentence. However, a word or a symbol in a Bangla sentence may be dropped at the surface level. Some of such cases are the copula verb in present tense when it takes attributes, the verbs that can be recovered by the presence of another verb, and the conjunts connecting two words, phrases or clauses. For these cases it is necessary to define a placeholder so that the relations can be shown. We put a &lt;NULL&gt; as a placeholder of the dropped words as discussed below. a) Bangla copula verbs are dropped in the present tense for the positive polarity b) A &lt;NULL&gt; verb is inserted on recoverability condition. Here, recoverability is c) A &lt;NULL&gt; conjunction is inserted to connect two words, phrases or clauses. 4.3 Same tree for different sentences As Bangla is a relatively free word order language, the words of the sentence can change their places. Some of the representations are unmarked (most fluent) and some are marked (rare). An unmarked simple Bangla sentence is shown in Example (4). (4) mohana Ama khAchchhe. This Bangla sentence is a simple sentence containing two nouns and a verb.  X  X  X ohana X  X  is the agent of this sentence,  X  X  X ma X  X  is the object and both are dependent of the verb  X  X  X hAchchhe X  X . However, according to the word being stressed and the different orders. The trees of all sentences containing these three words will remain the same as Fig. 1 ( k 1 d , k 2 t and end labels are defined in Sect. 5 ). 4.4 Ambiguity in the sentence An ambiguous sentence is one having multiple syntactic structures. Like in many other languages Bangla also include ambiguous sentences. For computational simplicity, for each ambiguous sentence we have chosen one interpretation which most likely interpretation of ambiguous sentence in the current context. 5 Definition of Bangla dependency relations In this section, we have defined the dependency relations starting from Level 1 to Level 3. Intrachunk relations (Level 1) of the bottom level are defined in Sect. 5.1 . Among interchunk relations of Level 2, Case, Modifier and few other interchunk relations of the top level are defined in Sect. 5.5 .

Each definition of dependency relation contains English and Bangla name of the tagging KGPBenTreebank. Each definition is explained with an example Bangla sentence where a pair of words has the corresponding dependency relation. The corresponding dependency relations are shown in textual representation. 5.1 Intrachunk relations In a chunk, the meaning of a function word is expressed through its relation with the content word. Prepositions and postpositions in the noun chunk and the auxiliary verbs in the verb chunk are examples of function words. Some Bangla postpositions are generated from some verb roots which are otherwise used as main verbs. Some main verbs are also used as auxiliary verbs. The relation between two words within a chunk is identified as intrachunk relation. The modifier intrachunk relations are relations are discussed below.

Postposition/Anusarga (ppl): Postpositions like  X  X heke X  (from),  X  X iYe X  (by), etc. and prepositions like  X  X inA X  (except) in the noun chunks (NP) are related to head words by Postposition/Anusarga (ppl) dependency relation. (5) se skula theke phirachhe. Spatio-temporal connection/Sthan-samaygata samparka (stc): Bangla nouns indi-noun or a pronoun with genitive marker. These space-time nouns may be followed by postposition. We relate the preceding noun or pronoun with space-time noun by Spatio-temporal connection/Sthan-samaygata samparka (stc) dependency relation. (6) se bA.Dira bhitara theke DAkachhe. Auxiliary verb/Sahayak kriya (vx): Auxiliary verbs in the verb chunks (VP) are related to main verbs by Auxiliary verb/Sahayak kriya (vx) dependency relation. (7) bAchchArA hese uThala. Part of/Kriya antargata bisheshya (pof): In conjunct verb chunks, the main verbs contain a nominal or adjectival part followed by a verb part. The first part is related to the second part by Part of/Kriya antargata bisheshya (pof) dependency relation. (8) ba;i melA bhAlabhAbe anuShThita haYechhe. Reduplication/Shabda dbaita (redup): Reduplication/Shabda dbaita (redup) depen-dency relations include nominal, pronominal and adjectival reduplications indicating plurality; verbal, adverbial, postpositional reduplications indicating continuity; reduplicated words indicating accuracy; onomatopoetic words, hedged expressions and also echo words. We consider the first occurrence of such pair of words as the head word and the second word as the dependent. In the following example, we have assigned two serial numbers (1 and 2) to disambiguate the head and the dependent. (9) bAchchArA galpa karate(1) karate(2) skula theke phirachhe. Fragment/Bhagnamsha (frag): Suffixes can be written either attached to the word or independently. The suffix occurring independently is related to the word by Fragment/Bhagnamsha (frag) dependency relation. (10) manamohana si.nha (bhAratera pradhAnamantrI) ra bidesha saphara Achhe. 5.2 Case/Karak The basic karak relations and their categories, as discussed in the Paninian framework (Bharati et al. 1999 ), from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) and also as they are defined in Bangla traditional grammar are of 6 types: Karta, Karma, Karan, Sampradan, Apadan and Adhikaran. In the scheme used by us, the Paninian karak relations, in general, are accepted with some changes as suggested in modern Bangla grammars Chatterji ( 2003 ), Chakravarty ( 2010 ). Some Bangla noun verb relations have been discussed in Chatterji et al. ( 2009 ).

It is difficult to consider sampradan karak relation in Bangla from syntax except in the instances where the words  X  X Ana X  (donate) and  X  X ampradAna X  (donate) are explicitly mentioned. This is because in Bangla sampradan are considered when the nature of the verb indicated that something is given selflessly.

Some Bangla grammarians have advocated that sampradan karak may not be considered separately in Bangla. In this context we quote Suniti Kumar Chatterji sampradan; Bangla does not have this. Some people use sampradan in Bangla for compatibility with Sanskrit; while others merge sampradan with karma. He considers the second approach reasonable (Page 247) and merged the sampradan with gauna karma (Page 241 and 299). 5.2.1 Subject/Karta Subject/Karta is the one who does, experiences or exists. It can also be or become something. However, it is referred to as Passive Karta when it acts as the doer of an action in a passive sentence. In Bangla, the karta may take a wide range of suffixes, like genitive, nominative, accusative, locative, etc. The verbs act in different ways and accordingly their subjects are defined. Because of the subcategorization of the subject, instead of including subject in the relationset we have included its subcategories.

Doer subject/Kriya sampadak karta (k1d): When the verb indicates some mental or physical exercise by an animate karta then its subject is defined as Doer subject/ Kriya sampadak karta (k1d).
 (11) bulabulite dhAna kheYechhe. Experiencer subject/Anubhab karta (k1e): When the verb expresses mental state, emotion or event without the subject X  X  conscious effort then its subject is defined as Experiencer subject/Anubhab karta (k1e). (12) AmAra shIta karachhe. Passive subject/Paroksha karta (k1p): When the verb indicates an action in passive construction then its subject is defined as Passive subject/Paroksha karta (k1p). This postpositions  X  X bArA X  (by),  X  X iYe X  (by) and  X  X arttRRika X  (by) or may take the suffix  X  X a X . (13) AnandamaTha ba Nkimachandra kartRRika rachita &lt;NULL&gt;. Even though this is the usual Bangla device for passivization, there may be confusion in certain cases. For example,  X  X a X  suffix is also attached with the karta of active voice verbs (See example 12) and  X  X bArA X ,  X  X iYe X  and  X  X arttRRika X  postpositions are also attached with karan. Again same word forms of some verbs are used both in active and passive voice. For example,  X  X aYechhe X  (has been done) in the following first example is in passive voice and in the second one  X  X aYechhe X  (has given birth) is in active voice. Therefore, we assigned separate tag for the karta of passive voice verbs though it conveys redundant information in many cases.  X  AmAra dbArA ei kAja haYechhe .  X  tAra jbara haYechhe . Noun of proposition/Bidheya karta or Samanadhikaran (k1s): Noun of proposition/ Bidheya karta or Samanadhikaran (k1s) is the complement of the karta in the sentence. (14) tini bhAla shikShaka chhilena. General subject/Sadharan karta (k1g): The subject is defined as General subject/ Sadharan karta (k1g) in the following contexts. The subjects which do not belong to tagged as k1g. 1. Subject of copula or be verb. 2. Subject of a verb in which the agent of the action is not specified, though it may 3. The subject which is in r6 relation with another noun or pronoun. (15) AmAdera siTi kaleja khuba bhAla &lt;NULL&gt;. 5.2.2 Object/Karma being affected by the action. It also includes some things or positions being achieved or attained through the action. A Bangla sentence with ditransitive verb or causative verb may have two karma. Similarly, transitive verbs and non-transitive verbs may have one and zero karma, respectively. In both active and passive constructions, the karma is tagged in the same way. Because of the subcategori-zation of the object, instead of including object in the relationset we have included its subcategories.

Transitive object/Sakarmak karma (k2t): Transitive object/Sakarmak karma (k2t) is the karma of a transitive verb. (16) bhUmikampa sAjAno gochhAno shaharaTA dhba.nsa karala. Direct object/Mukhya karma (k2m) &amp; Indirect object/Gauna karma (k2g): The two objects of a ditransitive verb of both passive and active sentences may be tagged as follows. Direct object/Mukhya karma (k2m) is the karma which undergoes the action. Indirect object/Gauna karma (k2g) is the one which is affected by the action, or a recipient or a beneficiary of the action. These two karma generally co-occur. (17) Ami mAke chiThi likhachhi. Purposive object/Uddyeshya karma (k2u) &amp; Predicative object/Bidheya karma (k2s): In the case of active as well as passive sentences with ditransitive verb, if the two objects are in complementary relation, the one which takes the complement is defined as Purposive object/Uddyeshya karma (k2u). This karma is attached with the suffix  X  X e X . Another one which stands as a complement is defined as Predicative object/Bidheya karma (k2s). (18) tini buddhadebake parameshbarera abatAra balena.
A ditransitive verb may take a pair of arguments which refer to the same thing or person. We tag them as k2u and k2s. A ditransitive verb may also take a pair of arguments which refer to two different things or persons. We tag them as k2m and k2g. The nature of such pairs of arguments are different. For example, in the following sentence (i),  X  X Andhike X  (Gandhi-to) and  X  X Apu X  (Bapu) are two karma of  X  X alA haYa X  (called). These two karma refer to same person. Therefore, they are tagged as k2u and k2s, respectively. In the following sentence (ii),  X  X Apu X  (Bapu) is the agent which is tagged as k1d and  X  X Andhike X  (Gandhi-to) and  X  X athATA X  (the words) are two karma of  X  X alala X  (told) and they are tagged as k2g and k2m, respectively. (i.) gAndhike bApu balA haYa. (ii.) bApu gAndhike kathATA balala. 5.2.3 Instrumental/Karan Instrumental/Karan(k3): Instrumental/Karan (k3) refers to a thing or object which action. (19) gAdhAke chAbuka mAro. 5.2.4 Ablative/Apadan indicates the source of an action or the distance between two places. Because of the subcategorization of the ablative, instead of including ablative in the relationset we have included its subcategories.

Place related ablative/Sthanbachak apadan (k5p): Place related Ablative/ Sthan-bachak apadan (k5p) refers to the source or origin of an act. (20) nadIra ghATa theke ghaTa bhese ela. State related ablative/Abasthabachak apadan (k5s): State related ablative/ Abastha-bachak apadan (k5s) is the state from where the action takes place. Here karta is not displaced, only object is displaced away from the state of karta. (21) AmAra ghara theke mandirera chU.DA dekhA yAYa. Time related ablative/Kalbachak apadan (k5t): Time related ablative/Kalbachak apadan (k5t) refers to the point of time which indicates the source of an action. (22) sakAla theke bRRiShTi nemechhe. Distance related ablative/Duratbabachak apadan (k5d): Distance related ablative/ Duratbabachak apadan (k5d) indicates the distance between two places one of which is the starting point and the other one is the ending point. The starting point place is tagged as k5d. The corresponding sentence contains two place names, a distance measure (either real or abstract) and a copula. (23) dilli theke kolakAtA bahu dUre &lt;NULL&gt;. 5.2.5 Locative/Adhikaran Locative/Adhikaran may be either the place where the action takes place, or the time when it takes place, or the domain about which it takes place or the state in including locative in the relationset we have included its subcategories.
Place related locative/Deshadhikaran (k7p): Place related locative/Deshadhik-aran (k7p) refers to the place that indicates the occurrence of the act. (24) bA.Dite phulera gAchha Achhe. Time related locative/Kaladhikaran (k7t): Time related locative/Kaladhikaran (k7t) is that point or duration of time which indicates the occurrence of the act. (25) bhore sUrya oThe. Domain related locative/Bishayadhikaran (k7d): Domain related locative/ Bisha-yadhikaran (k7d) is the thing or area, or things constituting a domain which can be pursued for study, or can be pursued as a profession. (26) tArA sAhitye paNDita &lt;NULL&gt;. State related locative/Bhabadhikaran (k7s): State related locative/Bhabadhikaran (k7s) refers to the state of being for something or someone at a particular time. (27) tArA khuba sukhe Achhe. 5.2.6 Other case-alike/Anyanya karak-sama Other than the five karak relations mentioned above, there are some more relations between a noun and a verb and between two nouns which are often confused with the karak relations.

Reason/Hetu (rh): Reason/Hetu (rh) represents the reason of the action. (28) bhaYe bhule yAYa debatAra nAma. Purpose/Uddeshya (ru): Purpose/Uddeshya (ru) represents the purpose of the action. (29) ratana unnatira janya kaThora parishrama kare. Destination/Gantabyasthal (des): Destination/Gantabyasthal (des) is the place related argument of the nontransitive moving verbs  X  X AoYA X  (go),  X  X hramana karA X  nominative marker (0 bibhakti). It is a karma but it behaves like an adhikaran. (30) rAma bA.Di giYechhila. Possession/Dakhal (r6v): Possession/Dakhal (r6v) is the relation between a noun and a verb where the noun acts as an owner. The owned part is considered as karma. This owner noun takes genitive marker and the corresponding verb is a  X  X e X  verb (existential). (31) rAmera ekaTA meYe Achhe. Comparison/Taratamya (Compr): Comparison/Taratamya (Compr) indicates a comparison between two noun phrases or between their attributes. For example, the phrase,  X  X  X itAra theke sundarI meYe X  X  [The girl more beautiful than Mita] indicates the comparison between the  X  X undarI X  attribute of  X  X itA X  and  X  X eYe X . (32) ekhAne aneke phuTabalera theke krikeTa pachhanda karena. Similarity/Sadrishya (sim): Similarity/Sadrishya (sim) describes the similarity between two noun phrases or between the attributes of two noun phrases. (33) se AmAra bonera mata &lt;NULL&gt;. 5.3 Modifier relations Most of the modifier relations can also be considered as intrachunk relations. However, sometimes, it is observed that the modifier relations exist between two different chunks.

Genitive/Sambandha (r6): Genitive/Sambandha (r6) refers to the relation between a noun or a pronoun with genitive marker and another noun. The r6 between such noun pairs are shown in Table 1 with an example of each.

For differentiating the r6 relation from other relations of the noun with genitive marker in a sentence, the following points may be considered. 1. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, preceding a postposition is not a 2. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker that precedes a noun of a complex 3. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, which are related to a mental verb 4. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, which is a karta of a passive verb is 5. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, which is related with a verb by r 6 v is Associative relation/Saharthak sambandha (ras) &amp; Non-associative relation/ Namarthak sambandha (rasneg): Associative relation/Saharthak sambandha (ras) occurs with a noun or pronoun which accompanies another noun or pronoun in karta or karma position and it is followed by the postpositions  X  X a Nge X  (with),  X  X Athe X  (with), or  X  X iYe X  (by). The role of saharthak noun is same as the role of the noun with which it is attached. If it is attached with a karta, its role is a karta and if it is attached with a karma, its role is a karma. When the occurrence of such sambandha is negated, it is defined as Non-associative relation/Namarthak sambandha (rasneg). Namarthak sambandha takes postpositions  X  X hhA.DA X , or  X  X inA X .

Noun noun modifier/Sanyogmulak bisheshya (nnmod): Noun noun modifier/ Sanyogmulak bisheshya (nnmod) refers to the relation between two nouns. The two nouns, however, should not be in r6 relation. (36) rAjaputa jAti khuba yoddhA jAti &lt;NULL&gt;. Adjective noun modifier/Bisheshyer bisheshan (jnmod): Adjective noun modifier/ Bisheshyer bisheshan (jnmod) is used to relate an adjective which modifies the numerical modifier etc. have been included into this relation. (37) se uchcha phalanashIla bIja diYe chASha kare . Demonstrative noun modifier/Nirnay suchak sarbanam (dnmod): Demonstrative noun modifier/Nirnay suchak sarbanam (dnmod) is the relation between the head of a noun phrase and its demonstrative. (38) sei meYeTA nAcha karate pAre nA. Pronominal noun modifier/Sarbanamjata bisheshan (pronmod): Pronominal noun modifier/Sarbanamjata bisheshan (pronmod) accounts for the relation between a noun or a personal pronoun and a reflexive pronoun which functions as an emphatic pronoun.

(50) tomAra kAke beshi pachhanda &lt;NULL&gt;? End/Samapti (end): End/Samapti (end) is used to indicate the relation between non-interrogative sentence markers ( j and ! ) and the verb of the main clause. (51) ete jami kama naShTa haYa. Symbol/Chihna (sym): Symbol/Chihna (sym) is the relation between a symbol except the sentence end markers and those which are used to join two independent clauses and the verb. (52) rohana, tui chA khete yA.
Dependent clauses are attached to the main clause with subordinating conjunc-tions. When the subordinating conjunction comes before the dependent clause, then it is called preconjunct. When the subordinating conjunction comes after the dependent clause, then it is called postconjunct. If a single clause sentence contains a subordinating conjunction, then it is tagged as particle. It is generally placed at the beginning of the sentence. 5.5 Interclause relations Interclause relations include relative and complement clause constructions where there is a main clause and at least one dependent clause. In relative clause construction the dependent clause is connected with the main clause by a referent. In initial position of the main clause.

Referent/Nirdesak (ref): Referent/Nirdesak (ref) relation is found between two clauses when a coreferent also surfaces. The role of the dependent clause is the same as the coreferent in the main clause. The ref relation is assigned between the verb of the dependent clause and the coreferent. (53) yakhana bRRiShTi pa.Dachhila takhana se chhAtA niYe gela. Clausal Star/Bakyamsha samagra (clausal*): Clausal Star/Bakyamsha samagra (clausal*) relation is found between two clauses when the coreferent does not surface, and the relation is assigned between the verb of the dependent clause and the verb of the main clause. Here,  X * X  is a variable indicating different dependency (deshadhikaran), k7t (kaladhikaran), etc. The  X * X  indicates the dependency relation between the two clauses. For simplicity, we have not considered subdivisions of karaks (except adhikaran) in this variable position. (54) yakhana bRRiShTi pa.Dachhila se chhAtA niYe gela. (55) ye ba;iTA Ami niYechhilAma Ami pherata diYe diYechhi. Clausal complement/Bakyamsha sampurak (clausalcomp): In a complement clause complementizer. The dependent clause is considered as clausal complement of the main clause. The verb of the main clause and the verb of the complement clause are connected by Clausal complement/Bakyamsha sampurak (clausalcomp) dependency relation. (56) se balala ye se kAla kolakAtA yAbe. Complementizer/Sampurak (comp): In the complement clause construction, Com-plementizer/ Sampurak (comp) relation is between the complementizer and the verb of the complement clause. The complementizer which is the introducer of the complement clause acts as a connector between the main clause and the dependent clause. It is attached to the verb of the complement clause. In our analysis, Bangla complementizers are  X  X e X  (that),  X  X ale X  (that) or a comma. In example (56)  X  X e X  is related with the verb  X  X Abe X  by comp dependency relation.

Apart from being a complementizer,  X  X ale X  (due to) can also indicate a reason clause (clausalrh) in multiclause Bangla sentences. It can also be used as a particle, shown in example (55)) or a personal pronoun which acts as referent in the subordinate clause.  X  X e X  can also be used as a particle. 6 Analysis of the scheme and the annotation process We have used the proposed dependency annotation scheme to build KGPBenTree-bank 3 . Then we have analyzed both the annotation scheme and the resource using standard analysis methods used in many other Treebanks. These analyses show the usability of the resource for other research purposes. 6.1 Corpus statistics We have used the dependency relations to annotate a treebank of 4167 sentences (56,514 words). The sentences are taken from Blogs, Multikulti ( www.multikulti. manually in two different levels namely lexical category and morphological values as a part of the Part-of-Speech Tagset (IL-POST) project undertaken by MSR India. This two level manually annotated sentences are used as input to our annotation task. The distribution of the length (number of words) of the sentences are plotted in Fig. 2 . The length varies from 3 to 67 words, while 93.95 % sentences (3913 sentences) have length between 4 and 29. 6.2 Tagset overview KGPBenTreebank. Some relations from the top and bottom positions of the list and their number of occurrences are shown in Table 2 . Maximum number of usage is found for ccof relation as there are two ccof tags from the conjunct to each of the parts which are joined by the conjunct. Next highest number of occurrence is found for jnmod due to its usage for different types of modifiers like quantifier, numerical modifier, etc. Number of occurrences of pof indicates the number of complex predicates in the corpus. There are 1039 occurrences of clausalk2. k5d, clausalk7p and clausalk7d have limited usage in Bangla.

The distribution of the occurrence of dependency relations in the annotated corpus is shown in Fig. 3 . Among 63 dependency relations 46 relations have been used less than 1,000 times and 10 relations have been used more than 2000 times. So, relations of the tagset have been used to capture the relations of small number of word pairs. 6.3 Inter-annotator agreement Three annotators have annotated KGPBenTreebank for 3 years. To calculate the agreement between the annotators, a part of KGPBenTreebank containing 485 sentences have been annotated independently by all of them. We calculate the inter-annotators agreement using Fleiss X  Kappa as discussed in Fleiss ( 1971 ).
Fleiss X  Kappa gives a measure (between 0 and 1) of agreement for more than 2 annotator readability. Fleiss X  Kappa is calculated as follows.

Suppose N is the total number of words, n is the number of annotators assigning dependency relations to the words and K is the number of dependency relations used for assignment. N n is the total number of assignments of relations made by the number of annotators assigning ith word to jth dependency relation. The proportion of all assignments used for assigning jth dependency relation may be defined using Eq. ( 1 ). The mean proportion of assignments on all dependency relations may be defined using Eq. ( 2 ).
 Among n  X  n 1  X  2 pairs of annotators, the extent to which the annotator pairs are agreed for the ith word is defined using Eq. ( 3 ). The mean of agreements for all words may be defined using Eq. ( 4 ).
 The degree of agreement between n annotators is computed in terms of Fleiss X  Kappa ( j ) using Eq. 5 . When the annotators are agreed on all assignments, then j  X  1. The calculated Fleiss X  Kappa for the three annotators on 485 sentences containing 6356 words is calculated to be 0.9288. So, the annotators have almost perfect agreement while annotating KGPBenTreebank. 6.4 Length of dependencies The average length of dependency relations is 2.82 while the longest and shortest dependency relations are clausalcondition and qsk 2 and their average lengths are 8.35 and 1, respectively.

In KGPBenTreebank, among 56,524 words, 4167 words (one word from each sentence) are the roots of the sentences. Root words of the sentences are not attached to any other word. The remaining 52,357 words of KGPBenTreebank are attached to some other words of the sentence. Among them, 28876 words are related to adjacent words (previous or next word), 8290 words are related to the words with distance 2 (previous to previous or next to next word), and so on. The increasing length of the dependency relations is plotted against the log of the number of words which are attached to correspondingly distant words in Fig. 4 . First two points of the plot are (X=1, Y= log 10 (28876)) and (X=2, Y= log 10 (8290)).
From this plot we observe that relations in KGPBenTreebank are mostly short distance relations and as the length of the relations increases the log of number of words related to the word with that distance decreases almost exponentially. 7 Comparison between Hindi and Bangla schemes The dependency annotation model discussed in this paper borrows from the Paninian grammatical model of Bharati et al. ( 1999 ), Hindi dependency scheme of Sharma et al. ( 2007 ) used in Anncorra, the typed dependency relation model de Marneffe and Manning ( 2008 ) followed in Stanford Parser v1.6.9 and the modern Bangla grammatical model discussed by Chatterji 2003 and Bamandev Chakravarty 2010 .

In both KGPBenTreebank and Anncorra, Karak relations are divided into mentioned in Sect. 7.1 . A detailed explanation on the differences between them is given in Sect. 7.2 . 7.1 Differences of Karak division schemes In KGPBenTreebank, five finer divisions of subjective case (karta karak) are used on the basis of the type of the activity of the subject. 1. doer subject (Kriya sampadak karta) 2. experiencer subject (Anubhab karta) 3. passive subject (Paroksha karta) 4. noun of proposition (Bidheya karta or Samanadhikaran) 5. general subject (Sadharan karta)
In Anncorra, six finer divisions of subjective case (karta karak) are used. 1. doer (karta) 2. causer subject (prayojaka karta) 3. causee subject (prayojya karta) 4. mediator causer (madhyastha karta) 5. noun complement of subject (karta samanadhikarana) 6. clausal subject
In KGPBenTreebank, five finer divisions of objective case (karma karak) are used. 1. transitive object (sakarmak karma) 2. direct object (mukhya karma) 3. indirect object (gauna karma) 4. purposive object (uddyeshya karma) 5. predicative object (bidheya karma)
In Anncorra, four finer divisions of objective case (karma karak) are used. 1. direct object (mukhya karma) 2. indirect object (gauna karma) 3. object complement (karma samanadhikaran) [In KGPBenTreebank it occurs as 4. goal, destination (k2p) [In KGPBenTreebank we have used it as other cases-
In KGPBenTreebank, sampradan karak is not considered and is merged with object/karma.

There are two finer divisions of sampradan (k4) in Anncorra. 1. recipient (sampradan) 2. experiencer karta (anubhava karta)
In KGPBenTreebank, place and time are tagged differently. Therefore, here, there are four finer divisions of ablative case (apadan karak). 1. place related ablative (sthanbachak apadan) 2. state related ablative (abasthabachak apadan) 3. time related ablative (kalbachak apadan) 4. distance related ablative (duratbabachak apadan)
In Anncorra, ablative case (apadan karak) has two finer divisions. 1. apadan karak/source which is related to both place and time. 2. prakriti apadan  X  X ource material X  in verbs denoting change of state.
In KGPBenTreebank, locative case (adhikaran karak) has four finer divisions as domain and state or condition are treated in different way. 1. place related locative (deshadhikaran) 2. time related locative (kaladhikaran) 3. domain related locative (bishayadhikaran) 4. state related locative (bhabadhikaran)
In Anncorra, locative case (adhikaran karak) has three finer divisions. 1. place related locative (deshadhikaran) 2. time related locative (kaladhikaran) 3. domain related locative (vishayadhikaran)
The relations used for connecting two clauses in KGPBenTreebank are given below. Here,  X * X  can be replaced by the relation of the two clauses. 1. referent (nirdesak) 2. clausal* (bakyamsha samagra) 3. clausal complement (bakyamsha sampurak) 4. complementizer (sampurak)
Anncorra has three types of relative clauses. 1. nmod_relc (relative clause constructions modifying a noun) 2. rbmod_relc (jo-vo construction modifying an adverb) 3. jjmod_relc (jo-vo clause construction modifying an adjective) 7.2 Overall differences of annotation schemes Extensive work has been done on developing Hindi treebank. The dependency annotating Anncorra. We have borrowed some features of these annotation schemes in the proposed Bangla dependency annotation scheme. Therefore, we discuss the differences between the existing Hindi annotation schemes and the scheme proposed in this paper.

Each difference is explained with an example and a dependency structure. The attachments and tags used by Anncorra which are different from KGPBenTreebank, are shown using thick lines and boldface in the dependency structures. The intrachunk relations of KGPBenTreebank are not included in Anncorra chunk level dependency treebank. The intrachunk attachments are shown using dotted lines and intrachunk relations are underlined.

The relationship set in the proposed scheme is categorized into 3 levels: intrachunk relations, interchunk relations and interclause relations. Though most of the relations in the treebank have syntactic orientation, semantic relations also have been considered in some cases where the need is felt.

The scheme has been created with the help of traditional Bangla grammar books, the existing schemes for Indian languages and the modern Bangla grammar books. Further, the scheme is corrected and enriched during the annotation process with the help of the annotators and some Bangla language experts. Then the annotated corpus is corrected based on the modified tagset. Further study would be more effective for the improvement or enrichment of the scheme.

Three annotators have electronically annotated 4167 Bangla sentences to test the proposed scheme. The inter-annotator agreement value on 485 Bangla sentences is found to be 0.9288 in terms of Fleiss X  Kappa which indicates the consistency of the treebank. However, analysis is required to find and correct the mistakes in the annotation.

 Abstract Dependency grammar is considered appropriate for many Indian lan-language. We have categorized these relations in three different levels, namely levels is further categorized and an annotation scheme has been developed. Both syntactic and semantic features have been taken into consideration for describing the relations. In our scheme, there are 63 such syntactico X  X emantic relations. We have verified the scheme by tagging a corpus of 4167 Bangla sentences to create a treebank (KGPBenTreebank).
 Keywords Dependency structure Syntactico X  X emantic relation Paninian karak Modern Bangla grammar and language 1 Introduction In this paper, we present a dependency annotation scheme for Bangla language. The relations are prepared taking into account modern grammatical and language structures of Bangla mostly studied from Chatterji ( 2003 ) and the dependency relations used in other Indian languages like Hindi and Urdu (Sharma et al. 2007 ; Bhatt et al. 2009 ). Most of these existing Indian language treebanks follow Paninian grammatical model which is discussed in Bharati et al. ( 1999 ).

By observing these grammatical models and dependency relations, we have tried The relations are described by the syntactic and semantic features occurring between the words.

In Bangla, syntax is not a strong aspect in identifying the relations. This is because the word order in Bangla sentences are relatively less rigid and suffixes and considered a balance of syntactic and semantic features to define the Bangla dependency grammar.

Computational processing for Bangla is challenging because of the scarcity of annotated resources. In the absence of treebank of Bangla the work of parsing and some other studies which could have helped in machine translation, question answering, etc. have been hindered.

Different grammars have been advocated for building treebanks in different languages like phrase structure grammar [in Penn Treebank Marcus et al. ( 1993 )] and dependency grammar [in Prague Dependency Treebank Hajic  X  et al. ( 1996 )]. We have used a dependency grammar based scheme to build a treebank of Bangla sentences. The scheme has been evolved by studying carefully the corpus considered for annotation (4167 Bangla sentences) as well as other corpus. The treebank created for these 4167 Bangla sentences is referred to as KGPBenTreebank 1 .

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Some related work has been discussed in Sect. 2 . In Sect. 3 , we have discussed some assumptions used to define the scheme and in building the KGPBenTreebank. The relation set of the scheme have been categorized and defined in Sects. 4 and 5 , respectively. In Sect. 6 , we have analyzed relations in KGPBenTreebank and Anncorra. Finally, Sect. 8 contains the conclusion. See  X  X ppendix 1  X  for the comprehensive dependency relationship set of the scheme. In the paper, examples are written in  X  X  X ndian languages TRANSliteration X  X  ( itrans ) Chopde ( 2000 ) encoding and the mappings of the itrans encoding with glyphs in the Bangla and Hindi scripts are shown in  X  X ppendix 2  X . Each example contains a Bangla sentence followed by the gloss and translation in English. Glosses contain root and features separated by X (dash) symbol. Here, gen (genitive), loc (locative), acc nf (nonfinite) and neg (negative) are the verbal features. 2 Related work Major treebanks are created on the basis of phrase structure or dependency structure of the language. The phrase structure grammar also known as context free grammar was used to build some English treebanks. In these treebanks, the intermediate nodes are phrasal nodes and the leaf nodes indicate the words.
 One of the earliest such attempt was the ATR/Lancaster Treebank project by Black et al. ( 1993 , 1996 ) for the American English corpus of 730,000 words. Another contemporary attempt was made in Penn Treebank Marcus et al. ( 1993 ) with the same concept and tags to annotate the spoken and written American English corpus of 4.5 million words. The tags used in these two treebanks include 14 phrase structures: Adjective phrase, Adverb phrase, Noun phrase, Prepositional phrase, Simple declarative clause, Clause introduced by subordinating conjunction or 0, Direct question introduced by wh-word or wh-phrase, Declarative sentence with subject-aux inversion, subconstituent of SBARQ excluding wh-word or wh-phrase, Verb phrase, wh-adverb phrase, wh-noun phrase, wh-prepositional phrase, constituent of unknown or uncertain category. The Penn Treebank includes four NULL elements namely *, T, 0(zero) and (rarely) NIL for four empty subject positions. The uses of these NULL elements are described in Santorini and Marcinkiewicz ( 1991 ).

The annotation tagset of the above phrase structure treebanks have been widely used by others to annotate other treebanks. For example, a Chinese treebank was created in Xue et al. ( 2005 ) based on the Penn Treebank annotation scheme. Three year Wall Street Journal (WSJ) collection of approximately 30 million words was annotated in Charniak et al. ( 2000 ) with the same structure as Penn Treebank, except for some additional co-reference marking.

Besides phrase structure treebanks, attempts have been made to build treebanks by collecting the framesets for each lexeme of the sentence. The English Proposition Treebank (Propbank) (Palmer et al. 2005 ) used the semantic roles of the verbs and analyzed the frequency of syntactic or semantic alternations in the annotation of the Penn Treebank comprehensive corpus.

However, phrase structure grammar is not so appropriate for annotating the treebanks for all languages. Certain Indian languages, some Roman languages (Italian and Spanish) etc., where word structure is not so rigid are some examples of them. For these languages, dependency grammar has been considered as an alternative to phrase structure grammar. Nevertheless, dependency grammar has McCord ( 1990 ).

The Prague Dependency Treebank Hajic  X  et al. ( 1996 , 2000 , 2001 ) is one of the pioneering work in this direction. In this treebank, 40 syntactic dependency functions has been defined between governor and its dependent nodes, such as: actor/bearer, addressee, patient, origin, effect, cause, regard, concession, aim, manner, extent, substitution, accompaniment, locative, means, temporal, attitude, cause, regard, directional, benefactive, comparison; there are also specific functions for dependents on nouns, for example material, appurtenance, restrictive and punctuation mark has been considered as one node. No extra node has been inserted in the tree except root node.

A Quranic Arabic corpus was annotated (Karlsson et al. 1995 ) with the help of dependency relations of traditional historical Arabic grammar known as ira  X  b. Here, 45 dependency relations 2 are categorized into 5 top categories of dependencies: nominal, verbal, phrases/clauses, adverbial and particle.

Bhatt et al. ( 2009 ) have annotated a multilayered treebank for Hindi and Urdu based on the dependency relations of Paninian grammatical model Bharati et al. ( 1999 ). In the model, the dependency relations in the sentence were defined between the modifier and the modified words. In the treebank named, Bharati et al. ( 2002 ) and Sharma et al. ( 2007 ) have considered the chunk as the basic unit of a dependency structure. They have also annotated the corpus using phrase structure grammar with a limited set of category labels: NP, AP, AdvP, VP and CP.
The treebanks are created both manually and semi-automatically. For example, to build the Penn Treebank, the POS tagged sentences were automatically parsed to yield a skeleton syntactic structure and then corrected by human annotators. The aim was to develop a large sized annotated corpus with minimum human effort. The Prague Dependency Treebank was created using 3 level annotation process: morphological annotation, syntactic annotation and linguistic meaning annotation. Here, the trees contain three parts of each node: original word form, morphological information and syntactic tag. The online annotation of Quranic Arabic corpus was verification, and online supervised collaborative proofreading. There were approx-imately 100 unpaid volunteer annotators and a small number of expert annotators (or supervisors or reviewers) annotating through a popular attracting website. 3 Categorization of the relation set complete proposition is an independent clause, whereas a dependent clause depends on another clause for making the proposition complete.

A sentence can be either a single independent clause or it may contain, along with an independent clause, one or more dependent clauses. We have considered both the shallow level intrachunk relations and deep interchunk and interclause relations to give a complete analysis of the Bangla sentence.

A word-chunk (chunk) in a sentence is a syntactically correlated non-overlapping group of words. In Bangla sentences two chunks can interchange their places by keeping the meaning of the sentence unaltered. Within a chunk some words are content words while some are function words. A content word is a word which carries meaning independently. One of the content words of a chunk is the head of the chunk.
We have categorized the relation set into three levels of relations. The relations inside a chunk are tagged as intrachunk relations at Level 1. At Level 2, we have tagged the relations between the chunks within a clause. There are three such relations are tagged at Level 3. Each level of relation is further classified based on syntactico-semantic features. We have used syntactic features like suffix, postposition, and morphological features and semantic features like the type of action, obligation in doing action, and animacy. We use syntactic features till syntax is able to analyze. In case of ambiguity, it goes for semantic features.

The categorization of relations are mentioned below along with the relation tags of the classifications. Each class of relation is defined in Sect. 5 starting from Level 1 relations to Level 3 relations.
 Level 1: Intrachunk Relations: Intrachunk relations are ppl, stc, vx, pof, redup, and Level 2: Interchunk Relations: karta (k1d, k1e, k1p, k1s, and k1g), karma (k2t, Level 3: Interclause Relations: Interclause relations are ref, clausal*, clausalcomp,
A dependent clause in a sentence is either a complement of the main clause or may modify the main clause. Interclause relations indicate the role of dependent clauses. Independent clauses are joined by a conjunct word and no interclause relation is used in such cases. 4 Some salient features of the relationset and the KGPBenTreebank In the process of building the KGPBenTreebank, we have defined the relations of the scheme and used them to annotate Bangla sentences. The annotated sentences are represented in two ways. In the textual representation, the dependency relation between the pair of words has been shown in the format DEP(CHILD, PARENT) meaning that there is a dependency relation DEP, where the dependent contains the word CHILD and the head contains the word PARENT. In the graphical represen-tation, each sentence is represented in a rooted directed tree structure where each edge and node are labelled. In the structure, head words are used as label of the parent nodes, dependents are used as label of the child nodes and the dependency relations are used as label of the edges. The directions are from parent to child nodes.
 During this exercise, we have considered certain features to simplify the task. These are discussed in the following subsections. 4.1 Syntactico-semantic relation set In the scheme, the head word can have many dependents, but a dependent is related only to one head. A word which is not dependent to any head word is called the root of the sentence. Dependency relations between the head word and its dependents can be explained syntactically as well as semantically. We have considered the defined syntactico-semantic relation set [incorporating thematic and functional semantic relations occurring at the sentence level] with the major inclinations towards logical relations to capture the dependency relations. 4.2 NULL node insertion Bangla, like most of the Indian languages, has in general a subject-object-verb sentence structure with verb being the root of the sentence. However, a word or a symbol in a Bangla sentence may be dropped at the surface level. Some of such cases are the copula verb in present tense when it takes attributes, the verbs that can be recovered by the presence of another verb, and the conjunts connecting two words, phrases or clauses. For these cases it is necessary to define a placeholder so that the relations can be shown. We put a &lt;NULL&gt; as a placeholder of the dropped words as discussed below. a) Bangla copula verbs are dropped in the present tense for the positive polarity b) A &lt;NULL&gt; verb is inserted on recoverability condition. Here, recoverability is c) A &lt;NULL&gt; conjunction is inserted to connect two words, phrases or clauses. 4.3 Same tree for different sentences As Bangla is a relatively free word order language, the words of the sentence can change their places. Some of the representations are unmarked (most fluent) and some are marked (rare). An unmarked simple Bangla sentence is shown in Example (4). (4) mohana Ama khAchchhe. This Bangla sentence is a simple sentence containing two nouns and a verb.  X  X  X ohana X  X  is the agent of this sentence,  X  X  X ma X  X  is the object and both are dependent of the verb  X  X  X hAchchhe X  X . However, according to the word being stressed and the different orders. The trees of all sentences containing these three words will remain the same as Fig. 1 ( k 1 d , k 2 t and end labels are defined in Sect. 5 ). 4.4 Ambiguity in the sentence An ambiguous sentence is one having multiple syntactic structures. Like in many other languages Bangla also include ambiguous sentences. For computational simplicity, for each ambiguous sentence we have chosen one interpretation which most likely interpretation of ambiguous sentence in the current context. 5 Definition of Bangla dependency relations In this section, we have defined the dependency relations starting from Level 1 to Level 3. Intrachunk relations (Level 1) of the bottom level are defined in Sect. 5.1 . Among interchunk relations of Level 2, Case, Modifier and few other interchunk relations of the top level are defined in Sect. 5.5 .

Each definition of dependency relation contains English and Bangla name of the tagging KGPBenTreebank. Each definition is explained with an example Bangla sentence where a pair of words has the corresponding dependency relation. The corresponding dependency relations are shown in textual representation. 5.1 Intrachunk relations In a chunk, the meaning of a function word is expressed through its relation with the content word. Prepositions and postpositions in the noun chunk and the auxiliary verbs in the verb chunk are examples of function words. Some Bangla postpositions are generated from some verb roots which are otherwise used as main verbs. Some main verbs are also used as auxiliary verbs. The relation between two words within a chunk is identified as intrachunk relation. The modifier intrachunk relations are relations are discussed below.

Postposition/Anusarga (ppl): Postpositions like  X  X heke X  (from),  X  X iYe X  (by), etc. and prepositions like  X  X inA X  (except) in the noun chunks (NP) are related to head words by Postposition/Anusarga (ppl) dependency relation. (5) se skula theke phirachhe. Spatio-temporal connection/Sthan-samaygata samparka (stc): Bangla nouns indi-noun or a pronoun with genitive marker. These space-time nouns may be followed by postposition. We relate the preceding noun or pronoun with space-time noun by Spatio-temporal connection/Sthan-samaygata samparka (stc) dependency relation. (6) se bA.Dira bhitara theke DAkachhe. Auxiliary verb/Sahayak kriya (vx): Auxiliary verbs in the verb chunks (VP) are related to main verbs by Auxiliary verb/Sahayak kriya (vx) dependency relation. (7) bAchchArA hese uThala. Part of/Kriya antargata bisheshya (pof): In conjunct verb chunks, the main verbs contain a nominal or adjectival part followed by a verb part. The first part is related to the second part by Part of/Kriya antargata bisheshya (pof) dependency relation. (8) ba;i melA bhAlabhAbe anuShThita haYechhe. Reduplication/Shabda dbaita (redup): Reduplication/Shabda dbaita (redup) depen-dency relations include nominal, pronominal and adjectival reduplications indicating plurality; verbal, adverbial, postpositional reduplications indicating continuity; reduplicated words indicating accuracy; onomatopoetic words, hedged expressions and also echo words. We consider the first occurrence of such pair of words as the head word and the second word as the dependent. In the following example, we have assigned two serial numbers (1 and 2) to disambiguate the head and the dependent. (9) bAchchArA galpa karate(1) karate(2) skula theke phirachhe. Fragment/Bhagnamsha (frag): Suffixes can be written either attached to the word or independently. The suffix occurring independently is related to the word by Fragment/Bhagnamsha (frag) dependency relation. (10) manamohana si.nha (bhAratera pradhAnamantrI) ra bidesha saphara Achhe. 5.2 Case/Karak The basic karak relations and their categories, as discussed in the Paninian framework (Bharati et al. 1999 ), from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) and also as they are defined in Bangla traditional grammar are of 6 types: Karta, Karma, Karan, Sampradan, Apadan and Adhikaran. In the scheme used by us, the Paninian karak relations, in general, are accepted with some changes as suggested in modern Bangla grammars Chatterji ( 2003 ), Chakravarty ( 2010 ). Some Bangla noun verb relations have been discussed in Chatterji et al. ( 2009 ).

It is difficult to consider sampradan karak relation in Bangla from syntax except in the instances where the words  X  X Ana X  (donate) and  X  X ampradAna X  (donate) are explicitly mentioned. This is because in Bangla sampradan are considered when the nature of the verb indicated that something is given selflessly.

Some Bangla grammarians have advocated that sampradan karak may not be considered separately in Bangla. In this context we quote Suniti Kumar Chatterji sampradan; Bangla does not have this. Some people use sampradan in Bangla for compatibility with Sanskrit; while others merge sampradan with karma. He considers the second approach reasonable (Page 247) and merged the sampradan with gauna karma (Page 241 and 299). 5.2.1 Subject/Karta Subject/Karta is the one who does, experiences or exists. It can also be or become something. However, it is referred to as Passive Karta when it acts as the doer of an action in a passive sentence. In Bangla, the karta may take a wide range of suffixes, like genitive, nominative, accusative, locative, etc. The verbs act in different ways and accordingly their subjects are defined. Because of the subcategorization of the subject, instead of including subject in the relationset we have included its subcategories.

Doer subject/Kriya sampadak karta (k1d): When the verb indicates some mental or physical exercise by an animate karta then its subject is defined as Doer subject/ Kriya sampadak karta (k1d).
 (11) bulabulite dhAna kheYechhe. Experiencer subject/Anubhab karta (k1e): When the verb expresses mental state, emotion or event without the subject X  X  conscious effort then its subject is defined as Experiencer subject/Anubhab karta (k1e). (12) AmAra shIta karachhe. Passive subject/Paroksha karta (k1p): When the verb indicates an action in passive construction then its subject is defined as Passive subject/Paroksha karta (k1p). This postpositions  X  X bArA X  (by),  X  X iYe X  (by) and  X  X arttRRika X  (by) or may take the suffix  X  X a X . (13) AnandamaTha ba Nkimachandra kartRRika rachita &lt;NULL&gt;. Even though this is the usual Bangla device for passivization, there may be confusion in certain cases. For example,  X  X a X  suffix is also attached with the karta of active voice verbs (See example 12) and  X  X bArA X ,  X  X iYe X  and  X  X arttRRika X  postpositions are also attached with karan. Again same word forms of some verbs are used both in active and passive voice. For example,  X  X aYechhe X  (has been done) in the following first example is in passive voice and in the second one  X  X aYechhe X  (has given birth) is in active voice. Therefore, we assigned separate tag for the karta of passive voice verbs though it conveys redundant information in many cases.  X  AmAra dbArA ei kAja haYechhe .  X  tAra jbara haYechhe . Noun of proposition/Bidheya karta or Samanadhikaran (k1s): Noun of proposition/ Bidheya karta or Samanadhikaran (k1s) is the complement of the karta in the sentence. (14) tini bhAla shikShaka chhilena. General subject/Sadharan karta (k1g): The subject is defined as General subject/ Sadharan karta (k1g) in the following contexts. The subjects which do not belong to tagged as k1g. 1. Subject of copula or be verb. 2. Subject of a verb in which the agent of the action is not specified, though it may 3. The subject which is in r6 relation with another noun or pronoun. (15) AmAdera siTi kaleja khuba bhAla &lt;NULL&gt;. 5.2.2 Object/Karma being affected by the action. It also includes some things or positions being achieved or attained through the action. A Bangla sentence with ditransitive verb or causative verb may have two karma. Similarly, transitive verbs and non-transitive verbs may have one and zero karma, respectively. In both active and passive constructions, the karma is tagged in the same way. Because of the subcategori-zation of the object, instead of including object in the relationset we have included its subcategories.

Transitive object/Sakarmak karma (k2t): Transitive object/Sakarmak karma (k2t) is the karma of a transitive verb. (16) bhUmikampa sAjAno gochhAno shaharaTA dhba.nsa karala. Direct object/Mukhya karma (k2m) &amp; Indirect object/Gauna karma (k2g): The two objects of a ditransitive verb of both passive and active sentences may be tagged as follows. Direct object/Mukhya karma (k2m) is the karma which undergoes the action. Indirect object/Gauna karma (k2g) is the one which is affected by the action, or a recipient or a beneficiary of the action. These two karma generally co-occur. (17) Ami mAke chiThi likhachhi. Purposive object/Uddyeshya karma (k2u) &amp; Predicative object/Bidheya karma (k2s): In the case of active as well as passive sentences with ditransitive verb, if the two objects are in complementary relation, the one which takes the complement is defined as Purposive object/Uddyeshya karma (k2u). This karma is attached with the suffix  X  X e X . Another one which stands as a complement is defined as Predicative object/Bidheya karma (k2s). (18) tini buddhadebake parameshbarera abatAra balena.
A ditransitive verb may take a pair of arguments which refer to the same thing or person. We tag them as k2u and k2s. A ditransitive verb may also take a pair of arguments which refer to two different things or persons. We tag them as k2m and k2g. The nature of such pairs of arguments are different. For example, in the following sentence (i),  X  X Andhike X  (Gandhi-to) and  X  X Apu X  (Bapu) are two karma of  X  X alA haYa X  (called). These two karma refer to same person. Therefore, they are tagged as k2u and k2s, respectively. In the following sentence (ii),  X  X Apu X  (Bapu) is the agent which is tagged as k1d and  X  X Andhike X  (Gandhi-to) and  X  X athATA X  (the words) are two karma of  X  X alala X  (told) and they are tagged as k2g and k2m, respectively. (i.) gAndhike bApu balA haYa. (ii.) bApu gAndhike kathATA balala. 5.2.3 Instrumental/Karan Instrumental/Karan(k3): Instrumental/Karan (k3) refers to a thing or object which action. (19) gAdhAke chAbuka mAro. 5.2.4 Ablative/Apadan indicates the source of an action or the distance between two places. Because of the subcategorization of the ablative, instead of including ablative in the relationset we have included its subcategories.

Place related ablative/Sthanbachak apadan (k5p): Place related Ablative/ Sthan-bachak apadan (k5p) refers to the source or origin of an act. (20) nadIra ghATa theke ghaTa bhese ela. State related ablative/Abasthabachak apadan (k5s): State related ablative/ Abastha-bachak apadan (k5s) is the state from where the action takes place. Here karta is not displaced, only object is displaced away from the state of karta. (21) AmAra ghara theke mandirera chU.DA dekhA yAYa. Time related ablative/Kalbachak apadan (k5t): Time related ablative/Kalbachak apadan (k5t) refers to the point of time which indicates the source of an action. (22) sakAla theke bRRiShTi nemechhe. Distance related ablative/Duratbabachak apadan (k5d): Distance related ablative/ Duratbabachak apadan (k5d) indicates the distance between two places one of which is the starting point and the other one is the ending point. The starting point place is tagged as k5d. The corresponding sentence contains two place names, a distance measure (either real or abstract) and a copula. (23) dilli theke kolakAtA bahu dUre &lt;NULL&gt;. 5.2.5 Locative/Adhikaran Locative/Adhikaran may be either the place where the action takes place, or the time when it takes place, or the domain about which it takes place or the state in including locative in the relationset we have included its subcategories.
Place related locative/Deshadhikaran (k7p): Place related locative/Deshadhik-aran (k7p) refers to the place that indicates the occurrence of the act. (24) bA.Dite phulera gAchha Achhe. Time related locative/Kaladhikaran (k7t): Time related locative/Kaladhikaran (k7t) is that point or duration of time which indicates the occurrence of the act. (25) bhore sUrya oThe. Domain related locative/Bishayadhikaran (k7d): Domain related locative/ Bisha-yadhikaran (k7d) is the thing or area, or things constituting a domain which can be pursued for study, or can be pursued as a profession. (26) tArA sAhitye paNDita &lt;NULL&gt;. State related locative/Bhabadhikaran (k7s): State related locative/Bhabadhikaran (k7s) refers to the state of being for something or someone at a particular time. (27) tArA khuba sukhe Achhe. 5.2.6 Other case-alike/Anyanya karak-sama Other than the five karak relations mentioned above, there are some more relations between a noun and a verb and between two nouns which are often confused with the karak relations.

Reason/Hetu (rh): Reason/Hetu (rh) represents the reason of the action. (28) bhaYe bhule yAYa debatAra nAma. Purpose/Uddeshya (ru): Purpose/Uddeshya (ru) represents the purpose of the action. (29) ratana unnatira janya kaThora parishrama kare. Destination/Gantabyasthal (des): Destination/Gantabyasthal (des) is the place related argument of the nontransitive moving verbs  X  X AoYA X  (go),  X  X hramana karA X  nominative marker (0 bibhakti). It is a karma but it behaves like an adhikaran. (30) rAma bA.Di giYechhila. Possession/Dakhal (r6v): Possession/Dakhal (r6v) is the relation between a noun and a verb where the noun acts as an owner. The owned part is considered as karma. This owner noun takes genitive marker and the corresponding verb is a  X  X e X  verb (existential). (31) rAmera ekaTA meYe Achhe. Comparison/Taratamya (Compr): Comparison/Taratamya (Compr) indicates a comparison between two noun phrases or between their attributes. For example, the phrase,  X  X  X itAra theke sundarI meYe X  X  [The girl more beautiful than Mita] indicates the comparison between the  X  X undarI X  attribute of  X  X itA X  and  X  X eYe X . (32) ekhAne aneke phuTabalera theke krikeTa pachhanda karena. Similarity/Sadrishya (sim): Similarity/Sadrishya (sim) describes the similarity between two noun phrases or between the attributes of two noun phrases. (33) se AmAra bonera mata &lt;NULL&gt;. 5.3 Modifier relations Most of the modifier relations can also be considered as intrachunk relations. However, sometimes, it is observed that the modifier relations exist between two different chunks.

Genitive/Sambandha (r6): Genitive/Sambandha (r6) refers to the relation between a noun or a pronoun with genitive marker and another noun. The r6 between such noun pairs are shown in Table 1 with an example of each.

For differentiating the r6 relation from other relations of the noun with genitive marker in a sentence, the following points may be considered. 1. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, preceding a postposition is not a 2. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker that precedes a noun of a complex 3. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, which are related to a mental verb 4. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, which is a karta of a passive verb is 5. A noun or pronoun with genitive marker, which is related with a verb by r 6 v is Associative relation/Saharthak sambandha (ras) &amp; Non-associative relation/ Namarthak sambandha (rasneg): Associative relation/Saharthak sambandha (ras) occurs with a noun or pronoun which accompanies another noun or pronoun in karta or karma position and it is followed by the postpositions  X  X a Nge X  (with),  X  X Athe X  (with), or  X  X iYe X  (by). The role of saharthak noun is same as the role of the noun with which it is attached. If it is attached with a karta, its role is a karta and if it is attached with a karma, its role is a karma. When the occurrence of such sambandha is negated, it is defined as Non-associative relation/Namarthak sambandha (rasneg). Namarthak sambandha takes postpositions  X  X hhA.DA X , or  X  X inA X .

Noun noun modifier/Sanyogmulak bisheshya (nnmod): Noun noun modifier/ Sanyogmulak bisheshya (nnmod) refers to the relation between two nouns. The two nouns, however, should not be in r6 relation. (36) rAjaputa jAti khuba yoddhA jAti &lt;NULL&gt;. Adjective noun modifier/Bisheshyer bisheshan (jnmod): Adjective noun modifier/ Bisheshyer bisheshan (jnmod) is used to relate an adjective which modifies the numerical modifier etc. have been included into this relation.

(45) ei mandiraTi khuba prAchIna &lt;NULL&gt;. Question words are tagged according to their usage in an interrogative sentence. How question words act in sentences are shown below.  X   X  X e X  (who-singular),  X  X i X  (what),  X  X ArA X  (who-plural),  X  X onaTA X  (which) etc. act  X   X  X i X  (what),  X  X Ake X  (whom),  X  X Adera X  (whose-plural),  X  X onaTA X  (which) etc. as  X   X  X ena X  (why) is used as reason (rh) or purpose (ru).  X   X  X akhana X  (when),  X  X othAYa X  (where) etc. act as adhikaran.  X   X  X ata X  (how much) is tagged as acomp or jnmod.  X   X  X i X  (what) is sometimes added with yes/no type question and is tagged as  X  When the question words  X  X i X  (what) and  X  X ata X  (how much) are related with the 5.4 Few other interchunk relations Some other interchunk relations are defined below.

Conjunct/Samyojak abyay (ccof): Conjunct/Samyojak abyay (ccof) conjoins between two independent words, phrases or clauses using the conjunct words  X  X ba.n X  (and),  X  X intu X  (but),  X  X  X  (and), etc. or using the conjunct symbols  X , X ,  X - X  etc. (46) darshaka upache pa.Dla nA kintu udaghATita hala eka natuna dika. Preconjunct/Abasthatmak abyay (pcc): Preconjunct/Abasthatmak abyay (pcc) relation is tagged between a subordinating conjunction and a verb. The subordinating conjunction may be in the preconjunct or in the postconjunct construction. (47) yadio Ami bAraNa karalAma tabuo se gela. Address word/Sambodhan sabda (rad): Address word/Sambodhan sabda (rad) is the relation between the address word and the verb. Address word is used when a person is addressed to. (48) sImA, tomAra yAoYA chalabe nA. Particle/Bakyalankar abyay (par): Particle/Bakyalankar abyay (par) is the relation between the particle and the verb. (49) nyAyya kAraNa kintu nei. Question mark/Prashnabodhak chihna (qs): Question mark/Prashnabodhak chihna (qs) relation is used between the question mark ( ? ) of the interrogative sentence and the verb. (50) tomAra kAke beshi pachhanda &lt;NULL&gt;? End/Samapti (end): End/Samapti (end) is used to indicate the relation between non-interrogative sentence markers ( j and ! ) and the verb of the main clause. (51) ete jami kama naShTa haYa. Symbol/Chihna (sym): Symbol/Chihna (sym) is the relation between a symbol except the sentence end markers and those which are used to join two independent clauses and the verb. (52) rohana, tui chA khete yA.
Dependent clauses are attached to the main clause with subordinating conjunc-tions. When the subordinating conjunction comes before the dependent clause, then it is called preconjunct. When the subordinating conjunction comes after the dependent clause, then it is called postconjunct. If a single clause sentence contains a subordinating conjunction, then it is tagged as particle. It is generally placed at the beginning of the sentence. 5.5 Interclause relations Interclause relations include relative and complement clause constructions where there is a main clause and at least one dependent clause. In relative clause construction the dependent clause is connected with the main clause by a referent. In initial position of the main clause.

Referent/Nirdesak (ref): Referent/Nirdesak (ref) relation is found between two clauses when a coreferent also surfaces. The role of the dependent clause is the same as the coreferent in the main clause. The ref relation is assigned between the verb of the dependent clause and the coreferent. (53) yakhana bRRiShTi pa.Dachhila takhana se chhAtA niYe gela. Clausal Star/Bakyamsha samagra (clausal*): Clausal Star/Bakyamsha samagra (clausal*) relation is found between two clauses when the coreferent does not surface, and the relation is assigned between the verb of the dependent clause and the verb of the main clause. Here,  X * X  is a variable indicating different dependency (deshadhikaran), k7t (kaladhikaran), etc. The  X * X  indicates the dependency relation between the two clauses. For simplicity, we have not considered subdivisions of karaks (except adhikaran) in this variable position. (54) yakhana bRRiShTi pa.Dachhila se chhAtA niYe gela. (55) ye ba;iTA Ami niYechhilAma Ami pherata diYe diYechhi. Clausal complement/Bakyamsha sampurak (clausalcomp): In a complement clause complementizer. The dependent clause is considered as clausal complement of the main clause. The verb of the main clause and the verb of the complement clause are connected by Clausal complement/Bakyamsha sampurak (clausalcomp) dependency relation. (56) se balala ye se kAla kolakAtA yAbe. Complementizer/Sampurak (comp): In the complement clause construction, Com-plementizer/ Sampurak (comp) relation is between the complementizer and the verb of the complement clause. The complementizer which is the introducer of the complement clause acts as a connector between the main clause and the dependent clause. It is attached to the verb of the complement clause. In our analysis, Bangla complementizers are  X  X e X  (that),  X  X ale X  (that) or a comma. In example (56)  X  X e X  is related with the verb  X  X Abe X  by comp dependency relation.

Apart from being a complementizer,  X  X ale X  (due to) can also indicate a reason clause (clausalrh) in multiclause Bangla sentences. It can also be used as a particle, shown in example (55)) or a personal pronoun which acts as referent in the subordinate clause.  X  X e X  can also be used as a particle. 6 Analysis of the scheme and the annotation process We have used the proposed dependency annotation scheme to build KGPBenTree-bank 3 . Then we have analyzed both the annotation scheme and the resource using standard analysis methods used in many other Treebanks. These analyses show the usability of the resource for other research purposes. 6.1 Corpus statistics We have used the dependency relations to annotate a treebank of 4167 sentences (56,514 words). The sentences are taken from Blogs, Multikulti ( www.multikulti. manually in two different levels namely lexical category and morphological values as a part of the Part-of-Speech Tagset (IL-POST) project undertaken by MSR India. This two level manually annotated sentences are used as input to our annotation task. The distribution of the length (number of words) of the sentences are plotted in Fig. 2 . The length varies from 3 to 67 words, while 93.95 % sentences (3913 sentences) have length between 4 and 29. 6.2 Tagset overview KGPBenTreebank. Some relations from the top and bottom positions of the list and their number of occurrences are shown in Table 2 . Maximum number of usage is found for ccof relation as there are two ccof tags from the conjunct to each of the parts which are joined by the conjunct. Next highest number of occurrence is found for jnmod due to its usage for different types of modifiers like quantifier, numerical modifier, etc. Number of occurrences of pof indicates the number of complex predicates in the corpus. There are 1039 occurrences of clausalk2. k5d, clausalk7p and clausalk7d have limited usage in Bangla.

The distribution of the occurrence of dependency relations in the annotated corpus is shown in Fig. 3 . Among 63 dependency relations 46 relations have been used less than 1,000 times and 10 relations have been used more than 2000 times. So, relations of the tagset have been used to capture the relations of small number of word pairs. 6.3 Inter-annotator agreement Three annotators have annotated KGPBenTreebank for 3 years. To calculate the agreement between the annotators, a part of KGPBenTreebank containing 485 sentences have been annotated independently by all of them. We calculate the inter-annotators agreement using Fleiss X  Kappa as discussed in Fleiss ( 1971 ).
Fleiss X  Kappa gives a measure (between 0 and 1) of agreement for more than 2 annotator readability. Fleiss X  Kappa is calculated as follows.

Suppose N is the total number of words, n is the number of annotators assigning dependency relations to the words and K is the number of dependency relations used for assignment. N n is the total number of assignments of relations made by the number of annotators assigning ith word to jth dependency relation. The proportion of all assignments used for assigning jth dependency relation may be defined using Eq. ( 1 ). The mean proportion of assignments on all dependency relations may be defined using Eq. ( 2 ).
 Among n  X  n 1  X  2 pairs of annotators, the extent to which the annotator pairs are agreed for the ith word is defined using Eq. ( 3 ). The mean of agreements for all words may be defined using Eq. ( 4 ).
 The degree of agreement between n annotators is computed in terms of Fleiss X  Kappa ( j ) using Eq. 5 . When the annotators are agreed on all assignments, then j  X  1. The calculated Fleiss X  Kappa for the three annotators on 485 sentences containing 6356 words is calculated to be 0.9288. So, the annotators have almost perfect agreement while annotating KGPBenTreebank. 6.4 Length of dependencies The average length of dependency relations is 2.82 while the longest and shortest dependency relations are clausalcondition and qsk 2 and their average lengths are 8.35 and 1, respectively.

In KGPBenTreebank, among 56,524 words, 4167 words (one word from each sentence) are the roots of the sentences. Root words of the sentences are not attached to any other word. The remaining 52,357 words of KGPBenTreebank are attached to some other words of the sentence. Among them, 28876 words are related to adjacent words (previous or next word), 8290 words are related to the words with distance 2 (previous to previous or next to next word), and so on. The increasing length of the dependency relations is plotted against the log of the number of words which are attached to correspondingly distant words in Fig. 4 . First two points of the plot are (X=1, Y= log 10 (28876)) and (X=2, Y= log 10 (8290)).
From this plot we observe that relations in KGPBenTreebank are mostly short distance relations and as the length of the relations increases the log of number of words related to the word with that distance decreases almost exponentially. 7 Comparison between Hindi and Bangla schemes The dependency annotation model discussed in this paper borrows from the Paninian grammatical model of Bharati et al. ( 1999 ), Hindi dependency scheme of Sharma et al. ( 2007 ) used in Anncorra, the typed dependency relation model de Marneffe and Manning ( 2008 ) followed in Stanford Parser v1.6.9 and the modern Bangla grammatical model discussed by Chatterji 2003 and Bamandev Chakravarty 2010 .

In both KGPBenTreebank and Anncorra, Karak relations are divided into mentioned in Sect. 7.1 . A detailed explanation on the differences between them is given in Sect. 7.2 . 7.1 Differences of Karak division schemes In KGPBenTreebank, five finer divisions of subjective case (karta karak) are used on the basis of the type of the activity of the subject. 1. doer subject (Kriya sampadak karta) 2. experiencer subject (Anubhab karta) 3. passive subject (Paroksha karta) 4. noun of proposition (Bidheya karta or Samanadhikaran) 5. general subject (Sadharan karta)
In Anncorra, six finer divisions of subjective case (karta karak) are used. 1. doer (karta) 2. causer subject (prayojaka karta) 3. causee subject (prayojya karta) 4. mediator causer (madhyastha karta) 5. noun complement of subject (karta samanadhikarana) 6. clausal subject
In KGPBenTreebank, five finer divisions of objective case (karma karak) are used. 1. transitive object (sakarmak karma) 2. direct object (mukhya karma) 3. indirect object (gauna karma) 4. purposive object (uddyeshya karma) 5. predicative object (bidheya karma)
In Anncorra, four finer divisions of objective case (karma karak) are used. 1. direct object (mukhya karma) 2. indirect object (gauna karma) 3. object complement (karma samanadhikaran) [In KGPBenTreebank it occurs as 4. goal, destination (k2p) [In KGPBenTreebank we have used it as other cases-
In KGPBenTreebank, sampradan karak is not considered and is merged with object/karma.

There are two finer divisions of sampradan (k4) in Anncorra. 1. recipient (sampradan) 2. experiencer karta (anubhava karta)
In KGPBenTreebank, place and time are tagged differently. Therefore, here, there are four finer divisions of ablative case (apadan karak). 1. place related ablative (sthanbachak apadan) 2. state related ablative (abasthabachak apadan) 3. time related ablative (kalbachak apadan) 4. distance related ablative (duratbabachak apadan)
In Anncorra, ablative case (apadan karak) has two finer divisions. 1. apadan karak/source which is related to both place and time. 2. prakriti apadan  X  X ource material X  in verbs denoting change of state.
In KGPBenTreebank, locative case (adhikaran karak) has four finer divisions as domain and state or condition are treated in different way. 1. place related locative (deshadhikaran) 2. time related locative (kaladhikaran) 3. domain related locative (bishayadhikaran) 4. state related locative (bhabadhikaran)
In Anncorra, locative case (adhikaran karak) has three finer divisions. 1. place related locative (deshadhikaran) 2. time related locative (kaladhikaran) 3. domain related locative (vishayadhikaran)
The relations used for connecting two clauses in KGPBenTreebank are given below. Here,  X * X  can be replaced by the relation of the two clauses. 1. referent (nirdesak) 2. clausal* (bakyamsha samagra) 3. clausal complement (bakyamsha sampurak) 4. complementizer (sampurak)
Anncorra has three types of relative clauses. 1. nmod_relc (relative clause constructions modifying a noun) 2. rbmod_relc (jo-vo construction modifying an adverb) 3. jjmod_relc (jo-vo clause construction modifying an adjective) 7.2 Overall differences of annotation schemes Extensive work has been done on developing Hindi treebank. The dependency annotating Anncorra. We have borrowed some features of these annotation schemes in the proposed Bangla dependency annotation scheme. Therefore, we discuss the differences between the existing Hindi annotation schemes and the scheme proposed in this paper.

Each difference is explained with an example and a dependency structure. The attachments and tags used by Anncorra which are different from KGPBenTreebank, are shown using thick lines and boldface in the dependency structures. The intrachunk relations of KGPBenTreebank are not included in Anncorra chunk level dependency treebank. The intrachunk attachments are shown using dotted lines and intrachunk relations are underlined.  X  Unlike Hindi treebank, causative subject [prayojaka karta] (pk1), mediator causer  X  Following the opinion in Chatterji ( 2003 ) we have merged recipient (sampradan  X  Prati upapad  X  X irection X  ( rd ) relation of Hindi treebank is not used in the  X  In respect of locative case, Anncorra treats both domain and state (or condition  X  Relation point of time ( rpt ) relation is used in Anncorra to connect the starting point  X  In Anncorra, the intensifiers modifying adjectives are tagged as jjmod . Whereas  X  In Anncorra, karta is inserted in recoverable condition i.e., when it is not 8 Conclusion The present paper is on building a dependency annotation scheme for modern Bangla language. The relationship set in the proposed scheme is categorized into 3 levels: intrachunk relations, interchunk relations and interclause relations. Though most of the relations in the treebank have syntactic orientation, semantic relations also have been considered in some cases where the need is felt.

The scheme has been created with the help of traditional Bangla grammar books, the existing schemes for Indian languages and the modern Bangla grammar books. Further, the scheme is corrected and enriched during the annotation process with the help of the annotators and some Bangla language experts. Then the annotated corpus is corrected based on the modified tagset. Further study would be more effective for the improvement or enrichment of the scheme.

Three annotators have electronically annotated 4167 Bangla sentences to test the proposed scheme. The inter-annotator agreement value on 485 Bangla sentences is found to be 0.9288 in terms of Fleiss X  Kappa which indicates the consistency of the treebank. However, analysis is required to find and correct the mistakes in the annotation.
