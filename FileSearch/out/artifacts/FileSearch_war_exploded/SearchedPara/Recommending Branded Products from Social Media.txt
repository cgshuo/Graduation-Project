 E-commerce companies are increasingly encouraging their users to connect to social media venues such as Facebook and Pinterest. The main strategic goal of such social con-nections is to boost user interaction and adoption on social media. However only a few efforts have been focused so far on leveraging users X  social profiles to personalize the e-commerce experience and to recommend products of inter-est. In this paper, we start exploring this topic by investi-gating if a user X  X  social media profile can be used to predict and recommend what type of products and what brands the social user is more likely to buy. More specifically, we study the correlation between the brands liked by the user on so-cial media sites and those purchased on an e-commerce site. We then leverage these correlations in a brand prediction system, showing that social media can be effectively used to recommend branded products when user-user collaborative filtering techniques are used.

In recent years many e-commerce companies such as eBay and Amazon have been moving into the social commerce domain by allowing users to interact with social media sites (e.g. Facebook). The main strategic goal of social media interaction is to provide users with a more engaging and social experience, thus increasing user retention and adop-tion. Such interactions are typically made possible by ded-icated API services that connect a user X  X  social media and e-commerce accounts. For example, eBay users can connect to their Facebook account, thus sharing with eBay the set of liked pages and other basic social information.

The social media profile information may be used by the e-commerce companies for social-driven applications. Some typical examples of these applications comprehend sharing purchases and  X  X ikes X  with social media friends and social gifting. However, e-commerce companies have surprisingly not fully developed technologies to leverage social media in-formation to improve product recommendation and to bet-ter predict users X  purchase behaviors. Such technologies could not only help improve recommendation for existing e-commerce users, but also and more importantly solve the cold start problem, i.e. providing an engaging and person-alized experience to new users.

In this paper we show that social media information alone, namely Facebook  X  X ikes X  and user demographics, provide useful information for recommending personalized branded products. We explore several unsupervised algorithms show-ing that social recommendation works best in a two-stage setting. First, domains of interests (e.g. fashion) are in-ferred for each user [25]. Then, the user is recommended brands from the domains of interest using collaborative fil-tering techniques.
We deal with the problem of recommending branded prod-ucts to social media users. More specifically, we aim at pre-dicting which brands (e.g. Nike , Coach ) the user will buy using solely information derived from the social network. Such a recommendation system would help in several prac-tical scenarios, including: (1) build a cold start recommender system, by providing branded product recommendations to social media users who join the e-commerce website as new users and opt to connect to their social media accounts; (2) improve existing product recommendation algorithms by providing social priors; and (3) provide e-commerce compa-nies (e.g. eBay) with tools for targeted social media cam-paigns.

We choose Facebook as the social network, and eBay as the e-commerce website. We focus on the restricted set of Facebook information that users are typically required to share with the e-commerce website when they connect to their social accounts: demographic information and the pages that they have liked on Facebook. As regards the set of brands we want to predict, we use a list of 4,445 brands included in the eBay database.

The paper has two main goals. The first goal is to explore if brands liked on Facebook correlate to brands purchased on eBay. The second goal is to leverage these correlations to recommend branded products using a user-user collabo-rative filtering system.
Our paper has the following main contributions:
To our knowledge this is the first work that systematically analyzes the correlation between brands in social media pro-files and brands purchase behaviors on e-commerce websites and that implements a brand recommendation system based on social information.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant previous work. Section 3 reports various statistics of our dataset. In Section 4 we describe differ-ent algorithms for recommending branded products from so-cial media information. We present experimental results for these algorithms in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes our work and describes future research directions.
Recommender systems have been widely studied in the past [17, 5, 18, 13, 7] and applied to various domains. E-commerce is a typical application for these systems, where they are used to predict or recommend product purchases. Two main techniques are most used: collaborative filtering and content-based.

Collaborative Filtering Methods . The underlying as-sumption of collaborative filtering methods is that users who carry similar characteristics tend to like similar products. In user-user systems, users are typically represented in a vec-tor space which summarizes their characteristics (e.g. de-mographics, purchased products, review scores assigned to products). These systems suggest new products to a user by selecting a set of products that similar users have bought or reviewed in the past, but the user has not [21]. Sarwar et al. [19] apply nearest neighbor collaborative filtering for rec-ommending purchases and predicting movie ratings, showing that dimensionality reduction techniques solve scaling issues on large-data without losing accuracy. Some studies [18, 13] have focused on the problem of sparsity .

Item-Item collaborative filtering, on the other hand, makes product recommendations directly based on users X  past be-haviors on e-commerce websites. Sarwar et al. [20] propose a system that models item to item relationships and demon-strate that such systems deliver good quality recommenda-tions in sparse data situations. The item-item method is also promising for incremental modeling and has big perfor-mance gain over user-user modelling.

In this paper, we apply the k nearest neighbor algorithm similar to [19] to the brand recommendation task. Our sys-tem explicitly integrates collaborative filtering techniques in the feature selection phase. Our selection method for Face-book likes is inspired by model-based approaches to collab-orative filtering discussed among others by Breese et al. [4].
Content-based Methods . In contrast to collaborative filtering methods, content-based methods often utilize the vast overload of information on the web, such as product reviews, customer opinions, and social media (e.g. blogs, tweets) to directly make product recommendations. In re-cent years, such systems have become more popular. Wi-etsma and Ricci [23] propose a system that structures prod-uct reviews to help rate and recommend products in a mo-bile decision aid scenario. Aciar et al. [2] develop a rec-ommender system based on consumer product reviews. The authors apply text mining techniques to extract useful infor-mation from review comments and then define an ontology to translate the review information into a form suitable for utilization by a recommendation system. Sen et al. [22] use users X  tag preferences to predict movie preferences and demonstrate that such content-based systems are more ef-fective than collaborative filtering methods. Recommendation on social media is a fairly new topic. Most work focuses on suggesting interesting content items (e.g. URLs, pictures, posts) or new friends. Social recom-mender systems differ from classical ones in that they often leverage existing social relations to boost the recommenda-tions.

Though some interest has focused on collaborative filter-ing [9], most popular are content-based methods . These systems assume that the content that users share on the so-cial network reflects their own interests, thus recommending new items that are similar to their own shared content [16, 15]. Abel et al. [1] represent users by a frequency vector of the hashtags and entities that they mention in their tweets. A similar vector is built for URLs shared in Twitter by an-alyzing the content of their links. Users are then recom-mended URLs whose vector is most similar to theirs. Sim-ilarly, Chen et al. [6] represent users with the bag-of-words of all terms of their tweets, and the URLs with the terms of the tweets that mention them. Unlike these methods, we do not have access to the social content (e.g. Facebook posts) due to the current scope of eBay X  X  Facebook Connect.
Community-based methods make the assumption that the content coming from a user X  X  friends or authoritative users is more likely to be interesting for a user than the rest. This assumption is usually combined with content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. Yan et al. [24] select per-sonalized tweets using random-walks on a graph that joins the user X  X  friends and tweets. The walk is bootstrapped by selecting with higher probability the tweets whose content is similar to what was previously posted by the user. Jamali and Ester [12] also use a random-walk approach, but they in-tegrate collaborative filtering instead of content-based tech-niques to estimate the probability of a graph transition. Jiang et al. [14] combine user topic preferences and social influence into a probabilistic matrix factorization model, rec-ommending items that are both topically similar to the pre-vious user X  X  preferences and authored by people who are trusted by the user. Community-based systems show bet-ter performance with respect to purely content-based and collaborative filtering methods. In our work we cannot use community-based techniques since we do not have access to the social graph.
Some research has investigated the broader topic of how social network influences users in their purchases. Bhatt et al. [3] empirically demonstrate that a user X  X  friends exercise  X  X eer pressure X : if friends widely adopt a product, the user is more likely to buy it. Guo et al. [8] study the trading dynamics on the e-commerce social network Taobao. They show that buyers are more likely to purchase from sellers that friends in their network have already bought from (in-formation passing). They prove that when a buyer has to decide from which seller to buy a product, the social net-work has a bigger influence on the decision than the sellers X  ratings and the price. Similar findings are found in [10, 11].
All these studies assume that the e-commerce site and the social network are integrated into one platform (e.g. Taobao), or that the e-commerce site has holistic access to the social network. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to focus on a more practical and common sce-nario, where the system (e.g. e-commerce companies such as Amazon and eBay) has limited access to the social net-work information.
In this paper we use a set of 9,398 eBay users that con-nected their account to the Facebook profile. The set is derived from a bigger set of 13,619 users described in [25], from which we select only those users who have liked and purchased at least one of 4,445 brands contained in the eBay database 1 . These brands are organized in nine eBay meta-categories 2 which refer to four different verticals, as shown in Table 1. Note that some brands may appear in multiple categories/verticals, e.g. 3M appears both in the Consumer Electronics and in the Home &amp; Garden meta-categories.
For each user in the dataset we select the brand pages that the user has liked on Facebook and we retain those brands that also appear in the eBay database. We also extract the items that the user bought on eBay, if the brand of the item is in the eBay database. For each user in the dataset we hence store the following information:
As we shall see later in the paper, this constraint in practice is not a must have. Using the k nearest neighbor and collab-orative filtering algorithms, brand recommendation can be done based on social media profile even when the user has not liked any brands.
Complete eBay category structure is available at http:// www.ebay.com/sch/allcategories/all-categories .
 Table 1: Number of Brands in Each Meta-category.
 Vertical eBay meta-category #Brands Electronics Cameras &amp; Photo 207 Fashion Clothing, Shoes &amp; Accessories 3,419 Home Home &amp; Garden 602 Sports Sporting Goods 441 Basic statistics for the final dataset are summarized in Table 2. Figure 1 reports the distribution of brand pages liked on Facebook for our users, i.e., it indicates how many users have liked a given number of brands. The function is a perfect power law, meaning that most users like few brands, and few users like many brands (max is 373, average is 12, and the median is 6 brands). While not surprising, this indicates that our task is inherently hard: for most users we have to rely on scarce Facebook information for recommending brands for purchases.

Figure 2 reports the distribution of likes for brands, i.e., it indicates how many brands have a given number of likes. The function follows a power law with only a few outlier fluc-tuations, showing that most of the brands have few likes and only a few brands receive many likes (max is 2814, average is 38, and the median is 5 likes). The fact that users X  likes are so sparse poses a great challenge for our recommendation task when likes are used as features.

As regards user purchase behaviors on eBay, the distri-bution of purchased brands is also power law, as shown in Figure 3, indicating that most users tend to buy a limited number of brands (max is 222, average is 8, and the median is 5 brands).

Similar to what we found out in our previous study, we notice that our dataset has a prevalence of women (64.9% of all users) and of people aged between 25 and 44 (57% of all users). In Section 3.2 we will explore if users in different demographic groups have distinctive purchase behaviors.
In this section we explore if different gender/age groups have peculiar preferences when they buy branded products on eBay or like brands on Facebook.

We first compute for each group the percentage of users who buy in each brand, and then perform a t -test. Results of the t -test for the women/men distinction show that the Figure 1: Distribution of liked brands for users.
 difference in percentage is statistically significant 3 for a large set of brands. Women buy significantly more than men in 795 brands with a statistical significance of p = 0 . 99. The most female-polarized brands, e.g. Chanel and Cuisinart , are mostly in Fashion and Home verticals. Men buy sig-nificantly more than women in 104 brands, e.g. Nokia and Wilson , mostly in Electronics and Sports verticals. For the remaining 3546 brands we do not observe any significant dif-ference. These results show that purchase behavior strongly varies across genders.

Differences across age groups are less strong. For example, only 600 brands show a significant difference between age groups 25-34 and 45-54. In general we observe that young people (25-34) tend to be prevalent in Sports , while older people (45+) are prevalent in Electronics and Home brands.
The overall demographic study suggests that gender and age are important signals for recommending brands for so-cial media users. In Section 4.2.2 we will explain how this information is utilized.
 We also study gender and age differences on Facebook. Similarly to purchase behaviors, we observe the same de-mographic differences. It is worth noting that these results refer to our dataset of 9K Facebook-connected eBay users, and may not generalize to the general population of eBay users or to the whole e-commerce spectrum.
We do 10-fold cross-validation where percentage difference in each fold is taken as a sample of size 10.
 Figure 3: Distribution of purchased brands for users.
In this section we explore how focused users are when they purchase from e-commerce web sites ( purchase focus ) and when they like brands on Facebook ( like focus ).
As regards purchase focus , let us represent with P ( u ) ranked probability with which a user u buys from the k th favorite brand. This rank is obtained by first estimating the probability P ( u, b ) of a user u buying in each brand b , and by successively ranking the probabilities: where purc ( u, b ) is the number of purchases of u for brand b , and B is the set of all brands.

To have an estimation of the overall purchase focus we average the P ( u ) k across all users U . We thus obtain the probability distribution for the event of an average user buy-ing in the top k ranked brands:
The hypothesis of a chaotic world where a user buys ran-domly from different brands would be proved if the distri-bution was fitted by a uniform distribution. To check the fit, we apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit test. The result of the test shows that the hypothesis is rejected. As expected, users do not buy brands randomly.
More specifically, more than 45% of the times an average user buys from the first preferred brand and 18% of the times from the second preferred brand. The top 5 brands collectively account for about 85% of a user X  X  purchases of branded products.

Similarly to the above, we also applied the K-S test to check the like focus . We again verified that users do not like brands on Facebook in a random function, and that they have a limited set of brands that they like: on average a Facebook user X  X  most favorite category accounts for 49% of all liked brands, the second about 21%. The top 5 categories collectively account for about 92% of a user X  X  liked brands on Facebook.

Overall, the results above prove that users express strong personal interests for certain brands on Facebook and are highly focused when purchasing branded products online.
Note that the results reported for  X  X rands X  in this section are in line with those reported in [25], where we showed that users are also very focused at the higher level of  X  X ategory X  (e.g. Fashion, Electronics).
In this section we study the correlation between brands X  pages liked on Facebook and brands purchased on eBay. At the end of the study we would expect that for example users who like many luxury handbag brands are likely to buy items from Salvatore Ferragamo or Burberry and alike.

Let us define two variables b l and b p : b l is defined on the space of users who like brand b on Facebook; and b p is the set of users who have bought at least one item in brand b on eBay. We compute association and predictability for pairs ( b , b p ) using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), which measures the degree of association between two events. The higher the pmi score, the stronger the correlation. We esti-mate PMI as follows: where | b l , b p | is the number of users who have liked and pur-chased brand b ; | b p | and | b l | are respectively the number of users liking and buying brand b ; and | U | is the total number of users. Table 3 reports the top five correlated brands for four example brands.

These results are very promising. The large number of discovered correlations suggests that purchased brands may be predicted and recommended by looking at the Facebook brands liked by the user 4 . We will discuss various algorithms to utilize user X  X  liked brands on Facebook for recommenda-tion in the next section.
The HTC to HTC mapping indicates that many users who like HTC indeed buy HTC products.
In the previous section we have shown that users have focused behaviors when buying branded products online. We have also shown that basic information from Facebook (namely demographics and liked brands) have promising cor-relation with purchase behaviors. In this section we leverage this information to build a recommendation system, whose goal is to predict/recommend brands for purchases using Facebook likes and demographic information as sole fea-tures. This setting fits well a cold-start situation in which a social media user for the first time joins the e-commerce web site and shares the social media profile, and the web site wants to provide interesting recommendations from day zero.

Our system is a pipeline of two different modules. The first module selects a large set of candidate brands by ex-ploring user interests at a general level. The second mod-ule applies accurate heuristics to select the final brands to recommend among those output brands from the fist mod-ule. The core intuition of the two-module pipeline is that applying the Brand Selection Module alone, i.e. without pre-filtering, would produce noisy and inaccurate results. Indeed, it often happens that Facebook users  X  X ike X  pages without a real interest. Our intuition is that these  X  X ninter-esting X  likes can be filtered out by selecting only pages that refer to the domain of passion of the user ( Log-Reg Module ). We describe the two modules here below in more details.
This module uses a Logistic Regression (LR) classifier to estimate the probability of a user buying in a specific eBay meta-category (e.g. Sporting Goods ). The classifier uses as features the likes of the user and the demographic profile. Full details of the system are presented in [25]. For each user, the classifier outputs a purchase probability for each meta-category. In the current study, we use this output to pre-filter the brands to recommend in the second module by applying a threshold on the probability. For example, sup-pose that for a given user the classifier assigns 0.6 probability for the meta-category Sporting Goods and 0.1 for Home &amp; Garden . Suppose also that we apply a probability threshold of 0.5. In this case, the module would output only brands from the Sporting Goods meta-category.
This module applies specific strategies to select brands to recommend from the output of the Log-Reg module. In the rest of this section we present different strategies, ranging from simple heuristic methods to collaborative filtering ap-proaches.
One reasonable and intuitive way to select brands to rec-ommend is to rank all brands according to their popularity , i.e., the number of users in a training set who have bought products from the brand. Then the top brands will be rec-ommended to all users in a testing set, without using any personalization. In our experiments we will refer to this strategy as B 1 and we will empirically recommend the top eight brands, because in our dataset users on average buy from eight brands.

Another naive baseline strategy uses the intuition that users buy what they like, i.e. the strategy selects the brands that the user has liked on Facebook. In the experiments we will refer to this strategy as B 2 and we will rank the selected brands using the popularity score described above.
The K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm has been widely and successfully used in recommender systems in the past years (e.g. [19]). We here apply KNN by representing each user in a boolean vectorial space, where dimensions corre-spond to likes of Facebook pages. If a user likes a specific page the corresponding dimension is set to 1, otherwise to 0. Note that by including all likes, and not only brand likes, al-lows us to perform effective recommendations even for users who have not liked a brand, but still have many likes in other domains.

For each user, we find the top-k nearest neighbors by com-puting cosine similarity between the user and all other users. In our experiments we empirically set k = 5. Once the top-k neighbors are found we select the brands to recommend following either of the two strategies below: Like-based KNN . In the first strategy, referred as L knn the experiments, we select and rank brands by performing a majority voting among the top-k neighbors X  liked brands. For example if two of the top-k neighbors liked Nike , Nike will receive a score of two and will be ranked accordingly. Purchase-based KNN . This strategy, referred as P knn in the experiments, selects the brands that are most purchased by the top-k neighbors. More in detail, each brand pur-chased by any of the top-k neighbors is assigned the follow-ing score: where topK ( u ) is the set of top-k neighbors of user u ; cos ( u, v ) is the cosine similarity between the target user u and a user v ; purch ( v, b ) and purch ( v, B ) are respectively the number of items from brand b bought by user v and the number of items from any brand bought by user v . This score gives a higher weight to brands that are most purchased by closest neighbors. In our experiment we empirically set k = 5.
In this section we explore user-user collaborative filtering to improve the recall of the selection strategies proposed earlier in this section. Suppose that for a given user the top brand output from P KNN is Burberry . Even though none of the top-k neighbors bought Louis Vuitton and Prada , it would make sense to recommend these two brands as well, as they target the same segment of users.

In order to capture this intuition, we compute a database of  X  X elated brands X , i.e. for each of the 4,445 brands in our dataset we discover the list of most related brands according to the purchase history on eBay, as follows.

We collect a dataset of all purchases of any of our 4,445 brands done by eBay users in 2012. This accounts for hun-dreds of millions of purchases done by tens of millions users. We then compute the relatedness between any pair of brands b and b 2 using the Jaccard Index as follows: Table 4: Summary of Recommendation Algorithms.
 Algorithm Recommendation B 1 most popular brands purchased by users B 2 brands liked by current user
L knn brands liked by k nearest neighbors
P knn brands purchased by k nearest neighbors B 1 + R most popular brands + related brands B 2 + R liked brands + related brands
L knn + R brands liked by knn + related brands
P knn + R brands purchased by knn + related brands Table 5: Confusion Matrix of Purchased and Rec-ommended Brands.
 Purchased tp : true positive f n : false negative
Not purchased f p : false positive tn : true negative where | b 1  X  b 2 | is the set of users who have purchased both brands and | b 1  X  b 2 | is the set of users who have purchased either brand or both.

The relatedness scores are then normalized to the [0 , 1] interval by dividing by the maximum score. Finally, brands that are highly related to the original selected brands are also included in the recommendation set using the follow-ing policy: the top-5 related brands are selected for each original brand unless the relatedness score is below 0.30 (i.e. the score is less than 30% of the top-related brand X  X  score). These parameters have been heuristically selected for our experiments. We do not report the details of the tuning process for lack of space. As an example, the top 10 related brands for Burberry are: Gucci , Prada , Louis Vuitton , Dolce Gabbana , Tory Burch , Fendi , Chanel , Salvatore Ferragamo , Hugo Boss , and Lacoste .

In summary, the brand selection module provides four dif-ferent selection methods (two baselines and two KNN-based algorithms) and one method to expand the set of recom-mended brands. Table 4 summarizes the possible combina-tions of these systems and the notation that will be used in the experimental section.
As for gold standard dataset for the experiments we use the 9,398 eBay users who connected to Facebook, as de-scribed in Section 3. For each user u the task is to recom-mend brands that users have actually bought.

As for evaluation measures we use Precision and Re-call to evaluate the recommendation models. Precision mea-sures the fraction of recommended brands that are actually purchased by the user, and recall measures the fraction of purchased brands that are recommended by the algorithm. F 1 combines the two. Given the confusion matrix in Ta-ble 5, precision is defined as P = tp tp + fp , recall is defined as
We evaluate our models using 10-fold cross validation in order to reliably compute statistical significance values. For each fold we use 90% of the users as training and 10% as testing. We compute the above measures for each fold by averaging the measures over all testing users. Algorithm P recision Recall F 1 User% B 1 0.137 0.231 0.172 100% B 2 0.165 0.238 0.195 100%

P knn + R +LR(0.8) 0.688  X  0.739  X  0.713  X  15.9%  X  indicates statistical significance at 0.95 level with respect Table 6 presents the overall results of our experiments. The first eight rows of the table report results by using the brand selection module alone (Section 4.2), while the last two lines report results for the full pipeline that includes the logistic regression module (Section 4.1). This allows us to better study the effect of pre-filtering the user X  X  domains of interest. The LR module is applied with two different probability threshold: 0.5 (the second last line in the table) and 0.8 (the last line in the table).

Results show that our full pipeline largely outperforms all other systems both in terms of precision and recall, at the cost of a lower user coverage, i.e. recommendation is pro-vided only for those users that are inferred to have a high interest in a given meta-category. The decrease in user cov-erage is expected, and we argue that in practical settings it is not as relevant as precision and recall. Indeed, a production recommendation system mostly aims at providing accurate recommendations to a limited set of users than providing inaccurate recommendations to all users.

The KNN algorithm performs best in its P knn con-figuration, i.e. when the recommendation comes from the brands purchased by the neighbors instead of their liked brands. P knn is better than the baselines with statistical significance while L knn is not. This underlines that pur-chase signals are much stronger than like signals, even when used indirectly as in this case.

Overall, all systems that integrate related brands are better than both baselines with statistical significance in terms of recall. The use of related brand proves successful in increasing the recall of the system, with a small (expected) cost in precision.

The experimental results show that both our intuitions are correct. From one side, we showed that a successful system for recommending brands and products from social media should integrate a pre-filtering stage, where the general in-terests of the users are inferred (e.g. Sport). Only then the social likes can provide useful and un-noised information. From the other side, we showed that user-user collaborative filtering is necessary to expand the recommendations, as so-cial media information may be at times too sparse.
 Demographics . Demographic information (gender and age) have been leveraged in the Logistic Regression module as features. As reported in our previous work [25] this improves the accuracy of the Regression model. However, we also tested the use of demographic information in the KNN-based brand selection models, by computing cosine similarity only across users in the same gender and age group, instead of all users. Results (not reported here for lack of space) show improvements both in precision and recall, though with no statistical significance.
In table 6 we reported results for the Logistic Regression model only at two specific thresholds, namely 0.5 and 0.8. Figure 4 and Figure 5 report the full spectrum of results for both user coverage and precision/recall at all levels of probability threshold.

The figures show that as the probability threshold in-creases, the number of qualified users drops significantly (Figure 4) while, as expected, both precision and recall in-crease substantially.
 Figure 4: Percentage of users covered in evaluation.
When the threshold increases up to 70%, the number of users drops to 2570. The precision is 0.598, recall is 0.705, and F 1 is 0.647. This indicates that about 70.5% of users X  purchased brands (almost 3 out 4) are captured and 59.8% of the recommendations (almost 3 out 5) are actually what users have bought. This result is very promising as 2570 / 9398 &gt; 1/4, i.e. the recommendation algorithm is effective for more than a quarter of the users.
 Figure 5: P knn + R using category prediction proba-bility.
In this paper we studied interactions between social me-dia profiles and purchase behaviors on e-commerce websites. We showed that there are significant correlations between social media information and online purchases at the brand level. We presented a two-stage pipeline system that uses Facebook likes for solving the task of branded products rec-ommendation. Results on a large dataset of eBay users who connected to Facebook show that brands recommendation can be successfully accomplished using social media infor-mation alone. We also showed that pre-filtering based on broad user interests is necessary for achieving good perfor-mance and that user-user collaborative methods improve the recall of the system.

In the future we will explore several research directions, including the following: (1) we will integrate our models into production systems to offer a personalized experience for cold-start social media users, and to improve existing product recommendation systems that rely on purchase his-tory; (2) we will extend our feature sets to include other types of features, such as clusters of likes automatically in-ferred using topic models; (3) we will investigate how to improve our method by focusing also on recommendation diversity; (4) finally, we will compare our algorithm to other state-of-the-art algorithms such as those based on matrix factorization.

To the best of our knowledge our study is the first at-tempt to predict e-commerce behaviors using only social me-dia information.
