 1. Introduction
Unlike prevalent networks, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) not only aim to foster the supportive effectiveness of self-organizing sensor nodes with low power, for instance with increased lifetimes, but also have intelligent actuators. The actua-tors help enhance the cooperative effort of sensor nodes to communicate while transmitting data in areas including health, warfare and environment monitoring ( Akyildiz et al., 2002 ). For example, health monitoring models adopt wireless sensors as extraordinary parts to continuously capture quantitative data from an enormous number of wearable body sensor networks for longer periods ( Hanson et al., 2009 ). A Hybrid Sensor Network architec-ture employed MicaZ sensors for the battle fi eld, which are skilled in tracking live vocal and magnetic weapon signals generated by enemy forces ( Bokareva et al., 2006 ). The most recent publication by Kapitanova et al. (2012) demonstrates how robust fuzzy logic is in event detection by monitoring smoke via temperature sensors attached throughout the home environment; fi re ignition may thus be detected, making the relevance of sensor applications apparent.
 greater fl exibility in establishing communications and increase system automation, though lack in security and privacy ( Li et al., 2009 ). The core weaknesses with these sensor nodes lie in the limited-resource devices, i.e. power and processing units. For this reason, vulnerability to various security threats is notably high.
Meanwhile, an adversary possesses passive and active abilities. It may implicate sensor nodes through access to secret information such as keys stored in the compromised node in addition to the potential to eavesdrop and alter (e.g. replay, forge, modify and delete) exposed nodal behavior ( Schaffer et al., 2012 ).
In mitigating security complications, traditional security tactics, for examples, fi rewall and cryptography are alternative options to prevent external intruders. Basically, they are impractical in completely averting network resources from increasingly sophis-ticated internal attacks ( Chen et al., 2002 ). A different security approach incorporates Intrusion Detection and Prevention Sys-tems (IDPSs) to detect and impede intrusion by impostors. An Intrusion Detection System or other similar ones (e.g. Intrusion
Prevention System, Intrusion Response System) monitor network traf fi c to analyze and detect attacks ( Anuar et al., 2012 ). Three detection methods employed are misuse, anomaly, and the hybrid model which is a blend of the fi rst two methods ( Fuchsberger, 2005 ). A misuse-based system identi fi es known patterns by matching observed data using simple rules. For instance, Snort-
Wireless runs its default rule settings to process all malicious events observed by the sensor and adopts intrusion detection techniques ( Lockhart, 2007 ). Anomaly based detection refers to the discovering of anomalous patterns in measurement data that do not conform to the expected behavior ( Curiac and Volosencu, 2012 ). According to Dutkevych et al. (2007) , an anomaly based solution averts intrusion in real time systems by analyzing protocol-based attacks and multi-dimensional traf fi c. The hybrid detection approach boosts the capabilities of a current Wireless
Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (WIDPS) by amalga-mating the two intelligent methods of misuse and anomaly ( Wang et al., 2011 ). Ayd  X  n et al. (2009) designed a hybrid IDS by incorporating the packet header anomaly detection and network traf fi c anomaly detection systems, which are anomaly based IDSs with misuse-based IDS Snort. The key concept behind the hybrid detection is that misuse identi fi es known attacks while anomaly discovers unknown attacks.

While traditional intrusion detection approaches such as mis-use, anomaly and hybrid display relatively reasonable perfor-mance regarding correct detection of known attacks and false alarm rates, they fail to detect  X  unknown  X  attacks ( Anderson et al., 1995 ). Therefore, an anomaly detection approach is considered as an alternative to detect constantly changing unknown attack behavior, but it may also exhibit high false positive results compared with misuse detection, which is considered inef fi
Arti fi cial intelligence (AI) techniques play a role in automating the intrusion detection process to diminish human intermediation.
The detecting intrusion process based on the traditional arti intelligence (TAI) entails methods such as fuzzy set, neural net-works, and evolutionary computing, which operate as classi for anomaly detection ( Idris and Shanmugam, 2005 ). Denning (1987) , with a rule-based expert system for IDS, aimed to improve detection performance. Although these rules apply cover-known patterns, they are unable to adapt to the attacks  X  pattern changes (e.g. attack polymorphs). To alleviate the problem of attack modi fi cations, computational intelligence (CI) is considered a high-accuracy detection method to be used in constructing an intelligent detection model and to automatically identify incon-sistent activities ( Russell and Eberhart, 2007 ). Agah et al. (2004) detected attacks with the game theory-based reinforcement learn-ing algorithm. The result was greater safety, but the energy ef fi ciency issues remained to be addressed.

Despite the limited agreement on the exact procedure of constructing anomaly classi fi ers based on TAI and CI to address safety, there is a broadly accepted view that the sections of CI are neuro fuzzy, genetic fuzzy and machine learning. By joining the autonomous multi-agent with the CI or TAI methods, a number of the previously identi fi ed weaknesses may be confronted ( Alpadin, 2010 ; Wooldridge, 2009 ). Toosi and Kahani (2007) combined the following three soft computing algorithms: neural network, fuzzy rules and genetic algorithm to improve the decision result opti-mization. Consequently, the three main clusters for the detection method applied in recent IDSs are identi fi ed in this research work: traditional arti fi cial intelligence (TAI), computational intelligence (CI), and multi-agent system (MAS)-based computational intelli-gence (MCI).

According to the existing reviews for anomaly resource-based monitoring, IDPS systems are divided into two categories: Host-based IDPS (HIDPS) and network-based IDPS (NIDPS) systems ( Anderson and Davis, 1995 ; Sherif and Dearmond, 2002 ). NIDPS monitors network traf fi c, in particular network segments or devices, after which it analyzes network and protocol conduct to identify suspicious activities. HIDPS observes all, or portions of, the dynamic behavior and state of a computer system. Unlike NIDPS which dynamically inspects network packets, HIDPS detects pro-grams  X  access and resources. HIDPS offers the advantage of being easy to deploy without affecting existing infrastructures as opposed to NIDS which detects attacks at the transport protocol layer through quick responses.

Throughout this study, we investigate the applications of TAI, CI and MCI for identifying present research challenges in preparing an IDPS. A novel Collaborative-based WIDPS (Co-WIDPS) architec-ture is proposed and presented in Section 5.2 . It demonstrates the impact of the MCI technique on enhancing the ef fi ciency of detection and false alarm rates. This architecture portrays the clear understanding of cooperative learning-based detection to satisfy the requirements of WIDPS. Our survey presents the state-of-the-art in the fi eld of WIDPS and highlights the central issues to be addressed.
 The remainder of this research paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the survey methodology. Section 3 introduces the most contemporary TAI, CI and MCI IDPS approaches. In Section 4 , the stated detection methods are scrutinized by evaluating their performance and highlighting the impact of MAS-based CI on detection rate performance improvements. Section 5 presents an intelligent intrusion detection and prevention technique and pro-poses a collaborative-based wireless intrusion detection and pre-vention system. An elucidation of existing challenges and similarities is given in Section 6 .Finally,theoverallconclusions are presented in Section 7 , including highlights of the recom-mended future direction of research and development for practical applications. 2. Methodology
The current investigation is based on 46 articles related to intrusion detection and prevention in wired and wireless networks. These articles were selected from cre dible, highly cited publications and resources, such as, in the Science Direct and IEEE based on their impact factor as reported by Journal C itation Reports (JCR). This paper integrates the challenges and issues hindering further advancements in NIDPS, speci fi cally WIDPS. It is expected to attract well-respected researchers ' consideration to possible solutions with respect to developing WIDPSs by anal yzing the methodologies  X  signi addition to empirical performance.
 Table 1 provides the number of literature works dealing with TAI, CI and MCI approaches. The list of articles is provided as a general overview of TAIs, CIs and MCIs in terms of their character-istics and current challenges encumbering intelligent IDPS devel-opment in sensor networks. The table comprises 4 horizontal sections (TAI, CI, MCI and critical review) and 3 vertical divisions de fi ning detection classi fi er types, the authors ' work titles and the works ' objectives. Embedding security mechanisms such as iden-tifying possible known/unknown vulnerabilities, predicting user behavior, analyzing and deterring individuals from violating security policies, are adopted into the network protocols to facilitate the development of ef fi cient intrusion recognition and reaction systems.

Analysis is based on two key aspects concerning the evaluation and comparison of the alternative WIDPS approaches  X  perfor-mances, that is, the ef fi ciency of the detection process and false alarm rates (false positives and negatives). The signi fi performance, and especially at this point, the ef fi ciency aspect must be emphasized. As an example, Potyrailo et al. (2012) researched about the in fl uence of wireless chemical sensors based on radio frequency identi fi cation in the high detection of chemical agents. They claim that any failure in real time diagnosis may lead to harmful events. Wang and Bagrodia (2012) achieved a false positive ratio of less than 10% with small packets of buffers to identify the compromised node in wireless sensor networks.
Due to the extraordinary hazards of practical operational net-works and systems of real environments, performing real time testing is very dif fi cult and complicated. To evaluate the detection rate performance, most researchers validate the ideas by testing in experimental simulated environments depicting the real environ-ment ( Toosi and Kahani, 2007 ). For example, KDD  X  99 was the most widely utilized public data set for evaluating anomaly detection methods. It originated around the DARPA IDS evaluation program ( C-sniper, 2012 ). The simulated attacks in KDD  X  99 dataset fall into one of the four categories: Denial of Service (DoS), User to Root (U2R), Remote to Local (R2L) and Probing attacks.

To examine the possibility of dropped packets by traf fi c collectors (i.e. TCP dumping) during heavy traf fi c, there exists different datasets such as NSL-KDD ( Tavallaee et al., 2009 ) which were selected to mitigate the dif fi culties incurred by KDD datasets. NSL-KDD is signi fi cant in that it contains fewer redun-dant, duplicate records in the training and test phases of learning-based detection, making the evaluation process of the learning system more ef fi cient. To access wireless sensor dataset, the Intel Berkeley Research lab collected wireless sensor data using TinyDB in order to process the query. Table 2 shows the comparable classi fi cation of the datasets based on network based traf wireless based traf fi c to justify the use of datasets.
Other critical reviews of anomaly based NIDS are more focused on the detection methods applied. Wu and Banzhaf (2010) classi fi ed anomaly based NIDSs according to their computational intelligence. For each cluster (e.g. fuzzy, neural network classi tion, swarm intelligence and soft computing) a number of research systems are referenced. Anomaly based NIDS methods reviewed by Kolias et al. (2011) emphasized the use of Swarm Intelligence (SI) techniques to demonstrate the impact of SI on IDS. The three detection methods discussed by Kolias are Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Clustering (ACC). Garcia et al. (2009) listed anomaly based NIDS software, analyzing various commercial and research projects. The authors published a range of research projects over more than a decade ago from initial statistical methods to expert systems, and more recently to Machine learn-ing (ML) approaches that particularly use the Markov decision process (MDP). Tsai et al. (2009) classi fi ed ML-based NIDS into single, ensemble, and hybrid types. According to them, most ML-based NIDSs employ a base line (i.e. a KDD data set and a support vector machine (SVM) classi fi er) for detection of algorithm com-parison. Davis et al. (2011) provided a table-based review of the traf fi c patterns and preprocessing methods utilized by anomaly based NIDSs. Patel et al. (2012) presented a comprehensive taxonomy of IDPS into cloud computing, and stipulated a list of requirements for a cloud-based intrusion detection and prevention system (CIDPS). Autonomic computing, ontology, risk manage-ment and fuzzy theory form an ideal design to meet the require-ments. None, however, have listed or compared the detection performance of MCI methods based on WIDPS. 3. State-of-the-art TAI, CI and MCI in IDPS
Countless studies have suggested means of increasing perfor-mance without affecting IDPS quality. AI techniques serve to automate the intrusion detection process and reduce human intervention. The process of detecting intrusion is founded on the AI technique by applying methods such as the TAI and CI techniques that operate as classi fi ers. This survey paper presents, in detail, the state-of-the-art of TAI, CI and MCI systems in the of WIDS, and additionally highlights the vital concerns/drawbacks to be addressed. 3.1. Traditional arti fi cial intelligence (TAI) technique
In TAI techniques, network traf fi c activity is captured by single classi fi ers (i.e. fuzzy set, neural network, genetic algorithm and arti fi cial immune system), whereby a pro fi le representing its desired behavior is coded and fi nally a behavior model is created.
Network events take place, the current pro fi le is assigned and an anomaly score is computed by comparing the two behaviors. The score normally indicates the degree of irregularity for a speci event, such that the IDS raises a fl ag in the event an anomaly occurs when the score surpasses a certain threshold. 3.1.1. Fuzzy set (FS)
Fuzzy set-oriented WIDPSs correspond to an audit data related to a set of rules which identi fi es different attributes from the training data as a fuzzy rule base ( Dickerson et al., 2001 ). The fuzzy rule base is bene fi cial in instances of misuse but is impractical when dealing with unknown behavior. To alleviate the drawbacks of unknown behavior detection, hybrid fuzzy classi fi ers that consider dynamic fuzzy rule tuning were recommended for a later stage to augment detection rate by dynamically adjusting the rules ( Abraham et al., 2007 ; Bridges and Vaughn, 2000 ; Liang and Wang, 2005 ; Lin et al., 2008 ; Oblak et al., 2007 ; Tong et al., 2009 ).
The most remarkable advantages of the hybrid fuzzy classi based WIDPSs are robustness and fl exibility. Among the most noticeable disadvantages are the challenge of using a fuzzy set in large scale wireless sensor computing (i.e. excessive resource consumption) and the additional complications imposed on alarm correlation. To moderate the alarm correlation, Kaptanova et al. (2012) suggested a hybrid fuzzy classi fi er that monitors a tem-perature value. The fuzzy logic controller performs robust detec-tion, but consumes vast computing resources when performing fuzzy alarm correlation. Thus, to avoid the pronounced resource consumption, a neural network may adopt fuzzy rules by updating the weight of the neurons. 3.1.2. Neural networks (NN) function, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), self-organizing map (SOM) and support vector machine (SVM) neural networks were implemented to the anomaly based WIDPSs. Neural networks are prominently characterized by their fl exibility and adaptability to generate fuzzy rules through performing weight tuning to repre-sent the effective hidden units. This detection approach is fre-quently employed to detect individual possible misuse ( Cannady, 1998 ; Debar and Siboni, 1992 ), to determine which network traf data clusters contain attacks ( Alan Bivens et al., 2002 ; Gunes
Kayacik et al., 2007 ), to identify deviations from normal behavior ( Bankovic et al., 2011 ), and to judge whether a network visit is normal or not ( Li et al., 2012b ).
 variants, from multi-layer feed forward neural networks to self-organizing maps and supporting vector machines ( Fisch et al., 2012 ), is that no expositive structure is provided explaining why a particular detection decision has been made. 3.1.3. Genetic algorithm (GA) to infer under distinguished selection rules to a state that max-imizes the  X  fi tness function  X  (i.e. minimizes the cost function), by evolving its operators such as selection, cross over, and mutation.
GA contributes another type of anomaly based WIDPS, which is adept at utilizing communication energy ( Khanna et al., 2009 ) and applying a grammatical evolution technique with Backus  X  Naur
Form (BNF) grammar to identify route disruption attacks in mobile ad-hoc networks (  X  en and Clark, 2009 ).
 the capability of a fl exible and robust global search method that converges to a global minimum (i.e. a solution from multiple directions), with no prior knowledge of the system  X  s behavior. Its main disadvantage is the enormous resource consumption involved. If the population is large then the mutation is too great and the system never converges towards a suitable solution. Due to this iteration an immense amount of resources are consumed. 3.1.4. Arti fi cial immune system (AIS) inspired by the natural immune system principles; this system models were then employed in a wide and intricate range of subjects. Clonal selection and negative selection comprised essen-tial shares of this system. The clonal and negative selection functions have a large in fl uence on the security of wireless sensor networks ( Hofmeyr and Forrest, 2000 ).
 clonal selection. They are normally applied as mobile memory detectors to generate several diverse detectors by approximation to achieve lightweight NIDS ( Jungwon and Bentley, 2001 ). Ma et al. (2007) organized WSN as a body, adversaries as pathogens and multi-agents as lymphocytes that defend against attacks. In all cases, self-adaptability is facilitated by upgrading the agents characteristics via the creation of new antibodies. Energy ef ciency is attained by deploying decision agents in the base station with suf fi cient resources and strong computational skills.
AIS functions provide the con fi gurability of driving the gene library evolution by using the clone selection. Also, AIS requires both additional memory and time when being transferred to generate a vast detector set number. The main disadvantage is its high resource consumption. 3.2. Computational intelligence (CI) classi fi ers
CI classi fi ers rely on a Soft Computing (SC) or Machine Learning (ML) model that allows for the patterns analyzed to be categor-ized. A distinct characteristic of these schemes is the prerequisite for labeled data to train the behavioral model, a procedure that places severe demands on the resources. ML based on SC classi-fi ers is meant to create an iterative process of observing patterns, adjusting to the mathematical form, and making predictions ( Alpadin, 2010 ). 3.2.1. Soft computing (SC)
SC classi fi ers were designed to modify the classi fi cation per-formance of TAI methods by incorporating a multifold learning algorithm ( Zadeh, 1994 ). SC classi fi ers distinguish two main approaches: neuro fuzzy (NF) and genetic fuzzy (GF) models which are utilized to adjust the structure and parameters of a fuzzy system by neural network and genetic algorithm operators, respectively. The goal is an optimal, continuous membership function that identi fi es anomalous behavior with supervised monitoring abilities, high detection rate and low false alarm rate ( Buckley and Hayashi, 1994 ; Full X r, 2000 ). 3.2.1.1. Neuro fuzzy (NF). Neuro fuzzy is a combination of a fuzzy set and adaptive neural network that tunes the fuzzy membership function using neural networks. Neuro fuzzy techniques are found in the milieu of NIDS, generally applied to IDS problems ( Gomez and
Dasgupta, 2002 ). The multi-layer perceptron learns the fuzzy rule, after which this neural network performs a fuzzy interface process to identify attacks ( Chavan et al., 2004 ; Mohajerani et al., 2003 ). 3.2.1.2. Genetic fuzzy (GF). In some ways associated to anomaly based
IDS methods, a revised NF classi fi er with a GA was proposed to modify the fuzzy engine for detection ( Toosi and Kahani, 2007 ). At the same time, IDS employs the fuzzy genetic learning method to construct a primary population by using the fuzzy rule. The antecedent fuzzy part provides a uniform crossover for a pair of fuzzy rules, following which the antecedent fuzzy set randomly supersedes the fuzzy set with a mutation probability. Lastly, the f uzzy genetic method terminates the fuzzy classi fi er execution through a total number of generations ( Abadeh et al., 2007 ). A parallel genetic local search algorithm is introduced to evolve the same class of individuals in different subpopulations independently. This parallel framework improves the search ability of the used genetic local search procedure by preventing the algorithm to produce invalid individuals ( Saniee Abadeh et al., 2007 ). More recently, Khan et al. (2012) developed a fault detection strategy in WSN. In this system, a recurrent Takagi  X  Sugeno inference system strategy decided whether or not to declare the node malicious.

In comparison to all the SC techniques, fuzzy logic is optimized to enhance the detection accuracy. The number of false positives is reduced and only the true positive intrusion events from the raw audit data are increased. It is still challenging to tune the fuzzy rules based on IDS into WSN to lessen the false positives and to boost the detection rates. 3.2.2. Machine learning (ML)
In the expansion of WIDS, the ultimate aim is to obtain a high level of accuracy in the various intruder detection schemes. Several ML-based designs have been applied to WIDPS. Some of the most important ones are cited below, and their main strengths and weaknesses are identi fi ed. 3.2.2.1. Reinforcement learning (RL). Reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a greatly signi fi cant method of wireless network security due to its capability to autonomously learn new attacks via online, unsupervised learning, as well as to modify new policies without complex mathematical approaches ( Barto, 1998 ). It has been proven to be effective, especially in real time detection and when no prior system  X  s behavior information is assumed.
RL constitutes another form of CI-based techniques, capable of forecasting online network fault detection partly by the observable Markov decision procedure, a practice which transforms a reward function into Markov chains ( Qiming and Shayman, 2000 ; Xu and Xie, 2005 ). Hence, to execute the learning prediction, a temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm was employed. A value function forecasting model was constructed upon completion of the learning phase.

In a non-cooperative game theory model, the system uses a Q-learning algorithm for any adversary recognition in sensor net-works ( Agah et al., 2004 ). Temporal difference sequential anomaly detection aided by the Markov reward model is used to determine data labeling and to improve its detection model performance ( Xu, 2010 ). The multilayer reinforcement learning framework assisted by the hidden Markov model (HMM) was proposed to solve real-time detection in a complex state space ( Andersen et al., 2009 ).
The primary disadvantage of reinforcement learning is the abundant resources consumed, in other words, the lack of memory to sustain the agent ' s data. The agent ' s memory is stored in a look-up table or in the Q-table. The values fi ll the Q-table with the maximum positive rewards possible when executing an action from the current state to the next-state space. Consequently, the high values in the Q-table expend all these resources. RL, when compared with other soft computing methods (i.e. neuro fuzzy and genetic fuzzy), is highly dependent on the state space. 3.2.2.2. Bayes network (BN). The Bayes network principle provides a distribution possibility to encode statistical relationships among any single quantity. BN is based on Bayes ' theorem (alternatively, Bayes ' law), which imparts a means to apply quantitative reasoning. This model is normally used for IDS in combination with HMM and MDP, a procedure that yields several advantages ( Ahmadabadi et al., 2001 ). Anomaly detection has the ability to represent a norm pro fi le of temporal behavior by shifting the observation window to view the last N audit event continuously and to detect an intrusion behavior during a window observation ( Ye, 2000 ).

Bayes Naive-based HMM techniques have been utilized in an anomaly detection system, typically applied to compute the statistical feature of normal behaviors incoming from the IP source ( Xu et al., 2007 ). They reduced the KDD  X  99 data set by choosing four attributes for the training mode in a TCP connection. These attributes include denial-of-service, e.g. syn fl ood; unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password; unauthor-ized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various over fl ow  X  attacks; and Probing, surveillance, e.g., port scanning. The dynamic Bayesian network was initialized with the Baum Welch algorithm to classify normal and attack data ( Devarakonda et al., 2012 ).

As pointed out by Patcha and Park (2007) , a serious disadvan-tage of using BNs is that the accuracy of this method is dependent on certain assumptions characteristically based on the behavioral model of the target system; deviating from these assumptions decreases accuracy. Selecting an accurate model is the fi towards solving the problem, as a result, considerably higher computational effort is required.

In most ML techniques, RL utilized HMMs and BNs to improve the detection operation. The main effort therefore goes to opti-mizing RL through the fuzzy logic controller (FLC). 3.3. Multi-agent-based computational intelligence (MCI)
MCI techniques based on multi-agent systems enhance the performance of detection and response ( Alpadin, 2010 ). The main objective of MCI consists of distributing agents to each cluster to provide a CI mechanism that makes individual and cooperative decisions associated to WIDPS ( Wooldridge, 2009 ). MCI has been employed in the domain of network security, especially in WIDS ( Li et al., 2012a ) and cloud computing-based IDS ( Doelitzscher et al., 2012 ).

MCI approaches correspond to a hierarchical multi-agent architecture for intrusion detection, and to modify statistical models, such as the next-generation intrusion detection expert system (NIDES) statistical algorithm that measures the similarity between a subject ' s long-term behavior and short term behavior for intrusion detection ( Debar and Siboni, 1992 ). The detection rate is high because it can use various types of audit data and detects intrusion based on the previous experimental data. In NIDES, known attacks and intrusion scenarios are encoded in a rule base, therefore, it is not sensitive to some behaviors and detectable types of intrusions are limited. To overcome this detection com-plexity, a distributed agent based IDS was proposed by Zhang et al. (2001 ), where each module negotiated with other agents from the lower to higher tiers, seeking to improve their accuracy of attack detections and false alarm rates.
 proposed in two phases, namely, which local agents used support vector machines in the training mode and which local agents used mobile agents in the decision mode to classify suspicious behavior ( Le X n et al., 2011 ). Some methods suggest a multi-agent system where each local agent collects data through a mobile agent. The local agent then examines the integrity of the system with a SVM classi fi er at the corresponding time an attacker enters the system.
Also, in the communication mode the mobile agent veri fi es the activity; if there is no suspicious activity, the message is forwarded to a neighboring node. The decision making component of detec-tion is based on the Bayes theory, in which, if the probability of normal activity is smaller than the assumed abnormality thresh-old, the current activity is categorized as abnormal ( Renjit and Shunmuganathan, 2011 ).
 according to a set of fuzzy associated rules. First, a java agent-based snort collects packets with a packet sniffer and then creates an input data for the rule engine. Subsequently, the rule engine forwards the pattern matching algorithm to a multi-agent system.
The audit data is then classi fi ed accordingly ( Mosqueira-Rey et al., 2007 ). Intrusion detection utilizes MAS along with the Fuzzy
Classi fi er System (FCS) and knowledge base to detect abnormal activities ( Dasgupta et al., 2005 ).
 Khorsandi, (2011) developed a cooperation policy setting process. Interacting peers ' agents regard each other ' s reliability or reputation as an impact factor in fl uencing the value of information received from the other, and hence, their learning mechanisms. A broadcasting mechanism was proposed for knowledge acquisition in dynamic environments, based on probabilistic modeling, which was improved through other cooperative communication ( Fisch et al., 2012 ).

In some domains of WSN-based IDPS, a two-tier, MAS-based ad-hoc intrusion detection mechanism was proposed ( Ramachandran et al., 2008 ). The fi rst tier runs an auctioning-based mechanism for the node task allocation. The second tier consists of the classi fi cation algorithm that uses a variation of an
ACO to identify the anomaly level. The collaborative work of the tactical squad of agents has led to concurrent detections of multi-ple sinkhole threats from different routes in the wireless ad-hoc network ( Stafrace and Antonopoulos, 2010 ). Speci fi cations of collaborative WIDPS were developed by employing MAS charac-teristics. For instance, the inclusion of deliberative Case Base
Reasoning (CBR)  X  Beliefs  X  Desires  X  Intentions (BDI) agents combination of CBR agents ' life cycles (i.e. retrieval, reuse, revision and retention stages) seems appropriate for packet-based detec-tion ( Herrero et al., 2009 ). For this purpose, a CBR life cycle with a cooperative version of maximum likelihood Hebbian learning is re fl ected upon.

Multi-agent-based WIDPS, in terms of CI (MCI) and non-CI methods, have emerged in commercial products. In recent years, a number of pioneering systems from the MCI-based WIDPS, for example, the Sensor Network-based Counter-Sniper (C-Sniper) system, has been practically adopted by the US Army MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) facility. Such a system automatically detects and accurately locates shooters even in urban environments ( Simon et al., 2004 ).

In brief, this review paper highlights the possible bene fi impact of MCIs using fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning, as well as to reveal potential pitfalls of not integrating MCI into Co-WIDPS. Fig.1 indicates a chronological list of TAI, CI and MCI-based IDPS events with respect to their relevant technologies.
Fig. 1 illustrates the chronology of those arti fi cial intelligent techniques which focus on TAI (fuzzy set, neural network and evolutionary algorithm), CI (soft computing and machine learning) and MCI. The fi gure summarizes the MCI techniques into two clouds: collaborative and single clouds. A collaborative cloud is a multi-agent system (MAS) utilizing the TAI methods and, in most cases, comprises CI approaches. For example, reinforcement meth-ods utilize neural networks and a fuzzy set ( Renjit and
Shunmuganathan, 2011 ). A single cloud is a multi-agent-based detection mode that does not use CI and TAI. As proposed ( Ramachandran et al., 2008 ), a MAS follows an auction and reputation mechanism for performing the task allocation in an intrusion detection. The two cloud types were compared with the
TAI and CI methods. The summary implicated that the detection and the response system based on the two MAS-based clouds performed extremely well. 4. Detection rates performance method and criteria for evaluation
The effectiveness of an IDPS is assessed on how capable the detection method is to make correct attack detection. According to the real nature of a given event compared to an IDPS prediction, four possible outcomes are shown in Table 3 . The outcomes are known as the IDPS reaction matrix. True Negatives (TN) as well as
True Positives (TP) correspond to a correct IDS operation; that is, events are successfully labeled as normal and attack, respectively.
False Positives (FP) refer to normal events predicted as attacks, while False Negatives (FN) are attacks incorrectly predicted as normal events ( lab, I.B.R, 2004 ).

A high FP rate that seriously affects the system  X  s performance can be detected, and an elevated FN rate leaves the system vulnerable to intrusions. Both FP and FN rates ought to be minimized, together with maximizing TP and TN rates simulta-neously. Based on Eqs. (1)  X  (6) and the IDPS reaction matrix, a possible status for an IDPS reaction is shown. It applies the following measures to quantify IDS performance ( Blasco et al., 2010 ): True negative rate  X  TNR  X  X  TN TN  X  FP  X  no True positive rate  X  TPR  X  or Sensitivity or Recall  X  R  X  X   X  no : of detected attacks False positive rate  X  FPR  X  : FP TN  X  FP  X  1  X  TN TN  X  FP False negative rate  X  FNR  X  : FN TP  X  FN  X  4  X  Accuracy  X  TN Precision  X  TP TP  X  FP  X  6  X 
Most of the systems reviewed used the same evaluation metrics such as the detection rate (DR) and false alarm rate (FAR). Some other studies have addressed the problems of IDS by proposing new DR and FAR and introduced different evaluation metrics. Table 4 shows the proposed evaluation metrics.
Traditionally, intrusion detection and prevention approaches are studied from two major views, namely, anomaly and misuse detection though no considerable difference in characteristics exists between them. Liao et al. (2012) proposed a subdivision of detection approaches into fi ve subcategories, including statistics-based, pattern-based, rule-based, state-based and heuristic con-cepts, but the properties of intelligent detection approaches are not de fi ned. Due to the lack of a more detailed view of detection and prevention approaches using multi-agent system-based com-putational intelligence, this paper presents a classi fi cation of three subclasses with an in-depth perspective on the characteristics: TAI-based, CI-based, and MCI based WIDPS. Accordingly, we have carefully assembled the current intrusion detection approaches, especially those found in wireless sensor networks (see Table 5 ).
Table 5 shows the types and subtypes of intrusion detection systems. The detection methodology is categorized into anomaly and misuse-based. It contains a host-based, network-based and wireless sensor-based intrusion detection and prevention systems. The type of attack detection is classi fi ed into known, unknown, and both kinds of detection. The performance indicates detection ef fi ciency, while the level of performance is evaluated by degrees of high, moderate and low. The sources comprise a public dataset (e.g. KDD99), a private dataset (e.g. NSL-KDD) and an unspeci dataset, as extracted from previous attacks. The available data is utilized to discriminate intrusion behavior from suspicious activ-ities. The methodology of anomaly based MAS and CI compared with TAI satis fi es the detection, particularly in unknown attacks.
Detection ef fi ciency in the MCI method portrays superior perfor-mance. The most signi fi cant aspects of the MCI-based IDPS mentioned are the high accuracy, self-learning, and robustness.
Fig. 2 depicts the total number of manuscripts investigated over a 14 year period from 1998 to 2012. The researched papers regarding TAI detection methods reached a peak in 2002, declined gradually by 2006, then remained stable until now. It is not easy to apply those TAIs which mitigate WIDPS vulnerabilities, as a new generation of intelligent attacks can arise. Nevertheless, CI and MCI have received increasing consideration recently.

From Fig. 2 , it can be observed that while TAI, CI and MCI were fairly level from 2007 to 2009, however, CI had become more popular than TAI by the year 2012 because CI in terms of MCI showed better performance of intrusion detection and false alarm rate. 4.1. Traditional arti fi cial intelligence (TAI)
The emergent anomaly detection applications have brought about a new trend of IDPS-focused research which concentrates on ways of managing alarms. Table 6 lists the most signi fi cant researchers attempting to deal with intrusion detection and prevention problems based on TAI approaches.

Generally, developed TAI techniques for IDPS are categorized into three detection classi fi ers. The fuzzy set-based WIDSs consist of a fuzzy rule based (FRB) and fuzzy C-mean (FCM); the neural network-based IDPS comprises a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and a self-organizing map (SOM).
Finally, the evolutionary algorithm is made of a genetic algorithm (GA) and an arti fi cial immune system (AIS) ( Li et al., 2012b ).
The majority of researchers operating with TAI have provided some solution to appraising the performance of IDPS for anomaly techniques (refer to Table 6 ) since anomaly techniques based on hybrid TAI (i.e. using fuzzy data mining) generate more accuracy than single TAI techniques (i.e. self-fuzzy), as per Fig. 3 . The hybrid
TAI approach combining the data mining techniques with fuzzy set, for instance, optimizes the system  X  s visibility and performance.
Moreover, the false alarm correlation and detection rate become more complicated becoming necessary to attract researchers  X  awareness to attempt and provide solutions to WIDPS manage-ment in the recently utilized hybrid TAI detection methods. performance of detection rate and false alarm rate in the wireless sensor environment. On the contrary, FCM, SOM, MLP, GP and AIS do not consider WIDPS due to their inability to provide adapt-ability at a time when adversary behavior is changing dramatically. 4.2. Computational intelligence (CI) puting (SC), are utilized for designing wireless sensor intrusion detection. The objective of this literature is to introduce SC and ML in terms of computational intelligence-based IDPS.
 based WIDPS are using ML taxonomy. Table 7 lists the most recent methods attempting to deal with intrusion detection and preven-tion problems based on CI approaches. The methods applied are very similar to each other. For instance, the neural network-based fuzzy solution replaces fuzzy-based neural network classi tune the fuzzy rule to achieve more accurate detection. The most important features that are different between the CI and TAI methods are the prevention capability and response. Currently, conducted research and proposed solutions with respect to CI techniques are still a long way from an ideal IDPS for wireless sensor networks. They not only lack the desired collaborative IDPS characteristics, but also fail to reach into wireless sensor territory.
In all circumstances, CI techniques provide high accuracy, self-learning, and are fault tolerant, but they are not capable of taking into consideration all the features addressed in WIDPS such as energy ef fi ciency, detection rate and false alarm rate. These inef fi ciencies are evidence of the lack of distributed and coopera-tive knowledge of the proper requirements identi fi ed prior to initiating any development.
 perceived in CI classi fi ers based on WIDPS. As shown in Fig. 4 ,RL facilitates a high level of accuracy for the detection process.
Alternatively, the process of detection may attain superior accu-racy upon autonomic agent decision making. 4.3. Multi-agent system-based computational intelligence intelligent intrusion recognition systems apply this sort of coop-erative classi fi er into computational intelligence. Table 8 illustrates the percentage of all research articles implementing multi-agent system techniques to the CI-based WIDS methods. The results indicate that MASs are becoming increasingly perceived for SC&amp; ML classi fi er design.

Fig. 5 demonstrates the correct detection rate achieved by MCI, which steadily increases as the false alarm rate dramatically decreases. Without a doubt, MCI approaches may potentially reach enhanced fl exibility, making them even more popular in the near future.
 multi-agent-based WIDPSs without integrating computational intelligence methods. In other words, CIs make use of MAS in terms of collaborative-based CI to optimize the functions of MAS. 4.4. Comparative discussion of the detection rate and false alarm rate evaluation attacks was measured by computing detection rates and false alarm rates for all the proposed methods. Table 9 compares the detection rate and false alarm rate for the most popular detection methods (i.e. traditional arti fi cial intelligence and computational intelligence), and the cooperative methods, such as the multi-agent based reinforcement learning (MCI). It is obvious that FCM,
GF and RL approaches outperformed in their high performance of correct attack detection rate. In this case, however, the FCM is distinctly better than the unsupervised SOM and neuro fuzzy approaches in terms of detection rate, FCM approach was able to reach the 1.5% of false alarm rate, compared with the false alarm rate of unsupervised SOM to 1.23%. Superior performance of the
RL approach comparing to neuro fuzzy and FCM and unsuper-vised SOM may be explained by the fact that the majority of Number of articles computational intelligence methods with the help of multi-agent system shows the best performance by decreasing the complex-ity anomaly based detection rate.

TAI and CI schemes own the strongest detection generality, as long as adequate attributes are in use. Their formidable capabilities of dealing with multiple-dimensional data fully support detection accuracy to be realistic but what comes along with this capability is the high complexity. Fortunately, com-putational intelligence based detection in terms of using multi-agents may be implemented with the help of WSNs  X  distributed architecture, which eventually reduces the complexity to those of relatively advanced TAI techniques-based schemes. These kinds of schemes are also characterized by their great fl ibility, as they never depend on any prior-knowledge. The logical evaluation on the three technique categories is illu-strated in Table 10 , where TAI stands for traditional AI, CI stands for computational intelligence., and MCI stands for multi-agent based CI.

The computation complexity and memory use of TAI methods, such as the rule-based detection schemes are lowest, indicating the fastest detection speed. However, they have to suffer from the weakest detection generality, since they are not equipped with the ability to dispose of multi-dimensional data. Inserting the new rules that cover more detection attributes into the rule set is the only way to push the detection generality up, which results in a linear increase of the complexity. The establishment of these schemes often demands some prior-knowledge regarding anomaly detection, either assumptions or experiences. The performance of computational intelligence techniques essentially stands in the middle. These schemes are enabled to be deployed in any WSN.
Learning technique, such as reinforcement learning, is allowed to tackle multi-dimensional data, but the complexity would climb up dramatically. For this reason, multi-agent systems adapt to miti-gate the problem of complexity by providing distributed sharing strategy. 5. Model of intelligent intrusion detection and prevention system (IIDPS) 5.1. General model
Intelligent techniques play a role in automating the intrusion detection process and to reduce human intervention. The process of intelligent detection applies advanced communications proto-cols based on arti fi cial intelligence (AI) techniques such as fuzzy set, neural networks, and evolutionary computing that operate as classi fi ers for anomaly detection to ensure detection accuracy along with stability ( Idris and Shanmugam, 2005 ). Denning (1987) used a rule-based expert system for IDSs to improve detection performances. Although the rules may cover known patterns, they are unable to adapt in cases where attack patterns modify (e.g. attack polymorphs). In order to provide high accuracy detection in anomaly detection, CI can serve in the construction of a model detection system by automatically iterating training and testing data ( Russell and Eberhart, 2007 ). From our point of view,
IIDPS architecture for WSN contains four modules: (a) signature matching, (b) feature selection, (c) normalization, and (d) decision ( Fig. 6 ).
 records of network traf fi c through the Snort-Wireless which attempts to make a scalable intrusion detection system that is easily integratable into an IDS infrastructure ( Lockhart, 2007 ). The gain of the process of signature matching includes (1) the single connection attack or known attacks detected at packet level and (2) the unknown attacks. In this case, if the record from the traf data correlates with the signature matching engine, then the gain of the signature matching is misuse detection or known attacks. The signature matching engine sends an alarm to the feature
Known attack signatures selection module regarding the unknown attacks when the sig-nature matching stage may not be detecting correct attacks. In the feature selection module, the process of detecting unknown attacks includes training and testing algorithm, and a correspond-ing model built through the feature selection module. The feature selection stage is adopted to fi lter some unimportant and noise features to decrease the data dimension. The data are normalized through the normalization module, which are used to train the computational intelligence engine to make a model. The normal-ization module generates the signature to the matching module for inspection. The decision module evaluates the generated model through the computational intelligence engine to judge against the observed traf fi c. In this scheme, if the deviation found exceeds (or is below in the case of abnormality models) the given alarm threshold, the detection stage is triggered.

IIDPSs are assessed on their capability to protect securely in large scale networks; nevertheless, utilization in a variety of wireless sensor networks and the complexity of the architecture (e.g. mobility, no central points, constrained bandwidth of wireless links, and limited resources) pose countless dif fi culties ( Liao et al., 2012 ). Some of the challenges remaining include questions as to how to reinforce the intrusion detections and response elements to deal with intrusion in parallel, in addition to the coordination and management of multiple nodes. Trust systems, like wireless sensor network fi ltering facilities, focus on low-delay processing time, and high throughput performance.

Many of the preceding technical studies related to IIDPS methods were summarized and re fi ned ( Abraham et al., 2007 ; Alan Bivens 2007 ; Renjit and Shunmuganathan, 2011 ; Sevil, 2011 ; Toosi and
Kahani, 2007 ) to bring a new perspective of IIDPS classi the development for cooperative-based wireless IIDPs. Fig. 7 branches out a tree plan classi fi cation of the anomaly based WIDPS detection techniques, and Table 11 outlines the advantages and disadvantages of detection in addition to the subtypes of detection-based WIDPS. In the branch of WIIDPS, the detection and prevention architecture uses
TAI, which collects and analyzes the information from single mon-itored classi fi ers (FS, NN, GA and AIS) in light of the availability of prior knowledge data. CI collects data from multiple monitored classi fi ers(NF,GF,RL,HMMandNB)todetectentire,distributed and cooperative attacks, or  X  hybrids  X  of both in terms of soft computing and machine learning approaches. Finally, MCI techniques are based on the establishment of a multi-agent model into SC and ML that allows the patterns analyzed to be categorized.
Table 11 provides the fundamentals for TAI, CI and MCI-based anomaly WIDPS techniques, as well as the principal subtypes of detection. What is obvious from Table 11 is that the recent studies related to MCI-based WIDPS concentrate on robustness, fl exibility, adaptability and low resource consumption. For example, the highly accurate detection technique is one of the most favorable research areas regardless of other consequent challenges such as false alarm rate and response time. This paper expands on the MCI based on collaborative techniques to help the Collaborative Intru-sion Detection and Prevention System (CIDPS) manager assimilate and synthesize false alarm rates into a well-managed set that applies to the whole networking environment under fully dis-tributed collaborative management control ( Patel et al., 2013b ).
To design a CIDPS based on a comprehensive set of require-ments for wireless sensor networks, this paper scrutinizes the special characteristics of a distributed framework structure within Smart Grid Networks (SGN) with Collaborative IDPS, as proposed by Patel et al. (2013a ). They obtained results in the context of an Intelligent Collaborative Intrusion Detection and Prevention Sys-tem for Smart Grid Environments by applying the threshold value of attacks severity on fuzzy violation. Different accuracies on attacks were derived by comparing the detection accuracy versus false positive alarms as an ef fi ciency factor as shown in Table 12 .
It can be observed from Table 12 that the fuzzy threshold value of 0.4 delivered the most ef fi cient result for false positive alarm rate at 13.2% and the higher detection rate at 88.9% for the CSIDPS. Fig. 8 shows the combination of Network and Host-based IDPS (NIDPS, HIDPS) in a fully distributed framework structure in a SGN environment with Collaborative-IDPS. This formation can be read-ily applied to any wireless network.

The monitored environment of an IDPS is typically speci fi
Network-based IDPS monitors network traf fi c for particular network segments or devices and analyzes the network and protocol behavior to identify suspicious activities.

Host-based IDPS monitors all or parts of the dynamic behavior and the state of a computer system. Unlike NIDPS which dynamically inspects network packets, HIDPS detects which programs access what resources. HIDPS has the advantage of being easy to deploy without affecting existing infrastructures, compared to NIDS which detects attacks at the transport protocol layer via quick responses.

A combination of both the HIDPS and NIDPS, function into a single unit, solves the problem of assimilation of data, information, and scalability through collaborative distributed management. 5.2. Proposed collaborative-WIDPS architecture model
Due to the complexity of IDPS in WSN, this paper incorporates three newly de fi ned concepts of detection management: fuzzy reinforcement learning management (FRLM), knowledge manage-ment (KM), and multi-agent management (MA) into the core architectural design of CIDPS ( Patel et al., 2013a ).The management fl ows from the module of CIDPS through an intermediate section are viewed as fuzzy reinforcement learner, knowledge and multi-agent manager, and are expected to respond to intrusions in WSN. The correlation fl ows are developed according to the CIDPS character-istics and the desired characteristics of WIDPS. The purpose of the paper comprises three concepts, namely fuzzy system (FS), reinfor-cement learning (RL) and multi-agent system (MAS) in order to design an ef fi cient system which meets the requirements of the Collaborative-WIDPS (Co-WIDPS). Fig. 9 depicts an enhanced Collaborative-WIDPS functionality architecture within a WSN. proposed by this paper. Layer 1 shows the traditional components of the system which monitor and collect the audit data through the sensors, analyze the data and detect intrusions, generate alarms and herald the proper response through the actuators.
The advanced components shown in the layer 2 are drawn from the four proposed concepts.
 techniques such as soft computing (e.g. neuro fuzzy systems), and machine learning (e.g. a reinforcement learning system) to detect intrusions and feed the obtained results into the autonomic solution mode components comprising of a self-optimizer, self-learning, and self-con fi guration. Self-learning and self-optimizing are de fi ned in autonomic computing principles in real-time with-out human intervention. The collaborative WIDPS proposed sys-tem architecture is illustrated and presented as a work fl scenario to illustrate the way it works, in eight steps, as numbered in brackets. Arrows point out the information fl ow between the components while the dash arrows indicate the logical commu-nications between the components. and latest challenges to wireless sensor networks fall into the computational intelligence intrusion detection module of auto-nomic wireless sensor-based IDPS as mentioned in Step 1. An event entering the system is checked to determine if it is an intrusion or not. If it is an intrusion, then the intrusion detection engine (IDE) takes full responsibility for analyzing and identifying the type of attack. 3 Computational intelligence intrusion detection systems (CIIDS):
Various CIIDS techniques have been suggested in this architecture. ML and SC are the main CIIDS methods. RL together with FS serves as a feature extraction selector and classi fi er of ML for Co-WIDPS. The results of signal classi for intrusion detection are then relayed to the inference engine. 4 Inference engine (IE):
IE is the logical and key division of the Co-WIDPS. IE performs based on the latest computational intelligence techniques, fronted and equipped with fuzzy reinforcement learning management.
 5 Fuzzy reinforcement learning management:
This Co-WIPDS architecture  X  s fuzzy reinforcement learning man-agement (FRLM) includes RL and FS. Given an anomaly incident,
FRLM is internally analyzed and it updates the Q-value of the learner  X  s agent. If necessary, it automatically updates of a newly discovered intrusion incident by applying anomaly calculator component-based computational intelligence and knowledge man-agement techniques in recursive iteration of its execution cycle. 6 Knowledge management:
In order to share knowledge and allow collaboration between other managers (i.e. FRLM and multi-agent managers), the knowl-edge manager (KM) uses four types of decision mechanism: policy, ontology, anomaly pro fi le and knowledge-based. The knowledge-based component directly connects to CIDPS to store the process of training and testing of CI algorithms. The purpose of the decision ontology is to provide a basis for representing, anomaly modeling and probing the decision to identify the abnormal behavior. The policy works as an action selector and uses an executer agent for this target. The action policy of the KM mechanism adapts to FRLM to cluster the incident according to its severity and to raise an alarm. 7 Multi-agent management:
A multi-agent manager prioritizes the anomaly according to a victim  X  s vulnerability. There are three possible scenarios in this state. The fi rst case is pattern collection through the data collector (DC) agent. In the second case, if the incident is a severe intrusion or low intrusion, the analyzer agent (AA) and decision agent (DA) are associated to the ontology and knowl-edge base which comprise the computational intelligence applying fuzzy techniques to Co-WIDPS, leading to robust, fault tolerant and easy to manage and operate WSN architectures and deployments. Knowledge management enables the characteriza-tion of anomaly pro fi le knowledge as a set of related concepts within an anomaly calculator domain. The policy aspect of a multi-agent manager is thus utilized to predict anomaly behavior.
In summary, the fully functional intelligent computational techniques and allowance of a fully scalable distributed structure of our system reduces the risks of low accurate detection and dif fi culty in synchronizing information between autonomous agents. It is deemed to be more sophisticated and accurate than the other comparable systems. 6. Discussion
This paper introduces three classes of WIDPS detection meth-odologies, approaches and technologies. Each technique has its advantages and limitations. The TAI-based IDPS is straightforward to implement and very effective in inspecting known attacks. Still, the approach hardly identi fi es unknown attacks, attacks concealed by evasion techniques and several variants of known attacks. A number of fuzzy rule-based approaches to detect unknown attacks are also proposed. Such techniques may unnecessarily result in issues with excessive computing time consumption and rapid updating of the knowledge base, hindering attack effectiveness.
A more accurate and simpli fi ed approach is still required to increase ef fi ciency and effectiveness further.

Computational intelligence-based approaches such as rein-forcement learning (RL) algorithm have the merit of possessing with no prior knowledge of attacks. They do not work well in real-time applications due to their high computational com-plexity. A multi-agent-based CI (MCI) not only mitigates high computational complexity such as time consumption and updating knowledge, but also enhances detection performance.
Therefore, we proposed a collaborative-WIDPS (Co-WIDPS) to demonstrate the in fl uence of CI through reinforced multi-agent systems. A list of performance metrics (detection, false positive and false negative) for wireless sensor-based intrusion detec-tion and prevention systems was provided. Besides, three applicable concepts in developing collaborative-WIDPS were incorporated from the review of the latest research works: fuzzy reinforcement learning, knowledge management, and multi-agent manager, with the aim of establishing an ideal design to meet these performance requirements. The fuzzy manager part of this structure used a cooperative algorithm (cooperative-reinforcement learning) to strengthen the multi-agent manager in terms of updating knowledge managers. Collaborative technology is becoming signi fi cant as it is exten-sively employed in wireless-based IDPS platforms. The MCI is a primary collaborative compon ent which elaborates WIDPS.
Table 13 shows the most recent multi-agent-based CI works applicable to IDPS. These are classi fi ed into terms of management structure, advantages and disadvantages. MCI-based WIDPSs and the three concepts of management, namely FRLM, KM, and MA may be of assistance in designing an ef fi cient system that satis collaborative-WIDPS (Co-WIDPS) performance.

The features employed are very similar to each other. The most important varying features are management capabilities in the system  X  s structure. The collaborative management using the multi-agent system-based computational intelligence (MCI) portrays the ability to mitigate detection problems. In other words, the indivi-dual or single capabilities in terms of self-cooperative techniques (without using CI methods) consider all the features addressed in their systems. These inef fi ciencies are evidence of the lack of cooperative knowledge regarding suitable CI methods to identify intrusion prior to initiating any development.

All new solutions to developing MAS-based CI methods con-sider the requirements (detection and false alarm rate) as being able to overcome Co-WIDPS complexities and meet the real operational goals of wireless sensor networks. As illustrated in Table 14 and as per our analysis, the proposed MCI-based Co-WIDPS mentioned in the references meet two well-known requirements, and it is thus realistic to place them in actual wireless sensor environments. The heterogeneous essence of WSN necessitates using MCI and individual techniques for Co-WIDPS to meet the stated requirements.

Incorporating a multi-agent system (MAS) to computational intelligence (MCI) in terms of Co-WIDPS allows monitoring intru-sion activity. Fuzzy system (FS) with reinforcement learning (RL) in terms of FRLM has merged into Co-WIDPS, resulting in high true positive and low false alarm rates. The policy aspect of MAS-based FRLM applies a negotiation method to improving the detection accuracy. The developed Co-WIDPS around MAS-based FRLM satis fi es the detection performance. 7. Conclusion
A comprehensive taxonomy along with state-of-the-art intrusion detection and prevention systems was presented in this work. The scope was to capture researchers  X  attentionintoattemptingtodis-cover potential solutions to augment IDPS in order to minimize the impact of attacks on wireless sensor networks. This research paper essentially focused on the intellige nt approaches to detecting intru-sions into a network. Throughout, published papers related to IDPS were reviewed. The published works were assessed and categorized into three trends: traditional arti fi cial intelligence, computational intelligence and multi-agent-based computational intelligence. Dis-cussion was expanded by the proposal of a new architecture to detect and prevent intrusions in a wirel ess sensor network, by combining computational intelligence and multi-agent-based computational intelligence approaches, or collaborative-WIDPS. The projected archi-tecture de fi ned the three detection means of management: fuzzy reinforcement learning management (FRLM), knowledge manage-ment (KM), and multi-agent management. In conclusion, the detec-tion management techniques can be improved by minimizing the false alarm rates and increasing the detection rates in addition to decreasing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks. In future, with the intent of validating the proposed architecture, the aim is to design and develop the aforementioned detection management components.
