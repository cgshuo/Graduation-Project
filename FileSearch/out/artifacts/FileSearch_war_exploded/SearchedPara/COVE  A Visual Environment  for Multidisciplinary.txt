 New technologies and approaches are transforming how we carry out and communicate science. In oceanography, large multidisciplinary teams are developing deep-water ocean observatories of unprecedented s cale. These observatories will allow hundreds of scientists from disparate fields to conduct experiments together, provide real-time sensor and data access through the Internet, and create a vast archive of data. My work explores some of the challenges of creating collaborative tools to support this new science. Working together with a team of scientists, I designed and deployed the Collaborative Ocean Visualization Environment (COVE) to bring together the data, processes and people on the team. I then carried out three field evaluations of COVE: a multi-month deployment with the scientists, engineers, and graphics staff of the observatory design team, and two different two-week deployments as the primary planning and collaboration platform for expeditionary cruises to map observatory node sites and ge othermal sites. Based on these experiences and insight gained in these deployments, I explore the needs of interactive tools to support the work of large multidisciplinary ocean science teams. J.2 PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING; Earth and atmospheric sciences Keywords : Collaboration, Visualization, e-Science The oceans are an important focus of scientific study and exploration. They cover over 70% of the earth's surface, are a significant source of food for a large part of the planet, and due to the impact of global warming, are increasingly central to predicting how our climate will evolve during the next century. To date our ability to collect data about the oceans has been extremely limited relative to th is need, as oceanography has traditionally been an expeditionary science: small crews of oceanographers periodically go to sea in ships to collect data and conduct observations. Ocean observatories that continuous ly collect and analyze diverse oceanic data offer a new approach. Over the next few years, the National Science Foundation (N SF) Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) will create an ocean observatory of unprecedented scale. The Regional Scale Nodes (RSN) portion of the OOI, installed off the Washington and Oregon coasts, will support sensors from the ocean surf ace to deep in the seafloor, connected to cables delivering pow er and bandwidth. The RSN is just one example of large multidisciplinary earth science projects currently in progress or being considered around the world. These new projects are intended to be transformational in nature -to change the way we carry out and communicate earth science. The hope is that making vast amount s of data available to many different types of scientists continuously and in real time will greatly increase our knowledge of the studied ocean systems. Over the last year I worked with the design team of the RSN to better understand these new envi ronments. In this close collaboration I saw that the observatory is a mixture of several interrelated datasets, processes, and disciplines. In order to prepare experiments historical charts, observed datasets, and model simulations must all be explored in the context of the underlying bathymetry (sea floor terra in). It may require several different design approaches to find the optimal combination and placement of instruments to collect necessary data. As experiments delve deeper into th e inter-related processes of the ocean, several different experts are often required to plan and understand the results from these e xperiments. For example, a team studying the relationships between geothermal activity and biological productivity may incl ude geologists, biologists, chemists, geneticists, mathem aticians, and electrical and mechanical engineers. Each of these specialists brings a new and important perspectiv e to the problem. The RSN team has several specialized tools to support specific tasks or disciplines, but none that provide an effective collaborative interface across all these areas. One possible solution is geo-referencing brow sers, such as Google Earth [3] and Microsoft Live Earth [5], which provide a familiar physical metaphor for viewing the large geographic layout of the observatory. But these do not support the evolving 3D bathymetry sets of the observatory, do not support viewing of rich multi-dimensional science data, and have limited ability for planning and analysis of sophis ticated sensor deployments. Powerful desktop data viewing tool s such as Fledermaus X  [2] or the Integrated Data Viewer [6] allow visualization of bathymetry and science data, but are difficult to use and also lack necessary layout capabilities and data sharing support. Scientists therefore need to move between multiple systems to plan, analyze, and view observatory data. Several researchers have explored interfaces for communicating across diverse teams, such as St arr [7] and Bannon et.al. [8] and recently there has been much research into the area of collaboration in scientific environments including Arnstein et.al. [1] and Lee et.al. [4]. The unique elements to our users are the strong geographical aspect to the work that can be exploited, and the importance of solutions that work not only in the lab, but on extended expeditions at sea. To explore possible solutions, I worked closely with the RSN team to implement and deploy the Collaborative Ocean Visualization Environment (COVE) shown in Figure 1. It provides a collaborative interface refined through iterative prototyping with the scien tists. The key to its success is a common visual environment that cuts across the specifics of the multiple disciplines to provide a powerful interactive workplace for individuals, groups, and the entire team. COVE has been evaluated in two different environments. The first is in extensive use by the RSN team to create the core cabling and instrumentation lay out for the RSN. The design process used by this team before COVE included utilization of paper and digital maps, geographical surveys, and multiple software applications. When new layouts were created by the project team, they were recorded in word processing or spreadsheet documents, and visually represented with sketching tools or created by graphic artis ts. Changes were time-consuming and expensive. With COVE all of this data can be conveniently layered and experiment design supported with an interactive instrument layout interface. While editing, site metrics such as cost, power needs, and bandwidth are available on a heads-up display. An RSN specific library of instruments and cable types was created for the layout process and existing bathymetry, maps, and geographical features are stored in a shared data repository for access by the team. With changes now possible in minutes rather than hours or days radically different layouts are easily created and compared. This has been crucial as NSF requirements have varied over time. More recently we also had the unique opportunity to carry out an in situ design evaluation by being part of ocean expeditions, gathering and visualizing data in real-time to assess two major sites for the RSN and a geothermal site. Both ship mounted and submersible sonar are used to ga ther high resolution maps of the sites, as well as several other inst ruments to collect images, video, and data sets such as temperature and salinity. In the past, the process was to return to land and possibly wait months before visualizing the collected data together. With COVE the team had a common platform for viewing of th is data in near real time and could change plans daily based on unexpected correlations. As well as a common data space, we also provided a novel environment for planning the mapping runs. The previous technique for determining routes involved the team gathering around a map and placing markers (usually coins) to designate possible waypoints (turn locations) for the ship. High-resolution UTM projection of the location were printed and lengths of runs determined using a ruler. Way points were calculated by having both UTM and Latitude/Longitude c oordinates printed on the map edges to provide cross-reference. By creating simple extensions to the COVE interface, scientists could quickly lay out routes and get visual feedback of the expected coverage. Since all the observatory data was already available in COVE, planning with existing layouts was straightforw ard and routing plans could be quickly developed and forwarded to the ship or sub. Since it was cheap to make new routes, se veral possible plans could be created, compared, and discussed to determine effectiveness. This allowed a process that had been run by teams of engineers to be carried out by undergraduate students by the end of the trip. The results of these two types of deployments show that by providing an intuitive common interface for the team, visual environments like COVE can play a pivotal role in multidisciplinary earth science collaborations in many ways. It frees up senior scientists to focu s on scientific questions rather than the details of laying out ne tworks. It allows teams to consider several alternative plans in real time rather than a few over hours or days. And it allows quick and effective communication across all levels of expertise on the team quickly making even students effective team members. [1] Arnstein, L., Hung, C.Y., Franza, R., Zhou, Q.
