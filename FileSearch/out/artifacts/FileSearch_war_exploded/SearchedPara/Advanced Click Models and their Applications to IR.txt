 This tutorial concerns with more advanced and more recent topics in the area of click models. Here, we discuss recent developments in the area with a particular focus on applications of click models. The tutorial features a guest talk and a live demo where participants have a chance to build their own advanced click model.

While this is the second part of the two half-day tutorials, it is not required for participants to attend the first one. In the beginning of this part, a short introduction to basic click models will be given so that all participants share a common vocabulary. Then, recent advances in click models will be discussed.
 H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval Click models; web search
Click models, probabilistic models of the behavior of search engine users, have been studied extensively by the information retrieval community during the last five years.

A good body of work has been published on click models over the past 5 to 10 years. Importantly, the area continues to be an active one, with new models aimed at describing and/or predicting behavioral data being proposed at each of the main information retrieval conferences (SIGIR, WSDM, WWW, CIKM) over the past few years. There is also a fair number of publications that use click models presented in the main information retrieval conferences as well as ACM journals such as TOIS. All this indicates that there is a substantial and continued level of interest in the topic.
Indeed, we now have a handful of basic click models, inference methods, evaluation principles and applications for click models, that form the building blocks of ongoing research efforts in the area. The time is right to organize and present this material to a broad audience of interested information retrieval researchers, whether junior or senior. Many of the click models available today have been proposed by different industrial and academic research groups X  X ne of the key aims of our proposed tutorial is to bring these together and offer a unified perspective. To achieve this, we describe the basic click models, inference methods and evaluation principles. We supplement this with an account of available datasets and packages plus a live demo based on these. We also present click model applications accompanied by examples.

We expect the tutorial to be useful for both researchers and prac-titioners that either want to develop new click models, use them in their own research in other areas or apply the models described here to improve actual search systems. A large body of research on click models has been developed. This research has improved our understanding of user behavior in web search and facilitated the usage of click models in various search-related tasks. Current studies use a broad range of notations and terminology, perform experiments using different and mostly proprietary datasets, do not detail the model inference procedures used and, thus, do not provide a general systematic view on the research area. This, in turn, slows down the development and hin-ders the application of click models. The goal of this tutorial is to bring together current efforts in the area, summarize the research performed so far and give a holistic view on existing click models for web search. More specifically, the aims of this tutorial are the following: 1. Describe existing click models in a unified way, i.e., using 2. Compare commonly used click models, discuss their advan-3.

The tutorial will be useful as an overview for anyone starting research work in the area as well as for practitioners seeking concrete recipes.
The tutorial aims to provide a map of an increasingly rich land-scape of click models. By the end of the half-day tutorial, attendees should be familiar with the basic definitions and intuitions of what we consider to be the core models, with inference tasks for these models, and with uses of these models. While our presentation is necessarily formal in places, we make a serious effort to relate the models, the inference procedures and the applications back to the core information retrieval task and to web search data by including a fair number of examples. We hope that this supplies attendees who are new to the area with effective means to start using click models in their own research.
The advanced tutorial consists of two blocks of 1.5 hours. Each block will incorporate three types of activity: (1) presentation of the material, (2) live coding sessions, and (3) discussions at the end of each 1.5 hours. Additionally we plan to bring an author of a recent click model paper to give a short presentation and participate in the discussion. For the coding sessions, we will provide code examples and data samples. The participants will be able to either follow the examples on the slides or perform them live along with the presentation. During the discussion sessions at the end of each 1.5 hour block, we will offer the participants a number of quizzes aimed to (self-)assess the comprehension of the presented material. The schedule of the advanced tutorial is as follows.
