 1. Introduction
At present, mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of the auditory event-related potential (ERP), provides the best known objective measure of the accuracy of the central auditory function associated with the detection of a change in the auditory environment, and these perspectives are promising. The MMN does not require attention and is task indepen-dent. This makes it appropriate for testing differences, e.g., between clinical populations. It can also be used in the assess-ment of individuals such as infants who are unable to respond in a testing situation by speaking. Moreover, the MMN allows us to study the accuracy of auditory discrimination independently for any acoustic feature (e.g., frequency, intensity) and for learned categories (e.g., language phonemes). Also, with the MMN, there is a possibility to estimate the duration of sensory memory. This can be done by measuring the decay of the MMN amplitude as a function of the interval between two successive stimuli. Because of its several advantages, the MMN has numerous existing or potential applications [18].
Among them, the fast detection of the MMN has significant importance in the training of auditory/speech perception in clinical and other populations. The auditory perception can be assessed online by computation and evaluation of the basic parameters of the ERPs (i.e., amplitude of peaks and latency). The human brain could be trained on the auditory perception following this online assessment procedure, which consists of changing of the type of stimulation, if the auditory perception is improved with training. The human brain, trained under these conditions, is theoretically able to discriminate very small changes between stimuli even during sleep. This has a high psychophysiological relevance for different brain studies. How-ever, until the present day, there is a limited number of computational ways to follow perceptual learning on the basis of
ERPs (in particular, the MMN) responding to changes in the auditory environment. Since MMN is averaged over a number of trials to have a reliable measure of the brain processes of interest, it is too slow for the online assessment of learning.
In this context, the online computation and evaluation of basic parameters of the MMN is a highly essential step forward to be able to train the human brain in such manner. However, due to a very low single trial SNR of the MMN, the first step towards this online evaluation procedure implies the development of reliable procedures which will evaluate the basic MMN characteristics in a fewer number of trials than the traditional averaging technique.

More technically, the MMN is elicited by an irregularity (deviant stimulus) in a sequence of repetitive auditory stimula-tion (standard stimuli) [18,19] . Such an irregularity can consist in a deviation from the standard stimuli in a first-order fea-ture such as frequency, intensity, location, or duration of a tone. However, it can also consist in a deviation from higher-order features, for example, a tone that differed from the preceding series of stimuli in the conjunction of two of its features [2].
The MMN peaks at 100 X 200 ms after deviation onset with the amplitude of peaks being up to 3 l V (rarely, up to 10 l V). It has the fronto-centrally predominant scalp distribution and, when nose reference is used, a reversed polarity at leads posi-tioned below the Sylvian fissure [1]. The polarity reversal may be absent with deviations in higher-order features [2].
Due to the fact that the physical characteristics of standard and deviant stimuli are quite similar to each other, both of them may elicit some identical exogenous ERP components that may, similarly to the MMN, be sensitive to irregularities in repetitive stimulation (e.g., P1, N1) [18]. However, only the deviant stimulus elicits the MMN. The conventional procedure to remove the common exogenous processing is to apply the difference wave (DW) procedure. It consists of subtracting the
ERPs elicited by the standard stimulus (standard sweep) from that elicited by the deviant stimulus (deviant sweep). This pro-cedure leaves only a clean MMN if these common ERPs are indeed identical. It means that these ERPs do not depend on the difference between standards and deviant stimuli. However, in practice, this is not always the case leading to under-or over-estimation of the MMN [5,9]. Additionally, the DW procedure reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because the noise in the standard sweep is added to the noise in the deviant sweep. Thus, if a paradigm eliciting practically flat responses to the stan-dard stimulus is available, the responses to the deviant stimulus can be used without the DW procedure. In fact, mainly the
N1, a negative deflection peaking at 50 X 150 ms after stimulus onset and, thus, partly overlapping the MMN time window, contributes to common exogenous processing [18]. The N1 consists of at least three components, two of which are sensitive to the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), becoming smaller with shortening the SOA [20]. The SOA is usually defined as the time interval between the onsets of two successive stimuli and, in extreme cases, can be equal to duration of a stimulus (uninterrupted sound paradigm with no silence between stimuli [22,26] ).

The uninterrupted sound paradigm in [22] consisted of two alternating tones of 600 and 800 Hz with the same constant duration of 100 ms where one of the 600 Hz tones was infrequently shortened to 75, 50, or 30 ms. For simplicity, only 600 Hz tones were shortened, causing an asymmetry in the design. The authors reported a clear MMN and argued that the paradigm produced a minimal elicitation of the N1 component. The same paradigm but only with 50 and 30 ms deviant stimuli was employed in [6] testing differences in the MMN characteristics among three groups of children. Comprehensive analysis of the ERPs elicited in this paradigm (the same data as in [6]) was performed in [10]. The authors revealed that the standard sweep was not flat and, thus, the DW procedure was necessary. However, at the same time, they showed the DW procedure would not be the most efficient way to quantify the MMN in the particular paradigm as it produced an unclean MMN and some spurious ERPs. These spurious ERPs were especially seen at the early latencies of 0 X 100 ms of the resulting traces and biased the baseline. As an alternative, the authors proposed the optimal digital filtering (ODF) procedure to separate the
MMN from the rhythmic responses to the standard stimuli in the frequency domain (2 X 8.5 Hz digital band-pass filter). How-ever, neither the DW nor ODF procedures extracted the MMN with characteristics expected from substantial number of pub-lications: the more deviant stimulus (i.e., 30 ms) elicits a more pronounced MMN, whose peak amplitude is larger and whose latency is shorter, than the less deviant stimulus (i.e., 50 ms). Recently, a new procedure to extract a cleaner MMN than after application of the DW and ODF procedures was initially proposed in [12] using the same data as in [6,10] and then extended by the authors with results of statistical comparison in [11]. The procedure was based on independent component analysis (ICA) [8]. The ERPs were decomposed into the independent components (ICs) through the FastICA algorithm [7] with the val-idation by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering implemented in the ICASSO software package [4]. The proposed ICA decomposition procedure allowed to extract a cleaner MMN, whose characteristics concur with substantial number of pub-lications, and obtain an increased single trial SNR compared to the DW procedure [11]. The authors suggested that this pro-cedure could be used to study the MMN in paradigms similar to their uninterrupted sound paradigm with small modifications.

The studies with application of digital filtering on the MMN are well presented in the literature. The frequency range of the MMN is a question still under speculation. An analog band-pass of .1 X 30 Hz has often been used to record the MMN.
However, these are not probably the optimal filter settings with respect to the SNR, since the MMN has most of its energy in the 2 X 5 Hz frequency range [21]. The test X  X etest reliability of the MMN for frequency, duration, and intensity deviants was compared in [25]. The authors used the band-pass digital filter of 1 X 30 Hz for data illustration and 2 X 10 Hz for the subse-quent amplitude and latency analyses as this stabilizes the numerical values of the MMN amplitude. The influence of low-and high-pass digital filter settings to the MNN amplitude during wakefulness and slow-wave sleep was demonstrated in [23]. The authors argued that, in wakefulness, any band-pass digital filter with cut-offs wider than 3 X 12 Hz could be used to reduce low-and high-frequency noise and maintain a tolerable MMN amplitude.

In contrast, the studies with application of ICA for the MMN extraction are relatively infrequent in the literature. A two-step approach to study the brain electrical activations underlying the MMN was designed in [16]. It consisted of application of the ICA with subsequent identification of the obtained ICs by low-resolution tomography (LORETA). The authors argued correspondence of the sources associated with these ICs to those proposed in the classical MMN literature. Support vector machine classification with recursive (based on ICs) channel elimination of averaged ERPs was implemented in [3] to show that untrained user X  X  MMN data can be classified with a high level of accuracy. The FastICA algorithm was used. The authors argued that the MMN can be used as a basis for brain X  X omputer interfaces. They also showed that classification accuracy for the DW procedure was poorer than for the ICA decomposition due a lower SNR in the DW procedure.

The purpose of this study is to compare statistically the performance of the conventional DW, ODF [10], and recently pro-posed ICA decomposition [11,12] procedures in the quantitative analyses of the MMN. The comparison is performed in the context of the experimental paradigm, employing a prototypical MMN protocol with a silence between stimuli. The em-ployed paradigm with duration decrement deviants is a small modification of the uninterrupted sound paradigm used in [6,10,11] . Thus, it allows us to test the sensitivity of the ODF and ICA decomposition procedures to small variations in the stimulus setup. The preliminary results concerning application of the ICA decomposition procedure on the ERP data from one participant in the context of the employed paradigm can be found in [12]. Each of these three procedures is separately applied to the same ERP data. Then, the results obtained after application of these procedures are statistically compared on the peak amplitude, latency, and single trial SNR of the MMN to ascertain the most suitable procedure for the quantitative analyses of the MMN, which can then be used in similar paradigms with sound duration decrements. 2. Methods 2.1. Design and procedure
The ERP data were collected at the Department of Psychology at the University of Jyv X skyl X , Finland. The participants in the experiment were twelve adults (four male and eight female, 23 X 30 years of age, mean 25.2 years) with no obvious hear-ing defects. The participants gave informed consent after the nature of the experiment was explained to them.
A schematic illustration of the experimental paradigm is depicted in Fig. 1 . The ERPs were elicited in a passive oddball protocol presenting an auditory stimulation. The stimulus setup was comprised of frequent sine tones of 600 Hz of 100 ms duration each (standard stimuli). Fifteen percent of the tones were randomly replaced by shorter tones of 75, 50, or 30 ms duration (deviant stimuli) each 5% referred to as dev75, dev50, and dev30, respectively. However, there were at least four standard stimuli between any two deviant stimuli. The SOA was constant and equal to 200 ms. It means that si-lence, which followed any deviant stimulus, was increased proportionally to its shortening (e.g., after 50 ms deviant stimu-lus, silence was 150 ms). The stimuli were presented binaurally through headphones at an intensity of 65 dB. During the experimental session lasting approximately 20 min, the participants read a book by their own choice. They were told not type of deviant stimuli. 2.2. Electrophysiological recordings
The Sound Assistant software (University of Jyv X skyl X , Finland) was used to control the presentation and timing of the auditory stimuli. The ERP data were recorded with a gain of 50 K with Brain Atlas amplifiers (Bio-Logic, Chicago). Data acqui-sition of electrophysiological responses was conducted with a Tecmar X  X  Labmaster 12-bit, 16-channel AD-converter and the
DSAMP software package (University of Jyv X skyl X , Finland). The sampling rate was 200 Hz and an analog band-pass of .1 X  30 Hz was used. The electrophysiological recordings began at 400 ms prior to the onset of the deviant stimulus and lasted for 375 ms after its onset (see Fig. 1 ). The recorded traces can be divided into the two time intervals with the same duration equal to 375 ms: standard sweep (including the responses elicited by the standard stimuli) and deviant sweep (including the response elicited by the deviant stimulus plus, partly, the response elicited by the subsequent standard stimulus). The re-corded data were processed off-line.
 The ERP data were recorded from nine channels using an Electro-Cap International 20-electrode location cap with Ag/
AgCl electrodes filled with ECI Electro-Gel. The cap places the electrodes over the standard 10 X 20 system of electrode place-ment. The data were recorded from frontal (F3, Fz, and F4), central (C3, Cz, and C4), parietal (Pz), and mastoid (M1 and M2) locations. All electrode locations were referred to the tip of the nose. Eye movements were measured at the upper corner of the left eye (G1) and the lower corner of the right eye (G2). Neuroline (Type 725-01-K) disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with ECI Electro-Gel were used to place the electrodes on the mastoid and eye locations. The skin underneath the electrode locations was cleansed with isopropyl alcohol and the outer layers of the epidermis were carefully removed with an abrasive paste. Impedances were always less than 5 k X . 2.3. Data analysis
The initial dataset for the three procedures used in this study was 12 4D arrays of 9 155 3 300 (i.e., 12 participants, 9 electrode locations, 155 samples per trace of 775 ms, three types of deviant stimuli, 300 trials of each type of deviant stimuli). 2.3.1. DW procedure
The DW procedure consisted of subtracting the standard sweep from the deviant sweep. Subtraction was performed on the single trial level for each participant. In this study, we used an alternative method to obtain DW traces (DW procedure with average standard sweep) compared to that in our previous study [11]. For each participant, there were three standard sets with identical ERPs (consisting of 300 individual standard sweeps) and three deviant sets with different ERPs (consisting of 300 individual deviant sweeps corresponding to the three types of deviant stimuli). At the single trial level, it provided a possibility to subtract the average of three standard sweeps, rather than the individual standard sweep preceding the cor-responding deviant sweep. This approach may reduce up to three times the noise variance in the average standard sweep to be subtracted from each individual deviant sweep. Thus, the array of the individual standard sweeps of 9 75 3 300 (samples 1 X 75 in the second dimension of the initial array of 9 155 3 300) was averaged with respect to the third dimension (type of deviant stimuli), producing 9 75 1 300 array, and then the third dimension was three times rep-licated, restoring the initial dimensionality, i.e., 9 75 3 300. The resulting array of the average standard sweeps was subtracted from the array of the individual deviant sweeps with the same dimensionality of 9 75 3 300 (samples 81 X 155 in the second dimension of the initial array of 9 155 3 300). The traces obtained after subtraction were time corrected by 75, 50, or 30 ms to adjust for the fact that while in any other deviant (e.g., frequency, intensity), the deviance starts at stimulus onset, the present duration deviants deviate from the standard stimulus starting at 75, 50, or 30 ms, respectively. A similar correction was performed in [25]. After this time correction, the traces for dev75, dev50, and dev30 were truncated from the end by 0, 25, and 45 ms, respectively. The length of the resulting time corrected traces for each type of deviant stimuli was 300 ms. All data points averaged over the first 50 ms of these resulting traces, which started from the offset of the deviant stimuli after the time correction, were used to compute the mean baseline. Finally, the ob-tained data were averaged with respect to the trial dimension, producing one 3D array of 9 60 3 for each participant. 2.3.2. ODF procedure
The ODF procedure to extract the MMN in an uninterrupted sound paradigm was originally proposed in [10]. It consisted of digital filtering of the full-length ERP traces in the frequency domain by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [27].In more details, such filtering procedure consisted of three steps. First, a direct FFT was used to transform the original time ser-ies to the frequency domain. Second, those elements of transformation that corresponded to the frequencies to be eliminated were set to zero. Finally, the original time series minus the eliminated frequencies were recreated by an inverse FFT. In order to increase the resolution in the frequency domain, the original time series were padded with zeros to have 2000 time sam-ples. For the current sampling rate of 200 Hz, this provided the resolution in the frequency domain equal to .1 Hz. It was shown in [10] that the frequency range for optimal extraction of the MMN in an uninterrupted sound paradigm was 2 X  8.5 Hz. Since the paradigm employed in this study is very similar to that one, the same settings in the ODF procedure (e.g., cut-off frequencies, length of FFT) were used. The ODF procedure was performed on the single trial level for each par-ticipant. Also, it was shown in [10] that the standard sweep was practically flat after application of the ODF procedure and, thus, deviant sweep alone can be used in the quantitative analyses of the MMN. Due to this fact, the full-length ERP traces after application of the ODF procedure were cut in order to have exactly the same time interval within the deviant sweep as after application of the DW procedure (see above). It means that, for example, within the full-length ERP traces of 775 ms for dev50, the time interval of 450 X 750 ms was isolated and then used in the subsequent quantitative analyses of the MMN.
Similarly to the DW procedure, all data points averaged over the first 50 ms of the resulting traces were used to compute the mean baseline. Finally, the obtained data were averaged with respect to the trial dimension, producing one 3D array of 9 60 3 for each participant. 2.3.3. ICA decomposition procedure
The ICA decomposition procedure to extract the MMN in an uninterrupted sound paradigm was originally proposed in [12] and then extended by the authors with results of statistical comparison in [11]. In this study, the implementation of the procedure was fully identical to that reported in these two studies. It was also performed on the concatenated averages 9 155 3 300 was averaged with respect to the trial dimension, producing 3D array of 9 155 3, and then three devi-ant traces with the length of 155 samples were concatenated, producing 2D array of 9 465. The resulting 2D array was given to the ICA decomposition procedure, which consisted of the four consecutive steps. First, decomposition of the original traces to ICs was performed using the stabilized symmetrical algorithm from version 2.5 of FastICA with the hyperbolic tan-gent non-linearity [7], searching nine ICs from the ERP data at nine electrode locations. Second, validation of the obtained ICs was performed using a clustering and visualizing method implemented in the ICASSO software package of version 1.22 [4]. The number of runs of the FastICA algorithm with random initial conditions was constantly set equal to 100, producing 900
IC estimates. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with average-linkage criterion was used to form nine clusters of esti-mated ICs. The curvilinear component analysis (CCA) was chosen for visualization of the clusters. The stability index was calculated to reflect the compactness and isolation of a cluster. This index is equal to one for an ideal cluster. More details was identified automatically by the ICASSO procedure. The centrotype is one IC estimate in the cluster with the maximum sum of similarities to other ICs estimates within the cluster. Third, division of the obtained IC centrotypes into one MMN-like
IC and eight non-MMN-like ICs was performed automatically using the polarity reversal property of the MMN, which usually appeared when all electrode locations were referred to the tip of the nose [1]. Finally, projection of the MMN-like and non-
MMN-like ICs back to the electrode locations was performed separately for these two sets of ICs. More details about the ICA decomposition procedure can be found in [11]. Similarly to the ODF procedure, the full-length projection of one MMN-like IC back to the electrode locations was cut in order to have exactly the same time interval within the deviant sweep as after application of the DW procedure. And also, all data points averaged over the first 50 ms of the resulting traces were used to compute the mean baseline. Finally, the obtained data were one 3D array of 9 60 3 for each participant. 2.3.4. Single trial SNR estimation
The same procedure as deployed in [10,11] was used to estimate the single trial SNR of the MMN after application of the three procedures under the comparison. Such SNR estimation procedure was originally reported in [17]. In short, for one par-ticipant, electrode location, and type of deviant stimuli, the signal power was estimated as the variance of the averaged traces of 300 single trials. The noise power was estimated as the mean value of 300 values of variances calculated in each single trial minus the signal power estimate. Then, the signal power estimate was divided by the noise power estimate resulting in the single trial SNR estimate based on these 300 trials. The calculation was repeated for each type of deviant stimuli, electrode location, and participant using the time window of 50 X 200 ms from the offset of the deviant stimulus (see Fig. 1 ). Finally, the obtained single trial SNR values were converted to dB. 2.3.5. Statistical analyses
The aforementioned time window of 50 X 200 ms was used in the statistical analyses. Note that the time interval for cal-culation of the baseline was the same in the statistical analyses for all three procedures (see description of the three proce-dures). In order to simplify the comparison among the procedures, relations among the scalp regions (e.g., sagittality and/or laterality) were not analyzed in this study. Thus, all electrode locations were averaged separately for each type of deviant stimuli and participant before the statistical tests. The traces at the mastoid locations were inverted before the averaging as these had positive amplitude of the MMN in contrast to other locations which had negative amplitude. Several statistical tests were performed. First, repeated measures ANOVAs were employed to test if the peak amplitude of ERPs within the resulting traces differed from the baseline. This was done within the earlier-defined time window for each procedure and type of deviant stimuli separately. Second, the peak amplitude, latency, and single trial SNR of the MMN within the same time window were examined through three repeated measures ANOVAs. These were dependent variables. In these tests, dif-ferences among the procedures (three levels: DW, ODF, and ICA) and among the deviants (three levels: dev75, dev50, and dev30), as well as their interaction, were compared. These were independent variables. The peak amplitude of the MMN was defined as a single data point most distant from the baseline value. The latency of the MMN was defined as a time inter-val, which corresponded to the peak amplitude of the MMN, and calculated from the offset of the deviant stimuli (see above about the time correction for duration decrement deviants). The single trial SNR expressed in dB was used in all statistical analyses. The Greenhouse X  X eisser correction for violations of the sphericity assumption was applied where appropriate, but the original degrees of freedom were reported. Estimated effect sizes were reported as partial Eta squared. For further anal-yses, repeated measures simple contrasts were employed testing pair-wise differences among the three procedures. Finally, additional repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to test if dev75, dev50, and dev30 differed from each other in the peak amplitude, latency, and single trial SNR of the MMN. These analyses were performed separately after application of each procedure. 3. Results 3.1. Application of the procedures 3.1.1. DW procedure
Fig. 2 shows the full-length grand averaged ERP traces of 775 ms, standard and deviant sweeps of 375 ms used in the DW procedure, and resulting time corrected and truncated traces of 300 ms after application of the DW procedure for dev75, dev50, and dev30. Note that, for the DW procedure, the average standard sweep was used and shown in the three middle graph of Fig. 2 (see description of the DW procedure above). It can be seen from the grand average that the onsets of both the standard and deviant stimuli elicited the N1 response, peaking at about 125 ms after the onsets of the stimuli. The amplitude of the N1 was reduced due to the short SOA of 200 ms. Also, it can be seen that the onsets of both the standard and deviant stimuli elicited the positive responses, peaking at about 75 ms after the onsets of the stimuli. These responses can be interpreted as the P1 responses. The N1 and P1 responses in the standard sweep were similar by the amplitude and latency the electrode locations (F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, and Pz) except for the mastoids (M1 and M2) where the polarity was reversed (Fig. 2 , right graph). These deflections had fronto-central topographies, peaking at 100 X 200 ms from the moment when the change (of duration) became observable (i.e., the offset of the deviant stimuli) and were interpreted as the MMN. It can be seen that the N1 and MMN responses partly overlapped each other in the deviant sweep (Fig. 2 , three middle graphs).
Additionally, a large positivity followed the MMN in the deviant sweep for dev50 and dev30, which can be interpreted as the P3a component. This might be a result of switching of attention to the deviant stimulus, which was quite distinguishable from the standard stimuli (at least dev50 and dev30). 3.1.2. ODF procedure
Fig. 3 shows the full-length grand averaged ERP traces of 775 ms after application of the ODF procedure for dev75, dev50, and dev30. The ERPs in the frequency range of 2 X 8.5 Hz referred to the MMN (left graph) and ERPs in the frequency ranges of .1 X 2 Hz and 8.5 X 30 Hz irrelevant to the MMN (right graph) are shown. It can be seen in Fig. 3 (left graph) that the MMN-like activity was partly separated from the N1 and P1 responses and was not separated from the P3a responses (except dev75 where no P3a was elicited). The residuals of the N1 and P1 responses in the standard sweep of the optimally filtered traces were observable. The main parts of these ERPs in the standard sweep were quite similar to those in the deviant sweep ( Fig. 3 , right graph) that could be explained by the constant SOA. Due to these two latter observations, it is reasonable to assume that the MMN-like activity after application of the ODF procedure consisted of a mixture of the genuine MMN and N1 re-sponses. Furthermore, the residual of the P1 response biased the baseline level for each type of deviant stimuli, since this residual appeared within the first 50 ms of the traces obtained after the time correction for duration decrement deviants. These artificially increased the peak amplitude of the MMN-like activity in the subsequent statistical analyses. 3.1.3. ICA decomposition procedure
The ERP data from one randomly chosen participant were used to illustrate the performance of the ICA decomposition procedure (mainly, the step of validation of the ICs) in the present experimental paradigm. For these ERP data, the results of application of the ICASSO validation procedure on the ICs obtained after 100 runs of the FastICA algorithm are presented below. Fig. 4 shows the stability index for the estimated clusters (left graph) and the number of IC estimates in each cluster (right graph). Fig. 5 shows visualization of IC estimates within the clusters and their interrelations as a 2D CCA projection.
The clusters are indicated by convex hulls. It can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5 that the diameter of the convex hull representing similarity among IC estimates grew with decrease of the value of the stability index. Fig. 6 shows the estimated IC centro-types associated with each cluster and ordered by the quality rank. It can be seen that the IC centrotype with label 1 (MMN-like IC) was active in the MMN time windows defined earlier as 50 X 200 ms from the offset of the deviant stimuli and prac-tically flat elsewhere. In Fig. 6 , the time intervals of 525 X 675, 1275 X 1425, and 2030 X 2180 ms of the concatenated traces cor-respond to these MMN time windows for dev75, dev50, and dev30, respectively. The MMN-like IC had the largest value of the stability index compared to the non-MMN-like ICs in Fig. 4 (left graph) and, thus, the most compact cluster in Fig. 5 . After projecting the MMN-like IC with zeroing all other ICs back to the electrode locations, it produced the expected polarity rever-sal at the corresponding electrode locations (not shown) and explained 60% of variance in the MMN time windows. Thus, this
IC represented namely the MMN rather than some non-existent ERPs, which could be produced by overfitting of the FastICA algorithm [24]. Also, it can be seen in Fig. 6 that the IC centrotype with label 4 had a slow frequency drift of about 2 Hz, and the IC centrotype with label 5 had a high-frequency noise, which could probably be caused by a noisy equipment or envi-ronment during the recording. Surprisingly, no clear IC centrotypes representing the N1, P1, or P3a responses were identified.
Fig. 7 shows the full-length grand averaged traces of 775 ms after application of the ICA decomposition procedure for dev75, dev50, and dev30. The MMN-like and non-MMN-like ICs were separately projected back to the electrode locations (left and right graphs, respectively). It can be seen that the MMN was separated from the N1, P1, and P3a responses (Fig. 7 , left graph). The residual of these irrelevant ERP activities in both the standard and deviant sweeps of the ICA decom-posed traces was negligible compared to the MMN-like activity at 50 X 200 ms from the offset of the deviant stimuli. At the same time, the N1, P1 and P3a responses were observable in the grand average of projections of the non-MMN-like ICs in contrast to the MMN-like activity, which was not identified in the deviant sweep of these traces ( Fig. 7 , right graph). 3.2. Statistical analyses
The negative deflections associated with the MMN obtained after application of the DW, ODF, and ICA decomposition pro-cedures differed significantly from the baseline in all deviants. For the results below, the order of deviants is dev75, dev50, and dev30, respectively. The DW procedure: F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  96 : 724 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 and F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  100 : 827 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 p  X  : 902. The ODF procedure: F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  52 : 297 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 p  X  : 909; and F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  88 : 010 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 p &lt;: 01 ; g 2 p  X  : 622 ; F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  125 : 378 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 The results of three repeated measures ANOVAs for all dependent variables (i.e., peak amplitude, latency, and single trial
SNR of the MMN responses) are presented below. 3.2.1. Peak amplitude
There was a main effect of procedure, F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  16 : 682 ; e  X  : 953 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2
Repeated measures contrasts revealed that the MMN peak amplitude was larger for the DW procedure than for both the

There was a main effect of procedure, F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  6 : 353 ; e  X  : 822 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 p  X  : 724, and a procedure deviant interaction, F  X  4 ; 44  X  X  3 : 014 ; e  X  : 844 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 contrasts revealed that the single trial SNR of the MMN was better for the ODF procedure than for both the DW and ICA decomposition procedures, F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  12 : 625 ; p &lt;: 01 ; g 2 also revealed that there was no difference between the DW and ICA decomposition procedures in this characteristic of the
MMN, F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  : 008 ; p  X  : 928 ; g 2 p  X  : 001. 3.2.4. Inter-deviant differences
Estimated marginal means and standard errors of the corresponding characteristics of the MMN for the three procedures and three deviants are summarized in Table 1 . Note that all electrode locations were averaged (see above). Also, note that, in the case of negative values in the single trial SNR, a lower absolute value means a better single trial SNR.

The results of the statistical tests employed separately for each of the three procedures to check differences among devi-ants are presented below.

For the MMN peak amplitude, there were main effects of deviant, F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  10 : 093 ; e  X  : 891 ; p &lt;: 01 ; g 2
F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  21 : 003 ; e  X  : 949 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 p  X  : 656; and F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  12 : 930 ; e  X  : 910 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2
ICA decomposition procedures, respectively. Repeated measures contrasts revealed that the MMN peak amplitude for dev75 was significantly lower than for dev50 and this characteristic for dev50 was significantly lower than for dev30 in each of the three procedures except for pair of dev75 vs. dev50 in the DW procedure where a difference was not significant (see the mean values in Table 1 ). For the result below, the order of pairs is dev75 vs. dev50 and dev50 vs. dev30, respectively. The
DW procedure: F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  3 : 622 ; p  X  : 084 ; g 2 p  X  : 248 and F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  6 : 214 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2
F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  13 : 514 ; p &lt;: 01 ; g 2 p  X  : 551 and F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  9 : 062 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2
F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  7 : 699 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 p  X  : 412 and F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  6 : 725 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2
For the MMN latency, there was a main effect of deviant, F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  6 : 385 ; e  X  : 845 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 decomposition procedure, but not for the DW or ODF procedures, F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  2 : 571 ; e  X  : 702 ; p  X  : 121 ; g 2 dev75 was shorter than for dev50 and this characteristic for dev50 was shorter than for dev30 after application of the
ODF procedure. However, repeated measures contrasts revealed that any of these differences were not significant for this procedure; dev75 vs. dev50 and dev50 vs. dev30, F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  : 205 ; p  X  : 660 ; g 2 g 2  X  : 041, respectively. On the contrary, the MMN latency for dev75 was longer than for dev50 and this characteristic for dev50 was longer than for dev30 after application of the DW and ICA decomposition procedures. Repeated measures con-trasts revealed that any of these differences were not significant for the DW procedure; dev75 vs. dev50 and dev50 vs. dev30, F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  1 : 251 ; p  X  : 287 ; g 2 p  X  : 102 and F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  1 : 325 ; p  X  : 274 ; g 2 nificant for the pair dev50 vs. dev30, F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  5 : 364 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  2 : 862 ; p  X  : 119 ; g 2 p  X  : 206, for the ICA decomposition procedure.

For the MMN single trial SNR, there were main effects of deviant, F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  18 : 744 ; e  X  : 991 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2  X  : 630 ; F  X  2 ; 22  X  X  22 : 387 ; e  X  : 948 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2
ODF, and ICA decomposition procedures, respectively. Repeated measures contrasts revealed that the single trial SNR of the MMN for dev75 was significantly worse than for dev50 and this characteristic for dev50 was significantly worse than for dev30 in each of the three procedures (see the mean values in Table 1 ). For the result below, the order of pairs is dev75 vs. dev50 and dev50 vs. dev30, respectively. The DW procedure: F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  7 : 645 ; p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 and F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  11 : 599 ; p &lt;: 01 ; g 2 p  X  : 513. The ODF procedure: F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  20 : 840 ; p &lt;: 001 ; g 2 p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 p  X  : 350. And the ICA decomposition procedure: F  X  1 ; 11  X  X  10 : 014 ; p &lt;: 01 ; g 2 p &lt;: 05 ; g 2 p  X  : 324.

Fig. 8 shows the MMN responses resulting from each of the three procedures for dev75 (left graph), dev50 (middle graph), and dev30 (right graph). It can be seen that the ICA decomposition procedure allowed us to obtain a cleaner MMN compared to the DW and ODF procedures, despite lower amplitude of the responses. Note that the MMN traces for the DW procedure were obtained by subtracting the standard sweep from the deviant sweep (see Fig. 2 ), whereas the MMN traces for the ODF (see Fig. 3 ) and ICA decomposition (see Fig. 7 ) procedures were represented by the deviant sweeps themselves. As mentioned above, all these MMN traces were time corrected for the duration decrement deviants and truncated. Also, note that, in the case of the ODF procedure, the residual of the P1 response biased the baseline level, making it more positive in all electrode locations except the mastoids and, thus, artificially increasing the amplitude of the MMN-like activity. 4. Discussion
The present study aims to examine the MMN in the experimental paradigm, employing a more prototypical MMN pro-tocol than in [11] with duration decrement deviants and a silence between stimuli, by the conventional DW, ODF, and re-cently proposed ICA decomposition procedures. The obtained results show that each procedure extracts a clear MMN-like activity (statistically significant). In general, the results are comparable with those obtained in our previous study with an uninterrupted sound paradigm [11]. However, the procedures differ in the performance of the extraction. Application of the DW procedure is reasonable in this paradigm, since it removes common exogenous processing (N1 and P1 responses), but not P3a, and keeps the MMN. In contrast, application of the ODF procedure with the frequency range of 2 X 8.5 Hz used for
MMN extraction is not efficient, since this produces the residuals of the N1, P1, and P3a responses, which overlap the MMN (e.g., N1) and bias the baseline (e.g., P1). The best performance among the three procedures is achieved by application of the
ICA decomposition procedure where the residuals of neither the N1 nor P1 responses with negligible residual of the P3a re-sponse are observable. However, it should be noted that the presence of a P3a after the application of the DW procedure cannot strictly be interpreted as a contamination of the MMN, since a frontal component can be considered to be an integral part of the MMN obtained under some but not all conditions. If the more frontal component is considered to be a genuine part of the MMN (i.e., a second source activated by the detection of a mismatch), then the DW procedure extracts a  X  X  X ore X  genuine MMN than the ICA decomposition procedure. Thus, the interpretation of the presence of a P3a after application of the DW procedure as a contamination of the MMN or its absence after application of the ICA decomposition procedure be-comes a matter of personal preference of the authors in different studies.

The main statistical comparisons among the three procedures show that the reduction in the MMN peak amplitude is sig-nificant after application of both the ICA decomposition and ODF procedures compared to the DW procedure. The MMN peak amplitude is lower after application of the ICA decomposition procedure compared to the ODF procedure (note the biased baseline in the case of the ODF procedure). The temporal characteristics of the MMN are not affected by any of the proce-dures used in this study. Finally, application of the ODF procedure significantly improves the single trial SNR compared to the DW and ICA decomposition procedures. Application of the ODF and ICA decomposition procedures would require the following number of experimental trials to obtain the same single trial SNR than application of the DW procedure. The
ODF procedure: 268, 148, and 121 single trials (the mean is 179 single trials); and the ICA decomposition procedure: 353, 282, and 260 single trials (the mean is 299 single trials) for dev75, dev50, and dev30, respectively, instead of 300 individual single trials for each type of deviant stimuli.

It can be observed that the ICA decomposition procedure requires a smaller number of trials than the DW procedure but only for the two most deviating stimuli. The lack of a significant effect in the single trial SNR between these two procedures can be explained by the use of an alternative method to obtain DW traces, i.e., DW procedure with average standard sweep (see above). In our previous study [11], we used the DW procedure without average standard sweep (ordinary DW proce-dure) and obtained a significant effect indicating that the ICA decomposition procedure extracted the MMN with a better single trial SNR than the DW procedure. On the first revision of this study, we also used the ordinary DW procedure and ob-tained a similar significant effect. The efficiency of application of the alternative DW procedure depends on the number of types of deviant stimuli in the experimental design, i.e., the more types of deviant stimuli used (more standard sweeps with identical ERPs would therefore be involved in calculation of the average standard sweep), the more efficient application of this procedure. In this study, we analyze the three types of deviant stimuli in contrast to the previous study with only two types. Thus, it was reasonable to reanalyze the data using the alternative DW procedure as it provided up to three times less noisy average standard sweep. Due to this reason, we would recommend to use the DW procedure with average standard sweep when an experimental paradigm involves more than one type of deviant stimuli and, especially, more than two. A necessary condition for this procedure must be elicitation of identical ERPs in the standard sweep preceding each type of deviant stimuli. It can be assumed that instead of the average of three individual standard sweeps in the alternative DW pro-cedure it would be more reasonable to use the average of 3 300 individual standard sweeps as this would produce the cleanest possible average standard sweep. However, it is possible to demonstrate that these two approaches produce exactly the same resulting average DW traces. In fact, after subtraction the average standard sweep (either with three or 3 300 individual standard sweeps) from the individual deviant sweeps, the resulting traces are then averaged with respect to the trial dimension (i.e., 300) to obtain the average DW which is needed for the MMN amplitude and latency analyses. Thus, it is not necessary to use the average standard sweep consisting of 3 300 individual standard sweeps before subtraction. However, these two approaches have different impact on the procedure of the single trial SNR estimation used in this study.
It is possible to show, though it is out of the scope of this study, that the approach with average of 3 300 individual stan-dard sweeps leads to underestimation of the noise in the single trial SNR estimation procedure as the noise from the indi-vidual standard sweeps is not involved in this estimation. On the other hand, it is possible to demonstrate that averaging three individual standard sweeps does not lead to such underestimation. Therefore, the DW procedure with average of three standard sweeps can be recommended for the use when the goal is to estimate the single trial SNR in the DW procedure independently from the analyses of the amplitude and latency of the MMN.

Regarding the ODF procedure, it should be noted that this procedure extracts an unclean MMN and may subsequently require, for example, application of the DW procedure to remove the residuals of the N1, P1, and P3a responses. This would reduce the single trial SNR and may produce non-significant results in the SNR statistical tests. However, in this case, this would not be the original ODF procedure proposed in [10]; this would be rather a combination of some digital filtering pro-cedure with the subsequent DW procedure or vice versa. For this new filtering procedure, the frequency range of 2 X 8.5 Hz can be adjusted not to remove the responses to the standard stimuli for what it was designed, but rather to stabilize the sta-tistical analyses of the MMN after application of the DW procedure (e.g., 2 X 10 Hz) as in [25]. But implementation of this 2 X  10 Hz digital filtering after application of the DW procedure is not considered in this study and may be implemented some-where else for the current paradigm. In this study, we only test our original ODF procedure and observe that this procedure is not efficient in the current experimental design as mentioned earlier. The inefficiency can stem from the differences in the paradigms. Indeed, in an uninterrupted sound paradigm, the repeated stimuli elicit only minimal ERPs, whereas in the cur-rent paradigm with silence between stimuli, the ERPs are better defined and the traces contain relatively large exogenous components. These components are not removed completely by the ODF procedure, which is originally developed for an uninterrupted sound paradigm.

The statistical comparisons employed separately after application of each procedure to test differences between dev75, dev50, and dev30 in the peak amplitude, latency, and single trial SNR of the MMN require some discussion. But, firstly, let us emphasize that, for the MMN latency, there is no main effect of procedure and no procedure deviant interaction in the main statistical comparison. This indicates that the three procedures do not differ with respect to detecting differences in the MMN latency among different types of deviant stimuli. Thus, the results of the statistical comparisons employed sep-arately after application of each procedure should be interpreted cautiously taking into account the probability levels of the non-significant effects and considering which of the tests failed to reach significance due to a lack of power. A significant effect of deviant obtained for the ICA decomposition procedure and not for the other two procedures may not be a sufficient statistical basis to conclude that ICA decomposition procedure differs from the other two procedures in this respect. Despite of the ICA decomposition procedure, the MMN for dev30 is significantly larger in the peak amplitude and earlier in the la-tency than for dev50 (see Table 1 ). These results are in agreement with well-known characteristics of the MMN supported in substantial number of publications. As discussed in [18], the more deviant stimulus should elicit a more pronounced MMN, whose peak amplitude is larger and whose latency is shorter, than the less deviant stimulus. Moreover, the authors noted that the decrease of the MMN latency is a more sensitive correlate of the increase of the magnitude of deviation than the peak amplitude increase (see also [5]). In this particular paradigm, the decrement of 30 ms deviates more from the 100 ms duration of the standard stimuli than the decrement of 50 ms and, thus, should elicit a larger and earlier MMN re-sponse. However, at the same time, there is no statistically significant difference in the MMN latency between dev75 and dev50 whereas a difference in the MMN peak amplitude is present. One possible explanation of these results can be that the decrease of the stimulus duration from 100 to 75 ms is too small to elicit a reliable MMN latency effect rather than inabil-ity of the ICA decomposition procedure to extract a genuine MMN. The DW and ODF procedures show statistically significant differences in the MMN peak amplitude for the pairs dev75 vs. dev50 (non-significant for the DW procedure) and dev50 vs. dev30, but not for the MMN latency. Despite the lack of a significant effect between deviants in the MMN latency, probably due to a lack of power, it should be noted that the values of the MMN latency for the DW procedure are also in agreement with the expected characteristics of the MMN: the MMN for dev30 is earlier in the latency than for dev50, and the MMN for dev50 is earlier in the latency than for dev75 (see Table 1 ). But this is not the case for the ODF procedure where reversed interrelations are observed. The lack of effect on latency, while effect on amplitude is obtained, may mean that the DW pro-cedure is not sufficiently powerful to reveal a clean MMN with the current sample size. Refer to [11] for a discussion why the
ICA decomposition procedure with its different mathematical background performs better than the DW and ODF procedures in extraction of the MMN in a duration decrement sound paradigm. It would be interesting to compare the ICA decomposi-tion procedure with a combination of the DW procedure with average standard sweep plus subsequent 2 X 10 Hz digital fil-tering procedure (see above) as this combination may extract a cleaner MMN than each of these two involved procedures separately. This will be done somewhere else.

Despite the successful extraction of the MMN, no clear ICs representing the N1, P1, or P3a responses are identified, as mentioned earlier, whereas there is evidence of the successful separation of these ERP components by the ICA (i.e., in [14,15] ). One possible explanation of this observation can be the following. When the input data consist of a mixture of fewer large source components than the available mixtures (number of electrode locations) plus many more small source compo-nents, as may be the case in our ERP data, large source components are accurately separated into separate output ICs whereas the remaining output ICs consist of mixtures of smaller source components (for a review, see simulations in [13]). The largest ERP component in this particular paradigm is the MMN as this paradigm elicits a reduced N1 response (due to the short SOA). Indeed, the N1 and P1 responses are lower in the amplitude than the MMN (see Fig. 2 , left graph).
Due to this fact, it is reasonable to assume that the MMN would be separated at least into one large output IC whereas other smaller ERP activities would be redistributed among the remaining output ICs. It seems to be the case in this study with nine electrode locations, where only one IC in each participant explains the MMN. This MMN-like IC produces the most compact cluster. The decision to use only one MMN-like IC in the ERP data from a participant can be justified by the fact that if more than one MMN-like IC extracted from nine electrode locations are used, a reduced single trial SNR is obtained and worse separation of the MMN from irrelevant activities in all participants is observed. The authors in [14,15] use a larger number of electrode locations (29 electrode locations in both studies) compared to our study. The use of a sufficient number of avail-able electrode locations is crucial requirement in any ICA based study and, thus, their small number is the main limitation of this study. Despite the absence of ICs representing the N1, P1, or P3a responses, the results obtained after application of the
ICA decomposition procedure with nine electrode locations seem to be reasonable in the context of the MMN extraction. It would be interesting to replicate and refine the same results using a greater number of electrode locations. This may change the number of the MMN-like and/or non-MMN-like ICs and increase the values of the stability index for the MMN-like ICs.
However, the use of a greater number of electrode locations would allow us to obtain a greater number of ICs although it also requires a longer ERP sweep to prevent overfitting of an estimation algorithm [24]. In turn, a longer ERP sweep may contain a greater number of active brain sources, yielding poorer estimation accuracy of ICs. Thus, the researcher should choose what is most important for the given task, reliability or accuracy.

As a further work, independently from the use of a greater number of electrode locations, it would also be interesting to determine the most suitable ICA algorithm for the paradigm with a short SOA. The responses to the standard stimuli have a quite regular time structure. Thus, an ICA algorithm which uses the temporal structure of the data (e.g., TDSEP) or both the spatial and temporal structure of the data (e.g., JADETD) can be used. The latter simultaneously uses the second-order time structure and the high-order cumulant information to reveal sources. It may be helpful if the data contain both the spatial and temporal information as may be the case in our study.
 A word of caution should be mentioned when applying the ODF or ICA to ERP studies as these procedures (especially the ICA) are computationally sophisticated. The ICA performs demanding computations to generate a requested number of ICs.
The researcher should deeply understand what to expect from the particular experimental manipulations in order to inter-pret the resulting set of ICs. A well grounded theoretical framework is often necessary to explain a particular IC as an im-proved representation of an already known ERP component (e.g., the N1, P1, P3a, or MMN). So far, the standard frame of reference for the MMN is the DW procedure, which will continue to be used in MMN studies due to its simplicity. On the other hand, the ICA decomposition procedure can certainly supplement it, especially when experimental effects, which are expected from the literature, are not distinguishable by application of the DW procedure alone [11]. The results obtained in this study support the use of the ICA as a supplementary tool to validate the results obtained with the DW procedure as their performances in the current experimental paradigm are comparable. 5. Conclusions
This study demonstrates that the ICA decomposition procedure performs similarly to the DW procedure with average standard sweep and better than the ODF procedure in the quantitative analyses of the MMN in the context of the experimen-tal paradigm, employing a prototypical MMN protocol with silent intervals between stimuli and duration decrement devi-ants. Both the ICA decomposition and DW procedures allow extraction of a cleaner MMN, whose characteristics are in agreement with most of the literature. Moreover, the MMN elicited by the most deviant stimulus is significantly larger in the peak amplitude and earlier in the latency compared to the second most deviant stimulus only after application of the
ICA decomposition procedure. In contrast, the DW procedure shows no statistically significant differences in the MMN la-tency between these two deviants, whereas the effect on the MMN peak amplitude is present. Despite this, we would rec-ommend to use the DW procedure with average standard sweep when an experimental paradigm involves more than one type of deviant stimuli as it increases the single trial SNR of the resulting traces. The ODF procedure with the frequency range of 2 X 8.5 Hz is not recommended for this paradigm as this procedure brings about the residuals of exogenous processing, which overlap the MNN.
