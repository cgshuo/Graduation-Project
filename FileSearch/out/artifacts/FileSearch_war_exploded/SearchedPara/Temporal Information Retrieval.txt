 The study of temporal dynamics and its impact can be framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches , which explain how user behavior, document content and scale vary with time, and how we can use them in our favor in order to improve retrieval effectiveness.

This half-day tutorial will outline research issues with re-spect to temporal dynamics, and provide a comprehensive overview of temporal IR approaches, essentially regarding processing dynamic content, temporal information extrac-tion, temporal query analysis, and time-aware retrieval and ranking. The tutorial is structured into two sessions. Dur-ing the first session, we will explain the general and wide aspects associated to temporal dynamics by focusing on the web domain, from content and structural changes to varia-tions of user behavior and interactions. We will begin with temporal indexing and query processing. Next step, we will explain current approaches to time-aware retrieval and rank-ing, which can be classified into different types based on two main notions of relevance with respect to time, namely, recency-based ranking, and time-dependent ranking.

In the latter session, we will describe research issues cen-tered on determining the temporal intent of queries, and time-aware query enhancement, e.g., temporal relevance feed-back, and time-aware query reformulation. In addition, we present applications in related research areas, e.g., explo-ration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as well as future event retrieval and prediction. To this end, we conclude our tutorial and outline future directions.
This tutorial targets graduate students, researchers and practitioners in the field of information retrieval. The goal is to provide an overview as well as an important context that enables further research on and practical applications within this area.
The time dimension has strong influence in many domains, e.g., Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [1], and Emerg-ing Trend Detection (ETD) [12]. In our context, we focus on the impact of time on search processes seen by the evolu-tion of the Web [30] that can be categorized with respect to its changes of 1) content and structure, and 2) user query-ing behavior. The content of the Web changes constantly over time, e.g., documents are added, modified or deleted continuously. Similarly, the link structure of the Web also evolves [16]. Content and structure changes affect basic pro-cesses like crawling and indexing, but also the computation of graph-based authority measures that typically are used for document ranking.

Another web evolution aspect is the change of user query-ing behavior, which can be observable at least in two ways. First, search traffic for particular queries varies over time and presents certain temporal patterns, such as, spikes, peri-odicity (e.g., weekly or monthly), seasonality and trends [32]. Second, many queries are time-sensitive, which contain un-derlying temporal information needs that do not exhibit a temporal pattern in search streams [38]. Understanding temporal search intent is a challenging task before applying an appropriate time-aware ranking method.

Temporal IR has received a large share of attention in the last decade. For example, there are at least two main research challenges related to temporal IR that have been or-ganized recently: the TREC Temporal Summarization Track and Temporalia (Temporal Information Access) [24]. In this tutorial, we will give a comprehensive overview of the important aspects of temporal information retrieval, which intends to support participants with basic knowledge who want to get acquainted with the research area, and for more advanced researchers aiming to understand in more detail this field of research. This tutorial complements previous work, such as, an overview of challenges and opportunities in temporal IR [3], a tutorial [41], and a recent survey [14] as follows:  X  We categorize temporal IR research challenges into three main topics, i.e., temporal indexing and query processing, temporal query analysis, and time-aware ranking;  X  We provide a review of most recent state-of-the-art and best practices in the topics related to the research challenges;  X  We present a number of interesting application areas in order to open new horizons for research and inno-vations;  X  We provide detailed description of the approaches in order to make it suitable as a teaching material.
This section outlines the topics that our tutorial will cover.
Evolving web content has an impact on several compo-nents of a search engine. In this section, we revisit three main building blocks of the search system, namely crawling , indexing , and query processing .

We will explain how to index versioned archives, which re-quires even more complex indexing and maintenance proce-dures. Several works have been proposed in the area of ver-sioned indexing and query processing [7, 10, 13, 21, 37, 53]. Two general approaches to text indexing, which have been employed, are either based on index compression (by ex-ploiting the redundancy between consecutive versions) [20, 21, 22], or based on index partitioning for faster temporal selections [5, 6, 7, 10]. We will present recent works on indexing, query processing and index maintenance efforts towards supporting temporally qualified queries, i.e., [5, 6, 7, 10], in more detail.
Understanding search intent behind a user X  X  query is the first step before applying a suitable retrieval and ranking model. In the temporal search realm, a system should be able to identify a query that contains an underlying tempo-ral information need, so-called a temporal query [24]. We categorize temporal queries into two main classes. The first class of temporal queries can be observed through tempo-ral patterns of user search behavior in query logs, whereas the second class of temporal queries may not exhibit such temporal patterns in a query stream, but can be referred to specific time or a particular event.

In this tutorial, we will explain current approaches to un-derstanding temporal query intent [32], as well as methods for detecting and predicting time-sensitive queries, such as, spiky, periodic or seasonal queries [43, 45]. In addition, we will explain how to determine the underlying temporal in-formation needs for a given temporal query by analyzing temporal document collections [25, 29, 54].

We will address the problem of multi-faceted temporal queries and its impact on result diversification [36, 46, 51, 56]. Finally, we will describe query enhancement techniques applied to temporal queries, which include time-based pseudo-relevance feedback [31, 40], and time-aware query reformu-lation [18, 26, 49].
Existing works on time-aware ranking can be classified into different types based on two main notions of relevance with respect to time: 1) recency-based ranking [16, 17, 19, 33], and 2) time-dependent ranking [11, 29]. Recency-based ranking methods promote documents that are recently cre-ated or updated. The preference of freshness is quite com-mon in a general web search, where a user looks for recent information, e.g., about breaking news. On the other hand, time-dependent ranking methods takes into account the rel-evant time periods underlying a given temporal query, which this type of ranking explicitly adjusts the score of a docu-ment with respect to the time of queries, for example, by assuming that documents with creation dates close to the query X  X  time are more relevant and thus must be ranked higher.

In addition to the aforementioned classification of time-aware methods, we also outline existing works that explic-itly model entities and events into retrieval and ranking pro-cesses [9, 27, 44]. Note that, entity and event-based retrieval returns events instead of documents, whereas time-aware ranking methods use a very simple notion of events.
Some applications have taken time-based exploration of textual archives beyond just searching over time, e.g., Time Explorer [34], and time-aware exploration search [39]. Fil-tering and displaying information might benefit from pre-senting time information conveniently in some domains, for instance, generating a timeline summary for a specific news story [35, 52, 55] and for a given entity [50]. Arguably, the most widespread summarization technology is the (query) focused summaries produced by search engines, or search results snippets using temporal expressions, which include the most frequent units of time appearing in search result pages [2, 15, 48]. There exists another form of temporal summary in terms of landmark documents, authors, and topics [47].

A series of temporal applications are the ones based on prediction of events , e.g., [8, 23, 27]. The most challenging task is the actual forecast of forthcoming events. A method to turn a standard IR engine into a future event predicting machine is proposed in [4], whereas an approach to forecast-ing real-life events by extracting information from a corpus comprised of 22 years of news stories is presented in [42].
A tentative schedule, which is aimed to meet a high-quality presentation within the chosen time period, is as follows.  X  9:00 -10:30 Part I ( 1.5 hour )  X  10:30 -11:00 Coffee break  X  11:00 -12:30 Part II ( 1.5 hour )
This tutorial targets graduate students, junior researchers and practitioners in the field of information retrieval. Our prospective participants should have a basic knowledge of search processes, essentially regarding web crawling, docu-ment indexing, query analysis, and retrieval and ranking. A prerequisite skill about other research areas, e.g., natural language processing, is required but not mandatory. The participants can download slides and a survey on temporal information retrieval [28] from the authors X  homepages.
