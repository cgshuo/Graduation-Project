 Association rule mining aims to discover relationships among data in huge database. These relationships may provide some clues for business users to per-form actions. In recent years, researchers [6,9] have focused on discovering more actionable knowledge. However, conventional association rules can only provide limited knowledge for potential actions. For example, in the Customer Relation-ship Management (CRM) field, associat ion rule mining can be used to prevent churning. One possible rule is  X  Demo : D  X  Churning  X . With this rule, busi-ness users may take some actions on the customers with  X  Demo : D  X  X oprevent churning. However, from the mined rule, business users cannot get knowledge on what action should be taken to retain these customers, though there might be many candidate actions.

We have previously defined combined association rule [11] to mine actionable knowledge. However, in [11], all of the attributes are treated equally when finding the frequent itemsets. The algorithm is time-consuming when a large number of attributes are in database. In this paper, we differentiate the attributes and find the frequent itemsets on groups of itemsets. Furthermore, since data imbalance is often encountered in data mining tasks, we will also tackle data imbalance problem in combined association rule mining.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the definition of combined association rule and its cha racteristics. Section 3 prop oses the interestingness measures and algorithm outline. Sect ion 4 introduces a case study. Section 5 presents some related work. Section 6 is the summary of this paper. Let T be a dataset. In this dataset, eac h tuple is described by a schema S = ( S
D 1 ,...,S Dm ,S A 1 ,...,S An ,S C ), in which S D =( S D 1 ,S D 2 ,...,S Dm )are m non-actionable attributes, S A =( S A 1 ,S A 2 ,...,S An )are n actionable attributes, and S C is a class attribute. Note that the data for combined association rule is not limited to one dataset. In fact, different kinds of attributes are often from multiple datasets [11].

Combined association rule mining is to discover the association among the  X  X ttribute-value X  pairs. For the convenie nce of description, we call an  X  X ttribute-value X  pair an  X  item  X . Suppose itemset D  X  I D , I D is the itemset of any items with attributes ( S D 1 ,S D 2 ,...,S Dm ), itemset A  X  I A , I A is the itemset of any items with attributes ( S A 1 ,S A 2 ,...,S An ), C is 1-itemset of class attribute, a combined association rule set is represented as Here,  X + X  means itemsets appearing simutaniouly. Since one action may result in different classes while one class may correspond to different actions, C k 1 ...C ki rather than C 1 ...C i areusedinEq.1. In order to make the combined associatio n rules in a rule set containing the same non-actionable itemset, it is important to firstly discover frequent non-actionable itemsets. Once these itemsets are discove red, the relationships of frequent non-actionable itemsets with target classes and actionable attributes are mined. In the rule generation step, the conditional support [10] is employed to tackle data imbalance problem. 3.1 Interestingness Measures For a single combined association rule D + A i  X  C ki , the conventional interest-ingness measures are its confidence and lift. However, these two interestingness measures are not sufficient to mine actionable knowledge from combined associa-tion rule. We illustrate this problem using an example. For a discovered frequent pattern D + A i  X  C ki , suppose Conf ( D + A i  X  C ki ) is 60% and the expected confidence of C ki is 30%. So the lift of this frequent pattern is 2, which is high enough in most association rule mining algorithms. However the confidence of D  X  C ki is 70%, which means objects with non-actionable attribute D have 70% probability to be class C ki . On the other hand, if action A i happens, objects with non-actionable attribute D only have 60% probability to be class C ki . Obviously action A i is negatively correlated to class C ki with respect to non-actionable itemset D .

Hence, a new lift named conditional lift is defined as follows to measure the interestingness of a comb ined association rule.
 where ConLift stands for the conditional lift of combined association rule D + A i  X  C ki . Count (  X  ) is the count of the tuples containing itemset  X   X   X . Note that D , A i ,and C ki are all itemsets so that D  X  A i  X  C ki means D , A i ,and C ki occur simultaneously.

Briefly, Eq. 2 is the lift of D + A i  X  C ki with D as a pre-condition, which shows how much is the contribution of A i in the rule. 3.2 Algorithm Outline The combined association rule mining procedure in this paper consists of two steps. The first step is to find single rule composed of frequent itemsets. The second step is to extract inter esting combined associatio n rule sets. Since itemsets are treated as different groups, the time comlexity of the algorithm is much lower than searching in the whole space of itemsets. In order to calculate the interestingness measures, the support c ount of each frequent itemset is recorded in the frequent itemset generation step. The outline of combined association rule mining is shown as follows: 1. Discovering frequent n on-actionable itemsets I D and the corresponding sup-2. For each frequent non-actionable itemsets I D 3. Finding frequent itemsets including target class I DC ; 4. Recording the support count C DC for each I DC ; 5. Calculating conditional support ConSup ( DC ); 6. If ( ConSup ( DC ) &gt;MinSup ), for each I DC 7. Finding candidate pattern of three kinds of itemsets I DCA ; 8. Recording the support count C DCA for each I DCA ; 9. Calculating conditional support: ConSup ( DA ); 10. Calculating Conf , Lif t and ConLift ; 11. If ( Conf  X  min c &amp; Lif t  X  min l &amp; ConLift  X  min cl ) 12. Adding the mined frequent itemsets to the rule set. Our proposed technique has been tested with real-world data in Centrelink, which is an Australian Gov ernment Service Deliver Agency delivering a range of Commonwealth services to the Australian public. 4.1 Business Background and Problem Statement When customers receive Commonwealth p ayments to which they were not en-titled, these payments become customer debt that must be recovered. The pur-pose of data mining in debt recovery is trying to make the customers to repay their debts in a shortened timeframe acco rding to historical debt recovery data and customer demographics. From a technical point of view, the objective is to mine the combined association rule with respect to the demographic attributes and debt information of customers, the arrangement, and the target class. Sup-pose some customers with similar demographic attributes and debt information belong to different target classes under different arrangements, Centrelink will recommend an arrangement to assist them to pay off a debt in the shortest pos-sible time. Note that an arrangement i s an agreement between a customer and Centrelink officer on the method, am ount and frequency of repayment. 4.2 Data Involved The dataset used for the combined associ ation rule mining is composed of cus-tomer demographic data, debt data and repayment data. The customer demo-graphic data includes customer ID, gender, age, marital status, salary, and so on. The debt data includes the debt related information. The repayment data includes the debt recovery arrangement, debt repayment amount and debt re-payment date. The class ID of each custom er is defined by business experts based on the information in debt data and arrangement data. 4.3 Experimental Results In our experiment, the frequent pattern s of the demographic itemsets were first mined using standard Apriori algorithm [1] on demographic data. The Conf , Lif t and ConLift can be calculated on each frequent itemset. In the experi-ments, we set minconf =0 . 45, minlif t =1 . 2, and minconlif t =1 . 2. Using these parameters and the calculated inter estingness measures, the interesting combined association rule sets are sel ected. In this case study, 28 rule sets are discovered, which include 111 single rules algother. Selected results are shown in Table 1. For privacy reason, the benefit t ype, arrangement pattern and class ID are recoded in the experiments.

With the mined combined association r ules, much actionable knowledge can be obtained. For example, suppose the prio rity of target class in this experiment is C 2 &gt;C 1 &gt;C 3 , if a customer is with demographic attributes MARITAL : SIN &amp; Age :26 y  X  50 y &amp; Earnings : [$200, $400), the arrangement A 2 will be recommended to him/her with the greatest priority. If A 2 is impossible, A 1 will be recommended. The arrangement A 10 is recommended with the least priority. The work in this paper is obviously different from any previous association rule mining algorithms. Hilderman et al. [4] extended simple association rule to mine characterized itemsets. Employing the concept of  X  X hare measures X , their algo-rithm may present more information in terms of financial analysis. Different from Hilderman et al. X  X  algorithm, each single rule in this paper is associated with a target class to provide ordered action list.

Ras et al. [7,8] proposed to mine action rules. They divided the attributes in a database into two groups: stable ones and flexible ones. The action rules are extracted from a decision table given pref erence to flexible attr ibutes. However, in their algorithm, only flexible attributes appear in the mined rules.
In combined association rule mining, ea ch single combined association rule is similar to class association rule (CAR), which was proposed by Liu et al. [5] in 1998. However, in [5], the class association rules are mined to build associative classifier while the combined association rule sets are mined for direct actions rather than prediction.

Data imbalance problem has attracted much research attention in recent years. Arunasalam and Chawla [2] studied the data imbalance in association rule mining. Their algorithm is focused on the imbalanced distribution of one attribute, the target class. In our algorithm, the data imbalance problem occurs not only on target class but also actionable attributes. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to mine combined association rules on imbalanced datasets. Unlike conventional association rules, our combined association rules are organized as a num ber of rule sets. In each rule set, single combined association rules consist of different kinds of attributes. A novel fre-quent pattern generation algorithm is proposed to discover the complex inter-rule and intra-rule relationships. Data imbalance problem is also tackled in this paper. The proposed algorithm is tested in a real world application. The experimental results show the effectiveness of algorithm.
