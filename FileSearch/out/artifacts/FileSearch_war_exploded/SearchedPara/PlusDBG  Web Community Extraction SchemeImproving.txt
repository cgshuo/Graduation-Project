 A Web community is defined as a set of related Web pages concerning a same topic. Web community extraction is usually used for the clustering of Web pages into semantic sets. Conventionally, e.g. in Web directory services, Web pages are clustered into various well-known topics by hand. However, it is impossible to cluster all the Web pages properly by hand because they are updated frequently and their number is huge. Thus, the Web pages should be clustered automatically into a set of Web communities.
 which is represented by HITS [1] proposed by Kleinberg, is to extract the author-itative pages related to a specified seed topic. Purpose 2, which is represented by Trawling [2] proposed by Kumar et al. , is to extract the Web communities related to unknown seed topics. However, these conventional schemes are not satisfactory with regard to both precision and pseudo-recall. This results in the inclusion of unrelated pages or the exclusion of related pages from the extracted Web community. Here, precision and pseudo-recall is defined as followings. Definition 1. Precision is the percentage of relevant Web pages extracted as members of Web communities.
 Definition 2. Pseudo-recall is the sum of the number of relevant Web pages extracted as members of the Web communities.
 pseudo-recall should be high if at all possible. That is, the community with overly low precision or overly low pseudo-recall is not desired.
 DBG that improves upon both precision and pseudo-recall. We extend the DBG (Dense Bipartite Graph) extraction scheme [3] proposed by Reddy et al. In par-ticular, we adopt a new parameter called  X  X istance X  defined by the relevance between a Web page and a Web community. The WWW is denoted as a large directed graph [5]: whole nodes are Web pages and whole edges are links. Web community extraction schemes [1, 2, 3, 4] extract Web communities by finding characteristic structures from such a Web graph. (DBGs) from a large Web graph to extract Web communities without specifying any topics [3]. A DBG is defined as a bipartite graph consisting of both F ans and Centers . In DBGs, each Web page of F ans links to at least u Center pages, and each page of Centers is linked from at least vFan pages. The DBG extraction algorithm consists of two steps. The first step iteratively extracts the candidate Web pages forming a Web community. The second step extracts Web pages constructing a DBG from the extracted candidate Web pages. In this algorithm, every Web page is given as a seed page.
 pseudo-recall. Especially, conventional schemes are infirm at the effect of multiple topic pages. Therefore, the extracted Web community may include unrelated pages and exclude related pages. The purpose of this study is to develop a method extracting as many Web communities as possible from a large Web graph without specifying any topics, satisfying both precision and pseudo-recall. Precision and pseudo-recall is defined in Definition 1 and Definition 2. To achieve this purpose, we extend the DBG extraction algorithm [3]. When a Web page includes multiple topics, the DBG extraction scheme tends to extract Web pages including unrelated topics as candidate Web pages forming the Web community. To solve the above problem and to improve precision, we adopt the  X  X istance X  defined by the relevance between a Web page and a Web community. Moreover, to improve pseudo-recall, we adapt a termination condition in the first step of DBG described in Section 2. In the conventional DBG extraction algorithm, loop count, which is fixed for all communities, is given as the termination condition. In our proposed scheme, threshold value of the  X  X istance X  is given as the termination condition and loop count of each community is determined by itself. 3.1 Definition of the  X  X imilarity X  and the  X  X istance X  The similarity ratio Sim ( p, F ) between the Web page p and the Web page set F is defined by Equation 1, where children ( p ) is a set of pages linked from the Web page p and children ( F ) is a union of Web pages linked from each page in the Web page set F . Then, Sim ( p, F ) represents the interest ratio of the Web page p to the Web page set F .
 By adopting Sim ( p, F ) as part of the  X  X istance, X  we are able to avoid the in-clusion of multiple topic pages, because multiple topic pages tend to have lower ratio of outward links to one topic.
 distance from the topic of the Web page p n , which is a page added in the n -th iteration, to the topic of Web page set F n  X  1 , which is a page set added in the n -1-th or less iterations. The  X  X istance X  is designed so that the Web page added later has a larger distance than the Web pages added previously. This is because, we think that the relevance between a Web page and a seed page becomes highest, when the Web page is directly related to the seed page. That is, the Web pages added in the n-th iteration are directly related to the Web pages added in the n -1-th iteration but indirectly related to the Web pages added in the iteration less than n -1-th.
 children ( x ) | X | children ( p n )  X  children ( y ) |} . 3.2 PlusDBG Algorithm In PlusDBG, every Web page is given as a seed page in the same way as in the DBG extraction algorithm [3]. PlusDBG consists of two steps, similarly to the DBG extraction algorithm. The first step extracts the candidate Web pages forming a Web community. The second step extracts Web pages constructing a DBG from the extracted candidate Web pages. PlusDBG extends the first step of the DBG extraction algorithm to satisfy both precision and pseudo-recall by using the  X  X istance. X  candidate Web pages forming a Web community related to the seed page s from a Web Graph G ( N, E ), where N is the node set and E is the edge set of the Web graph, iteratively by using the  X  X istance. X  1. Assign dis border as a threshold value of  X  X istance, X  and set F = F + = { s } . 2. Iterate (a) and (b) while | F + | &gt; 0. 3. Output F .
 a set of Web pages forming a DBG as a Web community in the same way as the DBG extraction algorithm from a Web Graph G ( N, E ). 1. Assign the out-degree threshold of F ans u and the in-degree threshold of 2. Iterate (a) to (c) until both | F ans | and | Centers | are converged. 3. Output F ans and Centers as a DBG. We use the NTCIR-4 [6] WEB task X  X  test collection for our evaluations.The test collection consists of 11,038,720 Web pages. In the evaluation, only the links between different Web servers are extracted as the data set for evaluation. the threshold value of  X  X istance X  is set to 1. With regard to the conventional DBG extraction algorithm, the maximum iteration number in the first step is set to 1 (hereafter referred to as DBG1) or 2 (hereafter referred to as DBG2). In PDBG, DBG1 and DBG2, both the out-degree threshold of F ans and in-degree threshold of Centers are also set to 3. Finally, all the Web pages are adopted as the seed pages in the evaluation. Then, each Center is extracted as a Web community. Thus, a Web page may become a member of multiple communities. 4.1 Precision In this section, the precision of the PDBG, DBG1 and DBG2 are compared. The precision is calculated by random sampling of 25 communities extracted with each algorithm. In each community, 50 Web pages are selected at random to confirm their precision. In the evaluation, Web pages that fulfilled either of the following criteria are counted as pages matching the topic of the community. Criteria 1 is that the page is an entrance page of the Web site covering the topic. Criteria 2 is that the page is a page containing topic-related contents. Here, a Web site is defined as a set of pages written by the same author. In the evaluation, the usefulness of a page is not taken into consideration. munities selected at random. As shown in Table 1, PDBG achieves almost the same precision as DBG1. In contrast, DBG2 shows the worst precision among the three algorithms. The precision ratio of PDBG in comparison with DBG1 is about 0.8 to 1.3 in most communities. In contrast, the precision ratio of DBG2 in comparison with DBG1 is under 0.1 in most communities. Hence, PDBG and DBG1 are able to extract communities with comparable precision. However, DBG2 is not able to extract communities with sufficient precision. 4.2 Pseudo-Recall In this section, the pseudo-recall of PDBG, DBG1 and DBG2 are compared. Pseudo-recall is defined in Definition 2. In Definition 2, pseudo-recall is deter-mined by the number of relevant Web pages in each Web communities and the number of extracted Web communities. However, for all extracted pages, we cannot evaluate whether a page is relevant to a topic. Thus, pseudo-recall is calculated by  X  total number of pages  X   X   X  average precision  X  instead. Figure 1 shows the pseudo-recall and the distribution of the extracted communities from the data set. Here, a Web page may become a member of multiple communi-ties. Thus, the total number of pages forming communities may exceed the total number of Web pages in the data set.
 that of DBG1, however, it is smaller than that of DBG2. The reason is discussed below.
 DBG1. Moreover, PDBG extracts about 200,000 communities not extracted in DBG1. For DBG2, the total number of extracted communities is just 223,791, which is about half of the number of extracted communities by PDBG. However, the total number of Web pages forming communities is 6,981,184,986, which is larger than that of PDBG.
 DBG2. That is, DBG2 tend to form many large communities such as consisting of more than 10,000 pages including unrelated Web pages. In this paper, we proposed a new Web community extraction scheme, PlusDBG, with improved precision and pseudo-recall. PlusDBG extracts DBGs from the Web page set using the threshold value called  X  X istance. X  Our experiment results have confirmed that the proposed scheme extracts about 3.2-fold larger numbers of members of Web communities as compared with conventional schemes, while maintaining equivalent precision.
