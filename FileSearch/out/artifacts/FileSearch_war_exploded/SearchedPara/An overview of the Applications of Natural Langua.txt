 1. Introduction
In 1995, the International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB) started a series of
Language in the Database and Information System area. Day by day, the influence of Human Language Technologies (HLT) on the creation and management of information systems is shown to be more and more obvious. Text mining techniques converge on data mining systems, as well as opinion mining approaches have become an essential part of business intelligence processes.
Nowadays, HLT research focuses on information system applications covering a wide range of areas where the NLDB community beyond intelligent systems able to automatically retrieve documents where relevant information arises. This relevant information can range from press clipping, where a breakthrough product has been presented by a competent company to social networks, where a community of users, or potential customers, are pouring their opinions about a brand or commercial product. All this information must be filtered, classified, clustered and extracted through Natural Language Processing (NLP) artifacts to finally serve as input to potential business databases. But the task of extracting useful information from unstructured data still poses important challenges. This is the reason why, traditional NLP research areas, such as semantic information retrieval, information extraction, text classification, text mining or question answering systems, achieve prominence with respect to emerging technologies such as opinion mining, subjectivity and sentiment analysis, that are oriented to discover all the knowledge, both objective and subjective, underlying in the Web 2.0. These technologies are destined for becoming the new interfaces to connect future users with modern information systems, where the knowledge will be automatically generated from user interventions in their social networks. In this research framework, the sixteenth NLDB conference was held in Alicante, Spain, bringing together specialized researchers in the field of NLP and information system engineering. In this edition, 74 papers where submitted, and each paper was reviewed by three members of the recommended Scientific Committee. As a result of the review process, 11
PhD students were selected to present their on-going work in the Doctoral Symposium session held at the conference. 2. Topics of interest for researchers in Natural Language and information systems
Despite the different applications and endpoints of each of them, the 74 research papers submitted to the NLDB conference fit with any of the following topics, which were considered as the priority interests of this community:  X 
Natural Language for Web Information-Intensive Services, that are focused on NLP approaches using semantic and Web technologies oriented to index, classify and extract Web information trying to shift the Internet towards a global platform for the retrieval, combination and utilization of interoperable resources [7].  X 
Natural Language in Conceptual Modeling focused on modeling techniques based on NLP to support the acquisition of application domain knowledge through documents and texts analysis [6].  X 
Natural Language Interfaces for DataBase Querying/Retrieval, trying to build ideal query interfaces to DBs more suitable for occasional users, where there would be no need for the user to spend time learning the system's communication language [1].  X  Natural-Language-Based Integration of Systems, most of them focused on Ontology-driven Integration and management, where
Semantics is considered to be the best framework to deal with the heterogeneity, massive scale and dynamic nature of resources on the Web [8].  X 
Broadly speaking, any other application, tool, technique or resource of Natural Language Processing when focused to information systems, is also considered as a priority target.
 are truly representative of the work being carried out at this time. 3. Special issue articles and their contributions
The manuscripts contained in this special issue correspond to the extended versions of the four best papers selected after the conference according to the NLDB Program Committee reviews. one in [2]) by Alexandra Balahur, Jes X s Hermida, Andr X s Montoyo and Rafael Mu X oz, from the University of Alicante, covers an important research insight on emotions. Emotions can be reflected by gestures, voice tone, and other forms commonly used by humans to indicate our position or the way in which a concrete event has affected us. However, when communication between two humans is through a text, such as a note or e-mail, there may be a hardly conducive place for the expression of emotions. It is quite possible that the emotions of the person issuing the message are different at the time when she/he writes it than at the time when the receiver reads it. Nevertheless, the main goal of the work performed by Balahur et al., is focused on discovering the emotions on the sender of the message when it was issued. Searching emotions in texts is one of the priority challenges there exists techniques or procedures in which the issuer can show emotions, such as exclamation marks or emoticons that can already be used in all messaging systems, in practice they are not always used. The appearance in a text of certain words closely associated with emotional states greatly facilitates in determining the emotion, model used by many systems. Emotinet, the proposal of these researchers from the University of Alicante, instead of using traditional models of lexical analysis is based on an analysis of situations and the psychological model of the appraisal theory.
The development of this resource has allowed the authors to make a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal as well as a thorough comparison with other traditional systems. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper resides in showing a novel approach to emotion detection, as well as the interesting conclusions drawn from the comparison with other methods. The good organization and clarity of the paper allow the easy understanding of the proposal, even for beginners in this interesting subject, especially nowadays in which written conversations between people who are far away are significantly increasing.
This is, definitely, an important contribution to the field of Natural Language for Web Information-Intensive Services. 2. The paper Querying Linked Data Using Semantic Relatedness: A Vocabulary Independent Approach , (extended version of the one in [3]) by Freitas et al., introduces a new method for querying Linked Data on the Web based on the Semantic Relatedness Spreading Activation algorithm using queries in natural language. The method designed for the researches of the National
University of Ireland (Andre freitas, Joao Oliveira, Sean ORain and Edward Curry) and Universidade Federalde Rio de Janeiro (Joao Carlo Pereira da Silva), introduces a new technique for creating queries using natural language without knowing the underlying structure of the ontologies. To deal with it, authors focused their interests on providing their query mechanism with three basic requirements: usability, flexibility, and expressivity, in addition to the always sought ability to query distributed data. Usability is an intrinsic feature of the natural language queries, therefore, is implicit in the proposal. Moreover, this approach identifies key entities from natural language queries that are mapped to instances or classes in the Linked Data Web by means of a vocabulary-independent matching process, thus allowing the flexibility and expressivity which are aimed. Finally, by means of user interaction which filters unrelated results, the mechanism produces valuable outcomes. This mechanism has been implemented and tested on DBpedia proving its value and interest when it is applied to large distributed databases. The exposition of this novel approach, along with the study of related work, makes this paper an important contribution to further research in the field of Natural Language Interfaces for DataBase Querying/Retrieval. one in [4]) by Ashwin Ittoo and Gosse Bouma, from the University of Groningen, deals with the task of mining causal relations from domain specific corpora, in order to discover new knowledge from non-structured databases. Causality is a complex phenomenon through which there is a connection between an agent event (cause of something) and a resultant effect (the principle of cause  X  effect). The study of cause and effect has always been of great importance in all scientific disciplines.
Aristotle (300s BC) introduced the philosophical theory of causality as a way of understanding the human experience of physical nature. Disciplines such as physics, chemistry, medicine and economics, to give some examples, have always based knowledge automatically. In this case, the authors propose a minimally supervised algorithm which first acquires a set of reliable causal patterns from a reference with broad-coverage corpus (this time, Wikipedia). This is an original way to build a knowledge base, which compensates for the lack of domain-specific resources, and contrasts with other existing techniques because it applies a principled seed selection strategy. This original bet on the use of broad-spectrum corpus to solve problems in restricted domains, the minimized supervision effort, and finally the valuable outcomes obtained after the performance evaluation, outperforming the state-of-the-art technology, constitutes the main contribution of this piece of work on the advancements of Natural Language for Web Information-Intensive Services. 4. Finally, the paper COMPENDIUM: A Text Summarization System for Generating Abstracts of Research Papers , (extended version of the one in [5]) by Elena Lloret, M. Teresa Rom X -Ferri and Manuel Palomar, from the University of Alicante, belongs to the general topic previously cited about Natural Language Processing applications to information systems. Specifically, it is an application of a text summarization tool (called COMPENDIUM) with the task of generating abstracts from biomedical papers.
Text summarization applications are really quite extensive. While the most obvious is to provide the reader with an overview of a document, it is increasingly being used to feed automatic systems on indexing, search, retrieval, classification and information extraction, because summaries enables them to access the most relevant part of a document without processing it in its entirety. Precisely, because of this secondary effect is why text summarization systems are considered a highly relevant support to information systems. In this case, the authors propose a new method relying on producing an extract that is represented as a word graph, where the shortest paths between nodes are proposed as candidates for new sentences of the abstract. Moreover, the paper presents two different techniques to produce summaries: extractive and abstractive, the former being purely information extraction, the latter including an information compression and fusion stage as a novel approach. The most interesting issue about this research work is that it does not only focuses on evaluating whether COMPENDIUM produces good or not good summaries when applied to biomedical texts, but also analyzes what summarizing technique is more
To address this latter task, the authors propose a user satisfaction evaluation where users rated the summaries according to results and insights obtained, the novel approach applied to the abstractive technique, and this interesting proposal for evaluation, make this paper a major contribution to the state-of-the-art technology.
