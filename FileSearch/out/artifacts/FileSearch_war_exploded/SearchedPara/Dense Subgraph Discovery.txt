 Finding dense subgraphs is a fundamental graph-theoretic problem, that lies in the heart of numerous graph-mining applications, ranging from finding communities in social net-works [11, 16], to detecting regulatory motifs in DNA [8] and to identifying real-time stories in news [2]. The problem of finding dense subgraphs has been studied extensively in the-oretical computer science [1, 5, 6, 7, 10], and recently, due to the relevance of the problem in real-world applications, it has attracted considerable attention in the data-mining community [4, 16, 18, 20, 21].

In this tutorial we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of ( i ) major algorithmic techniques for finding dense sub-graphs in large graphs and ( ii ) graph mining applications that rely on dense subgraph extraction. We will present fun-damental concepts and algorithms that date back to 80 X  X , as well as the latest advances in the area, from theoretical and from practical point-of-view. We will motivate the problem of finding dense subgraphs by discussing how it can be used in real-world applications. We will discuss different density definitions and the complexity of the corresponding opti-mization problems. We will also present efficient algorithms for different density measures and under different computa-tional models. Specifically, we will focus on scalable stream-ing, distributed and MapReduce algorithms. Finally we will discuss problem variants, extensions, and will provide point-ers for future research directions.
 The tutorial will cover the following topics: Charalampos E. Tsourakakis is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Center of Research on Computation and Society (CRCS) at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. from the Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO) program at Carnegie Mellon University in 2013. He also holds a Master of Science from the Machine Learning De-partment at CMU. He did his undergraduate studies in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). He is the recipient of a best paper award in IEEE Data Mining and has designed two graph mining libraries for tera-scale graphs. The former is officially used by Windows Azure, and the lat-ter was a research highlight of Microsoft Research. He has served in the PC of premium conferences. He has published over 30 papers in the fields of data mining, discrete mathe-matics, theoretical computer science and computational bi-ology. He has delivered two tutorials in the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. His Google scholar h -index is 17. His research interests include algorithm design for large-scale datasets, data science and mathematical optimization. [1] R. Andersen and K. Chellapilla. Finding dense [2] A. Angel, N. Sarkas, N.
