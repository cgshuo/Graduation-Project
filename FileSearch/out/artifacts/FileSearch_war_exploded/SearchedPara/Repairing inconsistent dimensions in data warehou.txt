 2. Preliminaries 2.1. Dimensions We start by defining the notion of hierarchy schema.

De fi nition 1. Hierarchy schema A hierarchy schema H consists of a pair ( C H ;  X  H ), where ( C denoted by  X  H . The set of categories C H contains a distinguished top category denoted All category in C H and has no outgoing edges, that is, there is no category c
Sometimes, we will write ca  X  H c b instead of ( c a , c b introduced in several models [30,38,16,36,52,53] .
 Example 4. The hierarchy schema H =( C H ;  X  H ), depicted in Fig. 1 (a), is as follows: C H ={Article, Journal, Subject_Int, Subject_ACM, Area, All}; All
De fi nition 2. Dimension A dimension D is a tuple ( H D ; E D ; Cat D ; b D ), where H elements; Cat D : E D  X  C H D is a function that defines to which category each element in E represents the child/parent relations between elements of different categories. We denote by closure of b D . The following conditions hold: (i)all D is the only element in categoryAll b then Cat D a  X  X   X  H Condition (ii) ensures that the child/parent relation ( b Example 5. Let D =( H D ; E D ; Cat D ; b D ) be the dimension given in Fig. 1 . Then H E D ={all, A 1 ,A 2 , TODS, DKE, DB, DM, DT, H2, G2, IS, MC}; all

De fi nition 5. Strictness constraints, covering constraints Let H =( C H ;  X  H ) be a hierarchy schema and let D =( H (i) A strictness constraint over H is an expression of the form c (ii) A covering constraint over H is an expression of the form c hierarchy schema H . We say that a dimension D satisfies a set of constraints say that the dimension D is inconsistent with respect to  X  constraints: {Article  X  Journal, Article  X  Area, Journal  X  In contrast, the dimension given in Fig. 3 is inconsistent with respect to and Journal  X  Area. Indeed, the rollup relations R D (Article, Area) and R algorithm could compute b D , and then for each pair of categories c closure of digraphs, which run in O E D jj 2  X E D jj b D (e.g., [25,50] ), can be used to obtain 3.

Given two dimensions D =( H D ; E D ; Cat D ; b D ), and D as b D  X  5b D  X  X   X  b D 5b D  X   X  X  jj .  X  we define the notions of repair and minimal repair.

Repair, minimal repair Let D X H D ; E D ; Cat D ; b D  X  X  be a dimension and  X  be a set of integrity constraints over H (i) A repair of D with respect to  X  is a dimension D  X  =( H (ii) A minimal repair of D with respect to  X  is a repair D repairs, that is deletions or additions of new elements are not allowed. which are shown in the following table:
Since D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , and D 4 , are closer to D , those are the minimal repairs. minimizing the set of insertions or deletions of tuples. For example, repairs D case, as the following example shows.
