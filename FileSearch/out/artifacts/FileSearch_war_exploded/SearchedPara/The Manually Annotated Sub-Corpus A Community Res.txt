 The need for corpora annotated for multiple phe-nomena across a variety of linguistic layers is keenly recognized in the computational linguistics community. Several multiply-annotated corpora exist, especially for Western European languages and for spoken data, but, interestingly, broad-based English language corpora with robust anno-tation for diverse linguistic phenomena are rela-tively rare. The most widely-used corpus of En-glish, the British National Corpus, contains only part-of-speech annotation; and although it con-tains a wider range of annotation types, the fif-teen million word Open American National Cor-pus annotations are largely unvalidated. The most well-known multiply-annotated and validated cor-pus of English is the one million word Wall Street Journal corpus known as the Penn Treebank (Mar-cus et al., 1993), which over the years has been fully or partially annotated for several phenomena over and above the original part-of-speech tagging and phrase structure annotation. The usability of these annotations is limited, however, by the fact that many of them were produced by independent projects using their own tools and formats, mak-ing it difficult to combine them in order to study their inter-relations. More recently, the OntoNotes project (Pradhan et al., 2007) released a one mil-lion word English corpus of newswire, broadcast news, and broadcast conversation that is annotated for Penn Treebank syntax, PropBank predicate ar-gument structures, coreference, and named enti-ties. OntoNotes comes closest to providing a cor-pus with multiple layers of annotation that can be analyzed as a unit via its representation of the an-notations in a  X  X ormal form X . However, like the Wall Street Journal corpus, OntoNotes is limited in the range of genres it includes. It is also limited to only those annotations that may be produced by members of the OntoNotes project. In addition, use of the data and annotations with software other than the OntoNotes database API is not necessar-ily straightforward.

The sparseness of reliable multiply-annotated corpora can be attributed to several factors. The greatest obstacle is the high cost of manual pro-duction and validation of linguistic annotations. Furthermore, the production and annotation of corpora, even when they involve significant scien-tific research, often do not, per se , lead to publish-able research results. It is therefore understand-able that many research groups are unwilling to get involved in such a massive undertaking for rel-atively little reward.

The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) (Ide et al., 2008) project has been established to address many of these obstacles to the creation of large-scale, robust, multiply-annotated corpora. The project is providing appropriate data and annotations to serve as the base for a community-wide annotation effort, together with an infrastructure that enables the representation of internally-produced and con-tributed annotations in a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats, thus enabling its immediate use with many common annotation platforms as well as off-the-shelf concordance and analysis software. The MASC project X  X  aim is to offset some of the high costs of producing high quality linguistic annotations via a distribution of effort, and to solve some of the usability problems for annotations produced at different sites by harmonizing their representation formats.

The MASC project provides a resource that is significantly different from OntoNotes and simi-lar corpora. It provides data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and all of the data in the cor-pus are drawn from current American English so as to be most useful for NLP applications. Per-haps most importantly, the MASC project is com-mitted to a fully open model of distribution, with-out restriction, for all data and annotations. It is also committed to incorporating diverse annota-tions contributed by the community, regardless of format, into the corpus. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, community-based effort to create a much-needed language resource for NLP. This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus and annotations, and serves as a call for contribu-tions of data and annotations from the language processing community. MASC is a balanced subset of 500K words of written texts and transcribed speech drawn pri-marily from the Open American National Corpus (OANC) 1 . The OANC is a 15 million word (and growing) corpus of American English produced since 1990, all of which is in the public domain or otherwise free of usage and redistribution re-strictions.
 Where licensing permits, data for inclusion in MASC is drawn from sources that have already been heavily annotated by others. So far, the first 80K increment of MASC data includes a 40K subset consisting of OANC data that has been previously annotated for PropBank predi-cate argument structures, Pittsburgh Opinion an-notation (opinions, evaluations, sentiments, etc.), TimeML time and events 2 , and several other lin-guistic phenomena. It also includes a handful of small texts from the so-called Language Under-standing (LU) Corpus 3 that has been annotated by multiple groups for a wide variety of phenomena, including events and committed belief. All of the first 80K increment is annotated for Penn Tree-bank syntax. The second 120K increment includes 5.5K words of Wall Street Journal texts that have been annotated by several projects, including Penn Treebank, PropBank, Penn Discourse Treebank, TimeML, and the Pittsburgh Opinion project. The composition of the 220K portion of the corpus an-notated so far is shown in Table 1. The remain-ing 280K of the corpus fills out the genres that are under-represented in the first portion and includes a few additional genres such as blogs and tweets. Annotations for a variety of linguistic phenomena, either manually produced or corrected from output of automatic annotation systems, are being added Table 2: Current MASC Annotations (* projected) to MASC data in increments of roughly 100K words. To date, validated or manually produced annotations for 222K words have been made avail-able.

The MASC project is itself producing annota-tions for portions of the corpus for WordNet senses and FrameNet frames and frame elements. To de-rive maximal benefit from the semantic informa-tion provided by these resources, the entire cor-pus is also annotated and manually validated for shallow parses (noun and verb chunks) and named entities (person, location, organization, date and time). Several additional types of annotation have either been contracted by the MASC project or contributed from other sources. The 220K words of MASC I and II include seventeen different types of linguistic annotation 4 , shown in Table 2.
All MASC annotations, whether contributed or produced in-house, are transduced to the Graph Annotation Framework (GrAF) (Ide and Suder-man, 2007) defined by ISO TC37 SC4 X  X  Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) (Ide and Romary, 2004). GrAF is an XML serialization of the LAF abstract model of annotations, which consists of a directed graph decorated with feature structures providing the annotation content. GrAF X  X  primary role is to serve as a  X  X ivot X  format for transducing among annotations represented in different for-mats. However, because the underlying data struc-ture is a graph, the GrAF representation itself can serve as the basis for analysis via application of graph-analytic algorithms such as common sub-tree detection.

The layering of annotations over MASC texts dictates the use of a stand-off annotation repre-sentation format, in which each annotation is con-tained in a separate document linked to the pri-mary data. Each text in the corpus is provided in UTF-8 character encoding in a separate file, which includes no annotation or markup of any kind. Each file is associated with a set of GrAF standoff files, one for each annotation type, containing the annotations for that text. In addition to the anno-tation types listed in Table 2, a document contain-ing annotation for logical structure (titles, head-ings, sections, etc. down to the level of paragraph) is included. Each text is also associated with (1) a header document that provides appropriate metadata together with machine-processable in-formation about associated annotations and inter-relations among the annotation layers; and (2) a segmentation of the primary data into minimal re-gions, which enables the definition of different to-kenizations over the text. Contributed annotations are also included in their original format, where available. 3.1 WordNet Sense Annotations A focus of the MASC project is to provide corpus evidence to support an effort to harmonize sense distinctions in WordNet and FrameNet (Baker and Fellbaum, 2009), (Fellbaum and Baker, to appear). The WordNet and FrameNet teams have selected for this purpose 100 common polysemous words whose senses they will study in detail, and the MASC team is annotating occurrences of these words in the MASC. As a first step, fifty oc-currences of each word are annotated using the WordNet 3.0 inventory and analyzed for prob-lems in sense assignment, after which the Word-Net team may make modifications to the inven-tory if needed. The revised inventory (which will be released as part of WordNet 3.1) is then used to annotate 1000 occurrences. Because of its small size, MASC typically contains less than 1000 oc-currences of a given word; the remaining occur-rences are therefore drawn from the 15 million words of the OANC. Furthermore, the FrameNet team is also annotating one hundred of the 1000 sentences for each word with FrameNet frames and frame elements, providing direct comparisons of WordNet and FrameNet sense assignments in attested sentences. 5
For convenience, the annotated sentences are provided as a stand-alone corpus, with the Word-Net and FrameNet annotations represented in standoff files. Each sentence in this corpus is linked to its occurrence in the original text, so that the context and other annotations associated with the sentence may be retrieved. 3.2 Validation Automatically-produced annotations for sentence, token, part of speech, shallow parses (noun and verb chunks), and named entities (person, lo-cation, organization, date and time) are hand-validated by a team of students. Each annotation set is first corrected by one student, after which it is checked (and corrected where necessary) by a second student, and finally checked by both auto-matic extraction of the annotated data and a third pass over the annotations by a graduate student or senior researcher. We have performed inter-annotator agreement studies for shallow parses in order to establish the number of passes required to achieve near-100% accuracy.

Annotations produced by other projects and the FrameNet and Penn Treebank annotations produced specifically for MASC are semi-automatically and/or manually produced by those projects and subjected to their internal quality con-trols. No additional validation is performed by the ANC project.

The WordNet sense annotations are being used as a base for an extensive inter-annotator agree-ment study, which is described in detail in (Pas-sonneau et al., 2009), (Passonneau et al., 2010). All inter-annotator agreement data and statistics are published along with the sense tags. The re-lease also includes documentation on the words annotated in each round, the sense labels for each word, the sentences for each word, and the anno-tator or annotators for each sense assignment to each word in context. For the multiply annotated data in rounds 2-4, we include raw tables for each word in the form expected by Ron Artstein X  X  cal-culate alpha.pl perl script 6 , so that the agreement numbers can be regenerated. Like the OANC, MASC is distributed without license or other restrictions from the American National Corpus website 7 . It is also available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 8 for a nominal processing fee.
 In addition to enabling download of the entire MASC, we provide a web application that allows users to select some or all parts of the corpus and choose among the available annotations via a web interface (Ide et al., 2010). Once generated, the corpus and annotation bundle is made available to the user for download. Thus, the MASC user need never deal directly with or see the underlying rep-resentation of the stand-off annotations, but gains all the advantages that representation offers. The following output formats are currently available: 1. in-line XML (XCES 9 ), suitable for use with 2. token / part of speech, a common input for-3. CONLL IOB format, used in the Confer-The ANC project provides an API for GrAF an-notations that can be used to access and manip-ulate GrAF annotations directly from Java pro-grams and render GrAF annotations in a format suitable for input to the open source GraphViz 12 graph visualization application. 13 Beyond this, the ANC project does not provide specific tools for use of the corpus, but rather provides the data in formats suitable for use with a variety of available applications, as described in section 4, together with means to import GrAF annotations into ma-jor annotation software platforms. In particular, the ANC project provides plugins for the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) (Cun-ningham et al., 2002) to input and/or output an-notations in GrAF format; a  X  X AS Consumer X  to enable using GrAF annotations in the Un-structured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004); and a corpus reader for importing MASC data and annotations into NLTK 14 .

Because the GrAF format is isomorphic to in-put to many graph-analytic tools, existing graph-analytic software can also be exploited to search and manipulate MASC annotations. Trivial merg-ing of GrAF-based annotations involves simply combining the graphs for each annotation, after which graph minimization algorithms 15 can be ap-plied to collapse nodes with edges to common subgraphs to identify commonly annotated com-ponents. Graph-traversal and graph-coloring al-gorithms can also be applied in order to iden-tify and generate statistics that could reveal in-teractions among linguistic phenomena that may have previously been difficult to observe. Other graph-analytic algorithms  X  including common sub-graph analysis, shortest paths, minimum span-ning trees, connectedness, identification of artic-ulation vertices, topological sort, graph partition-ing, etc.  X  may also prove to be useful for mining information from a graph of annotations at multi-ple linguistic levels. The ANC project solicits contributions of anno-tations of any kind, applied to any part or all of the MASC data. Annotations may be contributed in any format, either inline or standoff. All con-tributed annotations are ported to GrAF standoff format so that they may be used with other MASC annotations and rendered in the various formats the ANC tools generate. To accomplish this, the ANC project has developed a suite of internal tools and methods for automatically transducing other annotation formats to GrAF and for rapid adapta-tion of previously unseen formats.

Contributions may be emailed to anc@cs.vassar.edu or uploaded via the ANC website 16 . The validity of annotations and supplemental documentation (if appropriate) are the responsibility of the contributor. MASC users may contribute evaluations and error reports for the various annotations on the ANC/MASC wiki 17 .
 Contributions of unvalidated annotations for MASC and OANC data are also welcomed and are distributed separately. Contributions of unencum-bered texts in any genre, including stories, papers, student essays, poetry, blogs, and email, are also solicited via the ANC web site and the ANC Face-Book page 18 , and may be uploaded at the contri-bution page cited above. MASC is already the most richly annotated corpus of English available for widespread use. Because the MASC is an open resource that the commu-nity can continually enhance with additional an-notations and modifications, the project serves as a model for community-wide resource development in the future. Past experience with corpora such as the Wall Street Journal shows that the commu-nity is eager to annotate available language data, and we anticipate even greater interest in MASC, which includes language data covering a range of genres that no existing resource provides. There-fore, we expect that as MASC evolves, more and more annotations will be contributed, thus creat-ing a massive, inter-linked linguistic infrastructure for the study and processing of current American English in its many genres and varieties. In addi-tion, by virtue of its WordNet and FrameNet anno-tations, MASC will be linked to parallel WordNets and FrameNets in languages other than English, thus creating a global resource for multi-lingual technologies, including machine translation. The MASC project is supported by National Science Foundation grant CRI-0708952. The WordNet-FrameNet alignment work is supported by NSF grant IIS 0705155.
