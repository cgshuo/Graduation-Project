 I nformation diffusion in social networks provide great opportu-nities for political and social change as well as societal educa-tion. Therefore understanding information diffusion in social net-works is a critical research goal. This greater understanding can be achieved through data analysis, development of reliable models that can predict outcomes of social processes, and ultimately the cre-ation of applications that can shape the outcome of these processes. In this tutorial, we aim to provide an overview of such recent re-search based on a wide variety of techniques such as optimization algorithms, data mining, data streams covering a large number of problems such as influence spread maximization, misinformation limitation and study of trends in online social networks.

We start our tutorial with a discussion of the significance of so-cial networks in today X  X  world and measurement studies focusing on important characteristics that distinguish social networks from other networks.
In this part of the tutorial, we outline the techniques used in opti-mizing or facilitating information diffusion in social networks. We identify two problem definitions; maximizing the spread of influ-ence and minimizing the spread of misinformation in social net-works. Through our study of these two problems, we delve into more detail about the sub-problems; ( i ) Diffusion model forma-tion [4, 7, 9, 10], ( ii ) formalization and optimization [1 X 4, 6, 8, 9], ( iii ) large-scale data analysis and ( iv ) technique validation.
