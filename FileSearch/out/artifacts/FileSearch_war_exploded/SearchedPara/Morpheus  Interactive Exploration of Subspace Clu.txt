 Data mining techniques extract interesting patterns out of large data resources. Meaningful visualization and interac-tive exploration of patterns are crucial for knowledge dis-covery. Visualization techniques exist for traditional clus-tering in low dimensional spaces. In high dimensional data, clusters typically only exist in subspace projections. This subspace clustering, however, lacks interactive visualization tools. Challenges arise from typically large result sets in different subspace projections that hinder comparability, vi-sualization and understandability.

In this work, we describe Morpheus , a tool that supports the knowledge discovery process through visualization and interactive exploration of subspace clusterings. Users may browse an overview of the entire subspace clustering, ana-lyze subspace cluster characteristics in-depth and zoom into object groupings. Bracketing of different parameter settings enables users to immediately see the effects of parameters and to provide feedback to further improve the subspace clustering. Furthermore, Morpheus may serve as a teach-ing and exploration tool for the data mining community to visually assess different subspace clustering paradigms.

In applications such as life sciences, e-commerce, mobile information and communication, more and more data is pro-duced that requires mining for knowledge discovery pur-poses. In many cases, data objects are described by many different attributes. In such high dimensional data, the so called  X  X urse of dimensionality X  poses a major challenge for data mining [5]. More specifically, clusters cannot be de-tected due to the increasingly similar distances between ob-jects. As clustering aims to group similar objects while sep-arating dissimilar ones, traditional clustering algorithms are thus hindered by irrelevant dimensions. These irrelevant di-mensions differ from cluster to cluster; consequently, there are no globally irrelevant dimensions that could be removed. Recently, subspace clustering research tackles this challenge by removing locally irrelevant dimensions per cluster. Sub-space clustering successfully detects patterns in subspace projections of high dimensional data. These patterns have to be intuitively presented to the user for knowledge extrac-tion. With Morpheus we present a tool for intuitive repre-sentation and interactive exploration to tackle three major challenges of subspace clustering analysis:

Mor-pheus thus completes the final steps of the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process for subspace clustering (cf. Figure 1).

The Morpheus system provides visualization and inter-active exploration of subspace clusters, as well as feedback on parametrization and subsequent subspace clustering im-provement. Morpheus builds on our previous work on com-parison and representation in [4], providing hands on as-sessment of subspace clusters using the suggested measures. Additionally, it offers novel exploration features with feed-back for parametrization and analysis of different subspace clustering algorithms. New 3-dimensional views allow for interactive browsing and focusing on interesting results.
Morpheus is a subspace clustering visualization and anal-ysis tool that offers both overview and in-depth exploration techniques.
Morpheus provides visualization techniques to present sub-space clustering results such that users can easily gain an overview of the detected patterns, as well as an in-depth un-derstanding of individual subspace clusters and their mutual relationship.

Gaining a meaningful overview is crucial in allowing users to assess the overall subspace clustering result. As men-tioned before, subspace clustering is inherently challenging as both the typical number of resulting subspace clusters is usually enormous as well as that clusters in different projec-tions are difficult to understand. Visualization techniques that were developed for full space clustering results rely on a common representation, i.e. no subspace projections [4]. Consequently, they cannot be applied to subspace cluster-ing.

Our Morpheus system thus contains specialized techniques for visualization of subspace clustering. 2d and 3d models are an adequate representation for human cognitive abilities. Based on a recently developed comparison measure for sub-space clusters the Morpheus system provides an overview on the entire subspace clustering result by MDS (multidimen-sional scaling) plots in both 2d and 3d [4]. As illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, MDS approximates distances in high di-mensional spaces by two or three dimensions. While the 2d representation is a static view that allows for easy reading, the 3d MDS plots allow users to interactively explore the overall subspace clustering result. They may move around the 3d representation to focus on those subspace clusters they are most interested in. At any point, they may choose individual subspace clusters in the plot to obtain more de-tailed information.

Thus, MDS plots in Morpheus provide an overview on subspace clustering. Moreover, it helps users in interactively determining the best parameter setting. For any subspace clustering algorithm, some core parameters tend to have a large influence on the resulting output. We therefore present a bracketing representation, i.e. a series of 2d MDS plots for different parameters. Users thus get a clear visual impres-sion of the effect of parameters and may choose the best ones for a feedback loop that generates the desired subspace clustering.

For in-depth analysis of any subspace clustering algorithm, representation of the key features of subspace clusters in a cognitively meaningful way is crucial. As subspace cluster-ing results represent patterns in different projections by their very nature, visualization should contain information on the respective subspaces, the cluster values and additional in-formation on the interestingness measures computed by the subspace clustering algorithm. Morpheus uses a color-coding scheme where the different axis in the HSV color space are used to represent different aspects of subspace clusters in a very compact and easy to understand manner [4]. For easy navigation, subspace clusters can be zoomed into, and understood using a color legend on values of the subspace clusters.
The conceptual design for interactive exploration in Mor-pheus isbasedonthe Visual Exploration Paradigm [7]: Start-ing from an overview over the subspace clustering result the user can navigate through the visualized patterns. By se-lecting subjectively interesting subspace clusters, the user may then obtain more detailed information where desired. Detailed information is provided on three levels: for entire subspace clusterings, for single subspace clusters, as well as for individual objects. Based on the discovered knowledge, the user can give feedback to the system for further im-proved results. This feedback loop enables the system to use the cognitive abilities of humans for better parameter settings and thus for meaningful subspace clusters.
Overview Browsing. Interactive exploration in Mor-pheus starts from an overview of all mined subspace clus-ters in which the user can browse. The automatically de-tected patterns are thus presented to the user for a general impression of the result and a comparison of the resulting subspace clusters. As clusters are detected in arbitrary sub-spaces, they cannot be compared based on the full space dimensionality. Morpheus thus incorporates a distance func-tion that takes the main characteristics of subspace clusters, their subspace dissimilarity and object dissimilarity into ac-count for visualization in an MDS plot [4]. Based on such an overall distance function, subspace clusters can be intu-itively represented as circles in a 2d or 3d space (Figure 2). This approximation of the original high dimensional infor-mation to a 2d or 3d representation, allows human users to easily understand the result just by the visual impression. Morpheus enriches this MDS information by additional vi-sual features. The size of a subspace cluster is represented as the diameter of the circle. Its dimensionality is encoded by the color of the circle. This information allows users to identify similar subspace clusters, those clusters of similar dimensionality, or of similar size, or to study the overall distribution of these characteristics in the result for further analysis.

Subspace cluster details. Selecting a subspace cluster in this 2d or 3d representation by clicking on it, the user gets more detailed information which is presented in a second pop-up window. In this window, the data distribution inside the selected subspace cluster is visualized via box-plots. For each dimension the median, the 25/75% quantiles and min-imum/maximum values are presented. As a characteristic information for subspace clusters, the relevant dimensions, i.e. the respective subspace projections, are highlighted in red. For the irrelevant dimensions, that are not part of the subspace projection, we may observe a scattered distribution in the values, while in the relevant dimensions the data is clustered to a tighter value range. Having this information at hand, the user can investigate the quality and internal structure of the grouping of the objects in such subspace clusters and thus discover knowledge about the underlying structure of the data.

Parameter Bracketing. Parameter setting is in gen-eral a difficult task for most data mining algorithms. This is especially the case for unsupervised techniques like clus-tering, where typically no prior knowledge about the data is available. This inherent problem of clustering is even more present in subspace clustering as the user has to provide parametrization for detecting clusters in different subspaces. In general the problem can be solved by guessing a param-eter setting, looking at the result and then trying to choose a better parameter setting. To speed up this tedious pro-cess for users and give them more information to base their parameter choice on, Morpheus visualizes a set of different subspace clusters at once, called bracketing of different pa-rameter settings for direct feedback. This means that users obtain a series of MDS plots (cf. upper part of Figure 2) from which they pick the most appropriate one(s) for sub-sequent runs of the subspace clustering algorithms. By di-rectly comparing the results of different parameter settings, parametrization is no longer a guess, but becomes an in-formed decision based on the visual analysis of the effects of parameters. Moreover, this process is far more comfortable for users and allows reaching the desired subspace clustering result in fewer steps.

Direct subspace cluster comparison. For a more de-tailed analysis of two different parameter settings the user can select two clusterings out of the presented series of MDS plots by clicking on them in the bracketing representation. These two subspace clusterings are then presented as larger plots in the lower part of the cluster overview screen in Mor-pheus . Once again, detailed information for the subspace clusters can be obtain by picking individual subspace clus-ters. 3d Browsing. For the overview browsing Morpheus pro-vides static 2-dimensional MDS plots. These static views provide a fixed perspective for easy comparison. For in-depth browsing, where focusing to different parts of the sub-space clustering is of interest, a flexible navigation through MDS plots is provided in the Morpheus tool. 3-dimensional MDS plot browsing allows users to shift, rotate and zoom into the MDS plot using standard 2-dimensional input de-vices or 3-dimensional input devices that allow for even more intuitive navigation. The user may thus identify similar or dissimilar subspace clusters that are of specific interest. In Figure 3, a 3-dimensional MDS plot is rotated in 30  X  steps around the z-axis.

Object Ranking. Upon selection of an interesting sub-space clustering from the 2d and 3d overview browsing, the user can analyze this clustering in-depth on the object level. In the overview MDS plots, the objects are summarized by circles. For detail information on the objects and their char-acteristics, Morpheus provides an object ranking visualiza-tion technique which both provides information on the val-ues of the objects in the cluster, as well as on the most relevant objects for the subspace clustering. The color cod-ing, illustrated in Figure 4, uses the HSV color space, where the axes for saturation and value correspond to the inter-estingness measure according to the subspace clustering, i.e. interesting subspace clusters show up in bright and intensive colors in their relevant dimensions. Their value is repre-sented as the hue axes in HSV colors. Irrelevant dimensions are denoted in black for easier reading. As subspace clusters may be large, Morpheus allows for zooming into areas of in-terest via a scroll bar to the right, which moves a zoom area, depicted via yellow lines at top and bottom. Individual ob-jects can choose within this zoom area using the 2d or 3d input device. The user is then provided with information on the actual values of the object in question for most detailed analysis.
The demonstration setup for Morpheus contains the above described tools, real world data sets, precomputed examples, as well as different subspace clustering algorithms. Confer-ence attendees may explore subspace clustering results or see examples for different features and effects.

Data Sets. We use real world data from the UCI KDD archive [9]. Subspace clustering results on such real world data can be explored to find meaningful patterns in the data. Various parameter settings for the different data sets can be compared by bracketing. On meaningful subspace cluster-ings, the user can perform an in-depth analysis to study the structure of the respective subspace clusters. Possibly, even new or unexpected results are detected in data sets that conference attendees are familiar with.

Subspace Clustering Techniques. Besides the com-parison of subspace clusterings generated on different real world data and by different parameter settings, the Mor-pheus demo includes various subspace clustering techniques from different clustering paradigms:
As a grid-based subspace clustering algorithm, Morpheus includes the pioneer in subspace clustering, CLIQUE [2]. It discretizes the data space into grid cells for efficient bottom-up processing by pruning cells which do not contain a min-imum number of objects. A second grid-based algorithm in the Morpheus demo is SCHISM which extends CLIQUE to a variable threshold adapted to the dimensionality of the considered subspace [10].

The Morpheus demo includes projected clustering algo-rithms, that partition the objects in a search for disjoint clus-ters in the detected subspace projections. PROCLUS itera-tively refines a full-space k-medoid clustering in a top-down manner on the dimensionality of the subspace projections [1]. Also incorporated in the Morpheus demo is a second par-titioning technique, P3C , which combines one-dimensional cluster cores to higher-dimensional clusters bottom-up [8].
Density-based subspace clustering algorithms are avail-able in Morpheus as well. SUBCLU mines subspace clusters in a bottom-up fashion using a monotonicity on the density assessment for pruning the search space [6]. DUSC normal-izes the density with respect to the dimensionality of the subspace to remove dimensionality bias in monotonous den-sity measures [3].

Extensibility and Research Impact. Further sub-space clustering algorithms can be incorporated by an open interface specific for subspace clustering techniques. New al-gorithms, which also follow the simple input and output for-mats defined in the Morpheus system, can be easily plugged in for visualization and interactive exploration.
Morpheus may serve as a basis for teaching and research in the subspace clustering community. It allows students and researchers alike to easily see the effects of parametrization or subspace clustering paradigms. Easy extensibility makes Morpheus an ideal tool for the development and study of new algorithms. Consequently, Morpheus may even spark new interest in the domain of subspace clustering.
