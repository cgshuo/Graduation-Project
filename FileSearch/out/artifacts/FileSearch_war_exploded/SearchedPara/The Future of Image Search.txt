 There are billions of images on the Internet. Today, searching for a desired image is largely based emerged during the 1990s, focused pr imarily on color and texture cues . These were easier to model than shape, but they turned out to be much less us eful than originally hoped. I shall review some of the recent developments in the field of visual object recognition in the computer vision community that offer greater promise. Much better image features for characterizing shape, advances in machine learning techniques, and th e availability of large amounts of tr aining data lie at the heart of these approaches.
