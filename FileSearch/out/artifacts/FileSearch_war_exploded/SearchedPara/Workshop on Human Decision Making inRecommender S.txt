 A primary function of recommender systems is to help their users to make better choices and decisions. The overall goal of the workshop is to analyse and discuss novel techniques and approaches for supporting effective and efficient human decision making in different types of recommendation sce-narios. The submitted papers discuss a wide range of top-ics, from core algorithmic issues to the management of the human computer interaction.

Users interact with recommender systems to obtain useful information about products or services that may be of inter-est for them. But, while users are interacting with a recom-mender system to fulfill a primary task, which is usually the selection of one or more items, they are facing several other decision problems. For instance, they may be requested to select specific feature values (e.g., camera X  X  size, zoom) as criteria for a search, or they could have to identify features to be used in a critiquing based recommendation session, or they may need to select a repair proposal for inconsis-tent user preferences when interacting with a recommender. In all these scenarios, and in many others, users of recom-mender systems are facing decision tasks.

The complexity of decision tasks, limited cognitive re-sources of users, and the tendency to keep the overall de-cision effort as low as possible is modeled by theories that conjecture  X  X ounded rationality X , i.e., users are exploiting decision heuristics rather than trying to take an optimal decision [4]. Furthermore, preferences of users will likely change throughout a recommendation session, i.e., prefer-ences are constructed in a specific decision context and users may not fully know their preferences beforehand [2]. Within the scope of a decision process, preferences are strongly influ-enced by the goals of the customer, existing cognitive con-straints, and the personal experience of the customer [6]. Due to the fact that users do not have stable preferences, the interaction mechanisms provided by a recommender system and the information shown to a user can have an enormous impact on the outcome of a decision process [3]. For exam-ple, some authors analyzed the existence of anchoring effect in recommender systems and show the impacts of different types of rating drifts on a user X  X  rating behavior [1, 7].
Theories from decision psychology and cognitive psychol-ogy have already elaborated a number of methodological tools for explaining and predicting the user behavior in these scenarios. In [5], the authors pointed out their importance for recommender systems research, but current systems hardly integrate this knowledge in the computational model. The major goal of this workshop is to establish a platform for in-dustry and academia to present and discuss new ideas and research results that are related to the topic of human de-cision making in recommender systems. The workshop is focused on the role of decision theories in advancing recom-mender systems research and applications. The main topics of the workshop are:
In particular, papers submitted to this third edition of the workshop have focused on:
