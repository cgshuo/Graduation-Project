 Tree substitution grammar (TSG) is a promising for-malism for modeling language data. TSG general-izes context free grammars (CFG) by allowing non-terminal nodes to be replaced with subtrees of arbi-trary size.

A natural extension of TSG involves adding an insertion operator for combining subtrees as in tree adjoining grammars (TAG) (Joshi, 1985) or tree insertion grammars (TIG) (Schabes and Wa-ters, 1995). An insertion operator is helpful for ex-pressing various syntax patterns with fewer gram-mar rules, thus we expect that adding an insertion operator will improve parsing accuracy and realize a compact grammar size.

One of the challenges of adding an insertion op-erator is that the computational cost of grammar in-duction is high since tree insertion significantly in-creases the number of possible subtrees. Previous work on TAG and TIG induction (Xia, 1999; Chi-ang, 2003; Chen et al., 2006) has addressed the prob-lem using language-specific heuristics and a maxi-mum likelihood estimator, which leads to overfitting the training data (Post and Gildea, 2009).
 Instead, we incorporate an insertion operator in a Bayesian TSG (BTSG) model (Cohn et al., 2011) that learns grammar rules automatically without heuristics. Our model uses a restricted variant of subtrees for insertion to model the probability dis-tribution simply and train the model efficiently. We also present an inference technique for handling a tree insertion that makes use of dynamic program-ming. We briefly review the BTSG model described in (Cohn et al., 2011). TSG uses a substitution operator (shown in Fig. 1a) to combine subtrees. Subtrees for substitution are referred to as initial trees, and leaf nonterminals in initial trees are referred to as fron-tier nodes. Their task is the unsupervised induction of TSG derivations from parse trees. A derivation is information about how subtrees are combined to form parse trees.

The probability distribution over initial trees is de-fined by using a Pitman-Yor process prior (Pitman and Yor, 1997), that is, where X is a nonterminal symbol, e is an initial tree rooted with X , and P 0 (  X | X ) is a base distribution over the infinite space of initial trees rooted with X . d
X and  X  X are hyperparameters that are used to con-trol the model X  X  behavior. Integrating out all possi-ble values of G X , the resulting distribution is where  X  e erated initial trees, and n  X  i e e has been used in e  X  i . t e e t e,X are the total counts of initial trees and ta-bles, respectively. The PYP prior produces  X  rich get richer  X  statistics: a few initial trees are often used for derivation while many are rarely used, and this is shown empirically to be well-suited for natural lan-guage (Teh, 2006b; Johnson and Goldwater, 2009).
The base probability of an initial tree, P 0 ( e | X ) , is given as follows.
 where CFG ( e ) is a set of decomposed CFG produc-tions of e , P MLE ( r ) is a maximum likelihood esti-mate (MLE) of r . LEAF ( e ) and INTER ( e ) are sets of leaf and internal symbols of e , respectively. s X is a stopping probability defined for each X . 3.1 Tree Insertion Model We propose a model that incorporates an insertion operator in BTSG. Figure 1b shows an example of an insertion operator. To distinguish them from ini-tial trees, subtrees for insertion are referred to as auxiliary trees. An auxiliary tree includes a special nonterminal leaf node labeled with the same sym-bol as the root node. This leaf node is referred to as a foot node (marked with the subscript  X * X ). The definitions of substitution and insertion operators are identical with those of TIG and TAG.

Since it is computationally expensive to allow any auxiliary trees, we tackle the problem by introduc-ing simple auxiliary trees , i.e., auxiliary trees whose root node must generate a foot node as an immediate child. For example,  X (N (JJ pretty) N*) X  is a simple auxiliary tree, but  X (S (NP ) (VP (V think) S*)) X  is Figure 1: Example of (a) substitution and (b) inser-tion (dotted line). not. Note that we place no restriction on the initial trees.
 Our restricted formalism is a strict subset of TIG. We briefly refer to some differences between TAG, TIG and our insertion model. TAG generates tree adjoining languages, a strict superset of context-free languages, and the computational complexity of parsing is O n 6 . TIG is a similar formalism to TAG, but it does not allow wrapping adjunction in TAG. Therefore, TIG generates context-free lan-guages and the parsing complexity is O n 3 , which is a strict subset of TAG. On the other hand, our model prohibits neither wrapping adjunction in TAG nor simultaneous adjunction in TIG, and allows only simple auxiliary trees. The expressive power and computational complexity of our formalism is iden-tical to TIG, however, our model allows us to de-fine the probability distribution over auxiliary trees as having the same form as BTSG model. This en-sures that we can make use of a dynamic program-ming technique for training our model, which we de-scribe the detail in the next subsection.

We define a probability distribution over simple auxiliary trees as having the same form as eq. 1, that is, where d 0 X and  X  0 X are hyperparameters of the in-sertion model, and the definition of  X  0 e the same as that of (  X  e
However, we need modify the base distribution over simple auxiliary trees, P 0 0 ( e | X ) , as follows, so that all probabilities of the simple auxiliary trees sum to one.
 where TOP ( e ) is the CFG production that starts with the root node of e . For example, TOP ( N (JJ pretty) (N*) ) returns  X  X   X  JJ N* X . INTER_CFG ( e ) is a set of CFG productions of e excluding TOP ( e ) . P 0 MLE ( r 0 ) is a modified MLE for simple auxiliary trees, which is given by where C ( r 0 ) is the frequency of r 0 in parse trees. It is ensured that P 0 0 ( e | X ) generates a foot node as an immediate child.

We define the probability distribution over both initial trees and simple auxiliary trees with a PYP prior. The base distribution over initial trees is de-fined as P 0 ( e | X ) , and the base distribution over simple auxiliary trees is defined as P 0 0 ( e | X ) . An initial tree e i replaces a frontier node with prob-ability p ( e i | e  X  i ,X,d X , X  X ) . On the other hand, a simple auxiliary tree e 0 i inserts an internal node with probability a X  X  p 0 e 0 i e 0  X  i ,X,d 0 X , X  0 X , where a X is an insertion probability defined for each X . The stopping probabilities are common to both ini-tial and auxiliary trees. 3.2 Grammar Decomposition We develop a grammar decomposition technique, which is an extension of work (Cohn and Blunsom, 2010) on BTSG model, to deal with an insertion operator. The motivation behind grammar decom-position is that it is hard to consider all possible Figure 2: Derivation of Fig. 1b transformed by grammar decomposition.
 Table 1: The rules and probabilities of grammar de-composition for Fig. 2. derivations explicitly since the base distribution as-signs non-zero probability to an infinite number of initial and auxiliary trees. Alternatively, we trans-form a derivation into CFG productions and assign the probability for each CFG production so that its assignment is consistent with the probability distri-butions. We can efficiently calculate an inside prob-ability (described in the next subsection) by employ-ing grammar decomposition.

Here we provide an example of the derivation shown in Fig. 1b. First, we can transform the deriva-tion in Fig. 1b to another form as shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, all the derivation information is embed-a root symbol of the initial tree  X (NP (DT the) (N girl)) X , which generates two child nodes: DT (DT the)  X  X he X . On the other hand, N ins (N girl) denotes that N (N girl) is inserted by some auxiliary tree, and N iliary tree is  X (N (JJ pretty) (N*)) X . The inserted auxiliary tree,  X (N (JJ pretty) (N*)) X , must generate a foot node:  X (N girl) X  as an immediate child. Second, we decompose the transformed tree into CFG productions and then assign the probability for each CFG production as shown in Table 1, where a
DT , a N and a JJ are insertion probabilities for non-terminal DT, N and JJ, respectively. Note that the probability of a derivation according to Table 1 is the same as the probability of a derivation obtained from the distribution over the initial and auxiliary trees (i.e. eq. 1 and eq. 3).

In Table 1, we assume that the auxiliary tree  X (N (JJ pretty) (N*)) X  is sampled from the first term of eq. 3. When it is sampled from the sec-ond term, we alternatively assign the probability  X  3.3 Training We use a blocked Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algo-rithm (Cohn and Blunsom, 2010) to train our model. The MH algorithm learns BTSG model parameters efficiently, and it can be applied to our insertion model. The MH algorithm consists of the following three steps. For each sentence, 1. Calculate the inside probability (Lari and 2. Sample a derivation tree in a top-down manner. 3. Accept or reject the derivation sample by using The MH algorithm is described in detail in (Cohn and Blunsom, 2010). The hyperparameters of our model are updated with the auxiliary variable tech-nique (Teh, 2006a). We ran experiments on the British National Cor-pus (BNC) Treebank 3 and the WSJ English Penn Treebank. We did not use a development set since our model automatically updates the hyperparame-ters for every iteration. The treebank data was bina-rized using the CENTER-HEAD method (Matsuzaki et al., 2005). We replaced lexical words with counts  X  1 in the training set with one of three unknown
Table 3: Full Penn Treebank dataset experiments words using lexical features. We trained our model using a training set, and then sampled 10k deriva-tions for each sentence in a test set. Parsing results were obtained with the MER algorithm (Cohn et al., 2011) using the 10k derivation samples. We show the bracketing F1 score of predicted parse trees eval-uated by EVALB 4 , averaged over three independent runs.

In small dataset experiments, we used BNC (1k sentences, 90% for training and 10% for testing) and WSJ (section 2 for training and section 22 for test-ing). This was a small-scale experiment, but large enough to be relevant for low-resource languages. We trained the model with an MH sampler for 1k iterations. Table 2 shows the parsing results for the test set. We compared our model with standard PCFG and BTSG models implemented by us.
 Our insertion model successfully outperformed CFG and BTSG. This suggests that adding an inser-tion operator is helpful for modeling syntax trees ac-curately. The BTSG model described in (Cohn and Blunsom, 2010) is similar to ours. They reported an F1 score of 78.40 (the score of our BTSG model was 77.19). We speculate that the performance gap is due to data preprocessing such as the treatment of rare words. Table 4: Examples of lexicalized auxiliary trees ob-tained from our model in the full treebank dataset. Nonterminal symbols created by binarization are shown with an over-bar.
 We also applied our model to the full WSJ Penn Treebank setting (section 2-21 for training and sec-tion 23 for testing). The parsing results are shown in Table 3. We trained the model with an MH sampler for 3.5k iterations.

For the full treebank dataset, our model obtained nearly identical results to those obtained with BTSG model, making the grammar size approximately 19% smaller than that of BTSG. We can see that only a small number of auxiliary trees have a great impact on reducing the grammar size. Surprisingly, there are many fewer auxiliary trees than initial trees. We believe this to be due to the tree binarization and our restricted assumption of simple auxiliary trees.
Table 4 shows examples of lexicalized auxiliary trees obtained with our model for the full treebank data. We can see that punctuation ( X  X  X ,  X , X , and  X ; X ) and adverb (RB) tend to be inserted in other trees. Punctuation and adverb appear in various positions in English sentences. Our results suggest that rather than treat those words as substitutions, it is more rea-sonable to consider them to be  X  X nsertions X , which is intuitively understandable. We proposed a model that incorporates an inser-tion operator in BTSG and developed an efficient inference technique. Since it is computationally ex-pensive to allow any auxiliary trees, we tackled the problem by introducing a restricted variant of aux-iliary trees. Our model outperformed the BTSG model for a small dataset, and achieved compara-ble parsing results for a large dataset, making the number of grammars much smaller than the BTSG model. We will extend our model to original TAG and evaluate its impact on statistical parsing perfor-mance.
