 formed at times of crisis. Examining complex Twitter communication can be challenging; however, it is known that in Social Networks (SNs), some members have more influence over other members; they are known as leaders or pioneers [6, 13]. roles as Leader or Follower in Twitter Soci al Network Service (SNS), based on their credibility and to assess the impact of Leaders in crisis situations. 
Credibility refers to the objective and subjective components of the believability of an agent. A credible SN member is defined as one who has performed consistently, context. The credibility of an agent refers to its quality of being believable or trustworthy and can be measured by its trustworthiness, expertise, and dynamism [8]. 
In SNSs members interact in varied contex ts. We consider Victorian bushfires [11] as the context of the interaction between Twitter members, where the worst day known as Black Saturday when 173 people died. 1.1 Motivations and Contributions Identifying natural leaders in large SNSs such as Twitter is a challenging task. Making assumptions from the number of followers and the number of tweets on Twitter profiles can be deceiving and may not be accurate as both are cumulative figures. Communication in Twitter is best analysed and understood in a context [11]. The Goldbaum X  X   X  X ollow the Leader X  model [6] provides us with insights to identify members X  roles in the SNS whether they are leaders or followers. Enriching the  X  X ollow the Leader X  model with trust provides us with the potential to analyse SNSs based on members X  credibility. Member credibility level is a measure that reflects their trustworthiness and expertise, and provides the means to classify members in a specific context; some members can be classified either leaders or followers. 
Our key contributions in this paper as follows:  X  A credibility based approach that identifies SNS members X  roles.  X  An answer to what extent is leaders X  prominent and influential members in SNS.  X  An answer to what extent new tweets spread during crisis based on their quality. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of some related research work followed by the proposed SN members X  credibility based model in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 report , analyse and evaluate the empirical study of the proposed  X  X ollow the Leader X  model. 2.1 Social Networks and Trust In SNSs, members can express how much they trust other members through the adoption of their postings [14]. Since most SN participants do not know each other in real life, the trust inference mechanism is used when participants want to establish a new trust relationship or m easure trust values between connected members. The connection between member similarity and trust was established in [14]. They demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between the trust expressed by the members and their similarity. The more similar two people are, the greater the trust between them. Similarity can be interpreted as similarity in interests or opinions. 2.2 Follow the Leader Social psychology theory [10] points out that a person X  X  role in a specific context has a Follow the Leader phenomenon in dynamic social networks [6] can be used as a model of opinion formation with dynamic confidence in social networks; in which the profiling of agents as leaders or followers is possible. Goldbaum [6] defines the leader as somebody who possesses better knowledge and information than the general public in a specific context. In SNS, the number and types of links that members have are keys to determining quality of being believable or trustworthy and can be measured by their trustworthiness, expertise, and dynamism [8]. We adopt the credibility computation from our previous work [2] with variation in the expertise computation. 3.1 SNS Members Trustworthiness Trustworthiness is an attribute of individual exchange partners; a trustworthy member is a member in which others place their trust. SNS members gain trustworthiness from their direct followers and indirect followers using the trust transitivity feature of trust; friend, yield a trust score which is the product of the two scores. their implicit trust. Trust in Twitter is considered as binary construct (i.e., Trust score = 1, if there is a trust statement including @ tag referring a member, and 0 otherwise). The aggregation of trust scores is a measure of the member X  X  trustworthiness; consequently it is a measure of member credibility in the SNS. Formally, member m defined as follows: direct\indirect followers of the member with maximum direct\indirect followers in the context, considered as a reference point. Notably, credibility from followers is normalized, hence if the most trustworth y member received the highest trust score followers in the hierarchy is ignored, since their contribution to the members X  credibility is small compared to first and second level followers. 3.2 Expertise Component Expertise, a key dimension of credibility, is defined as the degree of a member X  X  competency to provide valuable quality tweets and exhibit high activity [9]. The expertise dimension of the member credibility captures their perceived knowledge and skills in a given context. SNS members vary in their knowledge and consequently their level of expertise; the more knowledge a member has, the more power they possess, to the extent that "knowledge is power" [7]. The credibility of a member coincides with their generated tweets quality which consequently coincides with their disseminating information laden have more followers and are more trusted. 
Member m expertise in SNS Twitter is drawn from the following three types of messages a member can post: new messages are the most important messages, followed by retweets and replies. mention), with accumulated quality  X   X   X  is given by the following relationship: Each type y tweets accumulated quality posted by member m defined as  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  X   X  X  X  X  where  X   X  refers to type y tweet i quality and  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X  represents the member with the maximum type y tweets accumulated quality, i.e., the member who has the highest quality of type y tweets issued in the context, considered as a reference point. reflects its importance and influence in the context based on the following assessment components: (1) number of keywords KN, (2) number of hash tags #N, (3) number of other Twitter references indicated with @ signs @N, and (4) number of URLs included in the tweet UN; each with a corresponding weight factor W in that component. For tweet i, Quality  X   X  , is given by: where W = (0.4, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1) represent each component weight impact in tweet Notably, the @ parameter does not appear in new messages, so we need to consider this impact when computing new tweet quality by scaling new tweets quality by 7/6. 3.3 Tweet Message Quality Computation context. Most of SNS contributors in crisis are from general public who want to provide information that help to minimize th e impact and consequences of the crisis. which is reflected in the above four components. Although other researchers such as believe that semantic metrics can be considered as added-value to the content quality. 
Our approach as follows: (1) For each assessment component, we build a list of keywords and items from tweets after removing stop words from each tweet message. (2) Ignore each keyword with a frequency less than four. (3) Assign a weight for each item based on its frequency in the context as the standard deviation of the keywords set. (4) Compute quality of a tweet message as shown in equation 3. 3.4 Computing Member Credibility By aggregating the credibility components, i.e. trustworthiness component credibility component (credibility gained from new tweets, retweets and replied tweets), thus member m credibility  X  X   X   X   X   X  at time t is given by: where  X  ,  X  represent trustworthiness credibility weighted importance factors gained expertise credibility weighted importance factors gained from new tweets, retweets and mention/replied tweets respectively. Where  X , X , X , X , X  are model tuning parameters, and T. X 1 X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  hese parameters can be normally set or using automated machine learning techniques. In our experiment, we set the values to trustworthiness and expertise components each assigned equal weights 0.5. 3.5 Classifying Members Based on Credibility To find the most trustworthy and expert SN members who can act as leaders, we define a credibility threshold from which leaders and followers are identified as: Credibility Threshold is a system parameter and is used to promote an adequate number of leaders from the crisis dataset based on the power-law degree distribution. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiven ess of the proposed approach to identify SNS leaders, in this section, we discuss the dataset and the results which demonstrate that the notion of  X  X ollow the Leader X  in assessing credibility can be used as a means to identify leaders and follo wers in the context. 4.1 SNS Crisis Dataset Our Victorian bushfire crisis dataset was borrowed from [11]. The dataset contains 1684 tweets representing members X  communication in one week; as the event unfolded from February 6-14, 2009. 697 unique users are identified in the dataset. 
In Victorian bushfire crisis, 71% of the tweets are new tweets to disseminate new information, followed by mentions/replies (21%) and retweets (8%). Although the retweets ratio is less than the number of mentions/replies, retweets have more impact on information diffusion than replies to spread critical crisis information among SNS members. This is because retweets reinfor ce a message and as such are considered important, and hence they are passed on down the network. 4.2 Leaders and Followers Analysis In the crisis dataset, about 78% of the population are inactive members who listen to active members. They passively contribute to the conversation by posting limited number of new messages, and they do not retweet messages of active members. Similar findings were reported by Starbird et al. [12] in their study covering the Red River flooding in America. Table 1 below provides a comparison between leaders X  community and followers X  community for the active subset, i.e., after removal of inactive members who do not have from/to links. From Table 1, for active members; we note the following observations: (1) 59.4% of the tweets are new, of which 15.5% of the new tweets are retweeted again; are vital source of information distribution. (2) Leaders who represent 20% of the retweet posts, and this for certain extent reflects power law distribution. (3) As shown in (RT 2 Me) column, 84.2% of the Retweets in the communication are generated by members addressing leaders X  content, i.e., originally leaders X  generated content as new messages. On the other hand 15.8% of the Retweets are generated by members addressing followers X  content. (4) 67% of followers follow leaders while 33% of followers follow other members in the SNS. (5) Leaders X  community possess 72.8% of indirect followers, on other hand, 27.2% of indirect followers follow other hierarchy. (6) Followers are mo re tweet repliers than leaders; they generate 53.1% of reply messages. Leaders usually create new messages and pass (retweet) messages more than followers. (7) Leaders X  community possesses 63.7% of SNS credibility, while followers X  community possess 37.3% of SNS credibility; this tends to align with the standard power law distribution. 4.3 SNS Leaders Influence Evaluation To determine the efficiency of the proposed Credibility approach in identifying leaders properly: first, we adopted centrality measure [4] which have been used as a proxy for power and influence; second, we conducted quality and spread analysis on the new tweets and compare between leaders and followers influence. 4.3.1 Centrality Measure individuals in the network. Degree centrality is measured as the number of links of a given node [5]. According to [7] if an ag ent receives many links, they are said to be exchange opinions with many other members, or make many others aware of their views and opinions. Agents who show high out-degree centrality are often said to be influential agents [7]. So, to what exte nt leaders are prominent and influential agents? 
Table 2.a presents the centrality measures (i.e., in-degree and out-degree) for leaders, followers and all members in th e dataset. The in-degree centrality of a particular node is defined as the number of in-links (trust statements this node received); it represents the number of retweets and replied tweets addressing that member. The out-degree centrality of a node is defined as the number of out-links (trust statements issued from this node), it represents the number of retweets and replied tweets issued by that member to other members in SNS. Table 2.a shows that Furthermore, leaders X  out-degree 5.39 is about 4 times followers X  out-degree (1.21). 
Since leaders possess high average in-degree and high average out-degree centrality, which in both cases is more than the followers and more than the average SNS. This outcome is drawn from their trustworthiness and expertise; leaders possess the highest trustworthiness and expertise level among all members in the context. 4.3.2 New Content Quality and Spread Analysis We conducted quality analysis on the new tweets for all population taking 10% as leaders using new content quality computation described in section 3.2.1. We define new content quality based on the quality distribution considering Quality Mean (QMean) and Quality Standard Deviation (QSdev) from the mean of the new content categorised as follows: (1) Low Quality: below QMean -QSdev (2) BelowAvg: equal or greater than QMean -QSdev and less than QMean, (3) AboveAvg: equal or greater than QMean and less than QMean + QSdev, and finally (4) High Quality: equal or greater than QMean + QSdev. 1. Quality Analysis Results: from Table 2.b, we note that: (1) High quality content represents 16.75% of all new tweets content, of which 41.6% of this content is generated by leaders. (2) As shown in column 3 (LdrsContent%), the percentage of new postings content generated by leaders for each category is increasing by the increase of the new content quality. This indicates that leaders are capable of generating the most credible content. (3) As shown in column 4 (Retweeted%), retweets correspond to quality above the average. 2. Spread / Diffusion Time Analysis Based on Quality Category Results: from time retweeted as shown in (1st Retweet A vg Time (Min)) column is decreasing with the increase of new content quality. As shown for the High quality category, the time elapse from new content posting to the first retweet time is 8.5 minutes, with overall elapse time for all retweeting of 195.0 minutes. One notable phenomenon is that tweets which carry bad news spread faster than other tweets. In a Twitter SNS, members X  behaviour is the determinant of their credibility; different members undertook varied activities and possess different interests. In a SN, the prominent and influential members in Twitter SNS. They generate the highest quality content to be adopted and retweeted by other members.

SN leaders are aware and become involv ed in the crisis early; they produce information-laden content and maintain high activity all times. Thus, their postings are an important resource for information management and decision making. 
In Twitter SNS, context leaders differ from Twitter leaders. In each context, there find same leaders across all contexts, simp ly because each Twitter member has varied interests and expertise in varied contexts. Finding leaders who have more influence in a SNS context is a challenging issue. In this paper, we proposed a new credibility ba sed approach to identify leaders in SNSs from their trustworthiness and expertise. Members X  trustworthiness is assessed based on other members X  trust in target member postings and their corresponding followers. content they generate. 
The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed credibility based approach is a significantly innovative approach to identifying Twitter SNS community leaders in a specific context such as crisis or terrorism. New content X  quality plays an important role in information dissemination and diffusion.
