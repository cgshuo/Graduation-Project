  X  X ith the rapid development of Internet technology, the landscape of exchanging infor-mation and doing business has been completely changed X  [15]. As a new way of doing business, E-Commerce is increasingly affecting, changing and even replacing the tradi-tional commerce approach. People are incr easingly accepting and using E-Commerce than ever before. Without any doubt, many net work applications, based on initial Door to Door to B2B, B2C, and C2C models, have a profound influence on the global econ-omy. However most of the development of E-Commerce is primarily achieved within a handful of countries, particularly in countries like US, Japan and some of European countries [5]. Since the advent of the Internet in the late 1990 X  X  in China, various appli-cations can be seen in the following year s, which stirred thousands of ambitious young Chinese people to establish their own business on-line with a dream of getting wealthy overnight. Over the past few years, almost 70% of the growth in Internet users from all over the world occurred only in China [5]. However, in terms of E-Commerce de-velopment, there is still a gap between China and the developed countries [4]. With the increased popularity of the Internet and the continuous improvement of Internet technologies, the development of E-Commerce has just made an impressive start. What hinder the development of Chinese E-Commerce can be attributed to various problems and barriers. Some of these problems such as payment method, distribution problem, and security issues have been partially alleviated. Unfortunately the consumers lack of trust towards E-Retailers has been identifi ed as the biggest barrier that needs to be overcome in long-term.

In the paper, we will identify the challenges in developing Chinese E-Commerce and propose a model to cooperate with current E-Commerce system as a mean of enhanc-ing trustworthiness. The paper is organized into 6 sections. Section 2 introduces the current standing of E-Commerce, and then Section 3 briefly reviews the challenges in developing E-Commerce, and examines the  X  X rust problem X , which is identified as the major obstacle that hinders the spreading of E-Commerce in China. In Section 4, we propose a computational model that can be used to address the trust problem. Section 5 specifically discusses how to apply the model to improve trustworthiness, and gives a case study in Section 6. Section 7 concludes t he paper by discussing further directions for improving trust between E-Commerce users. 2.1 Issues in E-Commerce Trust has always been the main concern among most of Chinese E-Commerce com-panies [6]. On one hand, people are impressed by doing business on-line, but on the other hand they are still worried about using E -Commerce widely. Consequently, a gap appeared between on-line retailers X  interest in attracting shoppers to their electronic storefronts and many consumers X  trust in those activities [2]. Nevertheless, research [18,19] have shown that the trust problem is not only technical problem , but more of a social problem caused by various reasons. F irst and foremost, for historical reasons, people may lack of confidence with others, therefore it X  X  quite difficult to put trust in someone else in the beginning. Secondly, the commercial law and regulation for E-Commerce cannot fully protect the interests of consumers and merchants. Therefore E-Commerce users lack the confidence to t ake the risk when communicating with an unfamiliar party. Thirdly, the social credit system and payment system in China are still not strong enough when carrying complex E-Commerce transactions, so that on-line business frauds may happen, and harm consumers. Last but not least, Internet secu-rity and cryptography techniques, which can increase consumers X  confidence in on-line activity, are still under development. Due to a ll these issues, E-Commerce specialists commonly regard that the bottleneck of Chinese E-Commerce is as a trust problem than anything else. 2.2 Opportunities of Chinese E-Commerce In 2005, Chinese E-Commerce has been experiencing the upsurge of B2C markets. With the recognition of trust problem, many retailers are experimenting with various trust building strategies to establish trustworthiness towards E-Retailers. Establishing trust between E-Commerce users is a long term process. Apart from more education or training in the long term, we can resort to technology to enhance consumer trust in an unfamiliar E-retailer. One effective method is to participate in third-party assurance programs, which assist consumers in an accessible level of trust they should place in an E-Commerce transaction. In that way, merchants who agree to meet a third party assurers standards can either use the assurer-certified technology, or agree to be bound in some way by the assurers procedures or oversight are registered by the assurer and permitted to display an identifying logo or assurance seal on their website. Consumers can reveal specific validation of the merchants good-standing with the assurer or addi-tional disclosures related to the merchants X  business practices or history. Some theories suggest that trust in an E-retailer can be specifically defined as consumers X  willingness to accept vulnerability in an on-line transaction based on their positive expectations regarding an E-Retailers future behavior. By evaluating a party X  X  post behavior and tracking its activities, the party X  X  future behavior can be expected and trust level can be considered so that consumers can make purchasing decision according to the trust level of E-Retailer. In this paper, a third party assurance program that can be cooper-ated with the current E-Commerce system is proposed. Through tracking E-Retailer X  X  activity records, collecting consumer expe riences, and recommendations, the compu-tation model is capable of considering the level that consumer can trust an unfamiliar E-Retailer. More detail about the model is described in Section 4. Chinese E-Markets is undeniably of great potential. E-Markets are not only benefi-cial for national economy, but also for the global economy, especially since China has entered the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, in terms of developing E-Commerce, there is a gap between China and other developed countries. The primary cause is that the advent of information age has a great impact on the economy of indus-trialized countries, while the social environment and China hasn X  X  become used to its coming. These can be noticed from various aspect s including information infrastructure, barriers of social environment, degree of technology innovation, level of awareness, and trustworthiness and so on. Technically, the improvement is obvious, but it X  X  difficult to catch up in short term for some social problems. 3.1 Informationization Gap Current social environment in China is yet to match the rapid informationization. The understanding of the relation and interaction between industrialization and information-ization is inadequate. In addition, the impor tance and urgency of informationization in social and economic development haven X  X  been fully appreciated. Apart from that, for a long term progress, the awareness and accep tance to informationization are still under-way both theoretically and practically.

Furthermore, the global information infrastructure are building up, China is not a exception. However, the popularity of inform ational and electronic facilities in China is still behind the USA, even though 70% of the growth in Internet users occurred in China [3]. That mainly due to the huge population of China and the imbalanced development of different regions.

In terms of the innovation of information technology, China is catching up to the developed countries progressively, although th e exploring and utilization of information resources and services are not yet adequate. 3.2 Social Barriers in E-Commerce In China, E-Commerce activities are impeded by some social barriers as well. For in-stance, the law and regulation are not flawless [16]. E-commerce gives a full impetus to social and economic development; in the meantime, it raises some new problems. So we need to address the inadequacy of traditional policy and laws in the new circumstance, and recommend new and effective law and regulation system. E-commerce may cause multi-facet problems, such as legitimacy and authentication of E-currency, E-contract, and E-bill. Taxation is another problem. It includes how to collect business tax and cus-tom; whether new tax and collecting methods are needed for some intangible products (e.g. software, electrical audio and video); how to secure market and prevent monopoly, especially telecommunication monopoly; how to protect privacy and Intellectual Prop-erty(IP); how to manage and control export and import of intangible products, and so on [17].

There is a lack of E-Commerce standard. Standardization and legislation is a diffi-cult but important task in developing E-Commerce. For instance, before the E-Signature Standard was invented in China, there was no particular standard to normalize the be-haviors on Internet, therefore, it could not setup a standard business environment com-patible with international standards, which has a huge impact on integration of individ-ual country and global economy [20].

Another problem associated with E-Comme rce is the social credit system and pay-ment system. The present E-Commerce can only be regarded as quasi-E-Commerce. Since the credit system lacks of trust, eff ective monitoring and payment mechanism. The Internet commodity transaction centers only fulfilled parts of E-Commerce processes, but by no mean to be full processes from pre-purchase to post-purchase.
The current distribution system for Chinese E-Commerce is still not satisfied enough [21]. For instance, the delivery of products has yet to be separated from manufacturing and commercial enterprisers. The incompl ete distribution system still responds pas-sively to production and sales departments, where different processing links such as warehousing, transporting and loading func tions as independent entities so that the dis-tribution problem has not b een solved well at present.

In summary, these informationization gaps and social barriers indeed hinder the de-velopment of Chinese E-Commerce, but many people consider lack of consumers trust in E-Commerce merchants, technology, social, financial and legal infrastructures of E-Commerce environment as the most concerne d issues that affect the development in an individual country, since most traditional cues for assessing trust in physical world are not available on-line.
 3.3 Trust Issue Trust is a catalyst for human cooperation [7], and it has received considerable attention in the business and social science literature. Lack of trust can result in a waste of time and resources on protecting ourselves against possible harm and thereby clogs up the economy. Consumer X  X  trust in an E-Retailer can be defined as consumers X  willingness to accept vulnerability in an on-line transaction based on their positive expectations in regard with an E-Retailers future behavior. Factors that affect trust in E-Commerce for consumers include security risks, privacy risks, and lack of reliability in E-Commerce processes in general. As pointed by Nielsen [8], real trust builds through a company X  X  actual behavior towards its customers ove r time, and it is seen to be difficult to build and easy to lose [9]. Theoretically, there ar e three trust-building processes summarized in [2]: 1. Knowledge-based trust is described as a form of trust that develops over time as 2. Institutional-based trust relied on the creation of a  X  X rust infrastructure X , of socially 3. Trust transfer happens when one party ascribes trustworthiness to an unfamiliar In the ext section, we will describe a computational model, which can be used to facil-itate the trust-building process in E-Commerce, particularly for Chinese E-Commerce market. 4.1 Relevant Works According to the context and purpose for which trust is established, the technologies and strategies used to build trust will vary. Numerous models for the way, which trust is established and maintained in an E-Commerce setting, have been proposed and ex-perimented. The Cheskin Research and Studio Archetype/Sapient eCommerce Trust Study describes trust as a dynamic process that depends or retreats as a function of ex-periences [10]. Nielsen X  X  model points out that real trust builds through a company X  X  actual behavior towards its customers over time. Egger and de Groot X  X  model of trust for E-Commerce (MoTEC) defined four components of trust consideration [11]:  X  Factors affecting trust before the site is acce ssed, which including brand reputation,  X  Web interface properties such as graphical user interface and usability.  X  Information content including information provided by merchant about services,  X  Relationship management such as customer services, post-purchase communica-Since trust must be based on experience over time, establishing an initial trust level can be a major challenge to potential customers. I t X  X  obvious that without initial trust, mer-chant cannot build a good transaction history, and without a good transaction history, consumers may not build trust in these merchants. Therefore, a trust model that can build initial trust of merchant from collecting off-line experiences, reputation, system guarantees, testimonials and track transaction histories, post customers X  evaluations and other information will be valuable to establish trust between consumers and merchants. 4.2 ERC 2 G Model The computational model is based on the ide a of Reputation accumulation from Role Play Game (RPG) and idea of Reputation System combining the concept of Mathemat-ical Trust Models [12,13,14]. Within RPG, the idea is for player to gain an initial value of reputation, and during playing, the lev el of reputation will be changed depends on player X  X  activities. For example, if the player steals something from others, the reputa-tion level will be dropped; and if the player helps somebody, the reputation will gain reasonable growth. In addition, the reputatio n level will affect player X  X  future activity such as permissions of some tasks, relationship with others, and final result of the game. In terms of doing E-Commerce, establishing trust is the way to build good reputation and relationship with both customers and business partners, which positive activities will increase that level, otherwise destroy reputation immediately.

In case of Reputation System, distribute and aggregate feedbacks about participant X  X  behaviors can be gathered, and these post experiences with a remote transaction partner is projected into the future, giving a measure of their trustworthiness. For instance, the first Web sites to introduce reputation schemes were on-line auction sites such as eBay. The collected information, r ecords, and specification will be translated into numerical values with different weight, and influen ce the value of  X  X rust level X  directly.
Figure 1 represents the ERC 2 G computational trust model, which utilizes multiple information sources and assigns different weights to different information sources. As shown in the model, the top trust level will be the output of the model, which is in-fluenced by five categories of information sources including: (1) direct experience; (2) experiences and recommendations of other parties; (3) Certification and evaluation schemes; (4) digital credentials; and (5) s ystem guarantees. When customer intends to buy a product or service provided by an E-Commerce system, the model computes a trust value based on specifying the values of different information weights. The infor-mation sources can be gathered from the servic e itself such as a successful transaction and customer evaluation, off-line reputation and certificates from other parties or asso-ciations, or even some system guarantees like new security techniques adoption and so on. Since the computational model depends on several information sources, the follow-ing need to be considered: 1. Accuracy of information 2. Complexity of information 3. Anonymity of information 4. Dynamic behavior 5. Context We have briefly introduced the concept of the computational trust model, and in Sec-tion 5, we will discuss how to use the model in an E-Commerce system in detail. The computational trust model forms the base for server side programs of a third party that aims to track activities, maintain trust level and assure trustworthiness of registered E-Retailers to their consumers. Figure 2 illust rate the complete scenario of cooperating with E-Commerce system in means of enhancing trust.

For a functional E-Commerce system of merchant, there have been some system guarantees, positive off-line experiences, and re putations before participating in third-party assurance. Therefore, the third party trust system estimate an initial trust value through evaluating existing evidence of supports, testimonials from customers and cer-tificates of the E-Retailer. If the initial trust value is acceptable for both the E-Retailer and the third party authority, their assura nce agreement will become effective, and the trust level will be activated and available to be viewed by customers of that E-Retailer. During assuring, any new valid evidence is acceptable to increase the trust level of E-Retailer, such as enhancement of system secu rity, association X  X  evaluation, and so on.
As shown in Figure 2, the interaction between consumer, E-Commerce system and trust system consists 14 steps in general. I nitially, consumer searches product informa-tion by sending a request, then the server side database is searched and return specific product information if found. At this stage, consumer is permitted to request trust level and past history of the E-Retailer. The request will be sent to the trust system located at third party server side, once authorizatio n and authentication succeed the corresponding trust level of the E-Retailer and related history summary will be shown to consumer. Ac-cording to the trust information, consumer can make decision to purchase. The process of making order, issuing invoice, process payment has no changes after participating as-surance program, but once the transaction completed, the transaction result will be sent to trust system immediately. In addition, if customers satisfy with the service provided by E-Retailer, they are welcomed to give customer evaluation, and these evaluations also influence the trust level of the E-Retailer.

Further more, accessing third party X  X  web s ite, E-Retailers can write testimonial or recommendation to their business partners. In future study, more information sources that may affect E-Retailer X  X  trustworthiness will be involved in the trust system, and aims to evaluate trust level more synthetically.

In next section, there is a case study that implementing E-Commerce system with the participation of trust assurance for EI Computer 1 . We will describe a case study of assisting trust-building in an E-Commerce system for EIComputer , whose implementation was reliant on XML , JSPs , JDBC and servlets techniques. 6.1 The Structure of System The structure of system is a distributed, three-tier, web based application. The client tier is represented by user X  X  web browser. The browser displays static XHTML documents and dynamically created XHTML (such as forms) that allow the user to interact with the server tier. The server tier consists of JSPs and servlets that act on behalf of the client. JSPs and servlets perform tasks such as generating list of products via connect-ing database and retrieving data there, getting information from client and store them in session or database, adding items to shopping cart, viewing shopping cart and pro-cessing the final order. The database tier might use the comdb database created by IBM cloudscape 10 2 ,andthe preparedStatement 3 is used for batch-processing.

Figure 3 illustrates the interactions between application components. In the diagram, names without extensions represent servlet aliases. For example, registration is the alias for servlet RegistrationServlet . After deploying the application, user can visit the web application via entering a valid URL.

This URL requests the index page of the application ( index.html ). User either can lo-gin as a member or register as a new member, otherwise they won X  X  be allowed to access the main page. By clicking  X  X ogin X  button aft er entering member ID and password, the XHTML will pass the information to authorization entity to validate member X  X  identity via comparing matched information from login table of comdb . If user is authorized, product category list will be shown, otherwise user will fail accessing and be asked to re-login or register. As the user chooses to register as new member, the registration entity contains application form linked from storefront is available for accessing. The action of this application form is to invoke the ProcessReg entity with information user entered as parameters. The result of succe ssful registration is issuing a memberID to the applicant, and then return to the storefront to login.

Within the Authorization entity, user can view all available products by accessing link of specific category. This invokes catalog entity to interact with database comdb to create table of products of current category dynamically. From this document, user can specify quantity of items, and then add items into shopping cart. Adding specific product to shopping cart invokes ShopCart entity to add products information into user session and return an documen t containing the contents of the cart, and subtotal of each product or press button link to ViewCart entity , which shows items in the user X  X  cart. At this stage, user can continue shopping (Cat egory entity) or proceed to check out (Order entity). In the latter case, the user is present ed with a form to input delivery information and credit-card information. Then the user submits the form to invoke ProcessOrder entity, which completes the transaction by sending a confirmation document to user, and order information will be added into orders table of comdb . In addition, user session will be cleared automatically. 6.2 Trust-Assurance Within EIComputer For the purpose of establishing trust with consumers, the EI Computer registered as-surance services provided by a third party called eTrust 4 like shown in Figure 3. The trust system of eTrust is also implemented as a distributed, three-tier, web based ap-plication. The management of EI Computer may provide evidence to eTrust either in paper format or electronic format to form an initial trust value. If the initial value can be accepted by both the merchant and eTrust (they assure the E-Retailers that meet their requirements), an agreement will become effective, and a use ID will be issued to EI Computer. During assuring, EI Computer can use the user ID and password to login, login information will be passed to eTrust authorization entity to validate user X  X  iden-tity through comparing the account table of trustdb . Since login successfully, user can check the current trust level and h istory records maintained by eTrust system, provide new evidences and recommend business partners as well. All these process are done by manipulating database, JSPs and serverlets .

When consumer makes request to view the trust level of EI Computer, it will call the requestTrust serverlet with authorized information of E -Retailer passed as parameters. Since authorization succeeds, need ed trust information will be found in trustdb ,anda trust level will be computed to be shown to consumer by showTrust entity. In this paper, we surveyed the E-Commerce activities currently under going in China. We have closely analyzed the gap between the informationization and barriers of Chi-nese E-Commerce systems. Among the topics of facilitating development of a positive, effective and satisfied E-Commerce system,  X  X rust X  is a major issue, which has not received adequate attention in past decades. We have proposed a computational trust model ( ERC 2 G ), which can foster a trust relati onship between consumers and mer-chants, and illustrate how to apply the model in a Chinese E-Commerce system. From the case study of EI Computer, we briefly talked about the implementation of E-Commerce systems with the consideration of enhancing trust. However, establishing trust must be a complex process, which involves more information sources, so continu-ous improving and enhancing the trustworthiness will be the main objective we need to achieve in future work.
