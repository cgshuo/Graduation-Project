 Web Usage Mining (WUM) applies data mining techniques to discover patterns from web server logs. WUM process is divided into three phases [2]: pre-processing, pat-tern discovery, and pattern analysis. The categorization of visitors X  behavior based on their interaction in a website is a key issue in WUM. Several works [1, 3, 5, 7] lever-age clustering techniques with the purpose of characterizing user behavior during navigation. The goals of session clustering can be roughly classified as usage and navigation . However, most clustering techniques do not consider the meaning in the application domain of accessed pages, in order to measure the similarity between web sessions. Page semantics is frequently consid ered in the pre-processing phase, in data enrichment tasks, in which URLs are mappe d into domain concepts [1, 3]. This ap-concept), to obtain better clustering results, often implies re-processing data. 
This paper presents Generalized Conceptual Session Clustering (GCSC) technique, which extends WLCS [1] in two ways: 1) it considers page similarity for session simi-larity computation, and 2) it deals with both usage and navigation clustering purposes. The goal is to improve the quality of resulting clusters and to ease their interpretation. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related work and Section 3 presents a review of WLCS algorithm [1]. Section 4 describes the GCSC approach. Preliminary experimental results are discussed in Section 5. Conclu-sions and future work are addressed in Section 6. Most works are concerned on how user sessi ons are represented according to the clus-tering objectives, and how session similarity is computed. Works such as [3, 7] are concerned with usage clustering , and hence represent web sessions as a set of (weighted) pages, disregarding their order of access. Navigation clustering is ad-represented in terms of visited pages, weight, order of access, and revisits. 
A critical issue in WUM is the semantic gap between events in the site, and their re-lated URL at server log. Semantic approaches conceptualize the application domain through a semantic model (i.e. taxonomy or ontology) which represents pages in terms of concepts and their relationships [8]. Works such as [1, 3] adopt a domain tax-onomy in the pre-processing phase to transform URLs into concepts. However, page similarity is not explicitly used during clustering, for session similarity computation. WLCS [1] establishes the similarity of sessions considering both the similarity of their overlap region weighted by the time spent, and the importance of this region within each session. User trajectory is defined as a n -length sequence ( j={1,...,n} ) of the session s i and () i tion by applying a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find the longest common path between any two sessions. Then, given a specific overlap for sessions s 1 length of overlap region, in order to retrieve the related page indices in each session. Then, considering the time spent on those pages, WLCS combines two measurement components: similarity and importance . The former computes how similar two ses-each session. The total session similarity is the product of similarity and importance . WLCS assumes total equality between pages in order to find the overlap region. Generalized Conceptual Session Clustering (GCSC) is a clustering approach that ex-tends WLCS in two aspects: a) it considers page similarity during the computation of session similarity, and b) it deals homogeneously with any clustering goals, as well as time and binary weights, by applying the proper post-processing operations over the input sessions. GCSC is based on a taxonomy representing domain events for address-ing the semantic gap between URLs and application events. GCSC assumes the fol-lowing pre-processing tasks over input log data:  X 
Log file is submitted to typical pre-processing tasks [2], and clustering-specific post-processing tasks [1, 3, 7].  X  A domain taxonomy exists, which reflects expert knowledge about the domain. 
Data enrichment activities map URLs into concepts of the domain hierarchy. 4.1 Session Representation and weight. We assume both time and binary weights. This session representation (Figure 1 A) obviously suits the navigation clustering objective. Hence, each index j session, including its revisits. The generalization proposed by GCSC with regard to session clustering purposes uses this same session representation for usage clustering, in which neither the order of visited concepts nor their revisits are relevant. Using ap-propriated pre-processing tasks, concepts are re-arranged in the session according to their proximity in the domain taxonomy to emulate a common usage sequence, as shown in Figure 1 (B). If time weights are used, they are added in case of revisits. 4.2 Page Similarity Measure This work leverages domain semantics, represented by the taxonomy, to compute the similarity between the concepts in terms of their location in the hierarchy. The adopted similarity function (Formula 1) is an adaptation of the GVSM (Generalized Vector-Space Model) [4] element similarity, where c 1 and c 2 are concepts in the hier-archy, LCA is the lowest common ancestor for c 1 and c 2 , and depth is the number of edges from the concept to the top of hierarchy. 4.3 Similarity-Based WLCS Another component of GCSC is SWLCS (Similarity-based WLCS), which extends WLCS by considering the similarity between concepts when computing the LCS be-tween sessions. The equality comparison of WLCS was replaced by a similarity com-parison (Formula 1) considering an additional input, namely similarity threshold . The similarity threshold allows defining the minimum similarity required in order to in-clude two different, but similar concepts in to the LCS. For example, consider the con-ceptual hierarchy of Figure 1 (C), sessions s 1 and s 2 of Figure 1 (B) and a similarity It should be noticed that the definition of a threshold value is not a simple task, since it is strongly dependent on depth of the hierarchy. This discussion is out of the scope of this paper scope. Given that any two sessions may have more than one LCS [1] and time spent in each page of the LCS is us ed to compute session similarity, SWLCS computes session similarity based on two LCS, yielding the highest similarity value. 
GSCS was implemented as operators in LogPrep [6], a customizable WUM pre-processing tool, which is organized in terms of pre-processing tasks. For each type of task, it provides one or more operators that implement some pre-processing technique. We extended LogPrep with a new task (clustering transformations) and two new op-erators that define respectively usage and navigation clustering goals, as well as weight types, together with some clustering-specific post-processing tasks of [6]. We leverage the distance education department domain of our university (PUCRS-Virtual) as case study. For a given web course, we developed a domain taxonomy that organizes 173 concepts through generalization relationships, which was validated by a domain expert of PUCRS-Virtual. Due to space limitation, the experiment discussed here compares WLCS and SWLCS algorithms for navigation clustering goal, consid-ering time weighted sessions. For this purpose, we created 11 hypothetical sessions (Table 2) out of real log data, where each session s i is composed of pairs of concept and weight, and concepts correspond to URLs mapped into the taxonomy. The mean time technique [7] was used to infer the time of the last access in each session. 
We run SWLCS over this data twice, with a similarity threshold of 0.7 and 1.0, the later to produce WLCS results. Then, resulting similarity matrixes were submitted to a graph-based clustering algorithm (http://www.users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/cluto). Comparing the clusters produced (Table 3), along with the intuitive meaning of do-main concepts, it is possible to state that SWLCS appropriately grouped s 1 and s 2 be-cause they have a common chat ancestor in their overlap region. Likewise, s 7 is Additionally, SWLCS enables to distinguish between visitors who browse general work tasks ( s 3 and s 4 ). Hence, it is possible to state that SWLCS revealed in this ex-periment more meaningful clusters with regard to the domain. Other experiments, not addressed in this paper due to space limitations, have displayed similar improvements. Notice that the same results could have be obtained by WLCS, if data enrichment tasks statically generalize concepts that are generalized dynamically by SWLCS. GCSC is a clustering approach that extends WLCS to consider page similarity, and for both navigation and usage clustering objectives. The main contribution is to lev-erage the advantages of the domain taxonomy for computing session similarity. Con-cept generalization is dynamical ly considered during session similarity computation, as opposed to static, data enrichment-based approaches. Preliminary results have shown encouraging results, but several issues need further experimentation: the ef-fects of concepts ordering in the usage sessions when computing LCS, bigger data WUM techniques to provide a learning mon itoring behavior for distance education, targeted at instructors. Future work incl udes cluster interpretation using the concep-tual representation of sessions, for both navigation and usage clusters.
