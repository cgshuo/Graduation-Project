The difference between BASE and SPLIT concerns the treatment of compounds. With regard to BASE, a
With an index generated by SPLIT, a user can employ the components of a compound as separate query lem of (in compounds) embedded query terms.

Koskenniemi (1983) . SWETWOL is meant to be used as a basic morphological tool in, e.g., information methods X  X ):  X  X &lt;metoderna&gt; X  X 
SWETWOL analyzes metoderna as a noun (N), with gender non-neuter (UTR), in definite form (DEF) plu-ral (PL), in nominative case (NOM), and with the base form metod ( X  X  X ethod X  X ).
When a compound is given as input to SWETWOL, it is split in the output. The cohort for pappersbruken ( X  X  X he paper-mills X  X ) is  X  X &lt;pappersbruken&gt; X  X  normalized to papper , which is then placed in the index.
 In this work, a word form is morphologically ambiguous if SWETWOL gives more than one reading for it. debate X  X ), with the following cohort:  X  X &lt;kulturdebatt&gt; X  X  ness. Given a compound as input to SWETWOL, relatively low precision may characterize the output, as themselves (and not their components in base form) are placed in the index. debates. If SPLIT is used, the following terms are placed in the index: about cultural debates. If BASE is used, only kulturdebatt is placed in the index. deciding which of the readings in the cohort that should be eliminated. The sole difference between SPLIT-EL and SPLIT is that SPLIT-EL makes use of the Compound Elimination Principle (ibid.):
This means that only the readings with a minimum number of compound boundaries are considered. The are eliminated and only the terms are taken to the index.

When local disambiguation was applied to the Helsinki Corpus of Swedish Texts increased from 42.7% to 48.1%. The maximal number of readings in a cohort decreased from 42 to 9. For word form types, which were assigned at least one reading, the proportion of unambiguous types was from cohorts (ibid.).

Terms that are not recognized by SWETWOL are preceded by the character  X  X  X  X  X  in the indices. This for BASE-base, SPLIT-base and SPLIT-EL-base, Section 3.3 ). 3.2.

It was decided to use the weighting scheme 0 X 1 X 1 X 1 for US1 and US2, the scheme 0 X 1 X 2 X 3 for US3.1 and for each of the schemes 0 X 1 X 1 X 1 and 0 X 1 X 10 X 100, we construct 52 new gain vectors for combination j by of the basic numerical data for evaluation of combination j .

The most extreme nDCG difference occurs at positions 90 and 100, where INFL-orig is below INFL-trunc by about 22% units. 4.1.2. User scenario 2

The data under the present scenario suggest that the performance categories 2 and 3 of US3.1 can be formance ( Fig. 4 ). We then obtain the following categorization: 1. INFL-trunc 2. BASE-base, SPLIT-base, SPLIT-EL-base 3.

User scenario 4.1
The three combinations BASE-base, SPLIT-base and SPLIT-EL-base have a very similar performance ( Fig. 5 ), and the following categorization is reasonable: 1. INFL-trunc 2.

INFL-orig combinations is 19.6% units, which is the most extreme nDCG difference under US4.1. when we move from US2 (impatient user, who values marginally, fairly and highly relevant documents bination, INFL-trunc, and the next best ones are in general greater under US4.1. 4.1.6.
