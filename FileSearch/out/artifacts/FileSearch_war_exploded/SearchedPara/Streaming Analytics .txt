 Recently we have seen emergence and huge adoption of social media, i nternet of things for home, industrial internet of things, mobile applications and online transactions. These systems generate streaming data at very large scale. Building technologies and distributed sy stems that can capture, process and analyze this streaming data in real time is very important for gaining real time insights. Real-time analysis of streaming data can be used for applications as diverse as fraud detection, in -session targeting and recomme ndations, control systems for transportation systems and smarter cities, earthquake prediction and control of autonomous vehicles.
 This tutorial will provide overview of streaming systems and hands on tutorial on building streaming analytics systems usin g open source technologies.
