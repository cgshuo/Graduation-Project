 With the rapid development of global networking through the network, the explosion users X  desired information is not an easy task. 
Document clustering is an important technology to solve the information overload problem [4,6]. But, document clustering is a complex job because different language promote Chinese information retrieval. In this paper, we propose new methods based on SOM (Self Organization Maps) [1,2,3] technique to solve Chinese document clus-tering problems. 
First, we gather Chinese news from several news documents websites and segment the sentences of the news documents into meaningful words. In order to overcome the shortcoming of traditional Chinese sentence segmentation process, we propose a new clustering process. Finally, we design a dynamical clustering process based on SOM technique to solve high dimensionality of clustering, and unpredicted cluster number efficiently. methods. Section 3 gives the experiments results. Section 4 contains conclusions and future works. 2.1 Chinese Sentence Segmentation We use the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing (CKIP) system that is devel-oped by ACADEMIA SINICA. CKIP system is a Chinese sentences segmentation system based on the thesaurus. For example, CKIP segments the sentence  X  overcome this drawback, we propose a compound words detection process that based on DHP algorithm [5]. Our compound words detection process contains four steps. shown in Fig. 1. Second, to find out all possible compound words of two terms from function and accumulate the number in the hash table as shown in Fig. 3. equation (1) to produce result don X  X  exceed the minimal confidence Step4. Generate all possible compound words as shown in Fig. 4. 2.2 Term Vector Generation and Dynamical Term Clustering Mode 2.2.1 Term Vector Generation We convert each term into a vector through three steps. and 1 to represent terms such as following example in Table 1. following measure as shown in equation (2). C (A, B)--Number of document simultaneously containing term A and term B C (A)+C (B)-C (A, B)--Total number of document containing term A or term B Step 3. Owing to three terms  X   X   X   X  and  X   X  have high similarity each term a unique number and calculate the address of each term by a hash function, as shown in Table 2. Then we accumulate the identification into the address as shown in Table 3. 2.2.2 Dynamical Term Clustering each cluster as shown in equation (3).

Second, our dynamical clustering method is trying to improve the quality of clus-tering by adding clusters step by step. The dynamical clustering method can be done second process is generating hierarchical structure. Process 1. Algorithm of growing clusters

Step2. Set next level with 2 clusters then restart the process of Growing clusters. 10% , the precision rate is highest. clustered into adjacent area We can improve the precision rate usefully and give the cluster result more meaning-And through SOM, the result is more readable for users. 
In the future, we should apply our system in more network services such as the per-sonal summary and the personal service.
