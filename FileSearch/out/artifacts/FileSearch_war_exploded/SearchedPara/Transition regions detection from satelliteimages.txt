In a satellite image, we generally observe that the transition from a homogeneous coverage (such as vegetation or bare soil) to any other shows up in a smooth way. This creates what we know as Transition way, but it does not appear as an abrupt linear change. Transition regions contain mixed pixels. Mixed pixels correspond to the spectral combination of more than one homogeneous coverage.

Transition regions shown in a remotely sensed image contain a large amount of ambiguity and un-certainty because of the presence of more than one land coverage. This uncertainty increases from the region of a remotely sensed image. previous example, we could say that a pixel from the transition region between forest and vegetation could be composed by 70% forest and 30% vegetation.

Determining the borderlines where transition regions start and end is a complex task. This happens because of the smooth change that mixed pixels show when moving from a coverage to the other. The borderline between a homogeneous coverage and a transition region (an area with a smooth change) contains mixed pixels that keep characteristics similar to the nearest neighbor coverage. This makes even harder finding the borderlines that delimitate the mixed pixels inside a transition region. ing the homogeneous coverage through a region growing segmentation technique. This technique allows us to control how the homogeneous region grows so that we only add those pixels containing one soil coverage. Once we located the homogeneous regions of the satellite image, we already isolated those pixels composed by more than one homogeneous coverage. A fundamental problem when we use region growing segmentation is the selection of seeds, which are used as initial points to emerge each homo-geneous coverage. As part of the contribution of this work, we present the automatic selection of seed pixels through cluster X  X  optimization using genetic algorithms.

Obtaining the borderlines that delimit homogeneous regions can be applied to different fields: changes the soil resource, monitoring of vegetation and fires, etc. These applications face a common problem, which consists of the temporal variation and dynamics of their undefined borders (borders that change tant doing research in the problem of identifying transition regions to solve, and have a more accurate control of those problems that may affect our natural resources. When we perform a hard classification using traditional methods, we add mixed pixels to an area that belongs to a homogeneous landcover. Consequently, this reduces the classification accuracy and does not reflect reality.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows the works related with the problem of transition regions. Section 3 describes the proposed method using regions growing segmentation. Section 4 presents our experiments and Section 5 conclusions and future work. 2. Related work bands) run through the soil coverage present in a satellite image.

Schiewe and Lowell modeled transition regions and described their uncertainties [8]. Their transition region X  X  model is based on the geometric and semantic model of the objects of the satellite image pro-posed by Galton and Lowell in [4]. The location of transition regions consists of the construction of transition ba nds that appear on each side of the soil coverage . The transition band width is obtained through a qualitative approach. This is a system that describes the intensity of human influence, which modeled through fuzzy sets using the concept of degrees of membership at different basic categories in to consider the uncertainty of transition regions and undetermined zones in both, the reference image which they draw transition regions through bands is a very geometrical defined way to do it. With geo-metrical, we mean that the transition region found by them is a polygon with constant amplitude, which except for manmade constructions. Second, they consider that the pixels inside a transition region keep the center of the transition region). This is a behavior difficult to find in a nature land cover. precisely, they introduce mixed pixels. This work consists of the implementation of a supervised clas-work is the construction of the FPM because of its dependency with the domain expert. The omission errors made by the domain expert can be translated to errors in the soft classification. Galton and Hood in [1] proposed an approach to deal with undetermined borderlines in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). They developed a structure that preserves imprecision or vagueness in the space is expressed through anchoring relations (the location of an undefined object with respect to the location of an object without forcing its identification with either a precise region in the embedding space or any precise mathematical construct from such regions, such as rough or fuzzy sets. The main representations for satellite image applications. When they describe geographic regions, they establish the nature of the relations between the  X  X nformation space X  (topological relations between regions) and what we call the  X  X recise space X  (exact coordinates). In this way, the proposed approach allows giving vagueness or imprecision to the reference regions using topological relations of precise data. The key idea is that  X  X n object in information space may be anchored to locations in precise space in different O is anchored over region R  X ,  X  X bject O is anchored outside region R  X , and  X  X bject O is anchored alongside region R  X . Topological relationships are used to relate vague areas with well-defined areas. A disadvantage of their method is that they do not determine the degree of vagueness or imprecision associated with the objects in a satellite image. They create borderlines around each region.
Fortin and colleagues in [14] present a study of boundary detection methods to find and characterize borders from the ecology point of view. Their work is based on the analysis of dynamical systems, and transition regions calle d  X  X cotones X . An ecotone is a transition zone between adja cent ecological systems. These systems have a set of unique characteristics defined by the time and space scales and the interaction force between the adjacent ecological systems. In their work, they present a summary of the common techniques used to detect transition zones. The first technique is based on limits. They use edge detection methods to identify borderlines. After that, they try to connect the discontinuous areas zone to the other. The second is that region growing segmentation techniques have two main problems: used as a stop criterion for the region growing algorithms is hard to tune.

Other proposed works related with transition regions are: fuzzy regions [10], fuzzy geographic ob-jects [13], fuzzy boundaries [5], and projecting land use transitions [17].

In this work, we introduce a new way to obtain transition regions using a region growing strategy. We perform a region growing segmentation step based on two elements: 1. Seed pixels. The initial pixels from which we generate regions. 2. Growing Threshold. This is a similarity measure that we use to compare a seed with other pixels
We obtain the values of these elements using genetic algorithms. 3. Proposed method
Mixed pixels belong to more than one land cover. Hence, when we classify them, there is ambiguity to determine the land cover to which they belong (ambiguity is defined as a type of uncertainty in the mixed pixel classification task). The ambiguity found in the mixed pixels that compose transition obtain transition regions through a region growing ba sed segmentation method. Using this segmentation technique, we identify the homogeneous areas that delimit the transition regions. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the TReDet method.

Figure 1 shows how the TReDet method works. It receives as input a satellite image. Then it starts a feature extraction phase obtaining three types of characteristics: 1. Features from the co-occurrence matrix. 2. Features using wavelets transforms. 3. Gray level features from the bands used to obtain a true color composition in the satellite image.
TReDet is mainly composed of two algorithms. The Region-Growing-Elements algorithm is used to obtain the growing seeds, thresholds, and the number of homogeneous coverages of the input image. We use a genetic algorithm to optimize these values. Finally, we use the output of the Region-Growing-Elements algorithm as input to the Obtaining-Transition-Regions algorithm in order to obtain the tran-sition regions found in the input image.

[Hom_cov, Seeds, Threshold] : = Region-Growing-Elements ( I , n, T_feat ); 4. Regions : = Region_Growing ( I, Hom_cov, Seeds, Threshold ); 5. Output: Segmented image by locating the transition regions. 3.1. Texture feature extraction
The use of the gray level scale representation of pixels for the segmentation task is simple to imple-ment. However, it does not always lead to good results. This happens because we do not consider neither combine both, texture and gray level features. In this way, given a satellite image, we extract texture features at the pixel level using three main approaches: a) We use a gray level co-occurrence matrix to calculate four texture features (energy, entropy, corre-b) We obtain ten energy features extracted with a three levels Wavelet transformation, [19]. c) We use the gray level of each pixel. We extract 15 features from each pixel. 3.2. Genetic segmentation method
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a widely used optimization tool because of its ability to perform a a set of virtual individuals (possible solutions), which are combined (through cross over and mutation for GAs to properly work are the following: a) The genes encoding the individual must be mapped according to the problem to solve. b) We are required to define a fitness function to evaluate the individuals. c) We need to establish a stop criterion to stop the process to search for solutions. Algorithm 2 calculates step 3 of Algorithm 1. Next we describe the steps of the proposed method.

Threshold : = Cluster_ordered [ n  X  1] ; 31. Output: Homogeneus landcovers, seeds, and threshold.

Next we describe the main steps of Algorithm 2. 3.2.1. Initialization
In steps 2 to 6 of Algorithm 2, we set the input parameters. These are the mutation percentage ( PM ), for these parameters are those recommended in different research works [11]. In step 7, we perform a watershed segmentation process from the original image, which obtains the initial regions. The genetic algorithm will group the initial regions into n groups. In step 8, it generates the initial population. The length of the individual chromosome corresponds to the total number of regions determined by the watershed segmentation. The coding of each individual consists of assigning a random cluster ( n ) number to each gene of the chromosome. For example , for a chromosome with 10 genes (corresponding analyzed), for each region numbered from 1 to 10, we assign an initial cluster number (the number of land cover to which such a region belongs). This is the chromosome code representation that we use as shown in Fig. 2 [11]. 3.2.2. Elements of the GA
The structure of our GA (fitness and crossover functions) is partially based on the work of Jiao et al. [11]. In that work, they present their image segmentation research based on memetic algorithms. The fitness function of each individual obtains the Euclidean distance (sum of square distances) from way and the rest by tournament. Crossover and Mutation complement the GA optimization process to obtain the best combination of individuals. The cross operation is performed by taking two individuals and making a cut to generate two new individuals. Mutation consists of randomly selecting a gene selected according to the number of generations selected by experimentation. We also take into account points (seeds) for the region growing process. 3.2.3. Homogeneous land covers
In step 25, we take the best individual obtained in the last generation of the genetic algorithm. This individual represents a segmented image in n clusters (or regions). Then, we calculate the variance of between our data and its mean. It is assumed that homogeneous land covers have lower variance than transition regions. Finally, we obtain homogeneous coverages from the first n -1 clusters. 3.2.4. Homogeneity threshold and seeds selection
We calculate the standard deviation of each homogeneous land cover. This parameter will be used as a each homogeneous land cover. These  X  k  X  pixels are used as seeds for our region growing segmentation process in Algorithm 1. The possibility of having more than one seed for each uniform land cover is important when there are more than two isolated land covers of the same type in the original image. 3.3. Region growing and transition regions
The segmentation process consists of separating the satellite image into meaningful units in order to recognize the land covers in the image. At this stage, we determine the homogeneous land covers (i.e. carry out the satellite image segmentation, we selected the region growing segmentation technique. This a region. In this sense, Algorithm 2 identifies the homogeneous land cover as well as seeds for each of these land covers. The growth of the region with similar pixels is done by adding pixels to it up to the standard deviation for each of the homogeneous coverages obtained. It has been assumed that a homogeneous coverage is composed of those pixels that are found inside the first standard deviation in the feature space used [12]. Homogeneous land covers delimit the mixed pixels contained in transition 4. Experiments
For the experiments, we used a Quick Bird satellite image of the zone of Puebla, Mexico. We analyzed We used band 3 to extract the energy features (Wavelets) and the co-occurrence matrix. The three RGB the mixed pixels of the transition region. In these figures, we show the limits between the homogeneous coverages and the transition region). Figure 3(a) shows the original sub-image in an RGB composition. for the segmentation process based on region growing. Figure 3(c) shows the location of the transition region generated by these two land covers.

Figure 4 shows a second example of how our method obtains transition regions. 5. Validation of the transition regions
This section quantitatively evaluates the limits of the transition region obtained through the region growing segmentation method. The evaluation is performed using synthetic images created from areas of actual land covers. The creation of synthetic images is very useful to determine the quality of the proposed method. The size of our synthetic images is of 100  X  150 pixels. We reduce the segmented image to a size of 85  X  135 due to the texture feature extraction technique that we use with windows of 16  X  16 pixels.
 To construct a synthetic image, we perform the following steps.

We create a mask to determine the shape of the desired transition region as shown in Fig. 5(a). The white areas represent the homogeneous land cover. The black area represents the transition region (the mixed pixel area).

We fill the regions identified in Fig. 5(a) with land cover pixels taken from the Quickbird satellite image. Thus, we create the synthetic image of Fig. 5(b) with three types of land cover. These are homo-one containing the combination of the two homogeneous land covers.

From the synthetic image, Fig. 5(b), we apply the proposed method to find the transition region. Ad-ages. Figure 6 shows these results for each of the compared methods: 1. Idrisi Taiga. This software uses a watershed delineation approach that partitions the input images 2. eCognition. Its core algorithm uses segmentation to create image objects. It uses a multi-resolution 3. TReDet. Our algorithm is based on region growing segmentation to detect the transition regions X  4. EDISON. This program implements an edge detection algorithm based on gradient rank-5. Matlab. We use the Matlab edge function to detect boundaries. The edge function uses a method
If we perform a qualitative analysis of the comparison from the results obtained in Fig. 6, we can observe that the TReDet algorithm obtains the transition region more accurately for the land covers region is better delimited with TReDet (see Fig. 6(d)) with respect to those obtained with the other methods.

In order to obtain the boundaries of the transition region using commercial software we used super-vised techniques. That is, we had the help of a domain expert in order to eliminate erroneous borders generated by the commercial software. In the case of the TReDet algorithm, the transition region bound-aries are found automatically.
 Neubert and colleagues [15] performed an analysis to evaluate the quality of the segmented images. This research mainly addresses remotely sensed images. In their work, they summarize a set of com-mercial programs focused to borders detection. In this work, we use some of those measures. They also present an analysis of the metrics to evaluate the quality of the segmented regions. In our work, we also use some of them in order to perform a quantitative comparison with commercial software and the TReDet algorithm. The metrics used in our work are shown in Eqs (1) to (4). 1. % Area difference: 2. % Perimeter difference: 3. % Shape index:
In order to validate the transition regions, we performed ten experiments using synthetic images with land covers contained in the synthetic image. Table 1 shows the averaged results of this quantitative analysis.

From Table 1, we can see that TreDet obtains better results in the area, perimeter difference, and visual quality. However, Matlab obtains better resu lts for the shape index. However, we should keep in mind that TReDet automatically finds the transition region boundaries, while the other algorithms are 6. Conclusions and future work
This paper presented a promising alternative for the identification of transition regions in satellite images using an evolutionary region growing segmentation process. Segmentation based on a growing region technique allows us to control (at the pixel level) the generation of homogeneous regions. This is very important because it allows homogeneous land covers to delimit the transition region and in-sition region or vice versa). Besides, the TReDet algorithm performs a more realistic detection of the segmentation step for the regions growing phase are obtained through a cluster optimization technique using genetic algorithms. The seed pixels corresponding to each homogeneous land cover are obtained using the feature space. To validate the results of the segmentation approach, we implemented an algo-rithm to create synthetic images. This was done in order to know with a high degree of certainty the number and location of each pixel in the synthetic image. In a comparison of the TReDet algorithm with commercial software, TReDet clearly outperformed them in three measures: area percentage, perimeter regions composed of mixed pixels (with two land coverages). In our future work, we will determine the proportion of each land cover for each pixel inside the transition region. We preview that depending on pixel.
