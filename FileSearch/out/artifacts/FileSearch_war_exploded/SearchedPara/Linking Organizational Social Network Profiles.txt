 Many organizations possess social media accounts on different so-cial networks, but these profiles are not always linked. End appli-cations, users, as well as the organization themselves, can bene-fit when the profiles are appropriately identified and linked. Most existing works on social network entity linking focus on linking individuals, and do not model features specific for organizational linking. We address this gap not only to link official social media accounts but also to discover and solve the identification and link-ing of associated affiliate accounts  X  such as geographical divisions and brands  X  which are important to distinguish.

We instantiate our method for classifying profiles on social net-work services for Twitter and Facebook, which major organizations use. We classify profiles as to whether they belong to an organiza-tion or its affiliates. Our best classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.976 on average in both datasets, significantly improving base-lines that exploit the features used in state-of-the-art comparable user linkage strategies.

With the pervasiveness of social network services (SNSs), orga-nizations also leverage them to reach out to and keep tabs on their fans and potential customers. However, unlike individual users, or-ganizations usually maintain multiple profiles, even within a single SNS, to distribute targeted messages. This kind of intra-network profiles often represent affiliates  X  entities such as brands or geo-graphical divisions which are part of the organization but is not the Figure 1: Google X  X  manual organization profile linkage for  X  X oeing X  in search results (captured May 2015). whole organization. An important task for both users and organi-zations is to automatically identify such profiles and link them to get a holistic social media profile of an organization, but to the best of our knowledge, up to now, this problem has been completely ignored by the community.

Individual users do follow organizations through these profiles to stay informed of their products, events and developments. How-ever, they do not have ways to easily identify all such profiles that belong to these organizations. Search engines of most SNSs cur-rently do not distinguish between individual user profiles and orga-nizational ones. While some Web search engines do provide links to profiles in their search results, these links still rely on manual effort by the organization ( i.e. , Google requires organizations to in-clude specific markup in their Web page 1 ; Figure 1). As such, one may think that the organization itself should be responsible to link their SNS account on their websites. Our experience shows that this is not always the case, possibly due to challenges in organi-zational knowledge management or ignorance. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, services that aggregate locations where we can find such comprehensive links do not currently exist: we can iden-tify only an organization X  X  main profile on the most popular SNS, but not identify its affiliate profiles.

Organizations would benefit from automatic profile linkage to help monitor their competitors X  profiles and activities  X  a fact that has been proven by the existence of nascent start-ups 2 . In addi-tion, organizations also face the problem of tracking and policing attempts by others to impersonate them or infringe upon their trade-marks. For instance, Jetstar Airways fell victim to impersonation, with a  X  X etstar Australia X  profile created on Facebook. This is used to insult customers who mistakenly provided malicious feedback through it 3 .
To solve these problems, it is important to identify an organiza-tion X  X  social networking profiles on a specific network. We address this task by defining three categories of profiles related to a given organization: Official. Profiles that represent the organization as a whole. For Affiliate. Profiles that represent one of the organization X  X  brands, Unrelated. These profiles are not run by the organization in ques-The contributions in our work are: 1) An implemented, automated system to perform organization profile linkage on social networks  X  given an organization X  X  name as a query, it first searches for pro-file candidates from the target social networks, then constructs a model by using supervised learning to classify each candidate into Official , Affiliate , or Unrelated for the query; 2) The creation of a publicly available dataset that consists of 6,784 profiles from about 220 real-world organizations across Twitter and Facebook, where the profiles are manually classified into the above three categories.
The name fields of a profile have been shown to be of high im-portance in linking users. Two kinds of proposed linkage methods rely on usernames: either through generating candidate usernames to match with [7], or by examining behavioural patterns that in-fluence the way usernames are created [8]. Another study found that the user and display names are the  X  X ost discriminative fea-tures X  [3] when disambiguating profiles.

Several works have examined user activities to identify a pro-file X  X  holder. These focused on using profile data and the content created by the user [1], or combining the information with other metadata ( e.g., location or time [2]). Their findings are helpful for our work as organizations often  X  X ross-post X  the same (or similar) material across different social networks.

Works have addressed social network profiles in the context of security  X  re-identification for anonymized social networks [4], spam bot detection [6], malicious profile detection [5]  X  but these are be-yond the scope of our current review due to space considerations.
The aforementioned studies have identified profiles on social net-works, to the best of our knowledge, they have all focused on pro-files belonging to individual users and do not consider the specific properties of organization profiles, and are thus insufficient for link-ing organizations. For example, organizations often use an abbre-viated form of their names online ( e.g., General Motors uses just  X  X M X ), and their names often contain some common words such as  X  X ompany X  or  X  X orporation. X  To accurately link organization profiles, it is necessary to take these properties into account.
We adopt supervised learning to classify organization names into the three categories previously defined. We extract 14 features that belong to the following four broad feature sets, annotating novel, specific features we introduce for this organization linkage prob-lem with an asterisk (*):
Baseline Features (BL). These features examine the relation-ship between the target organization X  X  name (hereafter,  X  X uery X ), and the two name fields on a profile: the handle and the display names. The handle name is sometimes known as a username, and is a unique identifier that represents the profile on the social net-work. On the other hand, the display name is a free-text string that provides a more user-friendly name, but is not unique. For ex-ample, on General Motors X  Twitter profile 4 , the username is GM while the display name is General Motors . We adopt the following as baseline features: Normalized edit distance (NED) gives a relative measure of simi-larity accounting for their lengths. Let ED ( s 1 , s 2 ) be edit distance between two strings s 1 and s 2 . Then, normalized edit distance N ED ( s 1 , s 2 ) between them is defined as follows: where len ( s i ) denotes the length of string s i ( i = 1 , 2) .
In these features, we first process the query to generate a sim-ple abbreviation and remove stop words ( e.g.,  X  X ompany, X   X  X or-poration, X  and so on) defined for this task before calculating the edit distances between both the processed string and the original query. These features best simulate how a human would approach this problem.
 Name-based Features (N). Name string lengths are also useful. We term these as name-based features:
Description-based Features (D). These features are based on the description field of the organization X  X  profile. Besides the rela-tionship between the description and query, we further searched for the organization X  X  description from DuckDuckGo 5 , a search engine that provides the results from sources such as Wikipedia.
The first two features give measures of the extent to which the profile X  X  description is relevant to the organization X  X  name. The third yields a similarity score between the profile X  X  description and organization descriptions provided by the DuckDuckGo general search engine, which we deem as a more general, third-party de-scription. Note that this feature requires an external API call.
Content-based Features (C). Posted content is also evidence for linkage. We construct two bigram language models for each category X  X  training data (Official, Affiliate, or Unrelated): one from the profile descriptions in the target class, and the other from the textual content of recent 20 posts by the target profiles. We use add-one smoothing as a simple mechanism to address zero occurring bigrams in the query. This process yields six models in total that capture writing style differences:
We first construct the dataset for our experiments. We search for organization names which are listed on Freebase 6 as having at least one social network presence, and then submit the each organization name as a query to Twitter and Facebook. Finally, we manually la-bel the profiles that Twitter and Facebook return. We obtain 3,381 profiles from 228 organizations and 3,403 profiles from 216 or-ganizations on Twitter and Facebook, respectively (Table 1 shows relevant statistics). Note that the number of organizations included in each dataset differs from the number of official profiles that we found, as some organizations either lack an official profile or have more than one. To encourage the community to work on this impor-tant and understudied research work on social networks, we have made our entire dataset publicly available 7 .

To study linkage performance across classification methods, we employ several different classifiers, namely: Bernoulli na X ve Bayes (BNB), Gaussian na X ve Bayes (GNB), decision tree (DT), logis-tic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum entropy (ME), all which are implemented in scikit-learn 8 . We perform 10-fold cross validation, evaluating each classifier with their accuracy on the official and affiliate classes.
We compare the accuracies of classifiers constructed by combin-ing  X  X aseline (BL), X   X  X ame-based (N), X   X  X escription-based (D), X  and  X  X ontent-based (C) X  features described earlier (Table 2) . In user identification works across SNSs, Iofciu et al. [1] reported that longest common subsequence-based distance is an effective feature in their  X  X ser maching based on username X  experiments. In a related vein, Zafarani and Liu [8] disclosed their top 10 most important features, most of which are length-based ones. We also compare our classifiers with those constructed using the features from both [1] and [8].
In this section, we refer to  X  X witter (Official), X   X  X witter (Affil-iate), X   X  X acebook (Official), X   X  X acebook (Affiliate) X  as  X  X W-Off, X   X  X W-Aff, X   X  X B-Off, X   X  X B-Aff, X  respectively.
 Classification Accuracies. In both Twitter and Facebook datasets, DT, LR, RF, SVM, and ME achieve accuracies over 0.7 in almost all feature sets (Table 2). Na X ve Bayes in both forms (BNB and GNB) yields lower accuracies (only about 0.2 to 0.7), especially in the Affiliate category, even when adding more features.

Among the classifiers, Random Forest (RF) achieves the best in both Twitter and Facebook datasets (0.983, 0.973, 0.972, 0.977 in TW-Off, TW-Aff, FB-Off, FB-Aff, respectively). RF is an ensem-ble approach, taking an average of multiple decision trees X  deci-sions, which are separately trained on different parts of the same training set, to reduce overfitting. While this step slightly increases the bias of the forest, it decreases its variance. This framework of RF works well for our task as each of our features tends to have large variance.

With respect to features, we observe that using all features yields the best accuracy in each classifier, and also outperforms the accu-racies obtained by the features used in [1] and [8] with statistical significance. This indicates that our ALL feature set is more effec-tive than longest common subsequence-based distance in [1] and length-based features in [8].

With respect to individual feature contributions, we further study the improvement when adding N, D, or C feature set to the baseline (Table 3). We observe higher improvement rate on affiliate pro-files in both Twitter and Facebook datasets (N: 15.02%, D: 7.57%, C:16.49% in TW-Aff and N: 7.61%, D: 4.54%, C:22.88% in FB-Aff). Among the feature sets, C is the most effective feature set to distinguish official and affiliate profiles (9.56%, 16.49%, 7.49%, 22.88% in TW-Off, TW-Aff, FB-Off, and FB-Aff, respectively). This indicates that content information extracted from profile de-scription and recent posts do contain useful signal that can help distinguish organizational names. Although acquiring such data can be expensive, our experiments validates its significant impact on the linkage accuracy.

Linking Affiliates. The existence of affiliate profiles is a dis-tinguishing characteristic of our problem, differentiating it from general linkage of individual profiles, or even linking official pro-files alone. Both individuals and official profiles have names which are generally close to that of their holder, and as such linkage of affiliates would be expected to be more difficult. However, RF, ME, and SVM classifiers all prove to be good and equally adept at detecting both official and affiliate profiles, countering this intu-ition. Investigating this more fully reveals that this actually does not hold with certain subclasses of affiliate profiles  X  while geo-graphic affiliates do tend to contain their parent company X  X  name with a location as a suffix as their profile name ( e.g.,  X  X icrosoft Asia X ), brand names often have little in common ( e.g.,  X  X enovo X  and  X  X hinkPad X ). Hence, the use of the parent company name for these brand profiles is insufficient to identify them as belonging to the organization; additional information is required. These classi-fiers, with the equipped features from our study, still significantly outperform the baseline and comparative methods.

Network Idiosyncrasies. On Twitter, all users are given the same type of profiles regardless of whether they are a person or an organization. On the other hand, Facebook has multiple pro-file types including Pages , which are designed for  X  X rtists, public figures, businesses, brands, organizations, and non-profits
We considered only Pages here, effectively resulting in a level of filtering provided by Facebook which Twitter does not have. Pages with handle and display names similar to those of an organization name are likely to belong to the organization.
 However, this observation is not the case with affiliate profiles on Facebook. Facebook does not require pages that specify a unique handle name; in this scenario, we instead treat the page X  X  numeri-cal ID as its handle name. This substitution greatly impacts on the normalized edit distance scores in BL. It is sometimes the case that an affiliate profile does not have a specific handle name  X  for in-stance, Netflix uses  X  X etflix X  as its official profile X  X  handle name but does not provide one for its Latin American affiliate
In addition, Facebook also generates  X  X opic pages X  from Wikipedia articles, giving them a display name from the title of that article but no handle name. For example, a page exists for Samsung which has just  X  X amsung X  as its display name 12 . We consider these pages to Table 3: Improvement rate by adding N, D, or C feature set to baseline features (BL).
 be unrelated. However, they have a similar edit distance as legiti-mate affiliate profiles. This makes it difficult to distinguish an affil-iate profile on Facebook using just the handle and display names.
As we go forward, it is likely that other social networks will exhibit their own unique set of quirks, which will similarly pose challenges to linking profiles on them. We recommend that the reader be mindful of these idiosyncrasies when adapting our work for linkage with other SNSs.
We have proposed an approach to organizational social profile linkage. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been tackled before in the literature, but is a problem of growing impor-tance given the amount of influence that social media plays in lives today. A key difference in organization linkage is the presence of affiliates  X  both geographic and brand  X  that change the nature of the problem.

While previous efforts have done linkage through manual means, our automated approach finds that profile description and posted content are the most effective features for detecting linkage. In future work, we plan to leverage unique characteristics of the dif-ferent types of affiliate accounts to achieve better classification ac-curacy. This will allow us to infer affiliate structure (with respect to the parent company), as well as to expand our work to include other social networks. [1] T. Iofciu, P. Fankhauser, F. Abel, and K.
