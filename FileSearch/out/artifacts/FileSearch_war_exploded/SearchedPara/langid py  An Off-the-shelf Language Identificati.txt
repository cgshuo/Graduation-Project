 Language identification (LangID) is the task of de-termining the natural language that a document is written in. It is a key step in automatic processing of real-world data, where a multitude of languages may be present. Natural language processing tech-niques typically pre-suppose that all documents be-ing processed are written in a given language (e.g. English), but as focus shifts onto processing docu-ments from internet sources such as microblogging services, this becomes increasingly difficult to guar-antee. Language identification is also a key compo-nent of many web services. For example, the lan-guage that a web page is written in is an important consideration in determining whether it is likely to be of interest to a particular user of a search engine, and automatic identification is an essential step in building language corpora from the web. It has prac-tical implications for social networking and social media, where it may be desirable to organize com-ments and other user-generated content by language. It also has implications for accessibility, since it en-ables automatic determination of the target language for automatic machine translation purposes.

Many applications could potentially benefit from automatic language identification, but building a customized solution per-application is prohibitively expensive, especially if human annotation is re-quired to produce a corpus of language-labelled training documents from the application domain. What is required is thus a generic language identi-fication tool that is usable off-the-shelf , i.e. with no end-user training and minimal configuration.
In this paper, we present langid.py , a LangID tool with the following characteristics: (1) fast, (2) usable off-the-shelf, (3) unaffected by domain-specific features (e.g. HTML, XML, markdown), (4) single file with minimal dependencies, and (5) flexible interface langid.py is trained over a naive Bayes clas-sifier with a multinomial event model (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), over a mixture of byte (1  X  n  X  4). One key difference from conventional text categorization solutions is that langid.py was designed to be used off-the-shelf . Since langid.py implements a supervised classifier, this presents two primary challenges: (1) a pre-trained model must be distributed with the classi-fier, and (2) the model must generalize to data from different domains , meaning that in its default con-figuration, it must have good accuracy over inputs as diverse as web pages, newspaper articles and mi-croblog messages. (1) is mostly a practical consid-eration, and so we will address it in Section 3. In order to address (2), we integrate information about the language identification task from a variety of do-mains by using LD feature selection (Lui and Bald-win, 2011).

Lui and Baldwin (2011) showed that it is rela-tively easy to attain high accuracy for language iden-tification in a traditional text categorization setting, where we have in-domain training data. The task be-comes much harder when trying to perform domain adaptation , that is, trying to use model parameters learned in one domain to classify data from a dif-ferent domain. LD feature selection addresses this problem by focusing on key features that are relevant to the language identification task. It is based on In-formation Gain (IG), originally introduced as a split-ting criteria for decision trees (Quinlan, 1986), and later shown to be effective for feature selection in text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997; For-man, 2003). LD represents the difference in IG with respect to language and domain. Features with a high LD score are informative about language with-out being informative about domain. For practi-cal reasons, before the IG calculation the candidate feature set is pruned by means of a term-frequency based feature selection.

Lui and Baldwin (2011) presented empirical evi-dence that LD feature selection was effective for do-main adaptation in language identification. This re-sult is further supported by our evaluation, presented in Section 5. The full langid.py package consists of the language identifier langid.py , as well as two support modules LDfeatureselect.py and train.py . langid.py is the single file which packages the language identification tool, and the only file needed to use langid.py for off-the-shelf language iden-tification. It comes with an embedded model which covers 97 languages using training data drawn from 5 domains. Tokenization and feature selection are carried out in a single pass over the input document via Aho-Corasick string matching (Aho and Cora-sick, 1975). The Aho-Corasick string matching al-gorithm processes an input by means of a determin-istic finite automaton (DFA). Some states of the au-tomaton are associated with the completion of one of the tion. Thus, we can obtain our document represen-tation by simply counting the number of times the DFA enters particular states while processing our in-put. The DFA and the associated mapping from state to n and embedded as part of the pre-trained model.
The naive Bayes classifier is implemented using numpy , 1 the de-facto numerical computation pack-age for Python. numpy is free and open source, and available for all major platforms. Using numpy in-troduces a dependency on a library that is not in the Python standard library. This is a reasonable trade-off, as numpy provides us with an optimized im-plementation of matrix operations, which allows us to implement fast naive Bayes classification while maintaining the single-file concept of langid.py . langid.py can be used in the three ways: Command-line tool: langid.py supports an interactive mode with a text prompt and line-by-line classification. This mode is suitable for quick in-teractive queries, as well as for demonstration pur-poses. langid.py also supports language identi-fication of entire files via redirection. This allows a user to interactively explore data, as well as to inte-grate language identification into a pipeline of other unix -style tools. However, use via redirection is not recommended for large quantities of documents as each invocation requires the trained model to be unpacked into memory. Where large quantities of documents are being processed, use as a library or web service is preferred as the model will only be unpacked once upon initialization.
 Python library: langid.py can be imported as a Python module, and provides a function that ac-cepts text and returns the identified language of the text. This use of langid.py is the fastest in a single-processor setting as it incurs the least over-head.
 Web service: langid.py can be started as a web service with a command-line switch. This allows language identitication by means of HTTP PUT and HTTP POST requests, which return JSON-encoded responses. This is the preferred method of using langid.py from other programming envi-ronments, as most languages include libraries for in-teracting with web services over HTTP. It also al-lows the language identification service to be run as a network/internet service. Finally, langid.py is compliant web server. This provides an easy way to achieve parallelism by leveraging existing technolo-gies to manage load balancing and utilize multiple processors in the handling of multiple concurrent re-quests for a service.

LDfeatureselect.py implements the LD feature selection. The calculation of term frequency is done in constant memory by index inversion through a MapReduce-style sharding approach. The calculation of information gain is also chunked to limit peak memory use, and furthermore it is paral-lelized to make full use of modern multiprocessor systems. LDfeatureselect.py produces a list of byte train.py implements estimation of parameters for the multinomial naive Bayes model, as well as the construction of the DFA for the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm. Its input is a list of byte patterns representing a feature set (such as that se-lected via LDfeatureselect.py ), and a corpus of training documents. It produces the final model as a single compressed, encoded string, which can be saved to an external file and used by langid.py via a command-line option. langid.py is distributed with an embedded model trained using the multi-domain language identification corpus of Lui and Baldwin (2011). This corpus contains documents in a total of 97 lan-guages. The data is drawn from 5 different do-mains: government documents, software documen-tation, newswire, online encyclopedia and an inter-net crawl, though no domain covers the full set of languages by itself, and some languages are present only in a single domain. More details about this cor-pus are given in Lui and Baldwin (2011).
We do not perform explicit encoding detection, but we do not assume that all the data is in the same encoding. Previous research has shown that explicit encoding detection is not needed for language iden-tification (Baldwin and Lui, 2010). Our training data consists mostly of UTF8-encoded documents, but some of our evaluation datasets contain a mixture of encodings. In order to benchmark langid.py , we carried out an empirical evaluation using a number of language-labelled datasets. We compare the empirical results obtained from langid.py to those obtained from other language identification toolkits which incor-porate a pre-trained model, and are thus usable off-the-shelf for language identification. These tools are listed in Table 3. 5.1 Off-the-shelf LangID tools TextCat is an implementation of the method of Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) by Gertjan van Noord. It has traditionally been the de facto LangID tool of choice in research, and is the basis of language iden-tification/filtering in the ClueWeb09 Dataset (Callan and Hoy, 2009) and CorpusBuilder (Ghani et al., 2004). It includes support for training with user-supplied data.

LangDetect implements a Naive Bayes classi-fier, using a character without feature selection, with a set of normaliza-tion heuristics to improve accuracy. It is trained on supplied data.

CLD is a port of the embedded language identi-fier in Google X  X  Chromium browser, maintained by Mike McCandless. Not much is known about the internal design of the tool, and there is no support provided for re-training it.

The datasets come from a variety of domains, such as newswire (TCL), biomedical corpora (EMEA), government documents (E URO GOV, E U -RO PARL) and microblog services (T-BE, T-SC). A number of these datasets have been previously used in language identification research. We provide a brief summary of the characteristics of each dataset in Table 1.

The datasets we use for evaluation are differ-ent from and independent of the datasets from which the embedded model of langid.py was produced. In Table 2, we report the accuracy of each tool, measured as the proportion of documents from each dataset that are correctly classified. We present the absolute accuracy and performance for langid.py , and relative accuracy and slowdown for the other systems. For this experiment, we used a machine with 2 Intel Xeon E5540 processors and 24GB of RAM. We only utilized a single core, as none of the language identification tools tested are inherently multicore. 5.2 Comparison on standard datasets We compared the four systems on datasets used in previous language identification research (Baldwin and Lui, 2010) (E URO GOV, TCL, W IKIPEDIA ), as well as an extract from a biomedical parallel cor-pus (Tiedemann, 2009) (EMEA) and a corpus of samples from the Europarl Parallel Corpus (Koehn, 2005) (E URO PARL). The sample of E URO PARL we use was originally prepared by Shuyo Nakatani (author of LangDetect ) as a validation set. langid.py compares very favorably with other language identification tools. It outperforms TextCat in terms of speed and accuracy on all of the datasets considered. langid.py is generally orders of magnitude faster than TextCat , but this advantage is reduced on larger documents. This is primarily due to the design of TextCat , which re-quires that the supplied models be read from file for each document classified. langid.py generally outperforms LangDetect , except in datasets derived from government documents (E URO GOV, E URO PARL). However, the difference in accuracy between langid.py and LangDetect on such datasets is very small, and langid.py is generally faster. An abnormal result was obtained when testing LangDetect on the EMEA corpus. Here, LangDetect is much faster, but has extremely poor accuracy (0.114). Analysis of the results re-veals that the majority of documents were classified as Polish. We suspect that this is due to the early termination criteria employed by LangDetect , together with specific characteristics of the corpus. TextCat also performed very poorly on this corpus (accuracy 0.362). However, it is important to note that langid.py and CLD both performed very well, providing evidence that it is possible to build a generic language identifier that is insensitive to domain-specific characteristics. langid.py also compares well with CLD . It is generally more accurate, although CLD does bet-ter on the EMEA corpus. This may reveal some insight into the design of CLD , which is likely to have been tuned for language identification of web pages. The EMEA corpus is heavy in XML markup, which CLD and langid.py both successfully ig-nore. One area where CLD outperforms all other sys-tems is in its speed. However, this increase in speed comes at the cost of decreased accuracy in other do-mains, as we will see in Section 5.3. 5.3 Comparison on microblog messages The size of the input text is known to play a sig-nificant role in the accuracy of automatic language identification, with accuracy decreasing on shorter input documents (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994; Sibun and Reynar, 1996; Baldwin and Lui, 2010).

Recently, language identification of short strings has generated interest in the research community. Hammarstrom (2007) described a method that aug-mented a dictionary with an affix table, and tested it over synthetic data derived from a parallel bible cor-pus. Ceylan and Kim (2009) compared a number of methods for identifying the language of search en-gine queries of 2 to 3 words. They develop a method which uses a decision tree to integrate outputs from several different language identification approaches. Vatanen et al. (2010) focus on messages of 5 X 21 characters, using drawn from UDHR in a naive Bayes classifier.
A recent application where language identifica-tion is an open issue is over the rapidly-increasing volume of data being generated by social media. post short text messages. Twitter has a worldwide user base, evidenced by the large array of languages present on Twitter (Carter et al., to appear). It is es-timated that half the messages on Twitter are not in
This new domain presents a significant challenge for automatic language identification, due to the much shorter  X  X ocuments X  to be classified, and is compounded by the lack of language-labelled in-domain data for training and validation. This has led to recent research focused specifically on the task of language identification of Twitter messages. Carter et al. (to appear) improve language identification in Twitter messages by augmenting standard methods with language identification priors based on a user X  X  previous messages and by the content of links em-bedded in messages. Tromp and Pechenizkiy (2011) present a method for language identification of short text messages by means of a graph structure.
Despite the recently published results on language identification of microblog messages, there is no dedicated off-the-shelf system to perform the task. We thus examine the accuracy and performance of using generic language identification tools to iden-tify the language of microblog messages. It is im-portant to note that none of the systems we test have been specifically tuned for the microblog domain. Furthermore, they do not make use of any non-textual information such as author and link-based priors (Carter et al., to appear).

We make use of two datasets of Twitter messages kindly provided to us by other researchers. The first is T-BE (Tromp and Pechenizkiy, 2011), which con-tains 9659 messages in 6 European languages. The second is T-SC (Carter et al., to appear), which con-tains 5000 messages in 5 European languages.
We find that over both datasets, langid.py has better accuracy than any of the other systems tested. On T-BE, Tromp and Pechenizkiy (2011) report accuracy between 0.92 and 0.98 depending on the parametrization of their system, which was tuned specifically for classifying short text messages. In its off-the-shelf configuration, langid.py attains an accuracy of 0.94, making it competitive with the customized solution of Tromp and Pechenizkiy (2011).

On T-SC, Carter et al. (to appear) report over-all accuracy of 0.90 for TextCat in the off-the-shelf configuration, and up to 0.92 after the inclusion of priors based on (domain-specific) extra-textual information. In our experiments, the accuracy of TextCat is much lower (0.654). This is because Carter et al. (to appear) constrained TextCat to output only the set of 5 languages they considered. Our results show that it is possible for a generic lan-guage identification tool to attain reasonably high accuracy (0.89) without artificially constraining the set of languages to be considered, which corre-sponds more closely to the demands of automatic language identification to real-world data sources, where there is generally no prior knowledge of the languages present.
We also observe that while CLD is still the fastest classifier, this has come at the cost of accuracy in an alternative domain such as Twitter messages, where both langid.py and LangDetect attain better accuracy than CLD .
 An interesting point of comparison between the Twitter datasets is how the accuracy of all systems is generally higher on T-BE than on T-SC, despite them covering essentially the same languages (T-BE includes Italian, whereas T-SC does not). This is likely to be because the T-BE dataset was produced using a semi-automatic method which involved a language identification step using the method of Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) (E Tromp, personal com-munication, July 6 2011). This may also explain why TextCat , which is also based on Cavnar and Trenkle X  X  work, has unusually high accuracy on this dataset. In this paper, we presented langid.py , an off-the-shelf language identification solution. We demon-strated the robustness of the tool over a range of test corpora of both long and short documents (including micro-blogs).
