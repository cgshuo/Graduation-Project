 Identifying the correct real-world referents of named entities (NE) mentioned in text (such as people, or-ganizations, and geographic locations) plays an im-portant role in various natural language processing and information retrieval tasks. The goal of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) is to label a surface form denoting an NE in text with one of multiple predefined NEs from a knowledge base (KB), or to detect that the surface form refers to an out-of-KB entity, which is known as NIL detection. NED has become a popular research field recently, as the growth of large-scale publicly available encyclo-pedic knowledge resources such as Wikipedia has stimulated research on linking NEs in text to their entries in these KBs (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Mc-Namee and Dang, 2009).

The disambiguation of named entities raises sev-eral challenges: Surface forms in text can be am-biguous, and the same entity can be referred to by different surface forms. For example, the surface form  X  X eorge Bush X  may denote either of two for-mer U.S. presidents, and the later president can be referred to by  X  X eorge W. Bush X  or with his nick-name  X  X ubya X . Thus, a many-to-many mapping be-tween surface forms and entities has to be resolved. In addition, entity mentions may not have a match-ing entity in the KB, which is often the case for non-popular entities.

Typical approaches to NED combine the use of document context knowledge with entity informa-tion stored in the KB in order to disambiguate en-tities. Many systems represent document context and KB information as word or concept vectors, and rank entities using vector space similarity met-rics (Cucerzan, 2007). Other authors employ su-pervised machine learning algorithms to classify or rank candidate entities (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Zhang et al., 2010). Common features include pop-ularity metrics based on Wikipedia X  X  graph structure or on name mention frequency (Dredze et al., 2010; Han and Zhao, 2009), similarity metrics explor-ing Wikipedia X  X  concept relations (Han and Zhao, 2009), and string similarity features. Recent work also addresses the task of NIL detection (Dredze et al., 2010).

While previous research has largely focused on disambiguating each entity mention in a document separately (McNamee and Dang, 2009), we explore an approach that is driven by the observation that entities normally co-occur in texts. Documents of-ten discuss several different entities related to each other, e.g. a news article may report on a meeting of political leaders from different countries. Analo-gously, entries in a KB such as Wikipedia are linked to other, related entries.
 Our Contributions In this paper, we evaluate a range of novel disambiguation features that exploit the relations between NEs identified in a document and in the KB. Our goal is to explore the usefulness of Wikipedia X  X  link structure as source of relations between entities. We propose a method for candi-date selection that is based on an inverted index of surface forms and entities (Section 3.2). Instead of a bag-of-words approach we use co-occurring NEs in text for describing an ambiguous surface form. We introduce several different disambiguation fea-tures that exploit the relations between entities de-rived from the graph structure of Wikipedia (Section 3.3). Finally, we combine our disambiguation fea-tures and achieve state-of-the-art results with a Sup-port Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Section 4). The task of NED is to assign a surface form s found in a document d to a target NE t  X  E ( s ) , where E ( s )  X  E is a set of candidate NEs from an entity KB that is defined by E = { e 1 ,e 2 ,...,e n } , or to recognize that the found surface form s refers to a missing target entity t /  X  E ( s ) . For solving the task, three main challenges have to be addressed: Ambiguity Names of NEs may be ambiguous. Since the same surface form s may refer to more than one NE e , the correct target entity t has to be determined from a set of candidates E ( s ) Name variants Often, name variants (e.g. abbre-viations, acronyms or synonyms) are used in texts to refer to the same NE, which has to be considered for the determination of candidates E ( s ) for a given surface form s .
 KB coverage KBs cover only a limited number of NEs, mostly popular NEs. Another challenge of NED is therefore to recognize missing NEs where t /  X  E ( s ) , given a surface form s (NIL detection). We formulate NED as a supervised binary classifi-cation problem. In this section we describe the con-struction and structure of the KB and the candidate selection scheme, followed by an overview of dis-ambiguation features and the candidate classifica-tion algorithm. 3.1 Knowledge base construction Our approach disambiguates named entities against a KB constructed from Wikipedia. To this end, we process Wikipedia to extract several types of infor-mation for each Wikipedia article describing a con-cept (i.e. any article not being a redirect page, a dis-ambiguation page, or any other kind of meta page). We collect a set of name variants (surface forms) for each concept from article titles, redirect pages, disambiguation pages and the anchor texts of inter-nal Wikipedia links, following Cucerzan (2007). For each concept, we also collect its set of incoming and outgoing links to other Wikipedia pages. Finally, we extract the article X  X  full text. We store this informa-tion in an inverted index, which allows for very ef-ficient access and search during candidate selection and feature computation.
The distribution of surface forms follows a power law, where the majority of surface forms is unam-biguous, but some surface forms are very ambigu-ous (Figure 1). This suggests that for a given set of distinct surface forms found in a document, many of these will unambiguously refer to a single Wikipedia entity. These entities can then be used to disam-biguate surface forms referring to multiple entities. 3.2 Candidate selection Given a surface form identified in a document, the task of the candidate selection component is to re-trieve a set of candidate entities from the KB. To this end, we execute a search on index fields storing article titles, redirect titles, and name variants. We implement a weighted search to give high weights to exact title matches, a lesser emphasis on redi-rect matches, and finally a low weight for all other name variants. In addition, we implement a fuzzy search on the title and redirect fields to select KB entries with approximate string similarity to the sur-face form. 3.3 Disambiguation features In this section, we describe the features that we use in our disambiguation approach.
 Entity Context (EC) The EC disambiguation fea-ture is calculated as the cosine similarity between the document context d of a surface form s and the Wikipedia article c of each candidate c  X  E ( s ) . We represent both contexts as vectors of URIs. To create d we extract all NEs from the text using the Stanford NE Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) and represent each NE by its Wikipedia URI. If a surface form is ambiguous, we choose the most popular NE with the popularity metric described below. Analogously, we represent each c as a vector of the incoming and out-going URIs found on its Wikipedia page.
 Link Context (LC) The link context feature is an extension of the EC feature. Since our observa-tions have shown that the entity context can be very small and consequently the overlap between d and c may be very low, we extend d by all incoming (LC-in) or by all incoming and outgoing (LC-all) Wikipedia URIs of the NEs from the entity context. We assume that Wikipedia pages that refer to other Wikipedia pages contain information on the refer-enced pages or at least are thematically related to these pages. With the extension of d to d X  , we ex-pect a higher overlap between the context vectors, so that cos( d X  , c )  X  cos( d , c ) .
 Candidate Rank (CR) The features described so far disambiguate every surface form s  X  S from a document d separately, whereas our Candidate Rank feature aims to disambiguate all surface forms S found in a document d at once. We represent d as a graph D = ( E ( S ) ,L ( E ( S ))) where the nodes E ( S ) =  X  s  X  S E ( s ) are all candidates of all surface forms in the document and L ( E ( S )) is the set of links between the candidates, as found in Wikipedia. Then, we compute the PageRank score (Brin and Page, 1998) of all c  X  E ( S ) and choose for each s the candidate with the highest PageRank score in the document graph D .
 Standard Features In addition to the previously described features we also implement a set of com-monly accepted features. These include a feature based on the cosine similarity between word vector representations of the document and the Wikipedia article of each candidate (BOW) (Bunescu, 2007). We perform stemming, remove stopwords, and weight words with tf.idf in both cases. Another stan-dard feature we use is the popularity of a surface form (SFP). We calculate how often a surface form s references a candidate c  X  E ( s ) in relation to the to-tal number of mentions of s in Wikipedia (Han and Zhao, 2009). Since we use an index for selecting candidates (Section 3.2), we also exploit the candi-date selection score (CS) returned for each candidate as a disambiguation feature. 3.4 Candidate classifier and NIL detection We cast NED as a supervised classification task and use two binary SVM classifiers (Vapnik, 1995). The first classifier decides for each candidate c  X  E ( s ) if it corresponds to the target entity. Each candidate is represented as a vector x ( c ) of features. For training the classifier we label as a positive example at most one x ( c ) from the set of candidates for a surface form s , and all others as negative.
 In addition, we train a separate classifier to detect NIL queries, i.e. where all x ( c ) from E ( s ) are labeled as negative examples. This may e.g. be the case if the similarity values of all candidates c  X  E ( s ) are very low. We calculate several different fea-tures, such as the maximum, mean and minimum, the difference between maximum and mean, and the difference between maximum and minimum, of all atomic features, using the feature vectors of all can-didates in E ( s ) . Both classifier use a radial basis function kernel, with parameter settings of C = 32 and  X  = 8 . We optimized these settings on a sepa-rate development dataset. We conduct our experiments on the 2009 Knowl-edge Base Population (KBP) dataset of the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) (McNamee and Dang, 2009). The dataset consists of a KB derived from a 2008 snapshot of the English Wikipedia, and a col-lection of newswire, weblog and newsgroup docu-ments. A set of 3904 surface form-document pairs (queries) is constructed from these sources, encom-passing 560 unique entities. The majority of queries (57%) are NIL queries, of the KB queries, 69% are for organizations and 15% each for persons and geopolitical entities. For each query the surface form appearing in the given document has to be dis-ambiguated against the KB.

We randomly split the 3904 queries to perform 10-fold cross-validation, and stratify the resulting folds to ensure a similar distribution of KB and NIL queries in our training data. After normalizing fea-ture values to be in [0 , 1] , we train a candidate and a NIL classifier on 90% of the queries in each it-eration, and test using the remaining 10%. Results reported in this paper are then averaged across the test folds.

Table 1 compares the micro-averaged accuracy of our approach on KB and NIL queries for different feature sets, and lists the results of two other state-of-the-art systems (Dredze et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010), as well as the best and median reported per-formance of the 2009 TAC-KBP track (McNamee et al., 2010). Micro-averaged accuracy is calculated as the fraction of correct queries, and is the official TAC-KBP evaluation measure. As a baseline we use a feature set consisting of the BOW and SFP fea-tures. The best feature set in our experiments com-prises all features except for the LC-all and CR fea-tures.

Our best accuracy of 0 . 84 compares favorably with other state-of-the-art systems on this dataset. Using the best feature set improves the disambigua-tion accuracy by 6 . 2% over the baseline feature set, which is significant at p = 0 . 05 . For KB queries our system X  X  accuracy is higher than that of Dredze et al., but lower than the accuracy reported by Zheng et al. One striking result is the high accuracy for NIL queries, where our approach outperforms all previ-ously reported results (Figure 2).

Figure 3 displays the performance of our ap-proach when iteratively adding features. We can see that the novel entity features contribute to a higher overall accuracy. Including the candidate se-lection score (CS) improves accuracy by 3 . 6% over the baseline. The Wikipedia link-based features pro-vide additional gains, however differences are quite small ( 1 . 0  X  1 . 5% ). We find that there is hardly any difference in performance between using the LC-all and LC-in features. The Candidate Rank (CR) feature slightly decreases the overall accuracy. A manual inspection of the CR feature shows that of-ten candidates cannot be distinguished by the clas-sifier because they are assigned the same PageRank scores. We assume this results from our use of uni-form priors for the edges and vertices of the docu-ment graphs. We presented a supervised approach for named entity disambiguation that explores novel features based on Wikipedia X  X  link structure. These features use NEs co-occurring with an ambiguous surface form in a document and their Wikipedia relations to score the candidates. Our system achieves state-of-the-art results on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset. We find that our features improve disambiguation results by 6 . 2% over the popularity baseline, and are espe-cially helpful for recognizing entities not contained in the KB.

In future work we plan to explore multilin-gual data for NED. Since non-English versions of Wikipedia often are less extensive than the English version we find it promising to combine Wikipedia versions of different languages and to use them as a source for multilingual NED. For multilingual NED evaluation we are currently working on a German dataset, following the TAC-KBP dataset creation guidelines. In addition to Wikipedia, we also intend to exploit more dynamical information sources. For example, when considering news articles, NEs of-ten occur for a certain period of time in consecutive news dealing with the same topic. This short-time context could be a useful source of information for disambiguating novel entities.
