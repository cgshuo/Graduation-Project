 Supplementary Material Then, where we excluded the terminal state from the sum since reaching it ends the trajectory. Similarly, This result is similar to Lemma 6.9 in (Bertsekas &amp; Tsitsiklis, 1996). Proof. We have rearranging gives the stated result.
 Proof. Let  X  1 ( x ),  X  2 ( x ) be some vector functions of the state. We claim that To see this, let 1 (  X  ) denote the indicator function and write property of the terminal state. Similarly, we have since and expected values with probability 1, therefore we have and Proof. Using (18) and (19) we have for all k algorithm in a stochastic approximation form as where and the noise terms  X M k +1 satisfy real part.
 Next, let h ( w ) = Mw + z , and observe that the following conditions hold. A 1. The map h is Lipschitz.
 A 2. The step sizes satisfy A 3. {  X M n } is a martingale difference sequence, i.e., E [  X M n +1 | F n ] = 0 . The next condition also holds h  X  ( w ) is continuous. Furthermore, the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) has the origin as its unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. real part.
 A 5. The iterates of (20) remain bounded almost surely, i.e., sup k k  X  w k k &lt;  X  , a.s. the convergence of the iterates of (20) with the asymptotic behavior of the ODE that if A1 -A3 and A5 hold, then  X  w k  X   X  w  X  as k  X  X  X  with probability 1. chain
