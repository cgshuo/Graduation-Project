 Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, the process of as-signing every word in a sentence with a POS tag (e.g., NN (normal noun) or JJ (adjective)), is pre-requisite for many advanced natural language pro-cessing tasks. Building upon the large body of re-search to improve tagging performance for various languages using various models (e.g., (Thede and Harper, 1999; Brants, 2000; Tseng et al., 2005b; Huang et al., 2007)) and the recent work on PCFG grammars with latent annotations (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006), we will investigate the use of fine-grained latent annotations for Chinese POS tagging. While state-of-the-art tagging systems have achieved accuracies above 97% in English, Chinese POS tagging (Tseng et al., 2005b; Huang et al., 2007) has proven to be more challenging, and it is the focus of this study.

The value of the latent variable approach for tag-ging is that it can learn more fine grained tags to bet-ter model the training data. Liang and Klein (2008) analyzed the errors of unsupervised learning using EM and found that both estimation and optimiza-tion errors decrease as the amount of unlabeled data increases. In our case, the learning of latent anno-tations through EM may also benefit from a large set of automatically labeled data to improve tagging performance. Semi-supervised, self-labeled data has been effectively used to train acoustic models for speech recognition (Ma and Schwartz, 2008); how-ever, early investigations of self-training on POS tagging have mixed outcomes. Clark et al. (2003) reported positive results with little labeled training data but negative results when the amount of labeled training data increases. Wang et al. (2007) reported that self-training improves a trigram tagger X  X  accu-racy, but this tagger was trained with only a small amount of in-domain labeled data.

In this paper, we will investigate whether the performance of a simple bigram HMM tagger can be improved by introducing latent annotations and whether self-training can further improve its perfor-mance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use latent annotations with self-training to enhance the performance of a POS tagger. POS tagging using a hidden Markov model can be considered as an instance of Bayesian inference, wherein we observe a sequence of words and need to assign them the most likely sequence of POS tags. If t i 1 denotes the tag sequence t 1 ,  X  X  X  ,t i , and w denotes the word sequence w 1 ,  X  X  X  ,w i , given the first-order Markov assumption of a bigram tagger, the best tag sequence  X  ( w n computed efficiently as 1 : with a set of transition parameters { p ( b | a ) } , for tran-siting to tag b from tag a , and a set of emission parameters { p ( w | a ) } , for generating word w from tag a . A simple HMM tagger is trained by pulling counts from labeled data and normalizing to get the conditional probabilities.

It is well know that the independence assumption of a bigram tagger is too strong in many cases. A common practice for weakening the independence assumption is to use a second-order Markov as-sumption, i.e., a trigram tagger. This is similar to explicitly annotating each POS tag with the preced-ing tag. Rather than explicit annotation, we could use latent annotations to split the POS tags, sim-ilarly to the introduction of latent annotations to PCFG grammars (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006). For example, the NR tag may be split into NR-1 and NR-2, and correspondingly the POS tag sequence of  X  X r./NR Smith/NR saw/VV Ms./NR Smith/NR X  could be refined as:  X  X r./NR-2 Smith/NR-1 saw/VV-2 Ms./NR-2 Smith/NR-1 X .

The objective of training a bigram tagger with la-tent annotations is to find the transition and emission probabilities associated with the latent tags such that the likelihood of the training data is maximized. Un-like training a standard bigram tagger where the POS tags are observed, in the latent case, the latent tags are not observable, and so a variant of EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters.

Given a sentence w n sider the i -th word w i and its latent tag a x  X  a = t i (which means a x is a latent tag of tag a , the i -th tag in the sequence) and the ( i + 1) -th word w i +1 and its latent tag b y  X  b = t i +1 , the forward,  X  i +1 ( b p ( probabilities can be computed recursively: In the E step, the posterior probabilities of co-occurrence events can be computed as: In the M step, the above posterior probabilities are used as weighted observations to update the transi-tion and emission probabilities 2 :
A hierarchical split-and-merge method, similar to (Petrov et al., 2006), is used to gradually increase the number of latent annotations while allocating them adaptively to places where they would pro-duce the greatest increase in training likelihood (e.g., we observe heavy splitting in categories such as NN (normal noun) and VV (verb), that cover a wide vari-ety of words, but only minimal splitting in categories like IJ (interjection) and ON (onomatopoeia)).
Whereas tag transition occurrences are frequent, allowing extensive optimization using EM, word-tag co-occurrences are sparser and more likely to suf-fer from over-fitting. To handle this problem, we map all words with frequency less than threshold 3  X  to symbol unk and for each latent tag accumu-late the word tag statistics of these rare words to c ( a are redistributed among the rare words ( w : c ( w ) &lt;  X  ) to compute their emission probabilities: The impact of this rare word handling method will be investigated in Section 3.

A character-based unknown word model, similar to the one described in (Huang et al., 2007), is used to handle unknown Chinese words during tagging. A decoding method similar to the max-rule-product method in (Petrov and Klein, 2007) is used to tag sentences using our model. The Penn Chinese Treebank 6.0 (CTB6) (Xue et al., 2005) is used as the labeled data in our study. CTB6 contains news articles, which are used as the primary source of labeled data in our experiments, as well as broadcast news transcriptions. Since the news ar-ticles were collected during different time periods from different sources with a diversity of topics, in order to obtain a representative split of train-test-development sets, we divide them into blocks of 10 files in sorted order and for each block use the first file for development, the second for test, and the re-maining for training. The broadcast news data ex-hibits many of the characteristics of newswire text (it contains many nonverbal expressions, e.g., num-bers and symbols, and is fully punctuated) and so is also included in the training data set. We also uti-lize a greater number of unlabeled sentences in the self-training experiments. They are selected from similar sources to the newswire articles, and are normalized (Zhang and Kahn, 2008) and word seg-mented (Tseng et al., 2005a). See Table 1 for a sum-mary of the data used.

Figure 1 plots the learning curves of two bigram taggers with latent annotations (Bigram+LA:2 has the special handling of rare words as described in Section 2 while Bigram+LA:1 does not) and com-pares its performance with a state-of-the-art trigram HMM tagger (Huang et al., 2007) that uses trigram transition and emission models together with bidi-rectional decoding. Both bigram taggers initially have much lower tagging accuracy than the trigram tagger, due to its strong but invalid independence as-sumption. As the number of latent annotations in-creases, the bigram taggers are able to learn more from the context based on the latent annotations, and their performance improves significantly, out-performing the trigram tagger. The performance gap between the two bigram taggers suggests that over-fitting occurs in the word emission model when more latent annotations are available for optimiza-tion; sharing the statistics among rare words alle-viates some of the sparseness while supporting the modeling of deeper dependencies among more fre-quent events. In the later experiments, we use Bi-gram+LA to denote the Bigram+LA:2 tagger.

Figure 2 compares the self-training capability of three models (the bigram tagger w/ or w/o latent annotations, and the aforementioned trigram tagger) using different sizes of labeled training data and the full set of unlabeled data. For each model, a tag-ger is first trained on the allocated labeled training data and is then used to tag the unlabeled data. A new tagger is then trained on the combination 4 of the allocated labeled training data and the newly au-tomatically labeled data.
There are two interesting observations that distin-guish the bigram tagger with latent annotations from the other two taggers. First, although all of the tag-gers improve as more labeled training data is avail-able, the performance gap between the bigram tag-ger with latent annotations and the other two taggers also increases. This is because more latent annota-tions can be used to take advantage of the additional training data to learn deeper dependencies.

Second, the bigram tagger with latent annotations benefits much more from self-training, although it already has the highest performance among the three taggers before self-training. The bigram tagger without latent annotations benefits little from self-training. Except for a slight improvement when there is a small amount of labeled training, self-training slightly hurts tagging performance as the amount of labeled data increases. The trigram tag-ger benefits from self-training initially but eventu-ally has a similar pattern to the bigram tagger when trained on the full labeled set. The performance of the latent bigram tagger improves consistently with self-training. Although the gain decreases for models trained on larger training sets, since stronger models are harder to improve, self-training still con-tributes significantly to model accuracy.

The final tagging performance on the test set is reported in Table 2. All of the improvements are statistically significant ( p &lt; 0 . 005 ).
It is worth mentioning that we initially added la-tent annotations to a trigram tagger, rather than a bi-gram tagger, to build from a stronger starting point; however, this did not work well. A trigram tagger re-quires sophisticated smoothing to handle data spar-sity, and introducing latent annotations exacerbates the sparsity problem, especially for trigram word emissions. The uniform extension of a bigram tag-ger to a trigram tagger ignores whether the use of ad-ditional context is helpful and supported by enough data, nor is it able to use a longer context. In con-trast, the bigram tagger with latent annotations is able to learn different granularities for tags based on the training data. In this paper, we showed that the accuracy of a sim-ple bigram HMM tagger can be substantially im-proved by introducing latent annotations together with proper handling of rare words. We also showed that this tagger is able to benefit from self-training, despite the fact that other models, such as bigram or trigram HMM taggers, do not.

In the future work, we will investigate automatic data selection methods to choose materials that are most suitable for self-training and evaluate the effect of the amount of automatically labeled data.
