A separate response by Lee and colleagues in this issue provides clarification of issues not covered here. 2. The Indus Script Debate
The Indus script refers to the approximately 4,000 inscriptions on seals, miniature tablets, pottery, stoneware, copper plates, tools, weapons, and wood left behind by the Indus civilization, which flourished ca. 2600 X 1900 BCE in South Asia. The existing inscriptions (see Figure 1(a) for examples) are relatively short, the average length being 5 signs and the longest inscription on a single surface being 17 signs. The number of different symbols in the script is estimated to be about 400. This large number of symbols, coupled with archaeological evidence indicating extensive use of the script for a variety of purposes, led scholars to suggest that the script was probably a logosyl-labic form of writing, each sign representing a word or syllable (Parpola 1994; Possehl 1996).

Several have published point-by-point rebuttals (Parpola 2005; Vidale 2007; McIntosh 2008). Parpola, who is widely regarded as the leading authority on the Indus script, writes that the arguments of Sproat and co-workers  X  X an be easily controverted X  and goes on to expose the inadequaciesofeachofthesearguments(Parpola2005,2008).McIntosh,inarecentbook on the ancient Indus valley, also discusses the evidence against the arguments of Sproat and colleagues (McIntosh 2008, pages 372 X 374).

Fallacies Resolved
Under a section entitled  X  X he Fallacies, X  Sproat (2010) describes a result from our article in Science (Raoetal.2009a)whichpresentsevidenceagainstthethesisofFarmer,Sproat, andWitzel(2004).Inourarticle,weshowthattheconditionalentropyoftheIndusscript is similar to various linguistic sequences. The impression conveyed by Sproat (2010) is that we are claiming such similarity by itself is sufficient to prove that the Indus script, or indeed any symbol system, is linguistic. We do not make such a claim; instead, we only note in Rao et al. (2009a) that our result increases the evidence for the linguistic hypothesis, when one takes into account other language-like properties of the script (see detailed explanation in Section 4 herein).

Nor does he describe our more recent block entropy result (Rao 2010b), even though he cites this paper (this new result extends the conditional entropy work). Both of these results include data from demonstrably nonlinguistic sequences, namely, DNA, protein sequences, and Fortran code. To present our work as  X  X imple experiments involvingrandomlygeneratedtexts X  X s,tosaytheleast,agrossmisrepresentationofour work. 796 (adapted from Rao 2010b). Block entropy generalizes Shannon entropy (Shannon 1948, 1951) and the measure of bigram conditional entropy used in Rao et al. (2009a) to blocks of N symbols. Block entropy for block size N is defined as: where p ( N ) i are the probabilities of sequences (blocks) of N symbols. Thus, for N = 1, block entropy is simply the standard unigram entropy and for N = 2, it is the entropy of bigrams. Block entropy is useful because it provides a measure of the amount of flexibility allowed by the syntactic rules generating the analyzed sequences (Schmitt and Herzel 1997): The more restrictive the rules, the smaller the number of syntactically correct combinations of symbols and lower the entropy. Correlations between symbols are reflected in a sub-linear growth of H N with N (e.g., H block size is increased from N = 1to N = 6 symbols. To counter the problems posed by the small sample size of the Indus corpus (about 1,550 lines of text and 7,000 sign occurrences), we employed a Bayesian entropy estimation technique known as the NSB estimator (Nemenman, Shafee, and Bialek 2002), which has been shown to provide good estimates of entropy for undersampled discrete data. Details regarding the NSB parameter settings and the data sets used for Figure 1(b) can be found in Rao (2010a). of a variety of natural languages and far from the entropies for unordered and rigidly ordered sequences (Max Ent and Min Ent, respectively). Also shown in the plot for comparison are the entropies for a computer program written in the formal language
Fortran, a music sequence (Beethoven X  X  Sonata no. 32 ; data from Schmitt and Herzel [1997]), and two sample biological sequences (DNA and proteins). The biological se-quences and music have noticeably higher block entropies than the Indus script and natural languages; the Fortran code has lower block entropies.
 that the Indus script is linguistic? We do not believe so. In fact, we contend that barring a full decipherment, one cannot prove either the linguistic or nonlinguistic thesis, unlike Sproat and colleagues who have previously claimed to have  X  X roof X  for the nonlinguistic hypothesis (Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel 2004, pages 34 and 37; Farmer 2005).Whatwedoclaim,aswestateinour Science paperandasexplainedinmoredetail subsequently, is that results such as the similarity in entropy in Figure 1(b) increase the evidence for the linguistic hypothesis, given other language-like properties of the Indus script.

First, such an exercise misses the point: as stated earlier, we do not claim that entropic similarity by itself is a sufficient condition for language. Second, these  X  X oun-terexamples X  ignore the fact that the unigram and bigram entropies are markedly dif-ferent for both the Indus script and the linguistic systems, as is obvious from comparing
Figures 1andS1inour Science paper (Raoetal.2009a). Moreimportantly, theseartificial examples fail to exhibit the scaling of block entropies beyond unigrams and bigrams exhibited by the Indus script and linguistic systems in Figure 1(b). 798 tems (corresponding to systems near Max Ent and Min Ent, respectively, in Figure 1(b)), saying these do not characterize any natural nonlinguistic systems. It is clear from
Figure 1(b) that there do exist natural  X  X ype 1 X  nonlinguistic sequences (DNA, protein sequences). The analogous result for conditional entropy was given in Figure 1B in Rao (2010b), which was omitted in Sproat (2010). As for  X  X ype 2 X  systems, Vidale (2007) providesanumberofexamplesofancientnonlinguisticsystemsfromCentralandSouth
Asia whose properties are in line with such systems. Section 6 herein discusses these systemsaswellasthespecificcasesofVin  X  caand kudurru sequencesmentionedinSproat (2010). Sproat, Farmer, and colleagues have objected to the use of artificial data sets in
Rao et al. (2009a) to demarcate the Max Ent and Min Ent limits: This objection is a red herring and does not change the result that the Indus script is entropically similar to linguistic scripts. Finally, the allusion in Sproat (2010) that we may be  X  X onfused X  about the difference between  X  X andom X  and  X  X quiprobable X  is unwarranted and not worthy ofcommenthere.Therelatedissueofartificiallygeneratedexampleswithquasi-Zipfian distributions has already been discussed in this response.
 result toblock entropies directly addresses theobjections ofPereira (2009), who stressed the need to go beyond bigram statistics, which Figure 1(b) does for N up to 6. Beyond N = 6, the entropy estimates become less reliable due to the small sample size of the
Indus corpus. 4. Inductive Inference
The correct way of interpreting the block entropy result in Figure 1(b) (and likewise the conditional entropy result) is to view it within an inductive framework (rather than in a deductive sense as Sproat and others do in Liberman [2009]). Given that we cannot answer the ontological question  X  X oes the Indus script represent language? X  without a true decipherment, we formulate the question as an epistemological problem, namely, one of estimating the posterior probability of the hypothesis H symbol sequence represents language, given various properties P unknown sequence. Using a Bayesian formalism, the posterior P ( H proportional to P ( P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , ... | H L ) P ( H L

 written, like the vast majority of linguistic scripts (and unlike nonlinguistic systems such as medieval heraldry, Boy Scout merit badges, or highway/airport signs, systems frequently mentioned by Sproat and colleagues). (2) Directionality : There is clear evi-dence for directionality in the script: Texts were usually written from right to left, a fact that can be inferred, for example, from a sign being overwritten by another on its left on pottery (Lal 1966). Directionality is a universal characteristic of linguistic systems but not necessarily of nonlinguistic systems (e.g., heraldry, Boy Scout badges). (3) Use of Diacritical Marks : Indus symbols are often modified by the addition of specific sets of marks over, around, or inside a symbol. Multiple symbols are sometimes combined ( X  X igatured X ) to form a single glyph. This is similar to linguistic scripts, including later
Indian scripts which use such ligatures and diacritical marks above, below, or around a symbol to modify the sound of a root consonant or vowel symbol. (4) Zipf X  X andelbrot
Law : The script obeys the Zipf X  X andelbrot law, a power-law distribution on ranked data, which is often considered a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for language (Yadav et al. 2010). (5) Syntactic Structure : The script exhibits distinct language-like syntactic structure including equivalence classes of symbols with respect to positional preference, classes of symbols that function as beginners and enders, symbol clusters that prefer particular positions within texts, etc. (Hunter 1934; Parpola 1994; Yadav et al. 2008a, 2008b). This structure is evident in both short texts as well as longer texts that are up to 17 symbols long. (6) Diverse usage : The script was used on a wide range of media (from seals, tablets, and pottery to copper plates, tools, clay tags, and at least one large wooden board), suggesting a diverse usage similar to linguistic scripts, and unlike nonlinguisticsystemssuchaspotterymarkings,deitysymbolsonboundarystones,and so on, whose use is typically limited to one type of medium. (7) Use in Foreign Lands : Indus texts have been discovered as far west as Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf.
These texts typically use the same signs as texts found in the Indus region but alter their ordering . As shown in Figure 1(c), these  X  X oreign X  texts have low likelihood values compared to Indus region texts, even after taking into account regional variation across the
Indus region (see error bar in Figure 1(c)) (Rao et al. 2009b; Rao 2010b). This suggests that, like other linguistic scripts, the Indus script may have been versatile enough to represent different subject matter or a different language in foreign regions. properties(e.g.,Zipfiandistribution)andanotherthatexhibitsadifferentproperty(e.g., ligaturing),itwouldbehighlyunusualforanonlinguisticsystemtoexhibitaconfluence of all of these properties.
 the same type of entropic scaling as linguistic systems. To estimate the prior probability
P ( H L ), one could take into account, as a number of scholars have (Vidale 2007; Parpola 2008; Mahadevan 2009), the archaeological evidence regarding the cultural sophistica-tion of the Indus civilization, contact with other literate societies, and the extensive use ofthescriptfortradeandotherpurposes.Thesefactorssuggestthat P ( H chance. Considering the properties discussed previously and our estimate of P ( H hypothesis than the nonlinguistic alternative. Given our current data and knowledge about the script, we believe this is the kind of statement one can make about the Indus script, rather than statements about the  X  X ollapse X  of one thesis or another (Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel 2004).

 method?Wedonotthinkso.Asimilarblockentropyresultwasobtainedindependently by Schmitt and Herzel (1997) using an entirely different entropy estimation method (see
Figure 8 in their paper). The overall result is also confirmed by other methods, as dis-cussed by Schmitt and Herzel:  X  X his order X  X NA, music, human language, computer language X  X hen ordered by decreasing entropy, is confirmed by the calculation of the
Lempel-Ziv complexity (Lempel and Ziv 1976) which also serves as an estimation of the entropy of the source X  (Schmitt and Herzel 1997, page 376). 800 5. Comparison with Ancient Nonlinguistic Systems
Sproat contends that results such as the similarity in entropy scaling in Figure 1(b) are  X  X seless X  without analyzing a sizeable number of  X  X ncient nonlinguistic systems X  (Sproat 2010). As mentioned earlier, Sproat ignores the fact that the results already include nonlinguistic systems: DNA and protein sequences (perhaps the two  X  X ost ancient X  nonlinguistic systems!) as well as man-made sequences (Fortran code and music in Figure 1(b)).
 analogy may be apt here: If, in the dim surroundings of a jungle, you notice something moving and then spot some stripes, your belief that what is lurking is a tiger will likely go up, even though it could also be a zebra, a man wearing a tiger costume, or any of a number of possibilities. The observation you made that the object under consideration has stripes is certainly not  X  X seless X  in this case, just because you haven X  X  ascertained whether antelopes or elephants in the jungle also have stripes. In other words, we now know that various types of symbol sequences, from natural sequences such as DNA and proteins to man-made systems such as music and Fortran, occupy quite different entropic ranges compared to linguistic systems (Figure 1(b); Figure 8 in Schmitt and
Herzel[1997]).Giventhisknowledge,thefindingthatIndussequencesoccupythesame entropic range as linguistic sequences, although not proving that the Indus script is linguistic, certainly increases the posterior probability of the linguistic hypothesis, just asthe observation ofstripes increases theposterior probability ofthe  X  X iger X  hypothesis in our earlier example. 1 As to where ancient nonlinguistic systems may lie among the entropic ranges in Figure 1(b), we discuss this in the next section. 6. Countless Nonlinguistic Sign Systems?
Sproat and colleagues have stated that the properties observed in the Indus script are also seen in  X  X ountless nonlinguistic sign systems X  (Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel 2004, page 21). Let us consider some of these nonlinguistic systems (Sproat 2010; Farmer,
Sproat, and Witzel 2004). Medieval European heraldry, Boy Scout merit badges, and airport/highway signs are not linear juxtapositions of symbols that can be up to 17 symbols long, as we find in the case of the Indus script, nor do they exhibit a conflu-ence of script-like properties as enumerated herein. We invite the reader to compare examples of heraldry (Parker 1894), Boy Scout badges (Boy Scouts of America 2010), and airport/highway signs with the Indus script sequences in Figure 1(a) and judge for themselves whether such a comparison bears merit.
 which refers to the markings on pottery and other artifacts from the Vin  X  ca culture of southeastern Europe of ca. 6000 X 4000 BCE. Sproat believes there is order in the Vin  X  ca system and states that we  X  X is-cite X  Winn. To set the record straight, here is what Winn has to say in his article in a section on Sign Groups (Winn 1990, page 269):
This contradicts Sproat (2010) and suggests that the Vin  X  ca system, if it indeed lacks precision in the order of signs, would be closer to the maximum entropy (Max Ent) range than to the linguistic scripts in Figure 1(b). The actual amount of lack of precision unfortunately cannot be quantified in entropic terms because a large enough data set of Vin  X  ca sequences does not exist.
 stones known as kudurrus . He declares that our statement regarding kudurru deity sequences obeying rigid rules of ordering compared to linguistic scripts is  X  X learly false. X  To shed more light on this issue, we cite here the work of several scholars in this field. Slanski, in a recent in-depth study of the form and function of kudurrus , states (Slanski 2003, page 163):
A similar statement on the hierarchical ordering of symbols on kudurrus can be found in Black and Green (1992, page 114). The reader will probably agree that a system with even a rough hierarchical ordering among its symbols is more rigid than most linguistic systems. Linguistic systems have no such hierarchy imposed on characters or words, and there is considerable flexibility in where such symbols may be placed within a sequence. Therefore, as originally suggested in Rao et al. (2009a), we expect the entropy of the kudurru sequences to be lower than linguistic systems and perhaps slightly above the minimum entropy (Min Ent) range in Figure 1(b). Again, the actual entropy values cannot be estimated because, as admitted in Sproat (2010), a large enough data set of kudurru sequences does not exist.
 data set of ancient nonlinguistic systems. This ignores the work of Vidale (2007), who did put together a set of ten such systems. Vidale questions the relevance of the non-linguistic systems suggested by Sproat and colleagues because they are neither of the same time period nor from the same geographical region as the Indus script. To rectify this oversight, Vidale lists ten nonlinguistic systems from Central and South Asia that were roughly contemporaneous with the Indus script (Table 1 in Vidale 2007). For this set of much more relevant nonlinguistic systems, Vidale demonstrates that the average number of different signs is only about 44, a far cry from the 400 or so signs in the Indus script.
 countless nonlinguistic sign systems (Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel 2004, page 21)? Vidale states that the archaeological data lead us to question this  X  X uperficial claim X  (Vidale 2007, page 344). In the ten nonlinguistic systems roughly contemporary with the Indus script, positional regularities can either be  X  X argely ruled out X  (e.g., in potters X  markings where signs occur mostly in isolation and rarely in couples) or the regularities take the form of  X  X ystematic, large-scale redundancy X  (e.g., constant repetition of the same symbols). Such systems would fall roughly in the  X  X ype 2 X  category of nonlinguistic systems suggested in our Science paper (Rao et al. 2009a), lying closer to the mini-mum entropy (Min Ent) range in Figure 1(b) than to the Indus script and linguistic systems. 802 7. Implications of the Linguistic versus Nonlinguistic Hypotheses
If the Indus script does encode language, what might the content of the inscriptions be? A majority of the Indus texts are found on stamp seals (Figure 1(a)), which were typically used in Bronze Age cultures for regulating trade. Seals were pressed onto clay used to seal packages of goods. Indeed, a number of such clay tags have been found at various sites in the Indus civilization, bearing seal impressions on one side and impressions of woven cloth, reed matting or other packing material on the other. These archaeological observations suggest that the short Indus texts on seals (Figure 1(a)), like their other Bronze age counterparts, probably represent the contents, the origin or destination, the type or amount of goods being traded, name and title of the owner, or some combination of these. Similar linguistic explanations can be found for the inscriptions on other media.
 religious or political symbols, one is hard pressed to explain: (1) how and why were sequences of such symbols, with syntactic rules entropically similar to linguistic scripts (Figure 1(b)), used in trade in a manner strikingly similar to other literate Bronze age cultures? and (2) why did the Indus people use these symbols in consistent sequences in their native region and alter their ordering when in a foreign land (Figure 1(c))?
As pointed out by other authors (Vidale 2007; Parpola 2008; Mahadevan 2009), such incongruities are more the norm than the exception if one accepts the nonlinguistic thesis espoused by Sproat and colleagues. The principle of Occam X  X  razor then suggests that we reject the nonlinguistic hypothesis in favor of the simpler linguistic one. 8. Conclusion
Alargenumberofidentificationproblemsareamenabletostatisticaltests,andrepresent perhaps the only way to solve these problems. Practical examples include separating e-mail from spam and recognizing faces in digital camera images. Even though we may not have a perfect test for any of these problems, the statistical methods that are used can be quite useful, even if they are fallible (we all rely on spam detectors for e-mail even if they occasionally let a spam e-mail through; we do not discard these detectors as  X  X seless X ). An important goal of our work (Rao et al. 2009a, 2009b; Rao 2010b;Yadavetal.2010)hasbeentodevelopbetterstatisticaltestsforlinguisticsystems.
As with other statistical tests, it would be foolhardy to expect that a single such test is infallible, as assumed by Sproat and others in their quest to find  X  X ounterexamples X  (Sproat 2010). The observation that a single statistical test by itself is insufficient was the primary motivation for the inductive framework adopted in our research, where we apply a range of tests and estimate the posterior probability that an unknown sequence represents language (Section 4).
 editors of prominent science journals  X  X ven know that there are people who spend their lives doing statistical and computational analyses of text X  (Sproat 2010). We find such a statement surprising because it fails to acknowledge both the impressive achievements of the field of computational linguistics in recent years and the wide coverage of these accomplishments in the popular press (Fletcher [2010] and Lohr and Markoff [2010], to give two recent examples).

For example, we now know that the kind of regularities found in the Indus script can be exploited by statistical models to fill in missing or illegible inscriptions with most likely predictions (Rao et al. 2009b; Yadav et al. 2010).
Recent n -gram analysis of the Indus script has revealed that there are interesting de-pendencies between signs that go beyond just pairs of signs (Yadav et al. 2010). Addi-tionally, these statistical models have allowed us to quantify the differences between
Indus inscriptions found in West Asia and those found in the Indus region (Figure 1(c)), suggesting the script may have been flexible enough to represent different content or even a different language in foreign regions.
 and methods from computational linguistics for almost four decades (Koskenniemi,
Parpola, and Parpola 1970; Koskenniemi 1981; Parpola 1994). We believe computational linguistics will continue to make important contributions to Indus script research in the years to come.
