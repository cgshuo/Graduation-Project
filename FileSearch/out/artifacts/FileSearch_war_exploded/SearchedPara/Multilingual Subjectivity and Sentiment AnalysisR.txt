 Subjectivity and sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic identification of private states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments, evalu-ations, beliefs, and speculations in natural lan-guage. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification adds an additional level of gran-ularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral.
 While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Ro-manian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods ap-plied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been look-ing at the ability of characters to carry sen-timent information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of po-liteness and additional verbal modes embed-ded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These addi-tional sources of information may not be avail-able across all languages, yet, various arti-cles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectiv-ity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak En-glish (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm,
