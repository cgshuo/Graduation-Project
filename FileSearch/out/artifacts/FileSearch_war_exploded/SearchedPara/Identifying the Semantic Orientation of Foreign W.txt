 A great body of research work has focused on iden-tifying the semantic orientation of words. Word po-larity is a very important feature that has been used in several applications. For example, the problem of mining product reputation from Web reviews has been extensively studied (Turney, 2002; Morinaga et al., 2002; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Banea et al., 2008). This is a very important task given the huge amount of product re-views written on the Web and the difficulty of man-ually handling them. Another interesting applica-tion is mining attitude in discussions (Hassan et al., 2010), where the attitude of participants in a discus-sion is inferred using the text they exchange.
Due to its importance, several researchers have addressed the problem of identifying the semantic orientation of individual words. This work has al-most exclusively focused on English. Most of this work used several language dependent resources. For example Turney and Littman (2003) use the en-tire English Web corpus by submitting queries con-sisting of the given word and a set of seeds to a search engine. In addition, several other methods have used Wordnet (Miller, 1995) for connecting se-mantically related words (Kamps et al., 2004; Taka-mura et al., 2005; Hassan and Radev, 2010).

When we try to apply those methods to other lan-guages, we run into the problem of the lack of re-sources in other languages when compared to En-glish. For example, the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966) has thousands of English words labeled with semantic orientation. Most of the lit-erature has used it as a source of labeled seeds or for evaluation. Such lexicons are not readily avail-able in other languages. Another source that has been widely used for this task is Wordnet (Miller, 1995). Even though other Wordnets have been built for other languages, their coverage is very limited when compared to the English Wordnet.

In this work, we present a method for predicting the semantic orientation of foreign words. The pro-posed method is based on creating a multilingual network of words that represents both English and foreign words. The network has English-English connections, as well as foreign-foreign connections and English-foreign connections. This allows us to benefit from the richness of the resources built for the English language and in the meantime utilize resources specific to foreign languages. Figure 1 shows a multilingual network where a sparse foreign network and a dense English network are connected. We then define a random walk model over the multi-lingual network and predict the semantic orientation of any given word by comparing the mean hitting time of a random walk starting from it to a positive and a negative set of seed English words.
 We use both Arabic and Hindi for experiments. We compare the performance of several methods us-ing the foreign language resources only and the mul-tilingual network that has both English and foreign words. We show that bootstrapping from languages with dense resources such as English is useful for improving the performance on other languages with limited resources.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we review some of the related prior work. We define our problem and explain our approach in Section 3. Results and discussion are presented in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5. The problem of identifying the polarity of individual words is a well-studied problem that attracted sev-eral research efforts in the past few years. In this section, we survey several methods that addressed this problem.

The work of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) is among the earliest efforts that addressed this problem. They proposed a method for identify-ing the polarity of adjectives. Their method is based on extracting all conjunctions of adjectives from a given corpus and then they classify each conjunc-tive expression as either the same orientation such as  X  X imple and well-received X  or different orienta-tion such as  X  X implistic but well-received X . Words are clustered into two sets and the cluster with the higher average word frequency is classified as posi-tive.

Turney and Littman (2003) identify word polar-ity by looking at its statistical association with a set of positive/negative seed words. They use two sta-tistical measures for estimating association: Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) and Latent Seman-tic Analysis (LSA). Co-occurrence statistics are col-lected by submitting queries to a search engine. The number of hits for positive seeds, negative seeds, positives seeds near the given word, and negative seeds near the given word are used to estimate the association of the given word to the positive/negative seeds.

Wordnet (Miller, 1995), thesaurus and co-occurrence statistics have been widely used to mea-sure word relatedness by several semantic orienta-tion prediction methods. Kamps et al. (2004) use the length of the shortest-path in Wordnet connecting any given word to positive/negative seeds to iden-tify word polarity. Hu and Liu (2004) use Word-net synonyms and antonyms to bootstrap from words with known polarity to words with unknown polar-ity. They assign any given word the label of its syn-onyms or the opposite label of its antonyms if any of them are known.

Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) used syntactic features and context coherency, defined as the ten-dency for same polarities to appear successively, to acquire polar atoms. Takamura et al. (2005) proposed using spin models for extracting seman-tic orientation of words. They construct a network of words using gloss definitions, thesaurus and co-occurrence statistics. They regard each word as an electron. Each electron has a spin and each spin has a direction taking one of two values: up or down. Two neighboring spins tend to have the same orien-tation from an energetic point of view. Their hypoth-esis is that as neighboring electrons tend to have the same spin direction, neighboring words tend to have similar polarity. Hassan and Radev (2010) use a ran-dom walk model defined over a word relatedness graph to classify words as either positive or negative. Words are connected based on Wordnet relations as well as co-occurrence statistics. They measure the random walk mean hitting time of the given word to the positive set and the negative set. They show that their method outperforms other related methods and that it is more immune to noisy word connections.
Identifying the semantic orientation of individ-ual words is closely related to subjectivity analy-sis. Subjectivity analysis focused on identifying text that presents opinion as opposed to objective text that presents factual information (Wiebe, 2000). Some approaches to subjectivity analysis disregard the context phrases and words appear in (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Banea et al., 2008), while others take it into considera-tion (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Yu and Hatzivas-siloglou, 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). The general goal of this work is to mine the seman-tic orientation of foreign words. We do this by cre-ating a multilingual network of words. In this net-work two words are connected if we believe that they are semantically related. The network has English-English, English-Foreign and Foreign-Foreign con-nections. Some of the English words will be used as seeds for which we know the semantic orientation.
Given such a network, we will measure the mean hitting time in a random walk starting at any given word to the positive set of seeds and the negative set of seeds. Positive words will be more likely to hit the positive set faster than hitting the negative set and vice versa. In the rest of this section, we define how the multilingual word network is built and describe an algorithm for predicting the semantic orientation of any given word. 3.1 Multilingual Word Network We build a network G ( V, E ) where V = V en  X  V f r is the union of a set of English and foreign words. E is a set of edges connecting nodes in V . There are three types of connections: English-English con-nections, Foreign-Foreign connections and English-Foreign connections.
 For the English-English connections, we use Wordnet (Miller, 1995). Wordnet is a large lexical database of English. Words are grouped in synsets to express distinct concepts. We add a link between two words if they occur in the same Wordnet synset. We also add a link between two words if they have a hypernym or a similar-to relation.

Foreign-Foreign connections are created in a sim-ilar way to the English connections. Some other lan-guages have lexical resources based on the design of the Princeton English Wordnet. For example: Euro Wordnet (EWN) (Vossen, 1997), Arabic Wordnet (AWN) (Elkateb, 2006; Black and Fellbaum, 2006; Elkateb and Fellbaum, 2006) and the Hindi Word-net (Narayan et al., 2002; S. Jha, 2001). We also use co-occurrence statistics similar to the work of Hatzi-vassiloglou and McKeown (1997).

Finally, to connect foreign words to English words, we use a foreign to English dictionary. For every word in a list of foreign words, we look up its meaning in a dictionary and add an edge between the foreign word and every other English word that appeared as a possible meaning for it. 3.2 Semantic Orientation Prediction We use the multilingual network we described above to predict the semantic orientation of words based on the mean hitting time to two sets of positive and negative seeds. Given the graph G ( V, E ) , we de-scribed in the previous section, we define the transi-tion probability from node i to node j by normaliz-ing the weights of the edges out from i :
The mean hitting time h ( i | j ) is the average num-ber of steps a random walker, starting at i , will take to enter state j for the first time (Norris, 1997). Let the average number of steps that a random walker starting at some node i will need to enter a state k  X  S be h ( i | S ) . It can be formally defined as: h ( i | S ) = where p ij is the transition probability between node i and node j .

Given two lists of seed English words with known polarity, we define two sets of nodes S + and S  X  representing those seeds. For any given word w , we calculate the mean hitting time between w and the two seed sets h ( w | S +) and h ( w | S  X  ) . If h ( w | S +) is greater than h ( w | S  X  ) , the word is classified as negative, otherwise it is classified as positive. We used the list of labeled seeds from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and (Stone et al., 1966). Sev-eral other similarity measures may be used to predict whether a given word is closer to the positive seeds list or the negative seeds list (e.g. average shortest path length (Kamps et al., 2004)). However hit-ting time has been shown to be more efficient and more accurate (Hassan and Radev, 2010) because it measures connectivity rather than distance. For ex-ample, the length of the shortest path between the words  X  X ood X  and  X  X ad X  is only 5 (Kamps et al., 2004). 4.1 Data We used Wordnet (Miller, 1995) as a source of syn-onyms and hypernyms for linking English words in the word relatedness graph. We used two foreign languages for our experiments Arabic and Hindi. Both languages have a Wordnet that was constructed based on the design the Princeton English Wordnet. Arabic Wordnet (AWN) (Elkateb, 2006; Black and Fellbaum, 2006; Elkateb and Fellbaum, 2006) has 17561 unique words and 7822 synsets. The Hindi Wordnet (Narayan et al., 2002; S. Jha, 2001) has 56,928 unique words and 26,208 synsets.

In addition, we used three lexicons with words la-beled as either positive or negative. For English, we used the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966) as a source of seed labeled words. The lexicon con-tains 4206 words, 1915 of which are positive and 2291 are negative. For Arabic and Hindi we con-structed a labeled set of 300 words for each language for use in evaluation. Those sets were labeled by two native speakers of each language. We also used an Arabic-English and a Hindi-English dictionaries to generate Foreign-English links. 4.2 Results and Discussion We performed experiments on the data described in the previous section. We compare our results to two baselines. The first is the SO-PMI method de-scribed in (Turney and Littman, 2003). This method is based on finding the semantic association of any given word to a set of positive and a set of negative words. It can be calculated as follows: where w is a word with unknown polarity, hits w,pos is the number of hits returned by a com-mercial search engine when the search query is the given word and the disjunction of all positive seed words. hits pos is the number of hits when we search for the disjunction of all positive seed words. hits w,neg and hits neg are defined similarly. We used 7 positive and 7 negative seeds as described in (Tur-ney and Littman, 2003).

The second baseline constructs a network of for-eign words only as described earlier. It uses mean hitting time to find the semantic association of any given word. We used 10 fold cross validation for this experiment. We will refer to this system as HT-FR .
Finally, we build a multilingual network and use the hitting time as before to predict semantic orien-tation. We used the English words from (Stone et al., 1966) as seeds and the labeled foreign words for evaluation. We will refer to this system as HT-FR + EN .

Figure 2 compares the accuracy of the three meth-ods for Arabic and Hindi. We notice that the SO-PMI and the hitting time based methods per-form poorly on both Arabic and Hindi. This is clearly evident when we consider that the accuracy of the two systems on English was 83% and 93% re-spectively (Turney and Littman, 2003; Hassan and Radev, 2010). This supports our hypothesis that state of the art methods, designed for English, per-form poorly on foreign languages due to the limited amount of resources available in foreign languages compared to English. The figure also shows that the proposed method, which combines resources from both English and foreign languages, performs sig-nificantly better. Finally, we studied how much im-provement is achieved by including links between foreign words from global Wordnets. We found out that it improves the performance by 2 . 5% and 4% for Arabic and Hindi respectively. We addressed the problem of predicting the seman-tic orientation of foreign words. All previous work on this task has almost exclusively focused on En-glish. Applying off-the-shelf methods developed for English to other languages does not work well be-cause of the limited amount of resources available in foreign languages compared to English. We pro-posed a method based on the construction of a multi-lingual network that uses both language specific re-sources as well as the rich semantic relations avail-able in English. We then use a model that computes the mean hitting time to a set of positive and neg-ative seed words to predict whether a given word has a positive or a negative semantic orientation. We showed that the proposed method can predict semantic orientation with high accuracy. We also showed that it outperforms state of the art methods limited to using language specific resources.
