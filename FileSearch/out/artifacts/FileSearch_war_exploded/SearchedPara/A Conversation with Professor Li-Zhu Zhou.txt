 The histo ry of KDD research in China can be backtracked to the early of 1990s. At that time, Ph.D. students from a few universities and research institutions such as Tsinghua, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences etc., started to select KDD problems as their dissert ation topics. During this time, the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) started to fund KDD projects in their regular programs. This could be viewed as the first important milestone . In 1999, the 3 rd PAKDD conference  X  PAKDD 1999 was held in Beiji ng and organized by Tsinghua University. This is the first international conference in KDD area ever held in China. The conference published 66 papers and had more than 150 participants from nearly 20 countries or regions in the world. Out of the 66 papers , over 12 papers were from China, and for the 150 participants over 20% were from China. This is a remarkable event in the history of KDD in China, as it not only showed the achievements of KDD research but also promoted the KDD research in China significa ntly. After PAKDD 1999, China hosted another two PAKDD conferences in 2007 and 2011 respectively. It is very interesting to see that quite a number of student authors of the papers of PAKDD 1999 have become university professors in database and KDD area in China. So PAKDD 1999 could be viewed as the second important milestone.
 Nowadays in China, KDD is one of the hottest research areas. For years, at the National Database Conference in China, Data Mining and KDD remain as the first topic in terms of paper submissions and publications. Research groups from universities such as Tsinghua, Peking, Nanjing, Fudan, and Harbin Institute of Technology etc. are doing well in KDD research. We can easily find their publications in the major KDD conference or journals like SIGKDD, ICDM, SIAM SDM, VLDB, ICDE, SIGMOD, and TKDE. Besides research, KDD and data mining technologies are used in many applications such as Web community mining, e -business, telecommunications, finance, and many others. For instance, MobileMiner is a system developed by Peking University. It adaptively profiles users' behavior from their calling and moving record streams and provides business solutions using state -of-the -art data mining techniques based on real mobile communication data set . As anot her example, we have used the real HTML page data, applied clustering and classification algorithms to the data, and found on Chinese World Wide Web there are over 600,000 deep web databases distributed over 15 domains in science, education, sports, entert ainment, and e -commerce etc.. This finding is very informative for providing further web services based on deep web databases. The upcoming SIGKDD 2012 to be held in Beijing is an internationally top conference in KDD area. I am expecting it to become the 3rd milestone in the history of Chinese KDD research and applications. Data mining is one of our major research areas in the database lab at Tsinghua University. In 1999 I served the third PAKDD con ference in China as its Program Committee Co -Chair and organized a team from Tsinghua University to host the conference successfully . In recent years, o ur research in this area mainly focuses on various data mining algorithms and their novel applications, with particular interests in graph data mining and Web data mining. In the graph data mining research topic, we mainly investigate the problems such as coherent sub -graph mining and graph generator mining for classification. We have proposed the CLAN algor ithm for mining closed cliques, the COCAIN and COCAIN* algorithms for mining closed coherent sub -graphs from large dense graph databases, and the FOGGER algorithm for graph generator discovery, which has shown high utility in classification (e.g., image cl assification and chemical compound classification). While in terms of Web data mining, we mainly focus on the problems such as name disambiguation in digital library and Web people search, community detection in large networks, entity and relationship extr action, entity linking, populating ontology with named entities, alias discovery, and personalized recommendation systems. We have proposed two graph-based frameworks, GHOST and GRAPE, for name disambiguation in digital library and Web people search respec tively, the REACTOR framework for semantic relation extraction and tagging, a personalized Web page recommendation framework via collaborative filtering and topic -aware Markov model, and a parallel community detection algorithm on large networks. These wor ks have been published in conferences like SIGKDD, ICDE, EDBT, ICDM, WWW, CIKM, and journals like ACM TODS and ACM JDIQ. Process of KDD is very much data dependent. Today t he landscape of data is changing along various dimensions such as diversity, volume, and dynamics. Now we are in an era of Big Data and are suffering from the data deluge problems brought by the explosion of such huge amount of data. New KDD and data minin g technology is a must to help us to get out of this dilemma . In this sense , KDD communities need to develop such new technology which is challenging because of the changing landscape of data.
 In China, as IT technologies are penetrating into every aspect of our societies and life, more and more business and customer services are driven by data processing and analysis. Both data deluge problem and KDD solution requirements for conquer ing the problem are becoming clear. For example, t he ubiquitous use of Internet and computer enables Chinese people to participate and interact with each other in various web communities, such as forums, newsgroups, blogs, twitters, social websites, etc. In July of 2011, the number of Internet users in China reached to 485 mi llions, the number of mobile phone Internet users reached to 318 millions. In every 6 months, the number of twitter users is doubled. Under this situation, it is crucial for us to understand the social dynamics involved in social relations as well as to pr edict future social trends. This presents both challenges and chances for us to develop new KDD technology for investigat ing fundamental problems in social network modeling, user behaviors tracking, and evolution analysis of network structures. So far the achievements we have made are far from being satisfactory.
 As another example, according to the latest statistics, the Internet economy of the 3rd quarter of 2011 in China has reached to 71.61 billion RMB ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/tech/2011 -10/26/c_12219 9765.htm ) and the number of Internet users concerned with this economy is over hundreds of millions. As the Internet economy is emerging, however, Internet fraud presents an serious threat to its growing. From technical perspective, KDD and Data Mining has a big role to play in specific task like fraud detection, and in more general task like cleaning up the Internet economy environment.
