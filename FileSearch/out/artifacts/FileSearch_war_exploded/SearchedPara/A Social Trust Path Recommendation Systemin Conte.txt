 In recent years, Online Social Network (OSN) has been used in variety of activities, such as employment and CRM systems [1], etc , requiring evaluating the trustworthiness between two unknown participants as trust is one of the most important impact factors for participants decision making [1]. In a Contextual Online Social Network (COSN) [1] depicted in Fig. 1 , each node represen ts a participant and each link corresponds to real world interactions or online interactions between participants. Some social contexts like social trust ( T  X  [0 , 1] ) and social intimacy degree ( r  X  [0 , 1] ) could be computed between two participants to illustrate the intimacy relationship between them. In addi-tion, role impact factor ( Rou  X  [0 , 1] ) could be computed to illustrate the impact of a participant in a specific domain [1]. As each participant usually interacts with many other participants, multiple paths may exist between two participants (i.e., a source and a target) without any direct link between them, such as the path A  X  B  X  C  X  E ,and A  X  B  X  D  X  E in Fig. 1. These paths are called social trust paths which can help evaluate the trust between two unknown participants. It is computationally impossible to evaluate the trust based on all the social trust paths as it is an NP-Complete problem [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to select the optimal social trust path that can deliver the most trustworthy trust evaluation result.

In this social trust path recommendation system, we provide three types of social path selection methods. They are (1) the shortest path between a pair of source and target, (2) the path with the maximum T value based on the method proposed in [2], and (3) the optimal social trust path based on the state-of-the-art method proposed in [1] which is based on the Monte Carlo method [3]. This method considers the social contexts like T , r and Rou , and and users X  preferences. These three different types of social paths provide different angles of trus t path connection, which can effectively help evaluate the trustworthiness of participants.
 Our system is based on Struts and Hibernate, and the server runtime is Tomcat 7 and JDK 7. We use MySQL database and Mxgraph 1 to display the social network structure. Fig. 2 shows the user interface of the system, which is divided into three areas: (1) The Source-Target selection area allows an user to view the head images of participants and selects two of them as a source and the target in trust path selection. (2) The in-formation display area initially shows the whole social network structure and can also display users information and trust path selection results based on different the user X  X  operations. (3) The input area allows an user to input parameter values to select differ-ent types of social trust path. 2.1 The Source-Target Selection Area This area mainly shows the information of the participant in the social network. When an user clicks a node from the social network displayed in information display area, the corresponding participant X  X  head image will be added in this area. In addition, users can view the details personal information by clicking the head images, and can add one of them as a source or a target by clicking the corresponding buttons. 2.2 The Information Display Area When loading the system, initially, this area displays the social network structure as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, by clicking the head image in Source-Target selection area, the detailed personal information of the participant like, node ID, name, age, so-cial position, address and the friends of the participant will be shown in this area. Fig. 3 shows the personal information by clicking the head image of the participant with ID=14. Furthermore, this area can also disp lay the final path selection results as the example shown in Fig. 4.
 2.3 Input Area This area is divided into three parts. The top of the area is for users to set the simulation times of the Monte Carlo method [3] and the multiple end-to-end constraints for T , r and Rou as the requirements of the optimal social trust path selection. For example, domain of employment or set r-constraint &gt; 0 . 4 in the domain of product introduction , where T-constraint, r-constraint and Rou-constraint are the constraints of T , r and Rou respectively. In addition, the middle part is a checkbox list, which is used for users to determine which type of path they would like to find. Under the checkbox list, there is a range control for user to control the maximal length of the selected social trust path. Furthermore, at the bottom of the input area, there are two range controls for indegree and outdegree of the social network. This can help users to filter those nodes with small indegree and outdegree, and then select the social trust path in the filtered social network based on their preferences.
 Users can visit this system via the web link http://ada.suda.edu.cn:8080/social/ .After opening the user interface, an user could s elect a source and a target by clicking the nodes from the social network displayed in the information display area, and the cor-responding head images will be displayed in the Source-Target area. Then the user can input parameter information to select certain social trust paths based on his/her prefer-ences. The path selection results will be displayed in the information display area. Fig. 4 shows the three different types of social trust paths between a source (ID=18) and the target (ID=41), where T and r values are displayed on path links, and Rou values are displayed on the top of the head images. If T AB =0 , it indicates that A completely distrusts B while T AB =1 is just the reverse. r AB =0 indicates that A and B have no social relationship while r AB =1 indicates they have the most intimate social rela-tionship. Rou A =1 indicates A is a domain expert while Rou A =0 indicates that A has no knowledge in the domain. All these factor values can be computed by using data mining technique [4]. In this paper, we have introduced a novel recommendation system to find the social trust path in COSNs. Our system has provided three main path selection methods for users, i.e., the shortest path, the Max T path and the optimal social trust path. Our system could recommend diverse social trust paths to help users evaluate the trustworthiness of two unknown participants, and can be used in may applications. For example, it can be used in employment systems to help an employer find trustworthy potential employees or be used in CRM systems to help a retailer introduce products to trustworthy loyal customers.
