 1. Introduction
As people read business news they relate its content to time. That is, in addition to the semantic context, each news document has its temporal context i.e., it describes events that happened, are currently hap-pening or will happen in relation to the publication date. Although both contexts are equally important to the reader, users looking for information in digital business news archives are restricted to keyword-based searches. Searches sensitive to temporal context are either utterly neglected or narrowed down to a doc-ument publication date.

We define a temporal expression in natural language as a phrase that, given a certain reference date r refers the addressee of the message (e.g. reader) to an interval on the Gregorian calendar. For instance in a document published on December 1, 2003 ( r 0  X  12 = 1 = 2003), the phrases  X  X  X wo days ago, X  X   X  X  X ast week, X  X  or  X  X  X n November 29 X  X  would be considered valid temporal expressions. In this paper we will use the term  X  X  X emporal reference X  X  to describe such temporal expression that can be automatically projected onto the calendar.
Recent scholarly attempts of analyzing the temporal context of text documents involved extraction of temporal references from documents  X  contents. Some of the references are explicit i.e., they refer to an absolute subset of the calendar. Other references are implicit, i.e. they must be resolved onto absolute calendar references based on a certain reference point. We show later in this paper that most temporal references in business news domain are implicit references.

We restrict our considerations to the business news domain for two important reasons. First, time has a special value in business and associating certain events with the calendar is particularly important for business people (Kalczynski, 2002). Second, because of its importance, time is being referenced more often in business documents than in general domain (Kalczynski, Abramowicz, Wecel, &amp; Kaczmarek, 2003).
In this paper, we propose a new way of representing the time context of business news for the purpose of document retrieval and an extension of the traditional retrieval model to the Temporal Document Retrieval Model (TDRM).
 In the section following this introduction, the background of the model is briefly presented. Next, the
Temporal Document Retrieval Model is described, verified, and its application to the traditional keyword-based retrieval is discussed. Concluding remarks and issues for future research are presented in the last section of this paper. 2. Background 2.1. Document retrieval
Traditional document retrieval is based on the assumption that information consumers are capable of representing their needs with a set of keywords or terms. Using mathematical models, Information Re-trieval Systems try to find documents, which match user information needs by assessing the similarity between representations of documents and representations of information needs (queries). The quality of retrieval is typically measured with recall (relevant documents retrieved/all relevant documents in the collection), precision (relevant retrieved/all documents retrieved), or F-1 i.e., the harmonic mean of recall and precision (Baeza-Yates &amp; Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, p. 75). Most information retrieval models are the extensions of the Vector Space Model.
 The Vector Space Model (VSM) for document retrieval was introduced by Salton and Lesk (1968). In
VSM, the document and the query are represented as p -dimensional vectors q and d these vectors consists of terms and the corresponding weights, and p denotes the number of all terms in the system. The set of all terms in the system is referred to as the  X  X  X erm space X  X  and denoted by X . More x i 2 X and p  X k X k . The weights are assigned to terms according to one of the existing term-weighting schemes such as TF-IDF (Salton &amp; Buckley, 1988).

The similarity between a document and a query is typically assessed by determining the angular distance between the query vector and document vector in X with a cosine measure: 2.2. Temporal retrieval
While temporal aspects of structured data have been studied by many database researchers (Tansel, 1993), there are relatively few projects which accented for temporal analysis of textual documents. Similarly to the traditional document retrieval, temporal document retrieval, sometimes referred to as temporal augmentation of documents (Koen &amp; Bender, 2000), has three important aspects: 1. representation of the document content as a document index, 2. representation of user information needs as a user query, 3. similarity metrics that enable matching queries with indexes.

Generally, research projects engaging in temporal document retrieval fall into two groups, which focus either on document publication dates e.g., Allan, Papka, and Lavrenko (1998) and Swan and Allan (2000) or temporal references extracted from documents  X  contents (Abramowicz, Chmiel, Kalczynski, &amp; Wecel, 2001; Goralwalla, Leontiev, Ozsu, &amp; Szafron, 1998; Kalczynski et al., 2003; Koen &amp; Bender, 2000; Llido,
Berlanga, &amp; Aramburu, 2001). Our idea is to include both the document publication date and the in-text expressions in the retrieval model.

Most attempts to utilize time constraints in document retrieval (Abramowicz, Kalczynski, &amp; Wecel, 2002; Berlanga, Perez, Aramburu, &amp; Llido, 2001) are based on the idea of event X  X ime periods. The event X  time period is a calendar interval that represents the temporal coverage of information described by a single document. In literature, the construction of event X  X ime periods is based on the publication date of the document (Allan et al., 1998; Swan &amp; Allan, 2000) or on anchored and unanchored temporal references extracted from the document  X  s content (Kalczynski et al., 2003; Llido et al., 2001). An anchored (explicit) temporal reference is a time reference with a known location on the calendar: for example  X  X  X anuary 1, 2002 X  X  and  X  X  X arch 1999. X  X  Unanchored (inexplicit) time references such as  X  X  X n a month, X  X   X  X  X ive days ago, X  X  do not have such a location and must be linked to a reference point in order to have meaning. A typical event X  X ime period that represents the content of a whole document is a continuous calendar interval (Llido et al., 2001). Other representations include a trapezoidal fuzzy number (Abramowicz et al., 2001) and set of intervals (Kalczynski et al., 2003).

The Temporal Document Retrieval Language (TDRL) proposed by Aramburu and Berlanga (1998) extends the Object Query Language (ODMG-93) with temporal predicates thus enabling users to formulate queries based on keywords, publication dates and event X  X ime periods. TDRL is based on Temporal Object-
Oriented Organization and Retrieval (TOODOR) database model (Aramburu &amp; Berlanga, 1997). It as-sumes that an article is useful for a certain period of time, before and after which it is obsolete.
Dorr and Gaasterland (2002) introduced the Connective Generator (CONGEN) a tense-analysis module for Machine Translation (MT), in which temporal expressions are modeled as logical expressions called time-stamped literals. The literals in the form relation  X  variable in fact, temporal intervals associated with sentences or their parts. However, they associate events with time and may be useful for temporal document retrieval.

Extracting and utilizing temporal references has also been studied in medical areas with the particular focus on visualization of temporal information (Combi &amp; Chittaro, 2001; Cousins &amp; Kahn, 1991) and supporting diagnoses of certain diseases (Goralwalla et al., 1998).

Other research deals with extraction of temporal expressions (Filatova &amp; Hovy, 2001; Koen &amp; Bender, 2000; Schilder &amp; Habel, 2001; Setzer &amp; Gaizauskas, 2002; Wilson &amp; Mani, 2000) and describes both various formats of representing temporal references (e.g. TIMEX2, TimeML tags) and interesting appli-cations of the extracted data. However, they all use temporal intervals (spans) as the basic representation of temporal information carried by a single document. This approach may be very inaccurate for business news because it typically contains numerous references to dispersed calendar subsets (Kalczynski et al., 2003).

Intuitively, a calendar comprises a finite number of time units (e.g. years, quarters, months, days) re-ferred to as time granularities (Goralwalla, Leontiev, Ozsu, &amp; Szafron, 2001). Time granularities are essential in analyzing the temporal context of text documents because apart from the time intervals, they also define the importance (or weight) of references. For instance  X  X  X ast month X  X  is less precise than  X  X  X wo days ago. X  X  Granularities are unanchored durations, which can be used as units of time (Goralwalla et al., 2001). Time granularities may be compared with each other. G 1 is coarser than G 2if G 1 &gt; G 2 as a time  X  X  X ranule X  X  from Bettini, Jajodia, and Wang (2000, p. 12) that represents the actual object of a certain granularity. And so,  X  X  X uly X  X  and  X  X  X ugust X  X  are granules of the monthly granularity and  X  X  X he first week of 1999 X  X  is a granule of the weekly granularity. Perhaps the most complete formal framework for manipu-lating temporal granularities was described by Bettini et al. (2000). However this framework was designed for knowledge discovery in temporal databases it is not appropriate for analyzing the time dimension of unstructured information.

In the proposed solution, we use the granularity model only for extracting temporal references because intervals in the granularity model. Therefore, we propose a fuzzy mathematical model to represent tem-poral references in document content.

The idea of fuzzy (uncertain) sets and numbers was first introduced by Zadeh (1965). Unlike random variables, which are objective data, fuzzy numbers are subjective data; they are valuations not measures (Kaufmann &amp; Gupta, 1985, p. 14). The subjective nature of fuzzy numbers enabled us to model fuzzy perception of time in business documents (see Appendix). 3. Temporal Document Retrieval Model 3.1. General assumptions
We consider an enumerable Gregorian calendar G with day as the finest granule. A temporal reference r fits within a finite and continuous interval in G (interval of confidence) with its starting date L and ending date U such that L 6 U . The assumption of continuity is a certain limitation that requires, for instance, business weeks to be extended to calendar weeks for coarser granularities. However we will later show that it will not significantly affect the proposed model.

Recall that a temporal expression in natural language is a phrase that, given a certain reference date r refers the reader to an interval on G . Given the reference date r natural language, can be represented as temporal references in G . However, for some references the starting and ending dates ( L and U ) may not be defined with absolute certainty according to the rules defined by natural language. This uncertainty is a phenomenon that results from subjective (yet correct) perception of some temporal expressions in the natural language.

To illustrate the issue, we grouped temporal expressions by a three-degree scale of uncertainty about their bounds. Zero-degree expressions (e.g.  X  X  X ast month, X  X   X  X  X esterday X  X ) are such expression, for which both
L and U can be specified with absolute certainty according to the natural language rules. Any starting date earlier than the beginning of the previous month or ending date later than the end of the previous month can be considered irrational for  X  X  X ast month. X  X  Hence, zero-degree expressions are defined by calendar while the other one can not be specified as a fixed calendar date according to the natural language rules.
Finally, for two-degree expressions (e.g.  X  X  X ow, X  X   X  X  X n about five days X  X ) neither bound can be specified with certainty.

We require each reference r to have a valid anchor (Bettini et al., 2000, p. 12) i.e., a calendar date that belongs to the reference with absolute certainty. While for zero and one-degree expressions the fixed bound serves as an anchor, for two-degree expressions a central point C must be arbitrarily selected from the dates that are referenced by the expression with absolute certainty. And so, for  X  X  X ow X  X  the reference date r anchor while for  X  X  X n about five days, X  X  the date five days later than r reference (e.g.  X  X  X ome day X  X ) will be disregarded as irrelevant to the model. 3.2. Fuzzy perception of time X  X  X  user study
In this section we show, that human perception of temporal references in business documents is fuzzy, i.e. when asked about the interval on the calendar that represents a certain temporal expression, the respondents as a group are uncertain about its bounds. The level of uncertainty can be conveniently rep-resented by fuzzy mathematical models, such as fuzzy numbers.

In the study, the subjects were presented with a set of 34 randomly ordered temporal expressions and asked to mark days on the calendar, which they consider to be the most representative for each reference respectively. The study was repeated on another date (different weekday and week, same month) on a larger set of subjects. In total nearly 8000 intervals were marked by the subjects in both studies. The subjects were also asked additional questions about their gender, age, occupation, first language, and time organization.
The collected data were cleansed, grouped by reference and normalized in order to find the general patterns in perception of time.

The distribution of the number of days marked by the subjects in response to each temporal reference indicated that the levels of uncertainty for most studied references are not approximated well by the intervals of confidence as suggested in previous studies e.g., Abramowicz et al. (2001), Kalczynski et al. (2003), Koen and Bender (2000) and Llido et al. (2001). The classical fuzzy numbers: triangular (TFN) and trapezoidal (TrFN) were also inappropriate. Instead a different shape of the membership function that generalizes TFN and TrFN was introduced. The function was named t -zoidal because its shape resembles a trapezoid with curved arms as shown in Fig. 1. For clarity, the figure illustrates a fuzzy number in t 2 R not t 2 I .

The membership function of the t -zoidal fuzzy number A  X  X  a where t 2 I denotes calendar days sequentially numbered since 1/1/1900, and f
The parameters n ; m 2 R  X  determine the shape of arms. Note that if a equivalent to the interval of confidence and parameters n and m no longer affect the shape of the mem-bership function. For m  X  n  X  1, the t -zoidal fuzzy number becomes a TrFN and if also a number becomes a classical TFN. Generally, we define six types of temporal references classified by the number of parameters in their t -zoidal representations. Table 1 presents the complete classification.
We propose the following method to estimate the parameters of the t -zoidal fuzzy numbers. The upper bound ( a 1 ) and lower bound ( a 4 )ofthe t -zoidal membership function are set to the lower and upper bound of the user data. Other parameters ( a 2 , a 3 , n , and m ) are estimated numerically by the minimum square method to fit the data.

In order to check how the proposed membership function fits the actual data, the sums of squared errors of t -zoids were compared to those of intervals of confidence, trapezoidal, and triangular fuzzy numbers, for each reference respectively. With an average sum of squared errors of 0.6, the t -zoids were 23 times better than intervals of confidence and 5.3 times better than TrFN in representing the fuzzy perception of time.
For all references, n and m values were greater or equal to one, which means that the arms of t -zoid were either flat or curved inward for all references with a 1 6  X  a
The t -zoidal shape results from differences in individual perception of temporal granularities. When asked about  X  X  X  month ago X  X  most people point at the corresponding date in the previous month. But some will think about the week that contains that date and a small fraction X  X  X bout the whole month.
In order to check, whether temporal perception is common across various contexts, i.e., gender, age, occupation, busyness (number of hours at work/school per week) and the dominant culture we tested five hypotheses: H1: Temporal perception will not differ by gender, H2: Temporal perception will not differ by age, H3: Temporal perception will not differ by occupation, H4: Temporal perception will not differ by busyness, H5: Temporal perception will not differ by the influence of different dominant culture.

We tested 34 different temporal contexts against appropriate variables. The dependent variables were coded with a novel method (see Appendix). Since the survey data of different temporal contexts are not in normal distributions, non-parametric statistical methods are applied to test the above hypothesis.
Mann X  X hiney method is used to test temporal perception difference between two independent sam-ples. Statistical result shows that the temporal perceptions between male and female are not signifi-cantly different. Out of 34 tests of difference, there are only two temporal contexts show significant difference between male and female. Occupation information is recoded into two groups X  X  X tudent and non-student. Statistical result shows that the temporal perceptions between two occupational groups are not significantly different. Out of 34 tests of difference, there are only three temporal contexts show sig-nificant differences between different occupational groups. Busyness is measured by the number hours of work per week. Hours of works information are recoded into two groups X  X  X ubjects who work 20 h and under and subjects who work more than 20 h per week. Out of 34 different temporal contexts, four temporal contexts show significant difference between two different levels of busyness. Dominant culture is measured by the first language of the subjects. First language information is recoded into two groups English and non-English. Out of 34 different temporal contexts, temporal span of five tempo-ral contexts shows significant difference between two different language groups. Also, temporal deviation of nine temporal contexts shows significant difference between two different language groups. Since the survey questions are in English, the difference is probably due to the different understanding of survey questions.

Kruskal X  X illis test is used to test perception difference among more than two independent groups. The information of subjects  X  age is recoded into three different groups: (1) age 20 and under, (2) age between 20 and 25, and (3) age 25 and above. Statistical result shows that the temporal perceptions among different age groups are not significantly different. Out of 34 tests of difference, there are only two temporal contexts which show significant differences among the age groups. Detailed statistical results for all temporal contexts are listed in Table 2.

Although the general perception of time is commonly believed to be different across various contexts (e.g. cultural, life-style), we showed that there are no significant differences in perceiving temporal refer-ences, which occur in business news. This important conclusion enables justifying a common model for temporal retrieval of business news. 3.3. Temporal references in business news
We define a calendar space C as a finite and continuous interval in the enumerable calendar G that is limited by dates considered important for the user. Some documents refer to dates, which are not only unimportant but also create noise in the retrieval system. By introducing the calendar space C , all dates that fall beyond the bounds of C would be disregarded after converting temporal expressions into references.
For example, if a business document contains the phrase  X  X  ... this method was used since 1879 ...  X  X  and the calendar space C is defined by [1/1/1995 X 31/12/2010], the lower bound of the one-degree uncertain temporal reference representing this expression will be trimmed to 1/1/1995.

In the proposed model, the role of calendar space C can be compared to the role of the term space X in the classical Vector Space Model for document retrieval. Therefore, we will refer to days in C as to  X  X  X alendar terms X  X  or  X  X  X erms X  X  in the remainder of this paper.

In this section we propose to use the t -zoidal fuzzy numbers to represent temporal references in business news archives. But, before the references can be represented in our model, they must be extracted from the document content.

Extracting temporal expressions from the document content is a very complex task that involves text understanding and additional knowledge (Dorr &amp; Gaasterland, 2002). For instance, in order to extract the reference from  X  X  X wo days after its CEO resigned, the market value of company XYZ plunged ...  X  X  the system must possess some additional knowledge about the event that had occurred in XYZ. For these reasons, in the proposed model we will concentrate on such temporal references, which can be automati-cally extracted and projected onto the calendar. Along with the extracted temporal references, the publi-cation dates will be included in the document representation as 1-zoidal references.

We will briefly describe a slightly improved version of the Time Indexer X  X  X  tool to extract temporal references from business news (Kalczynski et al., 2003). Although more sophisticated temporal extractors for general domain have been built e.g., Time Frames (Koen &amp; Bender, 2000) for English and TOODOR (Llido et al., 2001) for Spanish, the simplicity of the Time Indexer makes it a useful tool for the purpose of presentation of TDRM.
 The Time Indexer is based on pattern matching rather than full grammatical analysis of the content.
Because certain patterns are used when referring to time in business documents, about 200 templates were implemented. A template or a meta-rule contains both vocabulary elements and variables. Selected vocabulary variables used in the Time Indexer templates are presented in Table 3.

Some examples of Time Indexer templates include:  X  X  X ack in [month] [year], X  X   X  X  X operator] [granularity], X  X   X  X  X ear-ago [number] quarter, X  X   X  X  X n [month] [year], X  X  or  X  X  X month] [day], [year]. X  X  The templates for pattern matching rules were created manually by analyzing business news archives.

In the original implementation, the Time Indexer enabled representing temporal expressions as intervals of confidence, which X  X  X n fact X  X  X ere the upper and lower bounds of references in the defined calendar space (Kalczynski et al., 2003). The transition from an expression to a calendar interval was possible thanks to the symbolic notation. The symbolic notation applied builds upon the notation proposed by Llido et al. (2001).
It is based on dates, integer numbers and symbols representing temporal granularities: d X  X  X ay, bd X  X  business day, w X  X  X eek, m X  X  X onth, q X  X  X uarter, h X  X  X alf and y X  X  X ear. For instance  X  X 5d X  X  denotes five days and  X  X 3m X  X  three months. In addition to granularities, special date variables, which represent the beginning of the granule that contains the publication date, are used. And so, rdd denotes the actual publication date, rdw stands for the first day of the week, in which the document was published, rdm X  X  X he first day of the month, rdq X  X  X uarter, etc. For example if rdd  X  12/17/02 (Tuesday), then rdw  X  12/16/02, rdm  X  12/1/02, rdq  X  10/1/02, rdh  X  7/1/02, and rdy  X  1/1/02.

Such a simple notation and two operators ( X  X + X  X  and  X  X  )  X  X ) enabled translating most temporal expressions into time intervals. For example  X  X  X ast week X  X  may be translated into  X  X  X dw month X  X  into  X  X  X dm + 1m,rdm + 2m ) 1d. X  X  The main advantage of this notation is that it is human-under-standable. This enables manual definition of meta-rules. The notation has been extended in order to make the indexer compliant with the t -zoidal references.

Two corpora of business news: (1) CNN/FN with approximately 7000 documents and (2) TREC/FT with over 118,000 documents were analyzed with the improved Time Indexer to determine the number of temporal references of certain categories (see Table 4).

The results of the study justify the selection of the business news domain for the model. With an average of 10.2 (recall: 75.74%, precision: 74.70%) references per document for CNN/FN, the business domain is more useful for temporal retrieval than general domain with 6.6 (recall: 93.85%, precision: 87.5%) reference per document (Koen &amp; Bender, 2000).

Not surprisingly, the majority of extracted references were 2-and 1-zoidal, thus the most precise in terms of the proposed model. The study shows that about 10% (8.9% in CNN/FN and 9.7% in TREC/FT) of temporal references found in news documents cannot be conveniently represented as 1-and 2-zoids, yet they still provide important temporal information to people who read business news. As we showed earlier, these references can be conveniently represented as fuzzy numbers and used for document retrieval. Hence, the use of more complex representation of temporal references, such as a fuzzy number, is justified. Table 4 presents the complete results of the study.

In most cases, the parameters of the precise (1-zoidal) references and the intervals (2-zoidal) can be estimated from the publication date and the references themselves. However, a larger user study is required to estimate the remaining unknown parameters of 3, 4, 5, and 6-zoidal references. Based on the user study presented in the previous section, we conjecture that certain groups of references have common or scalable parameters. For instance, some references may prove to be symmetrical on the same granularity level, e.g. early/late last/this/next month.

Finally, let T j denote the TDRM document representation or temporal index that consists of the 1-zoidal reference to the publication date r 0 and a set of t -zoidal references f r temporal references extracted from the content of the document d 3.4. Vector Space Model for temporal retrieval
In TDRM the query Q is defined as a set of precise references to the finest granules X  X  X ays. This is because we assume that users can precisely identify the intervals on the calendar when they specify queries.
Hence, from the user point of view, the uncertainty applies only to temporal references in documents, which are authored by and meant for different people. While querying the collection of documents the users are certain about the subset of the calendar space C they are interested in. Therefore, a user query is a set
Q  X f q 1 ; q 2 ; ... ; q m g , where q i denotes the 1-zoidal reference (calendar day) such that l  X  q i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; m .

Notice that the queries are not intervals but sets of calendar terms. Thus, the notation enables encoding queries, which represent non-continuous intervals such as  X  X  X t the beginning of each month X  X  or  X  X  X very
Friday. X  X  All queries are limited by the bounds of the calendar space C . Because calendar terms are mutually independent, we will use the classical Vector Space Model to match document representations with user queries.

Recall we have a user query Q  X f q 1 ; q 2 ; ... ; q m g and a temporal index T d . These representations are not comparable and before the principles of VSM are applied to temporal retrieval, the temporal index must be projected onto the calendar space C .

Unlike keywords, that either occur in the document or not, calendar terms may partially match temporal references in documents due to the fuzzy nature of some temporal references. For example, a single day specified in the user query occurs in  X  X  X ast month, X  X   X  X  X arly last week X  X  and  X  X  X esterday X  X  but the match is different for each of these references. Again, we apply the mathematical model of uncertainty to represent the match between a single calendar term and a temporal reference.

For precise (1-zoidal and 2-zoidal) references of coarser granularities (e.g. last week, next month or this year), it is relatively easy to represent how well they match a single calendar day. Because  X  X  X ast week X  X  typically means  X  X  X ny day last week, X  X  the probability that a given day matches the reference may be computed as the reciprocal of the number of days in the granule. And so, for  X  X  X ast/this/next week X  X  the match between a query term and a precise reference can be represented by the probability that the calendar term belongs to the reference. Conversely, imprecise (3, 4, 5, and 6-zoidal) references are affected by user uncertainty. And so, we propose the following scheme for representing the match between a single calendar term c i and a t -zoidal temporal reference r k :
The match o i ; k returns values from  X  0 ; 1 . It brings together the shape and the span of the membership  X  X  X ate in July X  X  or  X  X  X  few days ago, X  X  for which the granularity model does not apply. Note that for the most (2-zoidal) the match returns the reciprocal of the probability of occurrence. Thus, in TDRM the match o represents the occurrence of calendar term c i in a temporal reference such that o rence, o i ; k  X  1 X  X  X ull occurrence and any value between zero and one represents the partial occurrence of c in r k . Hence, o i ; k is derived from the fuzzy representation of uncertainty in temporal perception. As it projects t -zoidal references onto the calendar space C , the proposed match o transition from the fuzzy representations of temporal references to the classical Vector Space Model.
Moreover, all temporal references are represented by the maximum of six parameters and computing o a t -zoidal reference is quite easy.

Further, we adopt the classical Term Frequency X  X  X nverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scheme (Salton &amp; Buckley, 1988) for weighting calendar terms in documents and queries. In general, a document matches a temporal query better if days specified in the query occur more frequently in the temporal index than other days. More formally, let K j denote the number of temporal references in document d raw frequency of calendar term c i in document d j is given by
Unlike in the classical Vector Space Model, where frequency of terms is represented by a natural number, in our model freq i ; j 2 R  X  . The remaining elements of the model: assigning weights to terms and ranking the documents for a specified query have not been changed in TDRM. However, in order to make the model complete, we briefly describe them below.

Let N denote the number of documents in the system and n i calendar term c k occurs. The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of term c
Finally, the TF-IDF weight of calendar term c i in document d  X  max L freq L ; j  X  , where the maximum is computed over all calendar terms, which are mentioned in the body of d j (Baeza-Yates &amp; Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, p. 29). Similarly, the TF-IDF weights of calendar terms in the query are given by w i ; q  X  idf i  X  0 : 5  X  0 : 5 freq Finally, the temporal similarity between the user query and document is given by one of the Vector
Space Model similarity metrics, such as cosine (1). The value of sim  X  d the collection provides a ranking for these documents. 3.5. Verification
An additional user study was conducted to determine the matches among 15 pre-defined queries and 50 documents randomly selected from the TREC Financial Times (TREC/FT) collection. Sixteen subjects who participated in the study were asked to find temporal expressions in each document and then to specify whether the document was relevant to each of the 15 queries or not. Subjects relevancy decisions were not unanimous in 60% of cases, mostly due to uncertainty about the bounds of some references. However, when the 20/80 rule was applied to filter out noise i.e., decisions of the users who determined the match against the majority were overridden, 81.5% of answers were unanimous. So, in order to build a reference set, the voting system was used to determine the matches between documents and queries i.e., in case of incon-sistencies each user  X  s answer counted as one vote. Eight document X  X uery pairs were excluded from the collection due to ties. As a result a small reference set based on TREC/FN with 742 document X  X uery pairs emerged.

The proposed retrieval method (TDRM) was evaluated and compared with the trapezoidal event X  X ime periods using the average recall, average precision, and F-1 measures. While the recall values were com-parable for both models, TDRM proved to be more precise than the previous approach, hence the higher
F-1 value. Table 5 summarizes the results. 4. Applications
Applying temporal context to business news retrieval can significantly improve overall precision by subsetting the number of documents to be searched with the keyword-based retrieval query (Kalczynski, 2002). Briefly, the idea is based on the assumption that people, who read business news, relate its content to time. Hence, the temporal context can be specified for all keyword-based queries in a business news domain. What is more, temporal constraints are superior to semantic constraints.

We assumed that users, who seek information using a retrieval system, are certain about the time context of information they are searching for. Therefore, fuzzy representations do not apply to queries. Specifying a query in TDRM can be compared to marking certain days (not necessary in a sequence) on the calendar.
And so, queries such as  X  X  X arch 2003, X  X   X  X  X ummer holidays 2002, X  X  or  X  X  X omorrow X  X  can be conveniently represented in TDRM. The days marked down on the calendar i.e., selected for the query, represent the temporal context of user  X  s information needs.

Documents which do not contain references, whose intervals of confidence  X  a lap with the specified temporal context, are automatically excluded from the keyword-based search. In this way, the average precision of keyword-based retrieval is significantly improved for high-recall
Time Indexers. With time extractors of 90% or more recall (valid extracted references/valid references in the collection) reported by Koen and Bender (2000) and Llido et al. (2001), the loss of average recall (relevant documents returned/all relevant documents in the collection) can be neglected (Kalczynski, 2002). 5. Discussion
The paper introduces t -zoidal fuzzy representations of temporal expressions in business news and pro-poses a document retrieval model based on the classical Vector Space Model. The t -zoidal fuzzy numbers proved to be very accurate in describing fuzzy perception of temporal context of business news. However, 8.4% of user data were excluded as incorrect because they violated either the upper or the lower bound of the reference defined by the natural language rules. The noteworthy is that for 32 out of 34 references there was at least one incorrect answer and 208 out of 239 (87%) subjects provided at least one incorrect answer.
In addition, 2.5% of references marked by users had to be excluded because they were not continuous. This shows that the perception of temporal references is far more complex than its mathematical descriptions proposed thus far. The users were not instructed whether they should consider weeks as business weeks or calendar weeks. The small fraction of non-continuous intervals shows that most users perceive temporal references in business news as traditional calendar references rather than business calendar references. Yet, phrases such as  X  X  X ext business day X  X  or  X  X  X ast weekend X  X  can be included in the model without violating the continuity of the intervals of confidence  X  a 1 ; a 4 .

So far we have identified 194 templates to extract temporal references from business news. These tem-plates produced 7057 distinct patterns when applied to a large collection of business news. However, a larger study of the perception of other expressions should be performed to estimate the missing parameters of the t -zoidal representation of temporal references. The study could also reveal some additional rela-tionships between the parameters of t -zoids, such as e.g. the symmetry between  X  X  X arly in [month] X  X  and  X  X  X ate
The present work offers a rather limited verification of the retrieval results obtained with TDRM. We believe that building a large test collection for temporal retrieval, similar to known test collections for traditional retrieval (e.g. TREC) is essential for comparing the efficiency of various temporal retrieval models.

We realize that pattern matching extractors are incapable of resolving certain references which require additional knowledge (e.g.  X  X  X n the first week of its fiscal year, the company XYZ ...  X  X ), and some complex references with auxiliary words. On the other hand, these problems gradually reduce as more and more sophisticated grammatical parsers are being developed.
 6. Conclusions and future work
Previous approaches to temporal retrieval were based on the intervals of confidence. We showed that such a representation is inaccurate for 10% of references and may reduce the efficiency of the retrieval system. Also, the previous models assumed that the temporal context of the whole document and a user query can be represented by a simple structure such as a calendar interval or a single trapezoidal fuzzy number. With the introduction of t -zoidal fuzzy numbers and the adoption of the Vector Space Model for temporal retrieval, we not only created more precise representations of temporal references but also enabled ranking a collection of documents after performing a user query.

Although the proposed model describes document retrieval using temporal information alone, it can be extended to a retrieval model that includes both the semantic and temporal context. Such a model would enable retrieving documents, which describe the events that are important to the user in a certain time context. We also believe that such a model could be built without the full grammatical analysis of text.
Instead, linking events and objects that occur in a single sentence to temporal references in the same sentence could prove to be sufficiently accurate. However, additional research in this area should be per-formed to verify this hypothesis.
 Appendix A.1. Fuzzy numbers
We will define the fuzzy number after Kaufmann and Gupta (1985, p. 11). Let R denote the set of real numbers, I  X  X  X he set of integer numbers, and @  X  X  X he set of natural numbers.
 defined by the characteristic function 8 xE : l A  X  x  X 2 0 ; 1.
 The characteristic function of an ordinary subset of E shows that its element either belongs ( l or does not belong ( l A  X  x  X  X  0) to A .
 membership function, which takes its values in the interval  X  0 ; 1 ; 8 x 2 E : l
Definition 3. A fuzzy number in R is a fuzzy subset of R that is convex i.e., 8 x  X  1 k  X  x 2 P l A  X  x 1  X ^ l A  X  x 2  X 8 k 2 X  0 ; 1 , and normal i.e., 9 x : l
According to the above definition, a fuzzy number is an extension of the interval of confidence in E .In fact if 8 x 6  X  0 : l A  X  x  X  X  1 the fuzzy number A is an interval of confidence. Other common shapes of the membership function are triangular and trapezoidal (Kaufmann &amp; Gupta, 1985).
 A.2. Framework for the user study
In order to prove that the fuzzy perception of time in business documents can be considered common for all users, we have defined the following framework.

Recall that for each survey question (reference) i we have an anchor i.e., the upper bound U lower bound L i or central point C i . For each of the 34 survey questions we have answers from m subjects.
Each answer j to question i has its starting point  X  t i ; j has been applied. All answers which go beyond any of the bounds are disregarded as invalid. In other words:
All answers with central points, which do not contain their central points, are disregarded:
The number of answers for each reference i is now lowered down to m reference, for each rational answer we compute the distance from anchor given by
Note that D i ; j  X  R  X  [f 0 g is specified in calendar days. Next, we compute the mean distance D reference and, for each rational answer, the deviation from the mean distance d span are mutually independent, we use them as the dependent variables for testing the hypotheses. References
