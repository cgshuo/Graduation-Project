Information Systems and Natural Language Processing are fundamental areas of research and development in informat-ics. The combination of both is an exciting and future-oriented field which is successfully addressed by the NLDB conference series since 1995. There are still many open research questions but also an increasing number of interesting solutions and approaches.

NLDB 2006 with its high quality contributions tersely has reflected the current discussion and research: natural language and/or ontology based information retrieval, question answering methods, dialog processing, query processing as well as ontology-and concept creation from natural language. Furthermore, some papers presented newest methods for parsing, entity recognition and language identification which are important for many of the topics mentioned before.
Among these interesting papers four specifically exciting papers where selected for this special Data and Knowledge Engi-neering issue. They were extended by the authors to give the reader a deeper insight into their work. It is our pleasure to introduce briefly each of them. As the reader will see, each reflects a hot topic of the NLDB community: matching unstructured information (e.g. available on the web) with structured information in the medical domain, obtaining the most relevant information when querying the web, to resolve the language barrier on the web, query reformulation to improve the results of a query.

In medical domains it is crucial that a support exists, with which physicians and other involved people can quickly and easily compare provided knowledge from clinical trials with their own data. Such information most often is poorly struc-tured and therefore provided in an unstructured form. Thus, valuable and effective support could be provided by extracting the desired and appropriate information (i.e. eligibility criteria) and matching tese against medical data in patient records. David Embley ) presents a system that focuses on this important topic. As the basis for clinical trials, the authors use a corpus which is available on the web. In order to get a logical query from textual information and match it against a medical record, both natural language processing and database techniques were combined.

Although search engines become more powerful to search for the right information, users still get a lot of information which they do not really need. The problem occurs because search terms have different meanings in different domains. The approach presented in the paper  X  X  Improving web-query processing through semantic knowledge  X  (by Jordi Conesa, Veda C. Storey and Vijayan Sugumaran ) offers a solution to this problem. They propose to use WordNet and ResearchCyc to relate terms with the several domains in which they are used. By combining the different domains using semantic and linguistic knowledge, more relevant query results can be obtained.

The World Wide Web has become an important information base. With its increasing importance for information sharing and its general acceptance also a lot of non-English speaking people use the web either searching for information, or pro-viding it. Approaches that overcome the language barrier will therefore become a necessity. The approach presented in the paper  X  X  A parametric linguistics based approach for cross-lingual web querying  X ( by Epaminondas Kapetanios, Vijayan Sugumaran and Diana Tanase ) proposes a solution to this problem since it can be applied to any language, it is not dependent on the structure of the target documents and it is based on a more general definition of a  X  X  X pace of words X .
Even when querying the web with the same language, a user will not always get the adequate answer and result. The reason for this often can be found in the query itself. If the query is reformulated to comprise semantically equivalent answer patterns, then the adequate answer will certainly appear. The paper  X  X  Improving the performance of question answering with semantically equivalent answer patterns  X ( by Leila Kosseim and Jamileh Yousefi ) demonstrates that the generation of equivalent answer patterns based on semantic constraints can improve the performance of a question-answering system. volved in the conference organization and the organization of this special issue. First we thank all authors for their valuable contributions. Secondly, we once again thank all members of the Program Committee for their detailed reviews and discus-sion. Furthermore we thank the following people for their substantial organizational collaboration for the conference: Ker-stin J X rgl, Christine Seger, Klothilde Puschl, Stefan Ellersdorfer, J X rgen V X hringer and Christian Winkler. Finally the editors thank Reind van de Riet who has supported us with his experience and knowledge.
