Geometry and Meaning is an interesting book about a relationship between geometry and logic defined on certain types of abstract spaces and how that intimate relation-ship might be exploited when applied in computational linguistics. It is also about an approach to information retrieval, because the analysis of natural language, especially negation, is applied to problems in IR, and indeed illustrated throughout the book by simple examples using search engines. It is refreshing to see IR issues tackled from a different point of view than the standard vector space (Salton, 1968). It is an enjoyable read, as intended by the author, and succeeds as a sort of tourist guide to the subject in hand.
 tary concepts from mathematics: graph theory, linear algebra (especially vector spaces), lattice theory, and logic. These concepts are well motivated and illustrated with good examples, mostly of a classificatory or taxonomic kind. One of the major goals of the book is to argue that non-classical logic, in the form of a quantum logic, is a candidate for analyzing language and its underlying logic, with a promise that such an approach could lead to improved search engines. The argument for this is aided by copious references to early philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians, creating the impression that when Aristotle, Descartes, Boole, and Grassmann were laying the foundations for taxonomy, analytical geometry, logic, and vector spaces, they had a more flexible and broader view of these subjects than is current. This is especially true of logic. Thus the historical approach taken to introducing quantum logic (chapter 7) is to show that this particular kind of logic and its interpretation in vector space were inherent in some of the ideas of these earlier thinkers.
 Grassmann X  X  Ausdehnungslehre was largely ignored and left in obscurity. Whether Aristotle was never admired for his mathematics I am unable to judge, but certainly Alfred North Whitehead (1925) was not complimentary when he said:
Middle Ages. If only the schoolmen had measured instead of classifying, how much they might have learnt! (page 41)
On the other hand, Grassmann was recognized for his foundational work on analytical geometry; for example, Hermann Weyl (1949) comments: following the procedure of Grassmann X  X  Ausdehnungslehre. (page 68)
Weyl of course contributed extensively to quantum mechanics and already then held the view that  X  X lassical logic does not fit in with quantum physics and is to be replaced by a kind of  X  X uantum logic X   X  (page 263). More recently Suppes et al. (1989) refer to Grassmann X  X  ground-breaking work on geometrical structures, which are now called Grassmann Structures. I think the case for Grassmann X  X  obscurity is unproven. tise in mathematics and logic to prepare them for the novel work presented on quantum logic and concept lattices in Chapters 7 and 8 (but see Courant and Robbins [1941] and
Marciszewski [1981] for further introductory material). The elementary concepts are well illustrated with examples from search engines and with problems of ambiguity of words. The  X  X iller application X  for quantum logic in chapter 7 is the modeling of negation, and in chapter 8 the interpretation of taxonomic structures as non-Boolean lattices. In both cases the applications are convincing. The basis for the representation in quantum logic is the lattice of subspaces of a vector space endowed with a geometry which determines a logic (Birkhoff and von Neumann 1936). It is a pity that Widdows did not complete the story, which was started by Birkhoff and von Neumann, and introduce the probability measure on this lattice of subspaces. One of the striking results in quantum theory is that this can be done consistently and uniquely (Gleason 1957). Von Neumann was well aware of this although he could not prove it; in 1954, he said:
In other words, probability corresponds precisely to introducing the angles geometrically. Fur-thermore, there is only one way to introduce it. The more so because in the quantum mechanical by a linear set of vectors, corresponds to the orthogonal complement of this linear space. (von Neumann, 1954, reproduced in R  X  edei and St  X  olzner 2001, page 244)
Had probability been introduced, and therefore the role of measurement, it would have helped explain the somewhat tantalizing expression on page 238:  X  X t follows that every  X  X xperimental proposition X  in a quantum mechanical system corresponds twice in passing. Returning to Whitehead and his beef about Aristotle, when he com-plains about Aristotle not  X  X easuring, X  one needs to take this seriously because the machinery of quantum mechanics and its observables only makes sense when one con-siders the observation of attributes with a probability of success or failure. Heisenberg X  X  uncertainty principle, one of the foundation stones of quantum mechanics, was about observables and their probabilistic interaction. A quantum logic without a theory of observation (or interaction) is somewhat empty. Readers might like to pursue this line of reasoning by consulting Beltrametti and Cassinelli (1981), one of the seminal works on quantum logic.

 Appendix: Wider Reading
Possibly the most outstanding reference to numerical taxonomy is Sneath and Sokal (1973). For a more up-to-date and appropriate reference to information retrieval, I would propose Belew (2000). The use and application of non-classical logic in IR is well covered by Crestani et al (1998). An extremely relevant set of papers on quantum logic, in that they deal with taxonomy and various conditionals  X  for example, the Stalnaker conditional  X  are the papers by Hardegree, especially Hardegree (1976).
His 1982 paper on natural kinds covers similar territory to Widdows X  discussion on  X  X xtent X  and  X  X ntent X  and its mathematical duality. An excellent source for papers on developments in quantum logic is Beltrametti and van Fraassen (1981). A critical view of the quantum logic enterprise is Gibbins (1987). To plug the gap on measurement in quantum mechanics one can do no better than Wheeler and Zurek (1983).
 concepts needed in his book, there is room for some more guidance on where to go next.
An excellent introduction to the broad field of mathematics, each chapter written by one of the masters of the field, is Newman (1988). More specifically, good introductions to the foundations of vector spaces can be found in Halmos (1958), and Isham (1989). CSLI, introduced quantum logic as part of his work on information flow (Barwise and Seligman 1997).
