 While users disseminate various information in the open and widely distributed environment of the Semantic Web, deter-mination of who shares access to particular information is at the center of looming privacy concerns. We propose a real-world-oriented information sharing system that uses social networks. The system automatically obtains users X  social relationships by mining various external sources. It also en-ables users to analyze their social networks to provide aware-ness of the information dissemination process. Users can de-termine who has access to particular information based on the social relationships and network analysis.

With the current development of tools and sites that en-able users to create Web content, users have become able to easily disseminate various information. For example, users create Weblogs, which are diary-like sites that include var-ious public and private information. Furthermore, the past year has witnessed the emergence of social networking sites that allow users to maintain an online network of friends or associates for social or business purposes. Therein, data related to millions of people and their relationships are pub-licly available on the Web.

Although these tools and sites enable users to easily dis-seminate information on the Web, users sometimes have dif-ficulty in sharing information with the right people and fre-quently have privacy concerns because it is difficult to de-termine who has access to particular information on such applications. Some tools and applications provide control over information access. For example, Friendster, a huge social networking site, offers several levels of control from  X  X ublic information X  to  X  X nly for friends X . However, it pro-vides only limited support for access control.

An appropriate information sharing system that enables all users to control the dissemination of their information is needed to use tools and sites such as Weblog, Wiki, and social networking services fully as an infrastructure of dis-seminating and sharing information. In the absence of such a system, a user would feel unsafe and would therefore be discouraged from disseminating information.

How can we realize such an information sharing system on the Web? One clue exists in the information sharing processes of the real world. Information availability is often closely guarded and shared only with the people of one X  X  social relationships. Confidential project documents which have limited distribution within a division of company, might be made accessible to other colleagues who are concerned with the project. Private family photographs might be shared not only with relatives, but also with close friends. A pro-fessor might access a private research report of her student. We find that social relationships play an important role in the process of disseminating and receiving information. This paper presents a real-world oriented information sharing sys-tem using social networks. It enables users to control the information dissemination process within social networks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: sec-tion 2 describes the proposed information sharing system using social networks. In section 3, we describe the appli-cation of our system. Finally, we conclude this paper in section 4.
Figure 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed informa-tion sharing system. The system functions as a  X  X lug-in X  for applications so that external applications enable users to leverage social networks to manage their information dis-Figure 1: Architecture of the proposed information sharing system semination. A user can attach an access control list to his content using his social network when creating content on an application. Then, when the application receives a re-quest to access the content, it determines whether to grant the request based on the access control list.

Because users determine the access control to informa-tion based on the social network, the system requires social network data. The system obtains users X  social networks au-tomatically by mining various external sources such as Web, emails, and sensor information; subsequently, it maintains a database of the social network information. Users can adjust the network if necessary.

The system enables users to analyze their social network to provide awareness of the information dissemination pro-cess within the social network. Using social relationships and the results of social network analyses, users can decide who can access their information.

Currently, the proposed system is applied to an academic society because researchers have various social relationships (e.g., from a student to a professor, from a company to a uni-versity) through their activities such as meetings, projects, and conferences. Importantly, they often need to share var-ious information such as papers, ideas, reports, and sched-ules. Sometimes, such information includes private or con-fidential information that ought only to be shared with ap-propriate people. In addition, researchers have an interest in managing the information availability of their social re-lationships. The information of social relationships of an academic society, in particular computer science, is easily available online to a great degree. Such information is im-portant to obtain social networks automatically.

Hereafter, we explain in detail how social networks are modeled, extracted and analyzed. Then we explain how users can decide to control information access using social networks.
With the variety of social relationships that exist in the real world, a salient problem has surfaced: integration and consolidation on a semantic basis. The representation of social relationships must be sufficiently fine-grained that we can capture all details from individual sources of information in a way that these can be recombined later and taken as evidence of a certain relationship.

Several representations of social relationships exist. For example, social network sites often simplify the relationship as  X  X riend X  or  X  X cquaintance X . In the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) [1] vocabulary, which is one of the Semantic Web X  X  largest and most popular ontologies for describing people and whom they know, many kinds of relationships between people are deliberately simplified as  X  X nows X  relations. A rich ontological consideration of social relationships is needed for characterization and analysis of individual social net-works.
 We define two kinds of social relationship (Fig. 2) [7]. The first basic structure of social relationship is a person X  X  participation in an event. Social relationships come into ex-istence through events involving two or more individuals. Such events might not require personal contact, but they must involve social interaction. From this event, social re-lationships begin a lifecycle of their own, during which the characteristics of the relationship might change through in-teraction or the lack thereof. An event is classified as perdu-rant in the DOLCE ontology [6], which is a popular ontology. For example, an event might be a meeting, a conference, a baseball game, a walk, etc. Assume that person A and per-son B participate in Event X . In that situation, we note that A and B share an event co-participation relationship under event X .

A social relationship might have various social roles asso-ciated with it. For example, a student-professor relationship within a university setting includes an individual playing the role of a professor; another individual plays the role of a stu-dent. If A and B take the same role to Event X ,theyarein a same role relationship under event X (e.g., students at a class, colleagues in a workspace). If A cannot take over B role or vice versa, A and B are in a role-sharing relationship (e.g., a professor and students, a project leader and staff).
Another kind of social relationship is called a common property relationship . Sharing the same property value gen-erates a common property relationship between people. For example, person A and person B have a common working place, common interests, and common experiences. Conse-quently, they are in a common property relationship with regard to those common properties.
If two persons are in either an event co-participation re-lationship or a common property relationship, they often communicate. The communication media can be diverse: face-to-face conversation, telephone call, email, chat, online communication on Weblogs, and so on. If we wish to dis-cover the social relationship by observation, we must es-timate relationships from superficial communication. The emerging field of social network mining provides methods for discovering social interactions and networks from legacy sources such as web pages, databases, mailing lists, and per-sonal emails.

Currently, we use three kinds of information sources to ob-tain social relationships using mining techniques. From the Web, we extract social networks using a search engine and the co-occurrence of two persons X  names on the Web. Conse-quently, we can determine the following relationships among researchers: Coauthor, Same affiliation, Same project, Same event (participants of the same conference, workshop, etc.) [8]. Coauthor and Same event correspond to an event co-participation relationship. Same affiliation and same project correspond to a common property relationship. We are also using other sources such as email and sensors (we are devel-oping a device that detects users within social spaces such as parties and conferences) to obtain social relationships.
Necessarily, the quality of information obtained by mining is expected to be inferior to that of manually authored pro-files. We can reuse those data if a user has already declared his relationships in FOAF or profiles of social networking services. Although users might find it difficult and demand-ing to record social relations, it would be beneficial to ask users to provide information to obtain social relationships.
In addition to the relationship type, another factor of the social relationship is tie strength. Tie strength itself is a complex construct of several characteristics of social rela-tions. It is definable as affective, frequency, trust, comple-mentarity, etc. No consensus for defining and measuring them exists, which means that people use different elicita-tion methods when it comes to determining tie strength. For example, Orkut, a huge social networking service, al-lows description of the strength of friendship relations on a five-point scale from  X  X aven X  X  met X  to  X  X est friend X , whereas other sites might choose other scales or terms.
 In our system, we use trust as a parameter of tie strength. Trust has several very specific definitions. In [4], Golbeck describes trust as credibility or reliability in a human sense:  X  X ow much credence should I give to what this person speaks about X  and  X  X ased on what my friends say, how much should I trust this new person? X  In the context of information shar-ing, trust can be regarded as reliability regarding  X  X ow a person will handle my information X . Users can give trust directly in a numerical value to a person in his relation. Alternatively, trust is obtainable automatically as authori-tativeness of each person using the social network [8].
The obtained social network data are integrated as ex-tended FOAF files and stored in database. Users can adjust networks if needed (Fig. 3). The social relationship and its tie strength become guiding principles when a user deter-mines an access control list to information.
The system enables users to analyze their social networks to provide awareness of the information dissemination pro-cess within the social network.

Social network analysis (SNA) is distinguishable from other fields of sociology by its focus on relationships between ac-tors rather than attributes of actors, a network view, and a belief that structure affects substantive outcomes. Be-cause an actor X  X  position in a network affects information dissemination, SNA provides an important implication for information sharing on the social network. For example, oc-cupying a favored position means that the actor will have better access to information, resources, and social support.
The SNA models are based on graphs, with graph mea-sures, such as centrality, that are defined using a sociological interpretation of graph structure. Freeman proposes numer-ous ways to measure centrality [2]. Considering a social net-work of actors, the simplest measure is to count the number of others with whom an actor maintains relations. The ac-tor with the most connections, the highest degree, is most central. This measure is called degreeness . Another mea-sure is closeness , which calculates the distance from each actor in the network to every other actor based on connec-tions among all network members. Central actors are closer to all others than are other actors. A third measure is be-tweenness , which examines the extent to which an actor is situated among others in the network, the extent to which Figure 5: Web site for sharing research information information must pass through them to get to others, and consequently, the extent to which they are exposed to infor-mation circulation within the network. If the betweenness of an actor is high, it frequently acts as a local bridge that connects the individual to other actors outside a group. In terms of network ties, this kind of bridge is well known as Granovetter X  X   X  X eak tie X  [5], which contrasts with  X  X trong tie X  within a densely-closed group.

As the weak tie becomes a bridge between different groups, a large community often breaks up to a set of closely knit group of individuals, woven together more loosely accord-ing to occasional interaction among groups. Based on this theory, social network analysis offers a number of cluster-ing algorithms for identifying communities based on network data.

The system provides users with these network analyses (Fig. 4) so that they can decide who can access their infor-mation. For example, if user wants to diffuse her informa-tion, she might consider granting access to a person (with certain trust) who has both high degreeness and between-ness. On the other hand, she must be aware of betweenness when the information is private or confidential. Clustering is useful when a user wishes to share information within a certain group.
To demonstrate and evaluate our system, we developed a community site (Fig. 5) using communication tools such as Weblogs, Wikis, and Forums. By that system, studies from different organizations and projects can be disseminated and their information thereby shared. Users can share various information such as papers, ideas, reports, and schedules at the site. Our system is integrated into a site that provides access control to that information. Integrating our system takes advantage of the open and information nature of the communication tools. It also maintains the privacy of the content and activities of those applications.

Users can manage their social networks (Fig. 3) and at-tach the access control list to their content (e.g., Blog en-tries, profiles, and Wiki pages) using extracted social rela-tionships and social network analysis (Fig. 4).

Once a user determines the access control list, she can save it as her information access policy for corresponding content. The access policy is described using extended eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) and is stored in a database. She can reuse and modify the previous policy if she subsequently creates a similar content.

One feature of our system is that it is easily adaptable to new applications because of its plug-and-play design. We are planning to integrate it into various Web sites and ap-plications such as social network sites and RSS readers.
Goecks and Mynatt propose a Saori infrastructure that also uses social networks for information sharing [3]. They obtain social networks from users X  email messages and pro-vide sharing policies based on the type of information. We obtain social networks from various sources and integrate them into FOAF files. This facilitates the importation and maintenance of social network data. Another feature is that our system enables users to analyze their social networks. Thereby, users can control information dissemination more effectively and flexibly than through the use of pre-defined policies.
 As users increasingly disseminate their information on the Web, privacy concerns demand that access to particular in-formation be limited. We propose a real-world oriented information sharing system using social networks. It en-ables users to control the information dissemination process within social networks, just as they are in the real world. Future studies will evaluate the system with regard to how it contributes to wider and safer information sharing than it would otherwise. We will also develop a distributed system that can be used fully on the current Web. [1] D. Brickley and L. Miller. FOAF: the  X  X riend of a [2] L. C. Freeman. Centrality in social networks: [3] J.
