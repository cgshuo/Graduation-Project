 Reordering for SMT is first propose d in IBM mo d-els ( B rown et al., 1993), usually called IBM co n-straint model , where the movement of words during translation is modeled. S oon after, Wu (1997) proposed an ITG (I nversion Transdu c tion G rammar) model for SMT, called ITG co n straint model , where t he reorde r ing of words or phrases is constrained to two kinds: straight and inverted . In order to further improve the reordering perfo r-mance, many structure -based methods are pr o-posed, including the reordering model in hierarchical phrase -based SMT systems (Chiang, 2005) and syntax -based SMT systems (Zhang et al., 2007; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Ge, 2010; Vi s-weswariah et al., 2010). Although the sentence structure has been taken into consi d eration , these methods don  X  t explicitly make use of the strong correl ations between words , such as co l locations, which can effectively indicate reordering in the target la n guage.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to i m-prove the reordering for SMT by estimating the reordering score of the source -language colloc a-tions (source collocations for short in this paper). Given a bilingual corpus, the collocations in the source sentence are first detected automatically using a monolingual word alignment (MWA) m e-thod without employing additional resources (Liu et al., 2009), and then the reordering model based on the detected collocations is learned from the word -aligned bilingual corpus. The source colloc a-tion based reordering model is integrated into SMT sy s tems as an additional feature to softly constrain the translation order s of the source collocations in the sentence to be translated, so as to constrain the translation orders of those source phrases contai n-ing these collocated words.

This method has two advantages: (1) it can a u-tomatically detect and leverage collocated word s in a sentence, including long -distance collocated words; (2) such a reordering model can be int e-grated into any SMT systems without resort ing to any additional resources.
 el in a phrase -based SMT system, and the evalu a-tion results show that our method significantly improves translation quality. As co m pared to the baseline systems, an absolute improvement of 1.1~1.4 BLEU score is achieved. 
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we describe the motivation to use source colloc a-tions for reordering, and briefly introduces the co l-location extraction method. In section 3, we present our reordering model. And then we d e-scribe the experimental results in section 4 and 5 . In section 6 , we describe the related wor k. Lastly, we conclude in section 7 . A collocation is generally composed of a group of words that occur together more often than by chance. Collocations effectively reveal the strong association among words in a sentence and are widely employe d in a variety of NLP tasks (Mckeown and Radey, 2000 ) . translated in the same order as in the source la n-guage, or in the inverted order. We name the first case as straight , and the second inverted . Based on t he observation that some collocations tend to have fixed translation orders such as  X   X  X  X  jin -rong  X  f i-nancial  X   X  X  X  wei -ji  X  crisis  X  X  ( financial crisis ) whose English translation order is usually straight, and  X   X  X  X  fa -lv  X  X aw X   X  X  X  fan -wei  X  X cope X   X  (scope of law) whose English translation order is generally inverted, some methods have been pr o-posed to improve the reordering model for SMT based on the collocated words crossing the neig h-boring components (Xiong et al., 2006). We fu r-ther notice that some words are translated in different orders when they are collocated with di f-ferent words. For instance , when  X   X  X  chao -liu  X  trend  X  X  is co l loca ted with  X   X  X  X  shi -dai  X  time s  X  X , they are often translated into the  X  trend of time s  X ; when collocated with  X   X  X  X  li -shi  X  hi s tory  X   X , the translation usually becomes the  X  historical trend  X  . Thus, if we can automatically detect the colloc a-tions in the sentence to be translated and their o r-ders in the target language, the reordering information of the collocations could be used to constrain the reordering of phrases during deco d-ing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to i m-prove the reordering model for SMT by est i mating th e reorder ing score based on the translation orders of the source coll o cations.

In general, the collocations can be automatically identified based on syntactic information such as dependency trees (Lin, 1998). However these m e-thods may suffer from parsing errors. Moreover, for many languages, no valid depende n cy parser exists. Liu et al. (2009) proposed to a u tomatically detect the collocated words in a sentence with the MWA method. The advantage of this method lies in that it can identify the collo cated words in a se n-tence without additional resources . In this paper, we e m ploy MWA Mode l l ~ 3 described in Liu et al. (2009) to detect colloc a tions in sentences, which are shown in Eq. ( 1 ) ~(3). notes the number of words collocating wit h collocated wor d s in S .

The MWA models measure the collocated words under different constraints. MWA Model 1 only models w ord collocation probabilit ies p osition collocation probabilit ies ) , | ( l c j d sides the features in MWA Model 2, MWA Model 3 also considers fertility probabilit ies ) | (
Given a sentence, the optimal collocated words can be obtained according to Eq. (4).
Given a monolingual word aligned corpus, the coll ocation probabilities can be estimated as fo l-lows. denotes the collocated words in the corpus and In this section, we first describe how to estimate the orientation probabilities for a given collocation, and then describe the estimation of the reordering score during translation. Finally, we describe the integ ration of the reordering model into the SMT system. 3.1 Reordering probability estimation Given a source collocation ) , ( ponding translations ) , ( tence pair , the reordering orientation of th e collocation can be defined as in Eq. (6). 
In our method, only th ose collocated words in source language that are aligned to diffe r ent target words , are taken into consider ation , and those b e-ing aligned to the same target word a re ignored .
Given a word -aligned bilingual corpus where the collocations in source sentences are detected, the probabilities of the translation orientation of collocations in the source language can be est i-mated, as follows: the algorithm in Figure 1. 3.2 Reordering model locations are first detected using the algorithm d e-scribed in Eq. (4). Then the reordering score is estimated according to the reordering probability weighted by the collocation probability of the co l-located words. Formally, for a generated transl a-tion candidate T , the reordering score is calculated as follows.

In addition to the detected collocated words in the sentence, we also consider other possible word pairs whose collocation probabilities are higher than a given threshold. Thus, t he reordering score is further improved according to Eq. (1 0 ).  X  is the threshold of collocation probability. The weights and the threshold can be tuned using a d e-velopment set. 3.3 Integrated into SMT system The SMT systems generally employ the log -linear model to integ rate various features (Chiang, 2005; Koehn et al., 2007). G iven an input sentence F , the final translation E * with the highest score is chosen from candidates, as in Eq. (11). tures . system as one feature as shown in (10). 4.1 Implementation We implemented our method in a phrase -based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007) . B ased on the GIZA++ package (Och and Ney, 2003) , we i m-plemented a MWA tool for collocation detection. T hus, g iven a sentence to be translated, we first identify the collocations in the sentence, and then e stimate the reordering score according to the translation hyp o thesis. For a translation option to be expand ed, the reordering score inside this source phrase is calculated according to their tran s-lation orders of the collocations in the correspon d-ing targe t phrase. The reordering score crossing the current transl a tion option and the covered parts can be calculated a c cording to the relative position of the collocated words. If the source phrase matched by the current translation option is behind the co v-ered parts in the source sentence, then current translation option is ( 4 3 3 2 e e f f  X  ). The collocations related to this translation option are can be estimated as fo l lows: coder, we design a heuristic fun ction to est i mate the future score , as shown in Figure 3. For any u n-covered word and its collocates in the input se n-tence, if the collocate is u n covered, then the higher reordering probability is used. If the coll o cate has been covered, then the reordering orient a tion can
Figure 3. Heuristic function for estimating future be determined according to the relative pos i tions of th e words and the corresponding reordering prob a-bility is employed. 4.2 Settings We use the FBIS corpus ( LDC2003E14 ) to train a Ch i nese -to -English phrase -based translation model. And the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) is used to train a 5 -gram lan guage model on the English sentences of FBIS corpus. development set to tune the feature weights of the SMT system and the interpolation parameters, based on the minimum error rate training method (Och, 2003) , and the NIST eva l uation sets of 2004 and 2008 (MT04 and MT08) as the test set s . tion metrics . We also calculate the statistical sign i-ficance differences between our methods and the baseline method by using the paired bootstrap re -sample method (Koehn, 2004). 4.3 Translation r esults We compare the proposed method with various reordering methods in previous work.
 Monotone model : n o reordering model is used. D istortion based reordering (DBR) model : a msd -bidirectional -fe reordering (MSDR or Source collocation based reordering (SCBR) The DBR model suffers from serious data spars e-ness . F or example, the reordering cases in the trained pairwise distortion model only covered 32~38% of those in the test sets. So its perfo r-mance is worse than that of the monotone model. The MSDR model achieves higher BLEU score s than the monotone model and the DBR model. Our models further improve the translation quality, achiev ing better performance than the combin a tion of MSDR model and DBR model. The results in Table 1 show that  X  X SDR + SCBR Model 3 X  pe r-forms the best a mong the SCBR models. This is because, as co m pared to MWA Model 1 and 2, MWA Model 3 takes more information into co n-sideration, including not only the co -occurr ence information of lexical tokens and the position of words , but also the fertility of words in a se n tence. And when the three SCBR models are co m bined, the performance of the SMT system is further i m-proved. As compare d to other reordering models, our model s achieve an absolute improv e ment of 0.98~1.19 BLEU score on the test sets, which are statisti cally signi f i cant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . the baseline system and T2 is generated by the sy s-tem where the SCBR models (1+2+3) 1 are used . MSDR+ Consecutive words 77.9% 73.5% The input sentence contains three collocations. The co l location (  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ) is included in the same phrase and translated together as a whole. Thus its translation is correct in both transl a ti ons. For the other two long -distance collocations (  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ) and (  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ), their translation orders are not correctly handled by the reordering model in the baseline system. For the collocation (  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ), since the SCBR models indicate p ( o =straight|  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ) &lt; p ( o =inverted|  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ) , the system f i-nally generates the tran s lation T2 by constraining their translation order with the proposed model. We compared our method with the method that models the reordering orientations based on co -occurring words in the source sentences, rather than the collocations. 5.1 Co -occurrence based reordering model We use the similar algorithm described in section 3 to train the c o -occurrence based reordering (CBR) model , except that the probability of t he reordering orientation is estimated on the co -occurring words and the relative distance. Given an input sentence and a translation candidate, the reordering score is estimated as shown in Eq. (12). in the source sentence. based reordering (WCBR) model . In this model, the probability of the reordering orientation is a d-d i tionally weighted by the pointwise mutua l info r-mation 2 score of the two words ( Manning and Sch X tze , 1999 ) , which is estimated as shown in Eq. (13). 5.2 Translation results Table 2 shows the translation results. It can be seen that the performance of the SMT system is i m-proved by integrating the CBR model. The perfo r-mance of the CBR model is also better than that of the DBR model. It is because t he former is trained based on all co -occurring aligned words, while the latter only considers the adjacent aligned words. When t he WCBR model is used, the tran s lation quality is further improved. However, its perfo r-mance is still inferior to that of the SCBR models, indicat ing that our method (SCBR models) of modeling the translation orders of source colloc a-tions is more effective. Furthe r more, we combine the weighted co -occurr ence based model and our m e thod, which outperform all the other models. 5.3 Result analysis Precision of prediction the reordering models by calculating precisions o f the translation orders predicted by the reordering models. Based on the source sentences and refe r-ence translations of the development set , where the source words and target words are automatically aligned by the bilingual word alignment method, we const ruct the reference translation orders for two words. Against the references, we calculate three kinds of precisions as follows:
Here, predicted by the reordering models. If denotes the translation order derived from the word alignments. If translation order is correct, otherwise wrong. and co n secutive words and the interrupted words in the source se n tences, respectively. precision on both cases . Here, the CBR model and SCBR Model 3 are compared. The results are shown in Table 3. 
From the results in Tabl e 3, it can be seen that the CBR model has a higher precision on the co n-secutive words than the SCBR model, but lower precisions on the interrupted words. It is mainly because the CBR model introduces more noise when the relative distance of words is set t o a large number, while the MWA method can effectively detect the long -distance collocations in se n tences (Liu et al., 2009). This explains why the combin a-tion of the two models can obtain the highest BLEU score as shown in Table 2. On the whole, the SCBR Model 3 achieves higher precision than the CBR model.
 Effect of the reordering model generated translations in the test set s . Using the above method, we construct the reference transl a-tion orders of collocatio ns in the test sets. For a given word pair in a source sentence, if the transl a-tion order in the generated translation is the same as that in the reference translations, then it is co r-rect, otherwise wrong.
 tho d, the co -occurr ence based method, and our m e-thod (SCBR models) . The precisions calculated on both kinds of words are shown in Table 4. From Test sets the results, it can be seen that our method achieves higher prec i sions than both the baseline and the method mode l ing the translation orders of the co -occurring words. It indicates that the proposed m e-tho d effe c tively constrains the reordering of source words during decoding and improves the transl a-tion qua l ity. R eordering w as first proposed in the IBM model s (Brown et al., 1993) , later was named IBM co n-straint by Ber g er et al. ( 1996) . Th is mo del treat s the source word s e quence as a coverage set that is processed sequentially and a source token is co v-ered when it is translated into a new target token . I n 1997, another model called ITG co n strain t was presented, in which t he reordering order can be hierarchica l ly modeled as straight or inverted for two node s in a binary branching stru c ture (Wu , 1997) . Although the ITG co n strain t allows more flexible reordering during d e coding, Zens and Ney ( 2003 ) showed that the IBM constraint results in higher BL EU scores. Our method models the reo r-dering of collocated words in sentences instead of all words in IBM models or two neighboring blocks in ITG models.
 (2003) linearly model ed the distance of phrase movements, whi ch results in poor global reorde r-ing. More methods are proposed to explicitly mo d-el the movements of phrases (Tillmann, 2004; Koehn et al., 2005) or to directly predict the orie n-tations of phrases (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005; Zens and Ney, 2006), conditioned on current source phrase or target phrase. Hierarchical phrase -based SMT methods employ SCFG bilingual tran s-lation model and allow flexible reordering (Chiang, 2005). However, these methods ignored the corr e-lations among words in the source la n guage or in the target language. In our method, we automat i-cally detect the collocated words in sentences and their translation orders in the target languages, which are used to constrain the ordering models with the estimated reordering (straight or inverted) score . Moreover, our method allows flexible reo r-dering by considering both consecutive words and interrupted words.
 many researchers employed syntax -based reorde r-ing methods (Zhang et al., 2007; Marton and Re s-nik , 2008; Ge, 2010; Visweswariah et al., 2010). However these methods are subject to parsing e r-rors to a large ex tent. Our method directly obtains collocation information without resort ing to any li n guistic knowledge or tools, therefore is suitable for any la nguage pairs.
 c a tion information to improve the performance of the ITG constraints (Xiong et al., 2006). Xiong et al. used the consecutive co -occurring words as co l-location information to constrain the reordering , which did not lead to higher translation quality in their experiments. In our method, we first detect both consecutive and interrupted collocated words in the source sentence, and then estimated the reordering score of these collocated words, which are u sed to softly constrain the reordering of source phrases. We presented a novel model to improve SMT by means of model ing the translation orders of source co l locations. The model was learned from a word -aligned bilingual corpus where the potenti ally co l-located words in source sentences were automat i-cally detected by the MWA method. During decoding, the model is employed to softly co n-strain the transl a tion orders of the source language collocations. Since we only model the reordering of collocated words, our methods can partially a l-leviate the data sparseness encou n ter ed by other methods directly modeling the reorde r ing based on source phrases or target phrases. In add i tion, this kind of reordering information can be integrated into any SMT systems without resort ing to any additional r e sources.
 posed method significantly improves the transl a-tion quality of a phrase based SMT system, achiev ing an absolute improvement of 1.1~1.4 BLEU score over the baseline me thods .
