 The Semantic Web, born with the goal of making Web resources machine-understandable and easily sharable and reusable among different applications, is al-ready massively exploited in many websites, which incorporate user-generated content and semantic annotations. The recent advances in the Semantic Web field, and specifi-cally the use of weak semantic techniques, such as microformats for adding semantics to content, provide new standardized ways to represent, process, and share information on the Web. This creates a basis for using other more complex methods of processing, such as natural language processing and personalization.

At the same time, the Social Web is growing daily in the number of users and applica-tions. Users now heavly contribute to Web content by tagging, commenting, rating, and uploading resources in an architecture of participation where user contribution and interaction add value. Moreover, users are involved in many social activities such as creating new relationships among other users, recommending and sharing resources, suggesting friends, creating groups and communities, commenting friends activities, and so on.

The primary goal of this special section is to showcase some recent research in the intersection of the Social Web and the Semantic Web that explores the benefits of adaptation and personalization for the so-called Social Adaptive Semantic Web.
In this article, we first provide some discussion about the impact and the opportu-nities of the Semantic Web on the Social Web (Section 2) and of the Social Web on the Semantic Web (Section 3). Then, we outline the opportunities for adaptation offered by the Semantic Social Web (Section 4) and provide a discussion of the special section topics and articles (Section 5). Conclusions and open issues are presented in Section 6. Social systems offer a democratic way to store and share information and knowledge. The massive use of tags represents a flexible way to freely associate meta-knowledge to data and induces unstructured collaborative classification schemes that are com-monly known as folksonomies. Unfortunately, the use of an uncontrolled vocabulary gives rise to problems such as polysemy, synonymy, basic level variation, ambiguity, and multiword expressions [Dattolo et al. 2010]; on the other hand, the data of the Social Web are independent and there is not interoperability among them. Creating value from this data coming from different applications is one of the main roles of the Semantic Web: In fact, while there are plenty of ways to create value by aggregating user contributions, there are few that go beyond summarizing or sorting the data. To sum up, the Semantic Web offers two major ways to enrich Social Web [Gruber 2006]. (1) Add value to user contributions by structuring existing data . There are three basic (2) Enable data sharing and computation across independent heterogeneous Social While editing metadata is technically easy in RDF and tools like Prot  X  eg  X  e, the process of semantic annotation of resources requires knowing the dictionary and understanding the structure of the domain ontology. Even though a number of ontologies have already been developed for many domains, the simplest ontology (a nomenclature or just a list of agreed terms) requires that the annotators adjust their viewpoint to it. Designing ontologies is hard. It requires highly trained experts in the domain who have a detailed and comprehensive knowledge of properties, functions at different levels of abstraction, and understand the concepts and their relationships according to the common view of the community. Automatic translation between two different views of the same domain is hard. As soon as the domain gets more realistic, complex, and interesting, peo-ple emphasize different relationships and start interpreting things in different ways. Different communities use different naming agreements, which emphasize different relationships and concepts [Al-Jabari et al. 2009; Iorio et al. 2009]. In reality, most of the systems that claim to use ontologies use taxonomies, hierarchies, or concept maps. These simpler semantic representations allow straightforward mapping of terms using applications such as WordNet, but exclude the semantics of the relationships among objects. Research on advanced structural ontology mapping is ongoing but the practical application of such mapping is still limited.

The Social Web offers solutions to some of these problems. User tags provide an alternative to semantic annotation by experts, by letting users annotate content with words they find personally useful. This results in many discrete (not related to each other) tags, some of which could be irrelevant, misspelled, or wrong. Yet the more people tag a certain resource, the tags that have meaning to more people get used more often. Thus, through crowdsourcing, a set of tags representative of the semantics of the resource as defined by the group of users who created the tags can be obtained, which is in fact semantic annotation without a predefined ontology or taxonomy. Such crowdsourcing is used by data and user-rich corporations like Google for semantic annotation of their repositories with images, old printed text (reCaptcha), audio and videos, so that they are searchable by various keywords.

The tags can express different semantic dimensions. Through the use of data-mining techniques, it is possible to categorize the tags and to create hierarchical organizations of categories resembling ontologies. Automatic ontology generation based on tagged documents may be a promising direction of research [Brooks and Montanez 2006; Fernandez-Tobias et al. 2011]. Yet, there is no guarantee that the automatically gen-erated ontology will be understandable for humans and that humans will agree with it. On the other hand, agreement may not be necessary since for practical reasons the ontology is better used by the machine and hidden away from human eyes [Gru-ber 2006; Weinberger 2008]. The humans can deal with tags, which are user-friendly; the ontology should stay in the background to support machine reasoning and more complex inference and adaptation.

In summary, the Social Web helps to overcome two problems that the Semantic Web community has been working on:  X  X he bottleneck in semantic annotation of web resources due to the necessity of using consistent and systematic annotations adhering to predefined ontologies through user-tagging, and  X  X he bottleneck in creating domain ontologies that are meaningful for particular user communities through crowdsourced social tagging and data mining/clustering of tags to derive higher level categories, concepts, and relationships among them. The Social Web is characterized by the explosion of user-generated content. In such abundance, it becomes very hard for users to find relevant content, including user anno-tations (tags). Personalized information filters and recommender systems provide a way for users to stay current in selected areas of interest, and they have become active areas of research [Durao and Dolog 2009; Tandukar and Vassileva 2011; Wang et al. 2010]. Many of these works are based on lexical analyses of the user-generated content, which is the first step towards semantic analysis. However, they rarely use explicitly Seman-tic Web approaches by mapping to ontologies. They typically use statistical approaches (machine learning or data mining) to derive clusters of semantically related items.
There has been a significant interest in the area of social recommender algorithms, probably because there is a clear methodology for evaluation. Researchers use exist-ing datasets provided by the social networking sites or create their own datasets by crawling or using the APIs of social networks and focusing on the quality of predic-tion provided by the algorithms using standard measures of precision and recall. This allows measuring the improvements. Yet, the usefulness of the proposed algorithms from a user perspective in real-world recommender systems is not always clear. The main reason seems to be the lack of transparency and user understanding of the un-derlying algorithms. A semantic approach, based on recommending items using an explicit model of user interests with respect to semantic categories, holds promise for creating this transparency and user understanding, increasing the user X  X  trust in the recommendations [O X  X onovan and Smyth 2005].

Apart from recommender systems and filters, personalization with some semantic elements on the Social Web is also applied in learning systems [Liang et al. 2012], for text annotation [Baruzzo et al. 2009], and for improving search in social sites, such as Twitter [Celik et al. 2011]. Similar to recommender systems, they use a combination of lexical analyses and statistical data-mining methods.

Excluding the approach of Baruzzo et al. [2009] which uses ontologies, these ap-proaches are not strictly semantic as they do not involve ontologies, but they do create representations of basic semantics through tags and keywords (as result of lexical analyses), and these can provide a basis for future sophistication, potentially enabling mining of concept structures and simple forms of reasoning. An illustration of this kind of work can be found in Fernandez-Tobias et al. [2011] where statistical methods com-bined with lexical analyses are used to find clusters of tags with the purpose of creating user profiles and item profiles that can be utilized later in recommender systems.
Evaluations of the human acceptance of the generated recommendations, especially in realistic settings and with large sets of users, are rare and this is clearly an area where more research needs to be done [Konstan and Riedl 2012]. In this section we provide an overview of the topics covered by the articles submitted to the special issue. We received 14 submissions, covering a wide range of topics. Unfortunately, the thorough peer-review process selected only two of these submissions as mature enough to be published in an archival venue such as TIST. This shows that the semantic adaptive Social Web is a very interesting area, attracting the attention of many researchers, but, at the same time, there are many challenging issues that have not been addressed in sufficient depth and methods that have not been evaluated thoroughly enough. We may conclude that the area is active, but not yet mature. This is due to the following factors:  X  X he presence of different communities (Adaptive Web, user modeling, Semantic Web and Social Web) with very different points of view, approaches, and techniques that only recently started to cooperate and share results;  X  X he limited diffusion of real Semantic Web applications, due to the lack of useful tools and robust platforms to support the development of this kind of applications;  X  X he success of Social Web applications, which catalyzed most of the researchers X  attention at the expense of other aspects; and  X  X he success of purely collaborative recommender systems as a method used for adap-tation and personalization on the Social Web at the expense of content-based ap-proaches that rely on semantics.

However, we felt it would be interesting and informative to provide an overview of the work-in-progress in the area. To do this, we analyzed the articles submitted to the current special issue as addressing the following aspects. (1) Impact of the Semantic Web on the Social Web . This aspect is related to the use (2) Impact of the Social Web on the Semantic Web . This relates to technologies such as (3) Novel systems and approaches combining semantic, social and adaptive aspects . (4) New challenges in the Social Adaptive Semantic Web . We refer to novel trust and
The main outcome of this analysis is that the only topic that has been adequately addressed is the impact of the Semantic Web on the Social Web, while the other topics are not completely or adequately addressed. We can also observe that there were some out-of-topics articles (containing neither social nor semantic aspects), which is a signal that there is not yet a common interpretation by the community of the meaning of topics related to the Social Semantic Web.

The two works accepted for publication exemplify the opportunities offered by ap-plying the Semantic Web on the Social Web. In more detail, both of the accepted articles Social Semantic Query Expansion by Biancalana et al. and Web Media Seman-tic Concept Retrieval via Tag Removal and Model Fusion by Chen et al., explore the opportunities given by semantic technologies to improve Web information retrieval.
The paper Social Semantic Query Expansion by Biancalana et al. [2013] describes a system that implements a social and personalized extension of traditional query expansion techniques, generally based on a coarse syntactic analysis which builds two-dimensional matrices representing distribution of cooccurring terms in a given collection of documents. The authors propose a novel weak semantic technique for query expansion, which exploits three-dimensional matrices, including as an addi-tional dimension the semantic classes (i.e., categories comprising all the terms that share a semantic property) related to the folksonomy extracted from social bookmark-ing services such as  X  X elicious X  or  X  X tumbleUpon X . The idea is to categorize the user needs and preferences in semantic classes. In the article, the authors demonstrate the improvement of search results by combining tags and folksonomies (Social Web) with a semantic categorization (Semantic Web). The authors carried out an extensive experimental evaluation with both artificial datasets and real users and showed that their approach outperforms traditional techniques. Then they also present the results of a questionnaire aimed at learning the users opinion regarding the system. Finally, they provide the results of a complexity analysis, which demonstrates the efficiency of the system in a real-time setting. This kind of evaluation, mixing artificial datasets and studies with real users, quantitative and qualitative techniques, and accuracy and performance evaluation, is a good example of a possible methodology for evaluating the complexity of a social semantic adaptive system even though it does not propose novel metrics or methodologies.

The article Web Media Semantic Concept Retrieval via Tag Removal and Model Fu-sion by Chen et al. proposes an approach for enhancing Web multimedia retrieval integrating content-based and semantic-based models. Since the information on the tags can facilitate media search though they are often imprecise, the authors first pro-pose an approach for noisy tag removal based on a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) algorithm, which is able to capture relationships among features and identify representative and discriminative tags that hold strong correlations with target se-mantic concepts. In addition, a novel weighted-model fusion method is also proposed to combine scores from both tag-based and content-based models where MCA is used to estimate the parameters involved in each model. The evaluation of the approach with a large dataset shows that the proposed framework outperforms baseline results and several tag removal algorithms and fusion methods. The weakness of this ap-proach is that it was not evaluated with different datasets, and thus the significance of results cannot be generalized. However, the main strength of the article relies in the clear demonstration of the real advantages of utilizing user-generated annotations (i.e., tags) for information retrieval provided they are correctly used with the help of semantic technologies. The advantages of social search and semantic browsing are also shown.

Even though the two accepted articles are good examples of the opportunities offered by a Social Semantic Web environment, we cannot claim that they exploit those oppor-tunities to improve recommender and adaptive systems, which is in our opinion, a key issue of the Semantic Adaptive Social Web. After presenting the analysis of contributions to the current special issue we can draw some conclusions and identify the main open issues in the field. The main lessons learned are the following.  X  X ost of the efforts are concentrated on the use of Semantic Web techniques in the
Social Web.  X  X he potential for using Social Web techniques for solving Semantic Web problems is still under-researched.  X  X ery few works present Semantic Adaptive Social systems.  X  X he new challenges which arise in the Semantic Social Adaptive Web related to privacy, trust, as well as new metrics and methodologies, have not yet been addressed.
The potential impact of merging social and semantic aspects is very important, specifically in relation to the improvement of information retrieval on the Web and to recommender systems. However, the opportunity offered by the Semantic Social Web for realizing intelligent and adaptive systems have not been adequately recognized. Moreover, there are a number of technological issues which can influence and motivate future research in different communities (adaptive systems, user modeling, Semantic Web, Social Web, data mining, knowledge representation, etc).  X  Semantic Web applications. There is a big opportunity to exploit the Social Web, namely, the collaboration among users and user-generated content, to improve the development of Semantic Web applications, thus fostering their diffusion. Some questions remain. How can Social Web data be used to improve Semantic Web applications? How can tags be used to create, populate, and maintain ontologies, alleviating one of the main bottleneck of the Semantic Web (i.e., ontology develop-ment)? This may be the starting point for new social semantic approaches for the
Web, which should lead to the design and development of novel applications having both semantic and social features.  X  Adaptive systems. The main issues here relate to the user-modeling process in this new and complex kind of environment. How can we gather user model data in this environment? What are the most suitable personalization strategies? What are the most effective recommendation algorithms in the Semantic Social Web?  X  Privacy issues. In the Social Web, users seem very willing to share their personal content with friends and even strangers, but they are not often aware of the conse-quence of disclosure. Exploiting user data from the Social Web can lead to an ethical dilemma as user requirements may be in conflict with the system goals, especially if they are commercial ones. How can a balance between privacy and disclosure be found that considers the best interests of both the user and the application? In or-der to foster the development of Semantic Adaptive Social Web applications, new approaches for privacy management are needed.  X  Evaluation metrics and methodologies. The evaluation of a complex system, such as a semantic adaptive social system, requires the integration of methodologies from different areas (adaptive systems, recommender systems, social sciences) and the use of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. In particular, it is necessary to implement a combination of evaluation methodologies in order to verify all of the aspects involved in a semantic social application; mere qualitative evaluation is not enough (see Gena et al. [2013]). In this sense, the article by Biancalana et al. is a good example of an exhaustive evaluation, albeit does not present a novel approach.
Some questions remain unanswered: Which are the most useful metrics to evaluate such applications? Do the results from laboratory studies, or studies based on dead data from datasets, provide enough information to evaluate new technologies and how do we validate them effectively in field experiments involving real systems with real users engaged in actual use?
To conclude, the fusion of social and semantic aspects in the Web is a highly promising and appealing area for both adaptive systems and information retrieval. Hopefully this special issue will encourage researchers to continue working to further these ideas and support the advancement of this research area.
