 Lack of motivation to provide ratings and eligibility to rate generally only after purchase restrain the effectiveness of rec-ommender systems and contribute to the well-known data sparsity and cold start problems. This paper proposes a new information source for recommender systems, called prior ratings . Prior ratings are based on users X  experiences of virtual products in a mediated environment, and they can be submitted prior to purchase. A conceptual model of prior ratings is proposed, integrating the environmental fac-tor presence whose effects on product evaluation have not been studied previously. A user study conducted in web-site and virtual store modalities demonstrates the validity of the conceptual model, in that users are more willing and confident to provide prior ratings in virtual environments.

User ratings are crucial for recommender systems in e-commerce in order to provide quality personalized product recommendations. However, users can lack motivation to provide ratings, and ratings can generally be given only af-ter purchase (how can I share my experience of an item I have not tried?). Without sufficient rating information for preference modelling, the effectiveness of recommender sys-tems is hindered X  X s seen in well-known problems such as data sparsity and cold start [3]. Although many approaches have been proposed to address these problems [3, 4], only few researchers have attempted to elicit more user ratings from the perspective of user interfaces, so as to inherently mitigate the severity of these problems.

Contemporary websites, e.g., brides.com and Ray-ban.com are implementing novel interfaces and interactions through which users can virtually try on different wedding dresses and glasses, to better elicit user preferences. However, the available media and interactions are limited in comparison with those of virtual reality (VR), e.g., SecondLife.com which can provide users with immersive virtual product experi-ences. Users can experience media more richly and can in-teract in real time with virtual products  X  X he  X  X econd exis-tence X  of real products in a mediated environment.
While the emergence of 3D VR environments offers more adequate information which can be used to model user pref-erence, research on recommender systems in VR is still in its infancy. Shah et al. [10] recommend to users locations of interest by analyzing users X  login data to help them navigate in VR. Hu and Hang [5] design a system to recommend vir-tual furniture according to users X  interest and requirements. Although a controlled prototype was implemented, the fea-tures of VR are not exploited to elicit user ratings.
This paper proposes a new information source, called prior ratings , built upon virtual product experiences. A concep-tual model of prior ratings is proposed to provide a princi-pled foundation, integrating the environmental factor pres-ence whose effects on product evaluation have not been stud-ied previously. For evaluation, we conduct user studies in two different modalities. The results demonstrate the valid-ity of the conceptual model under our experimental settings. To our knowledge, this is the first work that defines and in-vestigates the concept of prior ratings.
We define the term prior ratings as users X  assessment of products in the light of their virtual product experiences ,re-ferring to the psychological and emotional states that users undergo while interacting with virtual products in a medi-
Figure 1: The conceptual model of prior ratings ated environment [8]. Hence, prior ratings are reported by users based on their interactions with virtual products in a mediated environment, and they can be issued prior to pur-chase or after purchase (if any). We refer to the  X  X tandard X  type of ratings derived from  X  X osterior X  product experiences as posterior ratings . By  X  X osterior X , we mean experiences of a tangible product obtained via direct trials or use of the product in a physical environment. Since tangible products can be fully experienced usually only after purchase, poste-rior ratings are primarily post-purchase ratings. Prior rat-ings and posterior ratings are distinct and complementary in that they reflect different forms of user experiences.
It is reported that VR real-time interactions enable users to possess a strong sense of being in a mediated environment and gain a lifelike shopping experience [8]. Hence, we draw a hypothesis as follows.

Hypothesis 1. Users are more wil ling to provide prior ratings to the items (e.g., products) that they have interacted with in VR than in WS.
 Jiang and Benbasat [7] contend that virtual products in VR help improve the perceived diagnosticity of products X  the extent to which users believe a particular shopping expe-rience is helpful to understand the quality and performance of a product. Therefore, users may feel more capable of forming direct, intuitive and concrete opinions about prod-ucts in VR than in WS.

Hypothesis 2. (a) Users have more confidence in pro-viding prior ratings in VR than in WS; (b) the average value of prior ratings in VR is closer to that of posterior ratings than that of prior ratings in WS.
 Conceptual Model. A conceptual model of prior ratings is illustrated in Figure 1. Such a model allows a principled ba-sis for the elicitation and analysis of prior ratings. For a spe-cific product, a number of intrinsic and extrinsic attributes are associated. In different environments, the perceptions of these attributes can differ according to the types of me-dia and interactions that deliver information about them. The intrinsic and extrinsic perceptions indicate the quality of products as perceived directly and indirectly, respectively. In contrast, the perceived cost (e.g., time, price) refers to the cost that users have to bear in order to obtain the products. A prior rating is an overall evaluation of preference of prod-ucts in terms of both perceived quality and cost.
 Presence is defined as subjects X  sense of  X  X eing there X , the extent to which they experience the virtual environments as real or present and temporarily ignore where they are phys-ically present [11]. In this paper, presence is captured as the extent to which being in a mediated environment feels like being in a real environment 1 , given the richness in me-dia and interactions. Since information concerning product attributes is conveyed by media channels and user interac-tions, presence can be an important environmental factor that will influence the perceptions of product attributes.
Hypothesis 3. Presence has positive influence on the per-ceptions of both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. Intrinsic attributes (e.g., workmanship, size) have a di-rect impact on perceived quality during the goal-directed process of pre-purchase product evaluation [2]. In this pa-per, we classify intrinsic attributes into three types, namely appearance , material ,and functionality . Appearance refers to the attributes related to the superficial representation of products, such as patterns, form, size, etc. Material refers to the attributes associated with what products are made of, such as fabric properties, weight, etc. Functionality refers to the attributes indicating the utility of products or the actions that products can perform or that can be performed on products. For example, an electronic watch contains the functionality of stopwatch and it may  X  X it X  someone well. Extrinsic attributes (e.g., price) have no direct indica-tions of perceived quality. Rather, they are often used as cues to infer the quality of products when the information of intrinsic attributes is incomplete [1]. In this case, price is often used by users to infer the quality of products [1]. Brand name serves as a  X  X horthand X  for perceived quality by providing users with a bundle of product information [6]. In contrast, store name also has a positive but small impact on perceived quality [9]. Other extrinsic attributes (e.g., warranty) may also have effects on perceived quality.
Hypothesis 4. Users depend more on extrinsic attributes than intrinsic attributes to evaluate the product quality in WS, whereas users depend more on intrinsic attributes than extrinsic attributes to evaluate the product quality in VR.
Besides quality, extrinsic attributes also contribute to per-ceived cost , a combination of monetary (mainly price) and non-monetary (e.g., time, shipping) attributes.
 Prior Ratings. In a pre-purchase phase, users go through a process (perhaps subconscious) of evaluating the benefits that they can get and the cost that they have to incur. The outcome of this process helps determine whether users will like the product in question. Other than perceived quality, we posit that prior ratings could also be positively enhanced if the perceived cost is acceptable. Intuitively, for a specific product interested in by a user in terms of quality, if the price of the product turns out to be acceptable, it is likely that the user will like the product as a whole.

Hypothesis 5. Perceived quality has significantly posi-tive influence on prior ratings, and perceived cost will also positively influence prior ratings, if the price is acceptable.
Two kinds of mediated environments are developed: tra-ditional 2D websites (WS) and 3D VR environments. They differ in richness of both media and of interactions through which product information can be delivered. Both user in-terfaces  X  X ell X  our t-shirts whose source was the real-life com-merce website 80stees.com. These 50 t-shirts have average posterior ratings (on 80stees.com) in the range [3 . 2 , 4 of 5). The virtual store was built using OpenSimulator.org. T-shirts were displayed and arranged without a predefined order on the walls of virtual store. Users can interact with them by viewing, rotating, zooming, and even virtually try-ing on and customizing the t-shirts (on their avatar). They can also adjust the avatar X  X  shape as desired. In contrast, no interactions were available in WS: users can only imag-ine what the t-shirt would be like from text descriptions and static images. Four attributes, namely appearance, ma-terial, fit and price are identified as the major concerns of users via a pilot study. Together with attributes store and category, the six attributes are selected for the experiments.
The user study consisted of one session, structured as fol-lows. All subjects started with a tutorial video so as to get familiar with functionalities of user interfaces. Once sub-jects were comfortable, they proceeded. Each subject expe-rienced and evaluated eight different t-shirts in each envi-ronment by giving ratings to the questions about product attributes. Rating values were integers from 1 ( X  X trongly disagree X ) to 5 ( X  X trongly agree X ). Subjects could also add textual comments for each t-shirt. To eliminate the influ-ence of ordering, subjects were randomly determined into two groups. Specifically, of 30 volunteers recruited on a uni-versity campus, 16 subjects executed the user study first in WS and then VR, and 14 proceeded inversely. In addition to t-shirts, the subjects were also asked to rate the envi-ronment regarding the confidence (and state their reasons) and comfort in giving ratings, and the feelings of sense of presence. Finally, subjects could opt to state whether and in which environment they are willing and prefer to provide prior ratings. The questions are shown in Figure 2.
For Hypothesis 1, of 19 subjects who answered our ques-tions regarding the willingness to rate t-shirts, 18 gave posi-tive responses. More specifically, most subjects preferred to rate products in VR (14) rather than in WS (2). Two other subjects did not explicitly state their preference. Most sub-jects expressed that the reasons were  X  X t can provide more detail information X  and  X  X his environment (VR) has really high engagement. I X  X  like to share my feeling X . Only one subject did not want to provide prior ratings ( X  X ime con-Table 1: The evaluations of the environmental factors suming X ) but did indicate the willingness if X  X enefits or lucky draw X  were offered. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported.
For Hypothesis 2(a), we conducted a number of paired two sample t-tests to investigate the mean differences of en-vironmental factors, namely confidence, comfort and pres-ence. Table 1 reports the results. Since all p&lt; 0 . 01, we find that users in VR have greater confidence and feel more comfortable in their prior ratings than in WS. This may be partially explained by the fact that users have stronger sense of presence in VR than in WS. Besides, subjects also commented that the main reasons are due to the fact that they can try t-shirts on their  X  X wn X  body rather than have to image the real wearing effect in WS. They also feel stronger sense of presence in VR as if being in a real store. Thus, Hypothesis 2(a) is supported.

For Hypothesis 2(b), the collected data consists of 215 prior ratings in WS ( R.ws ) and 218 records in VR ( R.vr (see Table 2). The correlation between posterior ratings (
R p )and R.ws , denoted as corr ( R p ,R.ws )is  X  0 . 42 whereas corr ( R p ,R.vr )=0 . 23, signifying that the distribution of posterior ratings is distinct from prior ratings in WS, but marginally yet positively similar to prior ratings in VR. To have a better viewpoint, we classify rating values (4, 5) larger than median scale (3) as positive, and the remainder (1, 2, 3) as negative. Then we can obtain clearer correla-tions: corr ( R p ,R.ws )=  X  1and corr ( R p ,R.vr )=1. In addition, the average posterior rating is 4 . 13 whereas the values for R.ws and R.vr are 2 . 94 and 3 . 56, respectively. Thus, Hypothesis 2(b) is supported.

For Hypothesis 3, we conducted multiple linear regres-sions, each of which used  X  X resence X  as independent variable and one of intrinsic or extrinsic attributes in WS and VR as dependent variable. The results are illustrated in Table 3. We see that presence in WS is most influential ( p&lt; 0 . on material and store; in VR it is influential ( p&lt; 0 . on all attributes except category. Hence, presence in WS has smaller effects on the perceptions of product attributes than that in VR. This can be attributed to the lower level of presence in WS as shown in Table 1. However, for attributes whose information can be adequately communicated by ba-sic media (i.e., text descriptions, static images), such as cat-egory, presence may be of limited influence. One possible explanation for the different effects of price in two environ-ments is that price in WS may be ignored as a cue to infer user preference. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is partially supported.
For Hypothesis 4, we conducted a multi-variable linear regression: intrinsic and extrinsic attributes as independent variables and  X  X erceived quality X  as dependent variable. The results, presented in Table 4, show that three attributes in WS are the major concerns for product quality, namely ma-terial, category and store. In addition, attribute  X  X it X  is also considered important but has smaller influence. Note that the regression coefficients of category and store are greater than material and fit, which means that perceived quality re-lies more on extrinsic attributes than on intrinsic attributes. In contrast, the most important attributes in VR are ap-pearance, material, fit and price, and most comments are focused on these four attributes. Hence, subjects relied more on intrinsic attributes than extrinsic attributes to evaluate the quality of t-shirts in VR. Of the four major attributes identified from pilot study, we find that only one of them (material) is recognized in WS whereas all four attributes are correctly recognized in VR. One possible explanation is that when users have less or no direct experiences with products, they may tend to use extrinsic attributes (i.e., category, store, price) as cues to infer the product quality. On the other hand, if users have effective and direct interac-tions with products and thereby gain sufficient direct prod-uct experiences, they may rely more on intrinsic attributes to evaluate products. Thus, Hypothesis 4 is supported.
For Hypothesis 5, we investigated the correlations among prior ratings, perceived quality and cost by applying a lin-ear regression analysis. The results show that the coefficient of perceived quality is positive and large ( &gt; 0 . 6), and that it has a significant influence ( p&lt; 0 . 001) on prior ratings. In addition, the cost is demonstrated as relatively small yet positively important in VR (0 . 14 ,p&lt; 0 . 05) rather than in WS (0 . 06 ,p&gt; 0 . 1). The price of collected t-shirts ranges from US$3.99 to $32.00, indicating that the price is accept-able in general. As a consequence, users are more likely to like products as a whole given good quality estimated. How-ever, as users may not correctly judge the quality of products in WS, the price may fail to be or less considered when as-sessing their preferences. Thus, Hypothesis 5 is supported.
There are several potential limitations in our current ex-periments. First, certain attribute information (e.g., war-ranty, shipping) was not available for our user study. Al-though these are less relevant for the product class studied, they may be more important for other kinds of products. Second, due to lack of devices, our prototype implementa-tion uses only visual information in VR: users cannot touch the t-shirts and feel the material. Tactile feedback may be important for user evaluation of preferences. Nevertheless, as aforementioned, this limitation may not greatly influence the general conclusion since we exploited abstract attributes rather than some specific attributes. Third, most subjects were computer or electrical engineering students on a univer-sity campus, and the sample size was modest. A larger and more heterogeneous sample may allow for more confident generalization of our research findings. Since higher pres-ence may result in more confident prior ratings, it follows that the design of virtual stores should emphasize the sense of presence by increasing the media richness or the effec-tiveness of user interactions. The current research focused on the validation of conceptual model of prior ratings. For future work, we intend to investigate the benefits of prior ratings in improving recommendation performance.
