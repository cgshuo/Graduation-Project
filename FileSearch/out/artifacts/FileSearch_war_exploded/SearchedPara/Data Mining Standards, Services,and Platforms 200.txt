 This is a summary of the workshop on Data Mining Stan-dards, Services and Platforms, which was held at KDD 2004. The Workshop contained talks on the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and the Java standard for data mining JSR-73. It also contained talks on emerging service-based architectures for data mining. Finally, infrastructures for privacy preserving data mining were also discussed. KDD 2004 was the fourth year that there has been a KDD workshop on the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and related areas and the second year of a broader confer-ence with the theme of Data Mining Standards, Services and Platforms.
 Data mining and knowledge discovery has matured rapidly since the first KDD conferences in the late 1980s, draw-ing from the related fields of statistics, machine learning, databases, and high performance computing. Recall the fundamental role played by the relational database model [1] and the SQL standard in the development of databases, and the similar role played by the message passing model and the MPI standard in high performance computing [2]. There is not yet a similar model or standard in data mining. The role of this workshop is to move closer to such a model and supporting standards.
 The online proceedings can be found at: An invited talk was given by Jamie MacLennan of Microsoft with the title Vectors on Data Mining: How standards and platforms will impact the near future of Data Mining. Part of this role is played by the Predictive Model Markup Standard or PMML developed by the Data Mining Group [3] and [4]. One of the goals of PMML is to create a stan-dard interface between producers of models, such as statis-tical or data mining systems, and consumer of models, such Another theme in the DM-SSP 2004 Workshop is the matu-ration of service-based architectures for data mining to com-plement XML-based producer/consumer models.
 Robert Chu of SAS gave an introduction to web service based approaches to data mining in a talk called: Web Ser-vices Standards for Data Mining.
 Data mining has never limited itself to just small data sets. On the other hand scaling web services to working with large remote and distributed data sets faces several technical chal-lenges. Some of these were described, along with some pos-sible solutions, in a talk by David Hanley of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Robert Grossman of the Univer-sity of Illinois at Chicago and Open Data Partners with the title: Experimental Studies Scaling Web Services For Data Mining. PMML has served as a neutral common ground between var-ious other data mining standards, such as Java-based stan-dards and SQL-based standards. Mark F. Hornick of Oracle gave a talk describing the recently released Java standard for data mining (JSR-73) with the title: Java Data Mining (JSR-73): Status and Overview.
 Finally, the importance of privacy preserving data mining has grown enormously during the past few years. A fourth theme in the workshop was the beginning the process to de-velop standards in this area. Stanley R. M. Oliveira and Os-mar R. Zaiane of the University of Alberta gave a talk about this with the title: Toward Standardization in Privacy-Preserving Data Mining. [1] E. F. Codd. A relational model of data for large shared [2] W.
