 The PIKM 2012 workshop is the 5 th of its kind after 4 successful PhD workshops at ACM CIKM. This PhD workshop invites papers that describe the Ph.D. dissertation proposals of doctoral students in any of the CIKM areas: databases, information retrieval, data mining and knowledge management. Interdisciplinary work across these tracks is particularly encouraged. This year PIKM has received around 25 submissions from over 12 countries across the globe, among which 10 have been accepted as full papers for oral presentation while 4 have been accepted as short ones for poster presentation. The selection has been conducted based on reviews submitted by an expert team comprising 21 PC members spanning 12 countries and 6 continents with a good balance of industry and academia. H.2.0 [Information Systems]: Database Mana gement; H.2.8 [Information Systems]: Databa se Management -Database Applications [Data Mining]; H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval Algorithms, Management, Performan ce, Design, Experimentation, Security, Human Factors, Standa rdization, Languages, Theory Cloud Computing, Web Search, Recommendation, OLAP, Query Language, Process Modeling, Social Networking, Linked Data Goals: The goals of this workshop are two-fold: First, we want to give doctoral students an opportunity to present their work on a global stage. This gives the students the unique opportunity to receive feedback from reviewer s, from fellow students and from the general CIKM audience. Sec ond, we believe that the CIKM research community, too, benefi ts from such a workshop: Ph.D. dissertations are the grassroots of research. They point out new research avenues and provide fresh viewpoints from the researchers of tomorrow. Target Audience: We encourage mainly students at an early stage of their Ph.D. studies to participate in PIKM. These students certainly benefit from workshop by presenting their own work as well as attending the talks of their peers. We also expect PhD students besides the presenters to attend in order to learn about their peers X  research directio ns. Other than PhD students, participants attending these workshops so far have been professors, research scientists and professionals from the corporate world, some of them being our PC members. They get a panoramic view of the doctoral work pursued at various universities for prospective hires and collaborations. In addition, we would also encourage Master s X  students and Undergraduate seniors to attend this workshop this year. They would get an idea of the nature of work expect ed for a Ph.D. proposal and its reception by an audience of researchers worldwide. Past Workshops: PIKM has been held earlier in 2007 (Lisbon, Portugal) [8], 2008 (Napa Valley, California) [6], 2010 (Toronto, Canada) [4] and 2011 (Glasgow, Scotland) [2] in conjunction with the respective ACM conferences. The past workshops have been highly successful events with the CIKM organizers encouraging us to hold the workshop again the following year. These PIKM workshops have led to survey publications in the ACM SIGIR Forum journal [7], the ACM SI GKDD Explorations journal [5], and in the SIGMOD Record [3], with a new submission of PIKM 2011 to the SIGKDD Explorations completed [1]. Submissions: The PIKM workshop typically receives submissions from all over the worl d. It attracts a fairly good mix of papers in each of the CIKM tracks of databases, information retrieval and data mi ning/knowledge management. This year, our submissions of about 25 papers spanned more than 12 countries. Some interesting topics includ e collaborative exploratory web search, linked data and prediction, online analytical processing techniques, big data and the cl oud, query language development for scientific data, multilevel business process modeling, external program querying in RDBMS, know ledge transfer in streaming data, and advances in social networks. Reviews and Best Reviewer Award: Our PC for PIKM 2012 comprises 21 reviewers, and repr esents a good mix of experts from universities and the corporate world. With more and more experience from PIKM workshops, we are in a position to give preference to those reviewers who have made excellent reviews at past workshops. Thus, the workshop reviews are generally of good, if not excellent quality. To en courage reviewers, and also to honor their work, the PIKM 2012 offers a particular highlight: a Best Reviewer Award. We, as the chairs of PIKM, determine the winner. The judgment is based on criteria such as timeliness of the review, depth of the review, posit ive criticism, and suggestions for improvement. This year, the award goes to Gerard de Melo (ICSI Berkeley). His reviews are of admirable depth. We wish that every paper (including our own submissions) would get such reviews. Georgiana Ifrim (Univers ity College Cork) and Pierre Bourhis (Oxford University) deserve particular mention for being the runners-up for the Best Reviewer Award. Papers and Best Paper Award: On the basis of the reviews, we have selected a total of 10 full pa pers for oral presentation, among which 3 are in the database track, 3 in data mining and knowledge management and 4 in information retrieval. In addition, we have selected 4 short papers for poste r presentation, consisting of 1 each in data mining and IR and 2 in databases. Ever since its inception in 2007, PIKM has followed the tradition of giving out an award for the best paper. This is an unusual year, because there has been a tie among the top three papers. All three submissions received an identical review score: V.M. Megler, David Maier. When Big Data Leads to Lost Data Ye Xu, Dan Rockmore. Feature Selection for Link Prediction Carlos Garcia-Alvarado, Carlos Ordonez. Querying External Source Code Files of Programs Connecting to a Relational Database Out of these submissions, the firs t one stands out as a piece of research that combines methodol ogy and insights from databases, information retrieval and data mining. It will therefore receive the Best Paper Award of the PIKM 2012. The two other papers are runners-up for the award. The authors of the best paper will receive a certificate from ACM CIKM, as is the common practice in PIKM workshops. Runners-up will be mentioned on the PIKM website http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/PIKM2012/ . We convey our thanks to our dedicated PC members below.
