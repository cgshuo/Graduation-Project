 This paper summarizes the initial findings of an experimen-tal evaluation of how recommender systems affect the buy-ing behavior of online customers. The study was conducted in the context of a large-scale, commercial Mobile Inter-net platform, from which end users can download games to their mobile phones. Item recommendations were presented to platform visitors in different navigational situations; the recommendation lists were either determined with the help of different recommendation algorithms or based on non-personalized ranking techniques. The study is based on a sample of more than 155,000 different customers who vis-ited the portal during a four week evaluation period. The analysis revealed that the use of personalized recommenda-tions instead of non-personalized ones leads to a significant increase in viewed and sold items in different navigational situations and to an overall sales increase.

 Case study, Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems.
Only few publicly available studies exist that report on the business value of recommender systems, i.e., in which ways and to what extent such systems influence the buying behavior of online customers. The study presented in [1] is one of the more recent exceptions. In that work, the goal was to measure the extra revenue that is generated directly or indirectly by adding a recommender systems on a Swiss  X  X -Grocer X  platform. The main conclusions of their study was that recommender systems particularly boost indirect revenues that originate from purchases in item categories to which customers were pointed to by the system. An ear-lier study, which was also conducted in a real commercial context, is presented in [8]. Other recent works that focus on business-related aspects of recommender systems such as market intelligence or sales diversity include [2], [10], and [11]. Examples of other works that focus on the value of personalized Mobile Internet services are [5], [6] and [9].
In this work, we present the initial findings of an eval-uation of the effects of personalized item recommendation on a Mobile Internet game download platform of a major telecommunications provider in Germany. Portal visitors can access the platform with their mobile phones, browse the available games and purchase and download individual items. The prices of the games, which range from free de-mos to a few Euros per game, are automatically added to the customer X  X  monthly invoice.

During the four-week evaluation period, a sample of more than 155,000 different customers were included in the exper-iments. The entry screen of the personalized game portal is shown in Figure 1. It contains both links to different item categories such as  X  X ew items X  or  X  X op 10 X  products as well as teasers with direct links to certain items that are promi-nently placed on the main screen.

For our study, the following modifications were made to the existing portal. First, a new category link called  X  X y Recommendations X  that leads the user to a personalized list of recommendations, was added at the top of the screen for users that were not in the control group that received non-personalized recommendations. Second, the ordering of the items in the different item listings on the start screen and in the post-sales screen (see later) were personalized. Before the experiment, the item ordering in standard categories such as  X  X rom 99 Cent X  was determined manually and was mostly based on the game release date. Also the items on the start screen were all manually chosen before the experiment. Category listings for which a  X  X atural order X  exists were left unchanged, think e.g. of the  X  X rom A-Z X  category.
We used the following experimental setup. When a cus-tomer entered the portal for the first time during the eval-uation period, he was assigned to one of seven groups. For each group, the item ordering in the different lists was de-termined with a different personalized or non-personalized technique, as shown in the following table.
Customers remained in their groups to which they were randomly assigned throughout the experiment. Each group comprised around 22,300 customers. Note that from all por-tal visitors, only such customers were selected for the exper-iment, for which all algorithms were able to provide rec-ommendations. Thus, it was also ensured that only similar customer groups (frequent users) were compared. The item catalog consisted of about 1,000 games. Since the number of explicit item ratings was particularly low (less than 2% of the customers issued at least one rating), also implicit item ratings were taken into account. On a rating scale from  X  2 to +2, an item view action was interpreted as a rating of 0 (medium); an actual purchase corresponds to a rating of 1 (good). Explicit customer ratings, finally, override the implicit ones.
In order to determine the  X  X usiness value X  of a recom-mender system (as opposed to the system X  X  accuracy), differ-ent measurements can be made. Obviously, one can measure and compare the total number of sold items per recommen-dation technique. In addition, one can determine whether or not personalized recommendations can raise additional interest in certain items by measuring the number of item views. This number might be particularly important in pay-per-click advertisement scenarios. Finally, also  X  X onversion rates X  that, e.g., measure how many site visitors are turned into buyers, can serve as an indicator for the business value.
In this paper, we focus on the question, whether users that receive personalized recommendations (a) view more items, and (b) buy more items than those users that re-ceive non-personalized or no recommendations. In our ex-periments (see [3] for additional measurements and results) also hypotheses regarding two different conversion rates were tested. In short, these measurements show that in certain navigational situations a slight increase with respect to con-version rates can be observed (e.g., more visitors also ac-tually purchased at least one item). Overall, however, rec-ommender systems did not measurably help to turn more visitors into buyers , most probably because the conversion rates are already relatively high as we only consider frequent users. Long-term effects and  X  X ndirect revenues X  as described in [1] were also not in the focus of the current study, because in our application domain items are only bought once.
In the following, we summarize a selected subset of im-portant observations from our study in the context of the following navigational situations; see [3] for more details. My Recommendations:
Figure 2 shows on how many items a user clicked when viewing the personalized  X  X y Recommendations X  list. 1 We can observe that all personalized methods (except Slope-One) successfully stimulated users to view the details of the proposed items, i.e., they have raised more interest in the offered items than a simple list of top-selling or top-rated items did. The differences between the following groups of techniques are statistically significant ( p&lt; 0 . 01) when con-sidering the absolute numbers: CF-Item/Hybrid  X  Content-based  X  SlopeOne/TopRating/Topseller.
 Figure 2: Average number of item detail views per  X  X y Recommendations X  visits
With respect to downloads (Figure 3) things look dif-ferent. Although the content-based method raised addi-tional interest with respect to item views, this did not lead to significantly more downloads compared with the non-personalized methods. This indicates that users are gen-erally interested in things they have bought before (e.g., sports games) as they view many of them. Once they have seen different ones, they however download only one game
As mentioned above, the control group had no access to the  X  X y Recommendations X  section. Figure 3: Average number of downloads per  X  X y Recommendations X  visit of a certain genre in this navigational context. The Slope-One and even the non-personalized TopRating method, on the other hand, stimulated users to download a relatively high percentage of the items they have been presented. The groups with statistically significant differences ( p&lt; CF-Item/Slope-One/Hybrid  X  Content-based/TopRating  X  Topseller.

Note that this figure includes both downloads of free eval-uation versions (demos) and actually purchased items. Fig-ure 3 also depicts the relative portion of demo downloads and purchases, which better reflects the business value. What can now be seen is that the TopRating method and Slope-One only lead to very few actual purchases, which can be explained by the fact that both SlopeOne and the TopRat-ing method tend to include much more demo items in their recommendation lists. The reason for this is that on the portal, explicit item ratings can only be issued after hav-ing downloaded a game. Since demos are free, they have a disproportional number of ratings, which tend to be  X  as in other domains  X  above average. Overall, Figure 3 shows that the other personalized recommendations significantly outperform the non-personalized methods as they do not only lead to at least as many purchases as the TopSeller method, but they are also able to raise interest in addi-tional items. When comparing for instance the number of downloads for the TopSeller and the CF-method in Figure 3 the increase is more than 50% in the  X  X y Recommenda-tions X  navigational situation 2 . The TopSeller method rec-ommended mainly non-free games as the list of best-selling items contained only very few demos.

Post-sales recommendation: Another navigational sit-uation in which personalized recommendations were displayed was immediately after a download. The results here are structurally similar to the  X  X y Recommendations X  situa-tion, but the effects are even amplified (see Figure 4); sig-nificant differences at p&lt; 0 . 01 between the following groups could be observed: CF-Item/Hybrid  X  SlopeOne  X  Content-based/TopRating  X  Control  X  Topseller. Again, SlopeOne and the TopRating method, which particularly promote de-mos, stimulated users to download more demos but they do not succeed in increasing sales of non-free games. Compared to the control group, which received post-sales recommen-dations based on the game release date, the number of game downloads could again be doubled with the help of more sophisticated recommendation techniques.
Overall, the customers considered in this study downloaded over 200,000 items during the evaluation period.

Other selected situations: The different measurements (conversion rates, number of viewed items, purchases) have also been made for other navigational situations and game categories. We will shortly summarize selected situations in the following.

On the start-page , only the last two text teasers and the first image teaser were personalized in the experiment by se-lecting the top 3 recommendations (see Figure 1). The other teasers remained static during the evaluation period due to existing contracts. In general, we could observe that the first image teaser attracted most of the clicks (and interestingly also a good purchase rate) although it only represented the third best recommendation, a fact, which can be attributed to its visual representation. When analyzing the click and purchase behavior on the start page in more detail, it can be seen that the effect of personalization is strong. Per-sonalizing the rather unflashy first text teaser, e.g., with the CF-method, leads to more purchases than even a non-personalized image teaser, although the general click analy-sis shows that the most clicks are on the image teaser in ev-ery situation. Recommending top-selling or top-rated items on the start page performed particularly poor. The recom-mendation of recent items (the control group) worked com-parably well, but the personalized methods outperformed all non-personalized ones, which indicates that customers are interested either in new things or in things they have al-ready seen before (but not in generally good-selling items).
In the portal section that lists the new items of the last three weeks, personalization performed badly and the man-ually determined ordering based on the release date of the control group worked best. This indicates that visitors of the  X  X ew games X  section actually expect the latest games to be among the first few entries of the list. An analysis of the general distribution of clicks on 10-point lists clearly showed that the first entries receive the most clicks. We suppose that this effect is particularly strong in our setting, where the mobile user devices have small displays and navigation to the last list entry may be cumbersome.

Overall sales effect: The overall effect on sales num-bers (without demo downloads) for the different recommen-dation approaches is shown in Figure 5. Compared with the by-release-date approach before the experiment, direct sales could be increased significantly by up to 3.6% with the content-based method but also by 2% with the CF-item method. We interpret this result as particularly encourag-ing, because a measurable increase on the overall sales could be observed, although purchases by visitors that did not re-ceive personalized recommendations were also included (which leads to a dampening effect) 3 .
 Figure 5: Total number of non-free game downloads.
Note that although the content-based worked not partic-ularly well in the  X  X yRecommendations X  and post-sales sit-uation reported earlier, a closer look at the non-free game downloads in specific subsections of the portal (such as  X  X alf price X  X r X  X rotic games X  X evealed that the content-based method often outperformed the others, leading to the overall best results. While the performance differences in the individ-ual sections were not significant and we did not report them here, they lead to a statistically significant overall sales in-crease. It thus seems that customers tend to have a tendency to purchase games of genres which they liked in the past, i.e., buyers of specific action games seem to purchase other action games. Our observations also suggest that collabora-tive methods work well in situations where the user has no strong expectation with respect to the genre ( X  X yRecom-mendations X , post sales), i.e., they can be motivated to look on games of categories they have not seen before. Once they navigate to certain categories, however, they prefer recom-mendations of item categories they liked in the past.
The study presented in this paper shows that current rec-ommender systems technology is a suitable means to gen-erate additional business value in e-Commerce. Compared with the existing system, effective sales could be increased by up to 3.6 percent by providing personalized item recom-mendations on the Mobile Internet platform. Our evaluation also showed that more research is required in the following directions. First, in Mobile Internet settings, only very few explicit ratings are available and implicit ratings have to be collected. One open question therefore relates to how to interpret these implicit ratings and which other interaction data could be exploited. Another aspect concerns accuracy measures for recommender systems. An offline evaluation of our data showed that due to the high number of similar rat-ings very low Mean Absolute Error values could be achieved by the different techniques so that no meaningful compar-ison of, say, the CF-method with the SlopeOne technique
Many visitors go for instance directly the the search inter-face of the platform when entering the portal or followed a  X  X eep-link X  from within another game that points directly to an item X  X  detail page. based on the MAE is possible (although differences exist as our study shows).

Finally, we believe that the practical question of  X  X ecom-mending recommenders X , i.e., which technique works best in which situation, needs further research. Our results sug-gest that individual techniques cause different effects and it is necessary to take the navigational situation and the user X  X  intention and expectations into account to provide highly effective recommendations. In addition, also the gen-eral customer attitudes in a particular domain (such as the supposed tendency to buy more of the same in our case) could be a factor to consider in future research. [1] M.
