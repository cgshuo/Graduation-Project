 This short paper presents initial results from a project, in which we investigated differences in how users view relevant and irrelevant Web pages on their vi sits and revisits. The users X  viewing of Web pages was characterized by eye-tracking measures, with a particular attent ion paid to changes in pupil size. The data was collected in a lab-based experiment, in which users (N=32) conducted assigned in formation search tasks on Wikipedia. We perform ed non-parametric test s of significance as well as classification. Our findings demonstrate differences in eye-tracking measures on visits and revisits to relevant and irrelevant pages and thus indi cate a feasibility of predicting perceived Web document relevanc e from eye-tracking data. In particular, relative changes in pupil size differed significantly in almost all conditions. Our work extends results from previous studies to more realistic search scenarios and to Web page visits and revisits. Experimentation, Human Factors, Measurement. H. Information Systems.

Notwithstanding the large body of work on information relevance and relevance judgments, we still do not fully understand the process of how people judge relevance of documents. It is generally agreed that relevance judgment process is dynamic and multi-dimensional [3, 12], but we are only beginning to understand how the various relevan ce aspects might be applied by users in the process of assessing documents. A fo rmal model of aggregating relevance aspects was proposed [6], but only few research projects attempted to deal with that process from the cognitive perspective [9]. Though, there is also a more recent work in which a cognitively-influenced two-stage model of document assessment was proposed [23]. Given the notion of multi-stage relevance judgment process, we aim to investigate changes in cognitive processes as they are reflected in differences in how documents are viewed and read. In the current project we are looking for evidence of such differences in cognitive processing in Web information sear ch that leads to finding one or more relevant documents. This type of investigation lends itself well to the application of eye-tracking as a data collection method. Eye-tracking helps to get insights into cognitive processes involved in assessing document relevance. Prior work that used eye-tracking in investigation of differences in user behavior between irrelevant and relevant documents tended to use simple documents (e.g., individual sentences or short paragraphs); work that used more realistic tasks and more complex documents (e.g., web pages) did not document visits and revisits, neither did it examine pupil dilation. Prior work tended to look at differences in eye measurements between levels of document relevance, but it did not examine differences at sequential stages in the information search pr ocess. Our goal in this short paper is to extend previous work by examining differences in eye-tracking derived measures on Web search tasks conducted on English Wikipedia on pages marked by user s as relevant or irrelevant. We examine fixation durations and saccade-related measures, but focus mainly on pupil dilation. To investigate differences between stages of the search process, we operationalize them in a simple way as first visits and subsequent revisits to irrelevant and relevant pages. We formulated the following hypotheses: H1. Pupil dilation and (some othe r) eye-tracking measures will differ between relevant and irrelevant pages. H2. Pupil dilation and (some othe r) eye-tracking measures will differ between first and subseq uent visits to Web pages. H3. Pupil dilation and (some othe r) eye-tracking measures will differ between visits to relevant pages when a page relevance was decided compared to other visits to the same relevant pages, when the pages were not judged as relevant yet. In the next section, we present related work to place our project in context and to motivate our hypotheses. One reason why improved understa nding of relevance judgment process from user X  X  perspective is useful, is to better model differences between trained releva nce judges and actual users. In the already mentioned work [23] , Yilmaz et al. proposed a two-stage model of document assessment. The two stages are  X 1. initial assessment X  and  X 2. extract utility X . The authors used this model to explain disparities betw een judges and users relevance assessments. In addition to being motivated by the notion of stages in document assessment, our work draws on the authors X  finding that effort plays an important role in user assessment of document relevance and their argument for including effort in modeling relevance judgment process. Other researchers also postulated for including effort in modeling interactive information search; for example, using cost of search actions to explain some aspects of search behavior [1], or using search effort to explain search task success [2]. Furthermore, Villa and Halvey [21] showed a relationship between ment al effort and relevance levels of judged documents. As we will explain later, pupil dilation, which is typically provided by eye-trackers, is related to mental effort. Eye-tracking has received considerable attention as a data source useful in information retrieval research. Much of the work has concentrated on eye fixation patt erns on ranked search results pages [4,7,14,19]. While this work brought an improved understanding of eye gaze on web pages in general, and on search engine results pages, specifical ly, it did not address how people view and read documents that differ in their degree of relevance to the user X  X  information need. In other work, eye-tracking techniques have been used in research on relevance judgments. For example, Loboda et al. [16] focused at the word-level relevance and showed a rela tionship between eye fixation measures and the relevance of terminal words in sentences. Research presented in [20] and [5] demonstrated that user X  X  eye movement behaviors would shift between scanning, reading, or deciding processes, and that r eading and skimming behavior was heavily influenced by relevance (especially by topicality of text). In agreement with these findings, [8 ,10] reported that relevant and irrelevant paragraphs and short do cuments, respectively, could be discriminated based on gaze data and eye-m ovement patterns in reading experiments. Although ey e-tracking derived measures were investigated in previous research, most of the above mentioned studies focused on fixation duration, fixation counts, and fixation locations; pupil dilation has been genera lly neglected. Cognitive psychology research informs us that under constant illumination pupil dilation is associated with mental effort and attention [18] and thus, plausibly, it may be related to cognitive processing of documents. Indeed , Gwizdka and Oliveira et al. [10,17] demonstrated that change s in pupil size are related to levels of relevance  X  pupil dilated for more relevant stimuli, both for text and images. In light of this evidence, it seems reasonable to incorporate pupilometry in interactive information retrieval research. The use of pupilometry is additionally corroborated by the relationship between pupil dilation and mental effort. In summary, eye-tracking is a feasible approach to examining user X  X  implicit relevance judgments. With the sizable body of prior work, there is still a need for more research conducted on more realistic search task scenarios and documents (e.g., on the live Web), and paying attention to sequential stages of search and to a wider range of eye-tracking measures. That X  X  where we position our current work. We conducted a lab-based experiment of Web search on Wikipedia. 32 native English sp eakers (15 females) with a normal, to corrected-to-normal vision, attended individual experiment sessions held in the Information eXperience (IX) lab in the School of Information at University of Texas at Austin. Each session was completed within 1.5 hours; participants received $30 for their participation. Each participant was asked to complete four search tasks that were designed to differ in complexity (within-subject desi gn). The searches were conducted on Wikipedia using a commercial test search engine created by Search Technologies Corp. We used the commercial search engine, because Wikipedia does not provide full-text search. Participants used a PC comput er running Windows 7 that was equipped with Tobii T60 eye-tracker. The eye-tracking and interaction data was collected usi ng Attention Tool software [13], while the task rotations and ques tionnaires were controlled by YASFIIRE software [22]. Task rotations were assigned to participants in a random order. In each task, participants read task description, completed pre-a nd post-task questionnaires, and searched Wikipedia. At the end of the session, they answered an exit questionnaire. There were no time limits set for search tasks. In this paper, our focus is on viewing behavior of Wikipedia pages. During a visit to a Wikipe dia page, in addition to reading the page, a user could open a search task description on screen, bookmark the page and enter notes, edit the previously entered notes, and decide to complete the task by entering and editing the final notes about the results of their search. According to the instructions given to our participants, bookmarking a page signified that the page was percei ved by a participant as relevant to the search task, thus the bookmarking events provided us with binary relevance judgments. Users were also able to delete any bookmark, if they decided that a page was not relevant any more. The visits to Wikipedia pages (relevant and irrelevant) were categorized into first visits and revisits. We further distinguished these visits to relevant pages when relevance judgments were made (these included fi rst visits and revisits). We isolated time periods when a user was viewing a Wikipedia page (that is not reading task description nor entering notes) and considered each of them separately in our data analysis. We call user X  X  activity during these time periods a page viewing state and emphasize that a visit to a Web page may contain one or more such states. Extraction of isolated page view ing states serves a purpose of separating cognitive activities related to document processing from other activities, and, t hus, could be considered as contributing to eye-trac king data cleaning. The perceived binary level of page relevance, page first visit, revisit, and visit with relevance judgment were factors used in data analysis. Table 1 shows ey e-tracking derived variables. We first removed page viewing st ates with few eye fixation data points by deleting states shorter th an 6 seconds. This resulted in removing less than 6% of data. All further analyses were conducted after these short states were removed. 
Level Page and visit types Count Our data did not satisfy analysis of variance assumptions, therefore we performed non-parame tric tests. We constructed a 5-level factor variable (shown in Table 2 &amp; 3) from visits to irrelevant and relevant pages and different visit types (first visits, revisits, and visits to relevant pages with relevance judgment). The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test conducted with this factor showed significant differenc es for fixation duration (  X  (4) (  X  (4) 2 =41.15, p&lt;.0001). 
Level Page and visit types Pupil dilation The post-hoc pairwise comparisons (all checked at p&lt;.05) indicated significant differences in relative change in pupil size in almost all cases, except between revi sits to irrelevant and relevant pages and visits when releva nce judgment took place; pupil dilation was the largest on these visits, while the smallest dilation was on first visits to irrelevant pages. For other variables, the pairwise comparisons indicated signi ficant differences in only in a few cases. A significantly longer fi xation durations on revisits to relevant pages compared with revisits to irrelevant and first visits to relevant pages. Saccade duration on the first visits to relevant pages tended to be longer than on irrelevant pages. The slowest saccades were on relevance judgment visits to relevant pages. The pixel-length of saccades was significantly longer on all visits to irrelevant pages compared with first visits to relevant pages. The length of saccades was significantly shortest on first visits to relevant vs. revisits or relevanc e judgment visits to these pages. These results generally confirm our hypotheses, though, to a different extent for different variab les; their pattern of significance is shown in Table 4. One can expect significant cognitive processes to take place shortly before a decision is made. Therefore, we separately examined the last 2 seconds period of each page viewing state and compared differences between all visits wi th relevance judgment visits. The Wilcoxon rank sum test showed a significant difference for pupil dilation (W = 479178, p&lt;&lt;.0001). The same test also showed a significant difference between the first and the last two seconds of a visit to a re levant page during with relevance judgment (W = 45615.5, p&lt;0.0001). Other variables were not significantly different. In both cases, pupil tended to be larger during the two second period before the relevance decision was made. To further investigate how eye-tr acking data reflects relevance judgments, we employed classifi cation. In the analysis, we proposed two models to classify tw o different situations. The first model was used to classify first vi sits to relevant pages and visits to relevant pages during which pa rticipants judged relevance. The second one was used to classify visits to irrelevant pages and visits to relevant pages dur ing which participants judged relevance. Because of the class imbalance in our datasets, we used up-sampling [15] to simulate additional data points, thereby improving balance across classes. For both models, we used flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and all five variables were included as predictors (Table 1). The parameters of the two models were tuned to maximize Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and cross-fold validation was used to evaluate the performance of the models. Outcomes of both our classification models showed that the relative pupil dilation was the most important predictor (Table 5) . The models X  performances are shown in Table 6. Table 5. Variable importance for two classification models The findings show that severa l eye-tracking derived measures significantly differ between user vi sits and revisits to relevant and irrelevant Wiki pedia pages. In particular, a larger pupil dila tion on visits to relevant pages indicates, in part, a higher ment al effort and attention paid to relevant pages, and particularly so on revisits or when a relevance judgment was finally made. This re sult is inline with the results presented in [10, 21], but it also extends them, since our investigation distinguished first a nd subsequent visits to pages. Average pupil dilation during pa ge viewing states did not differentiate between revisits and relevance judgment visits to relevant pages. However, we show ed that the significantly larger pupil dilation in the last 2 second s before the relevance judgment was made, should enable one to differentiate the relevance judgment visits from any other vis its to Web pages. This result can be plausibly explained by in creased attention during relevance judgment. Results with respect to fixation duration, saccade duration and length, generally confirm prior work. For example [5, 10], where a tendency for visual scanning of irrelevant pages and continuous reading of relevant pages was shown. Our results indicate that on revisits to relevant pages and when relevance judgments were made, the Web pages were read more carefully. Previous studies that employed eye-tracking in characterization of text relevance were typically conducted under more constrained human-information interaction and, for example, examined only reading of prepared sentences [20], paragraphs [8] or short text documents [10] and not user-s elected Web pages. Our work extends the prior research by investigating more realistic and complex interactive information retrieval scenarios on the Web and by conducting analysis at the level of page viewing states, which we constructed to isolate cognitive activities not related to document viewi ng/reading. The classification results demons trate a promise in using eye-tracking variables in predicting user X  X  perceived relevance of Wikipedia pages. While accuracy of the two models shown in this paper is rather modest, it coul d be improved by combining with other interaction data and by applying further processing to pupil size, following, for example, appr oaches described in [11, 17]. One of the motivations of our work was the notion multi-stage of relevance judgment, the differences in variables between the visits and revisits provide some indir ect support for it. Interestingly, patterns of pairwise comparison si gnificance (Table 4) differ in all but two cases (1-3 and 3-5). Plausibly one could use different combinations of variables to infe r different types of page viewing states (Table 2). This finding is a likely indication of differences in cognitive processes, such as shifts in mode of reading (e.g., scanning, skimming, and continuous reading) and levels of mental workload and attention changing between visits and revisits to pages at different levels of relevance. A limitation of the current analysis is that we did not use time sequence analysis that would allo w for more direct modeling of a sequence of stages in document asse ssment. In the future, we plan to apply techniques such as Hidden-Markov Modeling (HMM) to our data. Other limitations include, a bias in our data towards relevance as well as use of only one web site , the English Wikipedia. We believe that our results should ge neralize to other text-heavy web pages and in our future work we plan to broaden the set of web pages we use and to address other limitations. In addition, our analysis was conducted at an aggregate level across all users and all tasks. In the follow up work, we will also examine data at an individual user and task levels.
