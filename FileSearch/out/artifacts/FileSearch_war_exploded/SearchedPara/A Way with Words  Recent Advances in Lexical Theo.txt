X  Indeed, Hanks has had a formidable career in lexicography, including playing an editorial role in the production of four major English dictionaries. But Hanks X  X  achievements reach far beyond lexicography; in particular, Hanks has made numerous contributions to computational linguistics. Hanks is co-author of the tremendously influential paper  X  X ord association norms, mutual information, and lexicography X  (Church and Hanks 1989) and maintains close ties to our field. Furthermore, Hanks has advanced the understanding of the relationship between words and their meanings in text through his theory of norms and exploitations (Hanks forthcoming). in this Festschrift; this review concentrates more on those articles that are likely to be of most interest to computational linguists, and does not discuss some articles that appeal primarily to a lexicographical audience. Following the introduction to Hanks and his career by de Schryver, the collection is split into three parts: Theoretical Aspects and Background, Computing Lexical Relations, and Lexical Analysis and Dictionary Writing. 1. Part I: Theoretical Aspects and Background Part I begins with an unfinished article by the late John Sinclair, in which he begins to put forward an argument that multi-word units of meaning should be given the same status in dictionaries as ordinary headwords.

 work of the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky 2006) in Chapter 4. They argue that some extended senses can in fact be viewed as non-metaphorical usages, and offer a further classification of metaphorical usages into strong and weak metaphors depending on whether the core meaning of the predicate is generalized. 2. Part II: Computing Lexical Relations Church kicks off Part II by responding to an earlier position piece by Kilgarriff (2007). Church argues that we should not abandon the use of large, but noisy and unbalanced, corpora, and discusses tasks to which such corpora are better suited than cleaner and more balanced, but smaller, corpora.

Grefenstette uses the number of frequently occur-ring noun X  X oun and adjective X  X oun sequences on the Web to arrive at an estimate of roughly two hundred million concepts. He acknowledges some of the limitations of his estimate, but nevertheless, this estimate gives insight into the potential number of en-tries in future lexical resources.

Geyken finds that when using a one-billion-word opportunistic corpus, most verb-nominalizations in a German dictionary are found to have positive pointwise mutual information, but that this is not the case when using a one-hundred-million word balanced corpus.

Part III: Lexical Analysis and Dictionary Writing
In Chapter 15 Atkins presents DANTE (a new English lexical database manually con-structed by analyzing a large corpus of English) and contrasts it with FrameNet. Atkins discusses the possibility of (semi-automatically) linking the lexical units in DANTE and
FrameNet. This is an interesting research problem, and moreover, the results would be a very rich lexical resource which would have many potential applications in computa-tional linguistics.

Beginning with an automatically produced clustering of a word X  X  collocates, their method uses 404 an iterative process in which a lexicographer first provides sense annotations. These annotations are then used as training data for a word sense disambiguation system which is in turn applied to unannotated items. The lexicographer can then provide more annotations and the process continues. Although this could potentially be a very powerful tool for dictionary writing, the authors do note some problems with this proto-type system. For example, they find that the  X  X ne sense per collocation X  hypothesis on which much of the annotation process is based does not always hold. They also discuss the dream of a disambiguating dictionary X  X  dictionary that determines the sense of a usage in text, and returns the appropriate entry.

Rundell further comments on the continuing need for elegance in lexicography even as the space restrictions of dictio-naries are reduced due to their increasingly electronic format. 4. Conclusion Overall this Festschrift should be commended for presenting a range of research re-lated to Hanks X  X  career. Those interested in Hanks X  X  work, or new ideas related to Hanks X  X  work, would gain from taking a look at this collection. Also of potential further interest X  X specially for those interested in issues related to word senses and the relationship between words and their meanings in text X  X ay be Hanks X  X  forthcoming book detailing his theory of norms and exploitations (Hanks forthcoming). computational problems related to lexicography and lexical acquisition. 3 Graduate stu-dents or other researchers wanting to learn more about problems in these areas may therefore particularly enjoy this collection. It should be mentioned, however, that those accustomed to the high standards for empirical research in this journal and at ACL conferences may take issue with some technical points in some of the contributions. Nevertheless, such issues do not detract from the presentation of interesting problems, and this collection may very well stimulate more computational research related to lexicography.
