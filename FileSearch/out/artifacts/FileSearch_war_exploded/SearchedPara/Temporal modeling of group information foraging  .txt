 1. Introduction
Complexity and dynamism are endemic to emergencies, such as those precipitated by natural or man-made disasters ( Skertchly &amp; Skertchly, 2001; Weick, 1993, 1995 ). Rapid and multifaceted changes in the emergency situation create the need for collaboration of emergency response personnel across diverse fields (such as fire, police and medicine), and thus for robust protocols for acquiring and processing information ( Ozel, 2001; Weick, 1993 ). This study attempts to identify and model the factors that can influence these information-intensive processes within groups of emergency response personnel.

The process of information foraging, which typically refers to how information is sought and processed from different sources, is thought to have an impact on the processes and outcomes of group work ( Annett, Cunningham, &amp; Mathias-Jones, ticed by individuals, within environments ranging from the World Wide Web (e.g., Pirolli, 2007; Zhang, Jansen, &amp; Spink, in describing how humans seek and  X  X  X andle X  X  (i.e., process) information X  X  joint phenomenon that has been termed  X  X  X nfor-event severity may influence what information is sought and how it is sought and/or handled.

The work described here contributes to the burgeoning literature on information foraging in a number of ways. Most importantly, the work described here develops data modeling approaches for group-level information foraging phenomena, thereby extending prior research that has mainly focused on individual-level information foraging ( Foster, 2004; Reddy &amp;
Jansen, 2008; Weick, 1993 ), and on the use of multimethod-based techniques based on longitudinal data ( Hyldeg X rd, 2009 ). Additionally, considerable work has been undertaken on examining information foraging outcomes (e.g., appropriate-ness or quality of information that has been foraged) ( Ozel, 2001; Weick, 1993 ). The present research addresses information foraging at a process-level: that is, one that engages how foraging unfolds over time. Indeed as discussed more fully below, salient factor in explaining foraging processes. The contribution of this research is therefore twofold: it documents a mod-eling approach for the analysis of foraging activities within groups, and estimates model parameters using process-level data obtained in a structured experimental setting.

The paper proceeds as follows: a background of concepts used in formalizing the phenomena considered in this study is presented in Section 2. The methodology and findings of the study are then described (Section 3), followed by a discussion of study conclusions, contributions and limitations of this research as well as opportunities for extending it (Section 4). 2. Background
This section reviews prior conceptual and empirical work on information seeking and handling, links to information dis-tribution, cast in terms of tasks typically undertaken by emergency response organizations. 2.1. Information foraging
Information foraging is a term used to describe a complex of activities associated with the seeking, gathering, sharing and consuming of information by one or more humans ( Pirolli &amp; Card, 1999 ). Prior and ongoing research has investigated the activities framed by this term, albeit using a somewhat inconsistent terminology. For example, information seeking has also been viewed as information search ( Kray &amp; Galinsky, 2003 ) and information gathering has been denoted information acqui-activity in which information that has been gathered is shared with one or more individuals. These three terms may be used to describe activities that occur between the time an individual decides to seek for information and when the individual decided whether or not to consume (i.e., use) it.

A closer examination of information consum-ing X  X articularly in the context of group work X  X as led to a new term, information handling, which refers to  X  X  X he physical and mental acts involved in incorporating found information into the group X  X  existing knowledge base X  X  ( Wilson, 2000 ). suming and sharing), which are referred to as information seeking and information handling, respectively. One contribution of the work described below is defining and exercising methods for identifying each of these activities in group-level data. 2.2. Group information foraging
Research on information foraging is strongly grounded in individual-level practices, whether exercised independent of others, as in studies of information foraging by individuals via the World Wide Web (e.g., Pirolli, 2007; Zhang et al., 2009 ) or dependent on others, as in studies of large groups of individuals whose search results are made available to others social information foraging does not imply explicit collaboration across individuals. In a collaborative setting, individuals on group work has identified factors such as complexity of the collective task (e.g., McGrath, 1984; Vakkari, 1999 ), commu-processes and outcomes ( Johnson, 2003; Savolainen, 1999 ). In sum, these studies point to the need for a proper understand-ing of the distribution of information among group members in order for the group to be effective in achieving their collec-tive goal. 2.3. Information distribution
Prior studies strongly suggest sharp differences in patterns of human information processing and decision making when the environment in which these activities take place is characterized by dynamism ( Brehmer, 1992; Gonzalez, 2004 ) and high stakes ( Klein, Orasnu, Calderwood, &amp; Zsambok, 1993; Perrow, 1984 ). Indeed, it is well known that X  X iven particular exogenous conditions X  X nformation that is held by one member will be unlikely to be shared with others, even when doing portion of group members who hold some information beforehand, determines initial commonality of information ( Stasser &amp; one group member) to common (i.e., known by all group members). 2.4. Information foraging in emergency response organizations
In the event of a large-scale emergency, the activities of responding organizations are coordinated by emergency response the high stakes in emergencies, a premium is placed on seeking, handling and managing information in a timely fashion in order to make effective decisions ( Klein et al., 1993; Perrow, 1984 ). Thus EROs may be characterized as information hubs during emergency response, where problems across organizational boundaries are addressed and decisions made under time constraints ( Quarantelli, 1978; Scanlon, 1994 ). These characteristics make EROs well suited for the study of group informa-tion foraging.

Information foraged by an ERO may rely on human or non-human sources. Each group member typically holds informa-tion that is relevant to the task but differs from or complements information held by others. The proportion of group mem-bers who hold some information beforehand determines initial commonality of information ( Stasser &amp; Titus, 1987; Stasser et al., 1989 ). 3. Research objective
The objective of this study is to develop a temporal model for analyzing information foraging behavior of a multi-disci-plinary group responding to a simulated emergency scenario. This entails estimating the extent to which time explains the variability in information foraging behavior within a particular group. The following research questions (RQs) guide this investigation:
Time series analysis is used to address these questions as it holds the potential to model temporal factors that underlying information foraging activities. 4. Study design
This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment in which a group of emergency response personnel interact with in order to meet the goals of the emergency response. Information relevant to the case is available through a computer inter-face, and can be discussed among participants. All conversations are video and audio taped, and all direct manipulations of the computer interface are logged for analysis. 4.1. Participants and roles
Participants were emergency managers taking part in a training course at the US National Fire Academy (NFA). Each group consists of five roles: one group coordinator (CO), and one representative from each of the following four emergency ser-vices: Police Department (PD), Fire Department (FD), Medical Officer (MO) and Chemical Advisor (CA). All participants had at least 10 years of experience in their organization, and reported having participated in tens to hundreds of exercises, as well as responding to thousands of emergencies. 4.2. Experiment design
The group convened in a conference room, seated so that they could view each other face-to-face, with video cameras and microphones set up to record their interactions. The group was first presented with an overview of the session, the com-pleted consent forms and background questionnaires. They next chose their roles, based on their area of expertise, and prac-ticed using the computer-based system on a test case until all stated that they understood their task and how to use the simulated environment to perform it. They were then presented with the information on the case.
 4.3. Task and simulation environment
The task of the group concerned a cargo ship fire with subsequent oil spill. Case materials were developed from archival reports of prior incidents, supplemented by discussions with subject matter experts. The group X  X  task was to allocate re-sources to the incident in order to meet four response goals: (1) control of access to incident location; (2) control of fire at incident location; (3) removal of trapped persons from danger; and (4) treatment of injured persons. Information on resources and panels with information about the status of the emergency on the right. Icons on the map serve as aides to resources that are controllable by a particular discipline. Information about other resources associated with another role had to be requested verbally. The CO had access to all information pertaining to the case. 4.4. Study data
Study data are taken from two complementary sources: logs of group members X  interaction with the simulation, and tran-scribed records of conversation among group members, coded for content to permit data analysis. As shown in Table 1 , the column Source indicates whether the data were taken from the log of interaction with the computer ( L ) or from the conver-sation transcript ( T ).

For the logs, an entry was generated whenever a group member clicked on a site ( Site ) or the Goal ( Goal ) button. Also sion, group and participant role ( Role ). InfoType indicates whether the information was initially common or unique, while
Behavior indicates whether the item was sought or handled. As an example, the second record in Table 1 shows that partic-truck) is coded as initially unique since it is only visible to the FD. Note that the information item becomes common when it is announced to the group at time 35. In other words, an information item is common to every member of the group if is communicated to the group at the beginning of the experiment; otherwise, it is unique.

For the transcripts, an instrument was developed for identifying and classifying details of the activities of information seeking and handling. Information seeking refers to purposive search for information, and is said to occur when in the following instances: questions requesting information from other group members; responses to such inquiries; other provision of information to group members. Information handling refers to the incorporation of found information into existing knowledge, and is said to occur in the following instances: statements concerning the allocation of resources; suggestions about courses of actions that may be submitted; explanations about allocation of resources and/or submis-sions of courses of action; and evaluations and confirmations concerning any allocation of resources and/or accomplish-ment of goals.
 the role of CA handled the unique information item  X  X  X as masks at Site C X  X . For the transcript data, two independent coders transcripts. Each statement in the transcript was time-synchronized with the corresponding computer log files to the level of seconds before being analyzed. Data from the three experiments are independently used to estimate parameters of the proposed model. 5. Methodology
The methodology for this study X  X ime series analysis X  X nables identification and estimation of temporal effects of prior foraging behavior on current foraging behavior. This problem arises in numerous situations, particularly those where behav-ioral patterns are suspected to be cyclical or otherwise temporally patterned (e.g., systematically increasing or decreasing over time). In contrast, typical approaches to the analysis of foraging data focus on pre-and post-foraging measures (e.g., net change in the number of information targets retrieved). Time series models seek to account directly for serial depen-dency (autocorrelation) in the data, allowing for prediction of future foraging behavior without an attempt to measure inde-that they enable consideration of temporal factors that cannot be captured via pre-/post-techniques such as ANOVA, but under study. For example, time series analysis may be employed to identify whether foraging effort oscillates, and if so over what period. It may also be employed to identify whether foraging effort decreases or increases overall, thus providing a de-gree of continuity with pre-/post-techniques.

The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series modeling approach ( Box &amp; Jenkins, 1976 ) includes both autoregressive ( p ) and moving average parameters ( q ) as well as differencing ( d ) in the formulation of the model, and may be summarized using the notation ARIMA ( p , q , d ); p is the number of autoregressive terms, d is the number of non-seasonal differences and q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation. For example, given a time autoregressive parameter and 1 moving average parameter after it was differenced once to attain stationarity. Equation 1 shows that the time series has one period ahead y t 1 relationship with its current value y / , / 1 are constants; | / 1 | &lt; 1, high value of / 1 denotes strong serial dependency in the series data, e noise series e t N  X  0 ; r 2 a  X  .

Box and Jenkins (1976) provide detailed procedure of estimating goodness of fit and parameter estimates of ARIMA models consisting of the following steps: model identification, model parameter estimation, and model diagnostics. Mod-el identification examines the data to identify appropriate procedures for achieving stationarity in the time series being investigated. It also yields the order of the regular and seasonal auto regressive and moving average polynomials that is necessary to represent the time series model. The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) measures the amount of linear depen-dence between observations in a time series that are separated by a lag k . The Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plot helps to determine the number of autoregressive terms necessary to reveal one or more of the following character-istics: time lags where high correlations appear, seasonality of the series, trend either in the mean level or in the var-iance of the series.

Model parameter estimation yields values that minimize the Sum of the Squared Residuals (SSR) between the real data and the estimated values. In general, a non-linear, maximum-likelihood estimation method is used.

Model diagnostic procedures are used to examine the adequacy of the residual error from the fitted model, typically accomplished by examining residual ACF plots and by conducting formal goodness-of-fit tests. If the residuals are correlated, then the model should be refined as in step 1 above. Otherwise, the autocorrelations are regarded white noise and the mod-eling process is concluded.

Time series analysis requires equal time periods between observations. Here, a time period of 15 s was used (this time period covered approximately five conversation turns on average). All statistical calculations were performed using PROC
ARIMA in SAS v.9.1. 6. Results
A summary of results from the three sessions is first provided, followed by a discussion of their interpretation. All statis-tical tests were performed at a = 0.05 unless otherwise noted.
Data are summarized in Fig. 2 . The right panel in Fig. 2 shows the number of foraging activities (i.e., combined seeking and handling activities) for common versus unique information at each interval for each group. For instance, there were seven and two instances of foraging for common and unique information items, respectively, in the second time interval in group in the first time interval there were 2 instances of information seeking in group A .
 Consistent with time series analysis methodology, the following analyses are performed to address the research questions.
The firstisan attempttomodelforagingforcommonversusunique information(RQ1);the secondis anattemptto modelseek-ing versus handling activities, ignoring whether the information being sought or handled is common or unique (RQs 2 and 3). 6.1. Foraging for unique versus common information
The data for addressing RQ1 are those shown on the right panel in Fig. 2 . It may be noted that foraging for unique infor-mation generally exceeds foraging for common information across all groups. The relevant data are captured in a single var-iable by modeling the proportion of foraging effort devoted to common versus unique information. However, the model that a Box X  X enkins approach is not appropriate. It may therefore be concluded that past foraging activities do not explain distribution of the group information foraging effort for common versus unique sources. 6.2. Effort devoted to seeking versus handling
The data for addressing RQs 2 and 3 are those shown on the left panel in Fig. 2 . The patterns here differ in morphol-lier and middle stages; for group C , they peak in the earlier stages, then generally decrease. Handling activities are perhaps more difficult to characterize: A appears to occupy a narrow range, while those for groups B and C rise with no readily discernible pattern.

Apparent in all three series is a stronger pattern of peaks and valleys without appreciable upward or downward trends. As (1) the estimated proportion of seeking activities and (2) the estimated proportion of handling activities (  X  p  X  p no drift in the data, suggesting that prior values of p  X  can indeed be used to model future ones.

Having identified that an ARIMA model may be appropriate, parameters are estimated as follows. To estimate the auto-value (shown on the vertical access) associated with values of the autocorrelation that exceed zero by two standard errors. suggesting that the appropriate model for the data is ARIMA(1,0,1).
 To complete the analysis, the data were fitted to the ARIMA model using maximum likelihood estimation methods ( Box &amp;
Jenkins, 1976 ), producing the following results for each group:
The above models suggest that foraging activity in the current period, when expressed as a function of seeking versus handling, is significantly related to foraging activity in the previous period. Moreover, the model suggests that the value said to decrease over time, as discussed more fully in the following section. 7. Discussion 7.1. Foraging for unique versus common information
The results show that distribution of information foraging effort across unique and common sources is not time depen-dent X  X espite the strong time constraints built into the experiment task. This result mirrors those typically seen when data groups X  preference for unique over common information may be time-invariant.

It is also instructive to reflect on the relationship between this conclusion and performance of the experiment task. Many crucial decisions (e.g., transport of the Medical Officer X  X  CO extracting (and using) unique information from other participants (e.g., identifying possible means for transporting CO the incident location by, say, querying the Fire Department about the operational status of its ladder trucks X  X  unique infor-mation item). To determine if participant role is associated with distribution of foraging effort across unique and common sources, the following exploratory test is undertaken. A reasonable null model is one of independence between role of forager some weak support that division of foraging effort across unique versus common sources is shaped by role. 7.2. Information seeking versus handling
In contrast to the results for foraging of common versus unique information, the results for information seeking versus handling show a significant and strong temporal dependency: as time passes, foraging activity decreases. The specific el of some type may help explain division of effort between common and unique sources, it is the factor of time that explains division of effort between information seeking versus information handling, answering research questions 2 and 3.
From the broader perspective of collaboration or group work, the data and results strongly suggest interplay between seeking and handling activities. There are no periods where one of these activities clearly dominates the other. It is also immediately obvious from the raw data that there is frequent switching between seeking and handling activities. In a dy-namic decision making environment, the information space may be changing as new information is created (e.g., by com-bining existing information) and other information is lost or becomes outdated. It may therefore be beneficial for collaborative foraging tools to provide some mechanism for buffering the information space, as well as tools for operating (2008) and by Sarcevic (2009) . 7.3. Overall observations
Taken together, the results for these data suggest first that, for these data, ARIMA-type models are not appropriate for modeling foraging activity devoted to common versus unique information. Because no trend has been detected, the results do not support an earlier contention that groups are thought to devote more time and effort to seeking common information appropriate for modeling distribution of effort between seeking and handling activities, ignoring whether the information being sought and handled is common or unique.

This study also confirms prior research by providing empirical evidence for collaborative strategies that groups employ to 2001; Johnson, 2003; Savolainen, 1995, 1999 ). As such, design of systems to support collaborative information foraging, especially in time critical domains, should incorporate high efficiency in computing and assessing potential resource alloca-tion alternatives in order to minimize the tendency of group members to resort to a less effective collaborative strategy ( Janis, 1972; Vakkari, 1999 ). 8. Conclusions
This study has examined the possibility that a single variable X  X ime X  X ay explain variability within group information foraging behavior. The process-oriented approach taken here is in contrast to difference-based approaches such as ANOVA that estimate aggregate differences between experimental conditions X  X s opposed to changes within those conditions. The tween common versus unique information.

These results speak not only to some of the methodological issues and opportunities in modeling foraging behavior, but handle information from a potentially complex and evolving array of sources. Understanding the determinants of foraging behavior should lead to guidelines on how to conduct training and how best to address operational needs in the field.
With regard to training, the approach taken here offers the opportunity for close examination of information foraging, but
Fiedrich, 2006 ), a systematic approach of the design of training environments relative to training goals should be taken if approaches such as this one are to be applied with success in practice.

With regard to operational needs, the results suggest that tools to support collaborative information foraging should encapsulate or afford some degree of temporal awareness. The presence of temporal dependency in foraging activity in this study, for example, may be viewed as indicative of the highly time-dependent nature of ERO work processes in general. In time left for convergent thinking (i.e., both information handling and choice/decision making).
