This Special Issue of ACM TALIP features recent advances in information processing and access for Japanese. While TALIP has already been recog-nized as a representative journal covering Asian language information pro-cessing, the number of submissions related to Japanese language processing has been limited compared with language processing of other Asian languages. One of the reasons could be that there are already several publication sources for work on Japanese language processing in Japan. Since Japanese is one of major Asian languages and shares various characteristics with other lan-guages, it is important to promote more publications on Japanese language processing from researchers in Japan through more internationally accessible channels.

From the journals acting as vehicles of Japanese language processing, we chose three journals: IPSJ (Information Processing Society of Japan) Journal, IPSJ Transactions on Databases (TOD), and the Journal of Natural Language Processing (published by the Association for Natural Language Processing), and initially selected 46 papers, published in 2004, that we thought were ap-propriate for this Special Issue. (We excluded papers that did not deal with Japanese language in any way and those that were related to NTCIR, since TALIP recently had a Special Issue on NTCIR-4.) We sent a Call for Papers to the first authors of these papers, encouraging them to substantially extend their work and to make it globally accessible. Fifteen papers were submitted in response to our invitation. Each paper was reviewed by three international experts in the fields of natural language processing or information retrieval, as is the case with all other ACM TALIP publications. In the initial review, seven papers were rejected and all others were returned to the authors with detailed comments from the reviewers. Since the schedule was very tight and we could not give the authors enough time for revision, one paper was withdrawn before the revised paper deadline. After the second screening of the papers, two papers were rejected. Finally, the following five papers were accepted and are included in this issue:
Efficient Retrieval for Example-based Machine Translation Using Edit-distance by Takao Doi, Hirofumi Yamamoto, and Eiichiro Sumita Estimating Satisfactoriness of Selectional Restriction from Corpus without Thesaurus by Yoichi Tomiura, Shosaku Tanaka, and Toru Hitaka Anaphora Resolution by Antecedent Identification Followed by Anaphoricity Determination by Ryu Iida, Kentaro Inui, and Yuji Matsumoto Acquiring Causal Knowledge from Text using the Connective Marker tame by Takashi Inui, Kentaro Inui, and Yuji Matsumoto Topic X  X tructure-Based Complementary Information Retrieval and Its Appli-cation by Qiang Ma and Katsumi Tanaka
Although these papers address a variety of interesting and challenging top-ics, they represent limited areas of research work recently done on information processing and access for Japanese. The editors hope that this Special Issue will provide a good starting opportunity for introducing and sharing informa-tion with researchers working on various Asian languages.

Last, but not least, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to the following people for their hard work in reviewing the papers. Without their high quality and punctual reviews, we could not have made this Special Issue available in this current form: Akiko Aizawa (NII, Japan), Christian Boitet (Universit  X  e Joseph Fourier, France), Tetsuro Chino (Toshiba Corporate R&amp;D Center, Japan), Nick Craswell (Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK), Yasuharu Den (Chiba University, Japan), Ayman Farahat (PARC, USA), Gregory
