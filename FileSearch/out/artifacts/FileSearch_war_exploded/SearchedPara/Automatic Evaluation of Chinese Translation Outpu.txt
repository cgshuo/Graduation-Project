 White space serves as the word delimiter in Latin alphabet-based languages. However, in written Chinese text, there is no word delimiter. Thus, in almost all tasks of Chinese natural language processing (NLP), the first step is to segment a Chinese sentence into a seque nce of words. This is the task of Chinese word segmentation (CWS), an important and challenging task in Chinese NLP. 
Some linguists believe that word (containing at least one character) is the appropriate unit for Chi-nese language processing. When treating CWS as a standalone NLP task, the goal is to segment a sen-tence into words so that the segmentation matches the human gold-standard segmentation with the highest F-measure, but without considering the performance of the end-to-end NLP application that uses the segmentation output. In statistical machine translation (SMT), it can happen that the most accurate word segmentation as judged by the human gold-standard segmentation may not produce the best translation output (Zhang et al., 2008). While state-of-the-art Chinese word segmenters achieve high accuracy, some errors still remain. 
Instead of segmenting a Chinese sentence into words, an alternative is to split a Chinese sentence into characters, which can be readily done with perfect accuracy. However, it has been reported that a Chinese-English phrase-based SMT system (Xu et al., 2004) that relied on characters (without CWS) performed slightly worse than when it used segmented words. It has been recognized that vary-ing segmentation granularities are needed for SMT (Chang et al., 2008). 
To evaluate the quality of Chinese translation output, the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation in 2005 (IWSLT'2005) used the word-level BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002). However, IWSLT'08 and NIST'08 adopted character-level evaluation metrics to rank the sub-mitted systems. Although there is much work on automatic evaluation of m achine translation (MT), whether word or character is more suitable for au-tomatic evaluation of Chinese translation output has not been systematically investigated. 
In this paper, we utilize various machine transla-tion evaluation metrics to evaluate the quality of Chinese translation output, and compare their cor-relation with human assessment when the Chinese translation output is segmented into words versus characters. Since there are several CWS tools that can segment Chinese sent ences into words and their segmentation results ar e different, we use four representative CWS tools in our experiments. Our experimental results reveal that character-level me-trics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics. That is, CWS is not essential for automatic evaluation of Chinese translation output. Our analysis suggests several key reasons behind this finding. Automatic MT evaluation aims at formulating au-tomatic metrics to measure the quality of MT out-put. Compared with human assessment, automatic evaluation metrics can assess the quality of MT output quickly and objectively without much hu-man labor. 
To evaluate English translation output, automat-ic MT evaluation metrics take an English word as the smallest unit when matching a system transla-tion and a reference translation. On the other hand, to evaluate Chinese translation output, the smallest unit to use in matching can be a Chinese word or a Chinese character. As shown in Figure 1, given an English sentence  X  how much are the umbrellas?  X  a Chinese system translatio n (or a reference transla-tion) can be segmented into characters (Figure 1(a)) or words (Figure 1(b)). 
A variety of automatic MT evaluation metrics have been developed over the years, including BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (exact) (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), GTM (Melamed et al., 2003), and TER (Snover et al., 2006). Some automatic MT evalua-tion metrics perform deeper linguistic analysis, such as part-of-speech tagging, synonym matching, semantic role labeling, etc. Since part-of-speech tags are only defined for Chinese words and not for Chinese characters, we restrict the automatic MT evaluation metrics explored in this paper to those metrics listed above which do not require part-of-speech tagging. Since there are a number of CWS tools and they give different segmentation results in general, we experimented with four different CWS tools in this paper. ICTCLAS: ICTCLAS has been successfully used in a commercial product (Zhang et al., 2003). The version we adopt in this paper is ICTCLAS2009. NUS Chinese word segmenter (NUS): The NUS Chinese word segmenter uses a maximum entropy approach to Chinese word segmentation, which achieved the highest F-measure on three of the four corpora in the open track of the Second Interna-tional Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (Ng and Low, 2004; Low et al., 2005). The segmenta-tion standard adopted in this paper is CTB (Chi-nese Treebank). Stanford Chinese word segmenter (STANFORD): The Stanford Ch inese word seg-menter is another well-known CWS tool (Tseng et al., 2005). The version we used was released on 2008-05-21 and the standard adopted is CTB. Urheen: Urheen is a CWS tool developed by (Wang et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2010b), and it outperformed most of the state-of-the-art CWS systems in the CIPS-SIGHAN X 2010 evaluation. This tool is trained on Chinese Treebank 6.0. 4.1 Data To compare the word-level automatic MT evalua-tion metrics with the character-level metrics, we conducted experiments on two datasets, in the spo-ken language translation domain and the newswire translation domain. 
The IWSLT'08 English-to -Chinese ASR chal-lenge task evaluated the translation quality of 7 machine translation systems (Paul, 2008). The test set contained 300 segments with human assess-ment of system translation quality. Each segment came with 7 human reference translations. Human assessment of translation quality was carried out on the fluency and adequacy of the translations, as well as assigning a rank to the output of each sys-tem. For the rank judgment, human graders were asked to " rank each whole sentence translation from best to worst rela tive to the other choices " (Paul, 2008). Due to the high manual cost, the flu-ency and adequacy assessment was limited to the output of 4 submitted systems, while the human rank assessment was applied to all 7 systems. Evaluation based on ranking is reported in this pa-per. Experimental results on fluency and adequacy judgment also agree with the results on human rank assessment, but are not included in this paper due to length constraint. 
The NIST'08 English-to-Chinese translation task evaluated 127 documents with 1,830 segments. Each segment has 4 refere nce translations and the system translations of 11 MT systems, released in the corpus LDC2010T01. We asked native speak-ers of Chinese to perform fluency and adequacy judgment on a five-point scale. Human assessment was done on the first 30 documents (355 segments) (document id  X  X FP_ENG_20070701.0026 X  to  X  X FP_ENG_20070731.0115 X ). The method of manually scoring the 11 submitted Chinese system translations of each segment is the same as that used in (Callison-Burch et al., 2007). The adequa-cy score indicates the overlap of the meaning ex-pressed in the reference tran slations with a system translation, while the fl uency score indicates how fluent a system translation is. 4.2 Segment-Level Consistency or Correla-tion For human fluency and adequacy judgments, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to compute the segment-level correlation between human judgments and automatic metrics. Human rank judgment is not an absolute score and thus Pearson correlation coefficient cannot be used. We calcu-late segment-level consistency as follows: Ties are excluded in pair-wise comparison. 
Table 1 and 2 show the segment-level consisten-cy or correlation between human judgments and automatic metrics. The  X  X haracter X  row shows the segment-level consistency or correlation between human judgments and automatic metrics after the system and reference translations are segmented into characters. The  X  X CTCLAS X ,  X  X US X ,  X  X TANFORD X , and  X  X rheen X  rows show the scores when the system and reference translations are segmented into words by the respective Chi-nese word segmenters. 
The character-level metrics outperform the best word-level metrics by 2  X  5% on the IWSLT X 08 CT-EC task, and 4  X  13% on the NIST X 08 EC task. 4.3 System-Level Correlation We measure correlation at the system level using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The sys-tem-level correlations of word-level metrics and character-level metrics are summarized in Table 3 and 4. 
Because there are only 7 systems that have hu-man assessment in the IWSLT X 08 CT-EC task, the gap between character-level metrics and word-level metrics is very small. However, it still shows that character-level metrics perform no worse than word-level metrics. For the NIST X 08 EC task, the system translations of the 11 submitted MT sys-tems were assessed manually. Except for the GTM metric, character-level metrics outperform word-level metrics. For BLEU and TER, character-level metrics yield up to 6  X  9% improvement over word-level metrics. This means the character-level me-trics reduce about 2  X  3 erroneous system rankings. When the number of systems increases, the differ-ence between the character-level metrics and word-level metrics will become larger. We have analyzed the reasons why character-level metrics better correlate with human assessment than word-level metrics. 
Compared to word-level metrics, character-level metrics can capture more synonym matches. For example, Figure 1 gives the system translation and a reference translation segmented into words: Translation:  X  X  X  _  X  _  X  _  X  _  X  _  X  Reference:  X  X  X  _  X  X  X  _  X  X  X  _  X  _  X 
The word  X   X   X  is a synonym for the word  X   X   X   X , and both words are translations of the English word  X  umbrella  X . If a word-level metric is used, the word  X   X   X  in the system translation will not match the word  X   X  X  X   X  in the reference translation. However, if the system and reference translation are segmented into characters, the word  X   X   X  in the system translation shares the same character  X   X   X  with the word  X   X  X  X   X  in the reference. Thus character-level metrics can better capture synonym matches. 
We can classify the semantic relationships of words that share some common characters into three types: exact match, partial match, and no match. The statistics on the output translations of an MT system are shown in Table 5. It shows that  X  X xact match X  accounts for 71% (29/41) and  X  X o match X  only accounts for 7% (3/41). This means that words that share some common characters are synonyms in most cases. Therefore, character-level metrics do a better job at matching Chinese transla-tions. 
Another reason why word-level metrics perform worse is that the segmented words in a system translation may be inconsistent with the segmented words in a reference transl ation, since a statistical word segmenter may segment the same sequence of characters differently depending on the context in a sentence. For example: Translation:  X  _  X  _  X  X  _  X  _  X  Reference:  X  _  X  _  X  _  X  _  X  _  X  X  _  X 
Here the word  X   X  X   X  is the Chinese translation of the English word  X  Kyoto  X . However, it is seg-mented into two words,  X   X   X  and  X   X   X , in the ref-erence translation by the same CWS tool. When this happens, a word-level metric will fail to match them in the system and reference translation. While the accuracy of state-of-the-art CWS tools is high, segmentation errors still exist and can cause such mismatches. 
To summarize, character-level metrics can capture more synonym matches and the resulting segmentation into characters is guaranteed to be consistent, which makes character-level metrics more suitable for the automatic evaluation of Chinese translation output. In this paper, we conducted a detailed study of the relative merits of word-lev el versus character-level metrics in the automatic evaluation of Chinese translation output. Our experimental results have shown that character-level metrics correlate better with human assessment than word-level metrics. Thus, CWS is not needed for automatic evaluation of Chinese translation output. Our study provides the needed justification for the use of character-level metrics in evaluating SMT systems in which Chinese is the target language.
