 Historically, environmental, hydrographic , meteorological, and oceanographic data have been collected by numerous local, state, and federal agencies as well as by universities around the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The GOM observing systems are organized into two groups pertaining to (1) in situ observations (see Figure 1), and (2) satellite observations. Each in situ observation contains a number of stations and each station (represented as a point in Figure 1) provides public Web data source access [7]. Nowadays, users have to manually interact with these large collections of Internet data sources, determine which ones to access and how to access, and manually merge results from different observational stations. Without an adequate system and personnel for managing data, the magnitude of the effort needed to deal with such large and complex data sets can be a substantial barrier to the GOM research. 
We intend to answer complex queries by developing a mediator-based data integra-tion system to access the underlying distributed and heterogeneous Web sources of various locations. The integration system should be able to not only answer the tradi-tional keyword-based queries, but also take the consideration of the spatial terms/concepts in the search. The examples of the spatial-aware queries are: 
Every GOM in situ observational station contains geospatial information including addresses and geographic references ((x, y)-coordinates). This information can be exploited and used to provide spatial awareness to integration systems. Yet most peo-ple use place names to refer to geographical locations, and will usually be entirely ignorant of the corresponding coordinates. In the paper, our focuses are to investigate the methods that represent the spatial features of the underlying data sources for quali-tative spatial reasoning. We employ a qualitative notion instead of a quantitative no-tion of spatial information because the chosen representation does not need to worry about the real data and measurements. Verbal descriptions are typically not metrically precise, but sufficient for the task intended. Imprecise descriptions are necessary in query languages where one specifies some spatial properties such as the wind tem-perature not far away from Corpus Christi coast. 
In order to support expressive spatial queries as well as to carry out qualitative spa-tial reasoning in an intuitive way, four relations have been proposed in [13]: Par-tonomic relations , Distance , Topological relations , and Directional relations . To the best of our knowledge, the BUSTER system [12,13,15] is the only implemented data integration system that supports two spatial features, partonomy and neighborhood graphs, in query answering and data retrieval. But the BUSTER system does not in-corporate the distance and directional relati ons. Their research efforts have concen-due to the lack of a comprehensive spatial reasoning framework. 
Often partonomic, distance, topological, and directional information is available about objects in a scene and it is necessary to use a combination of the two or more the above four spatial features. In particular, the framework utilizes inferences on combined spatial information about distance and directional relations. Unlike the BUSTER system where the build of neighborhood graph is straightforward because it deals with regions with the natural border, we have to utilize the Delaunay triangula-tion to determine the direct neighbor of point objects with no obvious border (see Figure 1). In addition, we propose a probability-based heuristic method to uniquely infer the directional information of indirectly connected points. Techniques for representing and reasoning about qualitative spatial information have been extensively studied in Artificial Intelligences (AI). The efficient spatial problem levels of spatial abstraction have been identified in terms of topology, ordinal and metrics [13], which correspond to the topological, directional and distance relations defined in Section 1, respectively. 
The spatial abstraction and reasoning approaches developed in AI research are in-adequate for the field of information retrieval and data integration because we have to explicitly represent and reason spatial relevance as well as retrieve conceptually rele-vant data. Although it is possible to use OWL (Web Ontology Language) to describe as well as reason about spatial properties, OWL has very limited build-in inference capabilities, and an extension of the formal semantics to integrate spatial relations into OWL turns out to be undecidable [8]. A better solution is to evaluate the queries with conceptual and spatial criteria separately. As a result, Stuckenschmidt et al. [13] pro-posed to represent the spatial information in four relations: partonomic, topological, directional, and distance relations. But the four relations have never been applied to a real system and the scenarios handled are relative simple in [13] with the four rela-tions considered separately, while the proposed probability-based heuristic method takes into the consideration the combination of distance and directional relations. BUSTER system [12,13,15] is the only implemented system that supports the par-tonomic and neighborhood relations, which are derived from the geographic tessella-tion of homogeneous decomposition. Spatial relevance is determined by the weighted sum of the partonomic and neighborhood relations. In addition, a system of eight calculus RCC-8 is widely used in GIS applications to describe the region connection relations [2,4,11]. 
In the rest of the paper, we use Texas area as an example to present the framework and the same idea can be applied to other GOM US states, such as Florida. In this section, we propose a framework to qualitatively represent the four spatial relations: partonomic, distance, topological, and directional relations. 3.1 Partonomic Relation applying the above partition method to divide an area, such as A 1 , to multiple smaller areas A 11 ,..., A 1m . Figure 1(a) represents station partonomies in Texas area from north to south: 1. Beaumont , 2. Houston , 3. Corpus Christi , and 4. Brownsville , and Figure 1(b) shows the corresponding decomposition tree, where S represents a station or a buoy. Each partonomy contains several different types of stations, and one type of station can appear in more than one partonomy. For example, TABS , TCOON , and NWLON stations can be found in all four partonomies, and the partonomy Corpus Christi includes TABS , Army Corps of Engineers Wave Sites ( ACEWS ), TCOON , NWLON , and NDBC Moored ( NDBCM ) buoys. For more details about stations in each area, please refer to Figure 1(b). 
This partition is sort of coarse and other finer partitions may be created based on the application needs. The simple queries can be answered by partonomic information including the water level in the Houston area or in the south Texas, etc. 3.2 Distance Relation and ocean based upon their distance from the land. The coastal stations are the ones that Figure 2 shows that there are four kinds of costal stations: ACEWS , TCOON , NWLON , and NDBC C-MAN . The offshore stations usually are the buoy systems that are not close to the land but within the continental shelf. All of the TABS and part of NDBCM the land and are outside of the continental shelf. The only station in Figure 2 that can be put in this category is NDBCM Buoy 42002 in the partonomy Brownsville . 
Correspondingly, we adopt from [5] the five-step distance with five symbols: very between two nearest coastal stations, between one costal station and one offshore station, and between one offshore station and one ocean station in one area are usually defined as very close or close , medium , and far , respectively. For example, in Figure 2 the distance is very close from TCOON 051 to TCOON 018, close from TCOON 017 to TCOON 047, medium from TCOON 051 to TABS K , and far from TABS K to NDBC 42002. The last symbol very far is used to describe the distance that is farther (not shown in Figure 2). 
Based upon the above distance concept, the distance addition operation is defined law. A real example for C + C = M is that in Figure 2 TCOON 003 indirectly links to 047 through 017, so the distance between 003 and 047 is M . The neighborhood graph is introduced in Section 3.3 and Figure 2 is a subgraph of Figure 3(e). 
The simple queries can be answered by combining partonomic and distance rela-dium ) from TCOON 047, etc (see Figure 2). 3.3 Topological Relation Topology is useful in information integration and retrieval because many spatial mod-eling operations require only topological in formation instead of coordinates (latitude and longitude). In GIS, the mostly consid ered topological relatio nships are neighbor-hood (what is next to what), containment (what is enclosed by what), and proximity (how close something is to something else). Because there is no containment relation-ship between any observational sites, we only consider the neighborhood and proximity relationships in the paper. To be more specific, proximity graphs are ex-neighborhood graph of the ocean observational stations is a graph G = ( N , E ), where N represent stations and E the imaginary edges between two neighboring stations. 
We now look at four types of neighborhood relations, minimum spanning tree (MST), relative neighborhood graph (RNG) [14], Gabriel graph (GG) [6], and Delau-nay triangulation (DT) [1]. A point in MST has the least number of neighbors while a node in DT has the most neighbors. In other words, for a given set of points N , each neighborhood graph (the graph giving for each point its set of neighbors) in the fol-lowing list is a subgraph of the subsequent one [9]: MST  X  RNG  X  GG  X  DT. Stronger requirement of neighborhood makes it relatively difficult for two points to be neighbors. In the paper, we do not consider MST neighborhood relation because each point has the least neighbors in the above four neighborhood relations. The Texas stations and the corresponding neighborhood graphs of RNG, GG, and DT are shown in Figure 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), and 3(d), respectively. It is easy to tell from Figure 3(b) that the RNG graph is not a good candidate for our application because most nodes only have two direct neighbors. Too few direct neighbors complicate the queries in which the user is requesting the information around a station. Although more edges have been added in Figure 3(c), the GG graph still has the similar not-enough-direct-neighbor problem. In the same area we expect that the closely located in Houston area but N 1 is not directly linked to N 2 . On the other hand, the DT graph Figure 3(d) generates some extra unnecessary neighbors. The problems in Fig-because the environmental and weather situation in one area is quite different from that of another remote area. For example the coastal station P 1 should not be the direct neighbor of the ocean station P 2 . (2) A coastal station in one region should not link to the coastal station in another region. The reason is that the coastal stations are usually stations in different regions is low. For example, P 3 in Houston should not link to P 4 in Corpus Christi . 
As a result, an intermediate neighborhood graph between GG and DT will suit our application needs. There are two ways to achieve this goal: one way is to add more edges to produce an enhanced GG graph and another way is to delete unnecessary connections from DT to create a reduced DT graph. We have chosen the latter one because it is relatively easy and straightforward to implement. We have designed two rules to eliminate extra edges: (1) coastal stations in one area do not connect to coastal first rule is proposed to add the partonomic factor to the neighborhood graph, and the applying both rules are shown in Figure 3(e), respectively. 3.4 Directional Relation symbolic direction. The n different symbols available for describing the directions are Southeast , South , Southwest , West , Northwest } (see Figure 4(a)). In the paper, we employ the cone-shaped direction system C 8 . For instance, the direction Northeast direction system results in the feature that the allowance area for any given direction increase with distance [5]. 
In the qualitative directional reasoning, we should be able to reason directional in-formation of indirectly connected points, or the composition of two directional rela-tions to derive a new directional relation. A typical composition is like: given B is east Figures 4(b), 4(c), and 4(d))? The composition table of the eight cone-shaped cardinal can be inferred exactly with one answer, 8 (represented by *) may be any of the eight directions, and the remaining 48 generate two possible answers, three possible an-do not provide enough information to infer the result of a composition. For example, C may be east (see Figure 4(b)), northeast (see Figure 4(c)), or north (see Figure 4(d)) of A depending on directions and distances between A and B and between B and C . In our application domain, we need to provide a unique and precise answer for each user X  X  spatial query instead of two, three, or four possible answers. Next, we first present a probabilistic solution [3] to reason a unique composition answer for the same, e.g, medium . Then we propose the heuristics to improve the above probabilistic method for the cases where two composition distances vary. For example, AB is me-dium , and BC is close and far in Figures 4(b) and 4(d), respectively.

Dehak et. al. [3] proposed a probabilistic method to uniquely determine the angular relationship  X  between two points, A and C , giving the angular value  X  from A to B and the angular value  X  from B to C . Under the assumption of uniform distribution for all points in a circular region and no knowledge of the point coordination informa-tion (longitude and latitude),  X  is calculated as: with and Equation (1) works well if two distances ( AB and BC ) are similar. 
In our application domain, we have the knowledge of cardinal directions, such as north or southwest, between two points, but the real angular information between two points is unknown. So we have to employ the average angular degree of a cone-shaped section to represent the angle of a direction. For example, the direction north-east is between the values of  X  and  X  can only be 0, eight directions, respectively. As a result, Equation (1) only returns two types of  X  values when  X   X   X  is in the first or fourth quadrant:  X  is right on the delimiter of two cone-shaped sectors when cone-shaped sector when then  X  = above example, to determine a direction for AC , we may use some heuristics or ran-domly pick one if the two distances, AB and BC , are the same. 
On the other hand, the two distances can vary widely, for example, AB is medium result of Equation (1) may drift away from the real angle between A and C . To handle the above disparate distance problem, we propose heuristics to improve the perform-ance of Equation (1) according to the  X   X   X  value and length of AB and BC . Next, we discuss the heuristics proposed for various scenarios. Heuristics 1: When longer one of AB and BC , or AC is in the same direction with the middle section be-tween AB direction and BC direction if AB and BC are of same length. For example, in Figure 4,  X  =0,  X  = A if BC is medium (see Figure 4(c)), or C is north of A if BC is far (see Figure 4(d)). Heuristics 2: When longer one of AB and BC , or AC is in the same direction with BC if AB and BC are of = or far (see Figure 5(b) and 5(c)). Heuristics 3: When result of Equation (1) if AB and BC are of same length. Otherwise,  X  is in-creased/decreased by if AB is longer than BC . The reason we do this is because usually the value  X  falls in the third or fourth direction from AB direction. For example, in Figure 10, B is east of A and C is northwest of B , then  X  =0,  X  = Figure 6(a) C is east of A because BC is short and  X  is decreased by creased by of C when AB and BC are of same length.

Another heuristics we utilize is when one of AB and BC is very close and the length of AB and BC varies, the direction of AC is inferred the same as the longer one of AB close and the distance from TCOON 051 to TCOON 018 is very close , then the direc-which is southwest. In the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics method is tested based on the Texas in situ stations (see Figure 1). The compared three methods are all based uses the exact angular degree, the second one is called approximate probabilistic method which does not use the exact  X  and  X  values and employs the average heuristic method which is developed from the second method and is enhanced with heuristics as proposed in Section 3. In the approximate probabilistic method a heuristic method the second direction anti-clockwise is chosen. 
Twenty stations are randomly selected from the four areas of Texas partonomies: 2 from Beaumont , 6 from Houston , 8 from Corpus Christi , and 4 from Brownville . Among the above selected stations, 9 are from coast, 10 from offshore, and 1 from ocean (see Table 2). The total numbers of tested compositions for the chosen stations are 97, 153, and 11, respectively. 
The overall results are shown in Table 3. Correct ratio (CR) is calculated as ( cor-rect infer ( CI ))/( total compositions ). For example, CR of exact probabilistic method in coastal area is 69/97=71.1%. Gap score (GS) is the directional difference between the inferred result and the real result. For example, the GS is 1 if the inferred direction is better performance than that of exact probabilistic method and is significantly better than the approximate probabilistic method in terms of CR in coastal and offshore area. To be more specific, the heuristic method achieves the CR of 74.2% and 75.2%, exact probabilistic method 71.1% and 69.9%, and approximate probabilistic method 60.8% and 59.5%, respectively in coastal and offshore area. From the perspective of GS, the heuristic method is the best among three methods with most GS as 1. The result generated for the ocean area is not conclusive because we only have one ocean station with 11 compositions in Texas, which is NDBC 42002 (see Figure 2). 
On the other hand, sometimes there is more than one path to reach from one station to another station in the composition operation, so the final CR can be adjusted better to some extent. For example, in Figure 2 TABS J can reach TCOON 018 through TCOON 047 or through TCOON 051. Both composition results will be counted corrected even if only one composition can successfully reason that TCOON 018 is southwest of TABS J . In Table 3, ACI, AGS, and ACR represent adjusted correct infer, adjusted gap score, and adjusted correct ratio, respectively. The performance of overall ACRs is at least 13% higher than overall CRs for all three methods. Without the exact angular degree of and  X  , the heuristic method achieves the overall ACR as 87.7%. proposed heuristics for the cases where the length of AB and BC vary because in the tested 261 (97+153+11) compositions there are 65 compositions where AB and BC have the same direction (  X   X  = ), 114 compositions where  X   X   X  and AB and BC are of the same length (represented as VSL), and only 82 compositions where posed in Section 3 are for VDL-type compositions. As we know from Table 1, AC simply has the same direction as AB and BC when  X   X  = and no equation or heuris-tics is needed at all. So 65 compositions with  X   X  = should be excluded from consideration. In Table 4, three methods obtain close performance for VSL-type com-positions and their CRs are 64.0%, 56.1%, and 62.3 %, respectively. As for VDL-type compositions, the heuristic method significantly outperforms other two methods. Especially, the CR of approximate probabilistic method is only 37.8% which is way too low. The proposed heuristics improves the performance of the exact probabilistic method and approximate probabilistic method by 12.2% and 32.9%, respectively. In the paper, we developed a framework to represent and reason the spatial relationship qualitatively for ocean observational systems. The framework considers four spatial relations, partonomic, distance, topological, and directional relation as well as the effects of their combinations. With only qualitative distance and directional informa-tion, the proposed probability-based heuristic method obtains very good results. The proposed framework can be utilized to represent spatial features of observational sys-prove the accuracy of the probabilistic method and investigate the methods to represent and reason the spatial relations between two areas and between a point and an area.
