 1. Introduction
In artificial intelligence research, agent-based systems technology has been hailed as a new paradigm for conceptualising, designing, and implementing software systems. Intelligent agent technology has contributed to intelligent systems develop-ment ( Klusch, 2001 ), and been applied to many business areas. One of the emerging areas is to develop intelligent informa-tion agent so as to advance information gathering, processing, and dissemination. The need for using intelligent system to support executive information processing is triggered by two major factors: (a) the increasing data overload problem expe-rienced by many executives and the dynamism and complexity of external environment which continuously creates signals possible signals/data emerging from the company X  X  external environment and internal systems. Time is regarded as a scarce information and the use of social networking tools, the volume and forms of information accessible from online, wireless devices and offline channels are increasing at an exponential rate, which exacerbates executives X  information overload prob-lems. In addition, executives are facing the challenges of making sense of potentially relevant information from an over-abundance of irrelevant information. According to Mintzberg (1973) executives perform multiple roles and activities, which are characterized by brevity, variety and discontinuity. In terms of information activity, executives exhibit ad hoc behavior in acquiring/receiving information. The risk of incomplete information and missing strategically significant infor-mation can lead to misjudgments and corporate blind spots.

To overcome the problem, a number of researchers turn to technical solutions, for example, Rajaniemi (2007) suggests that executives should employ experts and information technology to scan the business environment for them. Choo (1998) believes that automating the information searching process is one of the solutions to extend executives X  scanning coverage. Liu (1998a) claims that an intelligent agent approach represents one of the most popularly suggested solutions where problems are encountered in automatic information gathering, filtering and searching. Pursuing technical solutions to executive information processing problem has led to various intelligent agent-based information retrieval/discovery
Espinasse, Fournier, &amp; Freitas, 2009 ) being developed. One recent example is ENIRAF  X  Enhanced Information Retrieval and Filtering for Analytical Systems ( Wecel, 2007 ). Despite the great advances in ICT technologies, most of the intelligent systems, as reported, are either conceptual models, prototypes, or under development in laboratories ( Moukas &amp; Maes, to continuously scan the business environment, automatically filter out irrelevant information, make sense of information and proactively send alert of impending opportunities and threats, particularly in the context of executive information processing.

Fundamental question arises as to whether (or to what extent) an intelligent agent-based system can effectively support managerial information processing. Answers to the question do not rest essentially on technological possibility, but on the understanding of the nature of executive information and the complexity of human information processing. Processing infor-mation needed by executives face some distinctive challenges: firstly, the nature of information needed by executives is not often understood by many organizations until crises and problems occur. Secondly, information used by executives is rarely a piece of static information, and is often scatted throughout the organization X  X  internal systems and external environment.
The subjects may be unfamiliar to the inquirer, and the scanning process may be costly. Thirdly, interpreting information is essentially through human cognition and intuition, a process that is subtle. Sense making of information requires managerial knowledge and judgment that it is not often possible for computer to posses. This is not to claim that the endeavor of devel-oping agent-based systems for executive information processing is doomed to fail, but rather to assert that a better under-standing of executives X  information behavior and their perception on using advanced intelligent technology could avoid system failure due to technology determinism, particularly in the domain that is characterized by complex human reasoning and intuitive process. This re-enforces Mackrell, Kerr, &amp; Hellens X  X  (2009) argument that social and personal views are ne-glected in DSS research. Early information systems research into design and development projects conceived IS to be tech-nical with social consequences, implying an emphasis on IS problems and solutions as having technical complexity.
Nevertheless, it is widely recognized that both technical and human factors should be considered in the IS design and devel-opment process. In particular, IS design and implementation should be dealt with in some participative fashion, i.e. users should be able to influence the design process.

This study aims to uncover, from the users X  perspective, executives X  information processing behavior in scanning, filtering, interpreting, and to examine executives X  perceptions on supporting the aforementioned process through intelligent agent preting and alerting, which serves the purpose of formulating the research hypotheses. Section 3 is research design with de-tails of the approaches used for data collection and data analysis. The main findings and evidences are reported in Section 4 with discussion of hypotheses test results, this is followed by the implications. The last section draws conclusion and ad-dresses the limitations of the study. 2. Literature review and research hypotheses 2.1. The preconception of information scanning
Information scanning refers to continuous scanning information from multiple sources through advanced information re-trieval techniques ( Klusch, 2001 ). The term is often used interchangeably as environment scanning. An early study on envi-ronmental scanning was carried out by Aguilar (1967, p. 7) , who envisioned the necessity of  X  X  X canning for information about events and relationships in a company X  X  outside environment, the knowledge of which would assist top management in its task of charting the company X  X  future course of action X . As the external environment becomes more volatile and unpredict-able, environmental scanning becomes more critical to strategic decision making. Environmental scanning has been seen a managerial activity of learning about events and trends in the organization X  X  environment, and is conceived as the first step in the ongoing chain of perceptions and actions leading to an organization X  X  adaptation to its environment ( Hambrick, 1982 ).
Environmental scanning copes with external competitive, social, economic and technical issues that may be difficult to ob-serve or diagnose but that cannot be ignored ( Stoffels, 1994 ). The degree of an executive X  X  information scanning, is affected a problem; the capacity of the individual executive including the time, energy and other resources devoted by executives; the types and levels of scanning skills available; and the interests and values of the individual toward scanning. Information reactive mode, also referred to as decision-oriented searching, information is acquired to solve a specific problem, whereas in proactive mode, also referred to as surveillance, information is collected to detect potential threats and opportunities. It is environmental horizon, captures early warning signals and identifies areas that require managerial attention. Developing intelligent agent-based system for information scanning has been attempted by many researchers. Chi and
Turban (1995) conceptualise a knowledge creating and collecting agent that is capable to scan and search information from internal and external environments. Mouksa and Maes (1997) propose a information discovery agent with capability to per-form information acquisition task by scanning and searching distributed information sources. Budzik, Bradshaw, Fu, and
Hammond (2002) conceptualise an intelligent agent system for automatically retrieving information from online reposito-ries. A multi-agent model for information processing is developed by Liu (1998a) , which consists of three types of agents: the sible for managing the sources of information, ensuring a match between user X  X  information needs and the available sources.
The FIA is responsible for domain-specific scanning, analyzing and interpretation of information. The SIA is responsible for architecture created by Shaw et al. (2002) comprises of five software agents, data sources, and a user profile base. The five software agents are intelligent user information agent (IUIA), query enhancing agent (QA), searching and routing agent (SRA), filtering agent (FA), and analysis and synthesis agent (ASA). The user profile base (UPB) is a knowledge base holding user profiles so that the information retrieval is carried out in the right context. The notable benefits of using agent-based information scanning are to support continuous surveillance of the environment, whereas continuous surveillance by exec-utive individual is not possible ( Liu, 1998b ). Successful development and implementation of agent-based information scan-ning/retrieving systems may lead to some strategic benefits, such as enabling  X  X  X ecision without blinders X  ( Bazerman &amp; Chugh, 2006 ), and supporting  X  X  X vidence-based management X  ( Pfeffer &amp; Sutton, 2006 ).

The scenario of automated information scanning process through intelligent agents is based on assumptions that techni-cally the agents are capable to perform the complex tasks as anticipated, and socially executives are willing to rely on the system to receive both required and unexpected information. In practice, even with an advanced technology and increasing interest on intelligent agents, there has not yet been seen robust intelligent scanning/retrieving systems being successfully adopted by executives. This may be caused by: firstly, technical incapability of intelligent agents for managerial information signals X  from a company X  X  external environment. Ample evidences show that soft information and external information are rarely included in existing executive information systems ( Salmeron, 2002; Averweg &amp; Rold X n, 2007 ). Secondly, there may be resistant attitude and behavior toward using agent-based system by executives. The issue of technical capability of auto-mating executive information process is beyond the scope of this paper, however, examining executives X  perceptions and concerns of adopting the system could unfold challenging and critical factors that may have profound impact on future development of intelligent agent-based information systems for managers. The preconception is that executives may per-ceive the usefulness of the agent-based scanning system. This leads to the first hypothesis that:
H1. Executives perceive an intelligent information scanning agent to be highly useful to acquire strategic information. 2.2. The preconception of information filtering
Information filtering (IF) is a process of screening out irrelevant data from large volumes of dynamically generated data is particularly important for executives, because  X  X  X nless the information overload to which managers are subjects is re-duced, any additional information made available by a Management Information Systems cannot be expected to be used user X  X  regular information interests, which then turned into profiles that can be put into the IF system. When incoming data, texts, events, or surrogates are scanned, they are compared to the profiles. The comparison results in some of the data to be retrieved for users X  attention, and some to be discarded. The retrieved data are used and/ or evaluated based on how well they respond to the information interests, which lead to modification of the user profiles and information interests. The modified entities will be used in subsequent comparison or filtering process.
 Identifying information interests and building user profile have been emphasized for effective information filtering by
Belkin and Croft (1992) . This view is re-enforced by Balabanovic and Shoham (1997, p. 68) who argue that  X  X  X he construction represent the user X  X  actual interest X . The challenge of identifying user interests is that user information interest may change over time as new conditions, goals and knowledge change. One way to cope with this challenge is through user evaluation automatically and unobtrusively by monitoring user behavior in information processing, e.g. user reading time, scrolling and interaction with documents. The learning function is claimed to enable the agent to dynamically adapt to changes in user preferences and information needs by learning from the users X  behavior. Many internet-based applications, e.g. online shop-ping sites (Aamazon.com), social networks, advertising networks are capable of monitoring and learning user online behav-ior and preference through web log, cookie, web bug, etc. tools. The results are used to build user profiles so as to automatically recommend goods, services or advertisements to users.

The need for information filtering is rooted in the debate on whether executives prefer to receive raw factual data verse analyzed information. Bernhardt (1994) argues that managers prefer analyzed information to detailed raw data, as analyzed information makes sense of the data, thus it is meaningful and actionable. It has been a common problem of many Manage-ment Information Systems that the systems produce sheer volume of data but little meaningful information to senior man-can be too extensive for an executive to spot trends, patterns, and exceptions from the data available. Thus data needs to be filtered and refined in order to be useful. Nevertheless, managers X  demand for refined information has been questioned. Ed-wards and Peppard (1993) argue that refined information that reaches the top management team is likely to be distorted.
The distortion may not be conscious, but due to the assumptions and knowledge used in handling the information bring to bear on it. Senior managers may want to form their own impression through direct contact with key environmental sources to ensure that data is undiluted and does not suffer from the loss of meaning associated with passing information through intermediaries ( Daft et al., 1988 ). Mintzberg (1980) observed that managers clearly prefer to have information in the form of concrete stimuli or triggers, not general aggregations, and wish to hear specific events, ideas and the problems. It appears that on information filtering for executives, the challenge is more toward executives X  behavior and preferences than on technical possibility. This leads to the second hypothesis that:
H2. Executives perceive an information filtering agent highly useful to reduce information overload and to increase information relevancy. 2.3. The preconception of information interpretation
Information interpretation is often viewed as an individual level process wherein people attend to, and make sense of, incoming information ( Thomas, Clark, &amp; Gioia, 1993 ). Weick (1995) defines that sense making deals with how social agents construct meaning out of a flow of action and events and how this meaning is crystallized into sensible structures. In the model of sense making, organisations are loosely coupled systems in which individual managers have great latitude in inter-preting equivocal information from the environmental changes and establishing their own representations of external real-ity. Information interpretation includes the process of translating the searched events, developing models for understanding, bringing out of meaning, and assembling conceptual schemes ( Daft &amp; Weick, 1984; Liu, 1998a ). Cognitive learning theory suggests that there is limitation in human cognitive capacity, hence, there is a need for explanation ( Payne, Bettman, &amp; are important to users, in particular, when the user perceives an anomaly, when they want to learn, or when they need a specific piece of knowledge to participate properly in problem solving.

Using accumulated knowledge in order to reason, to explain and to make recommendation is one of the key functional-ities that intelligent systems and Expert systems (ES) aim to achieve. Budzik et al. (2002) conceptualise that software agents, in the case of information processing, must be able to reason about the contents of a document in the right context in order to provide helpful recommendation. For example, the meaning of the information, the reasons for advising a particular course of action, and the justification for a particular piece of information. To do so, executives X  knowledge needs to be cap-tured, engineered into the agents. This may be problematic, as explained by Blair (2002) that knowledge is an elusive con-cept, it is not something tangible that we can possess, exchange, or lost the way that we can with data or information. Only a person can be knowledgeable, that is only a person can have, and exercise, knowledge. Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1986) showed that for most areas of expertise, rules, procedures and facts, at best, only rudimentary level of expert behavior  X   X  X  X ompe-between that part of expertise that is unexpressed by expressible and that part of expertise that is simply inexpressible.
Much of the history of ES development has been a saga of wasted time, effort and money trying to make inexpressible exper-tise explicit. Clearly, there are technical challenges in developing a workable intelligent expert system, i.e. the degree of knowledge that can be acquired and reused, and the capability of machine learning.

In contrast, the 5th generation project in AI assumes that any human skills or expertise that could be performed consis-tently could ultimately be completely described by a set of rules or procedures ( Feigenbaum, McCorduck, &amp; Nii, 1988 ).
Knowledge citation, knowledge engineering and rule-based reasoning are suggested for developing expert systems where knowledge and rules tend to be structured, and thus can be made explicit. Machine learning is another computational ap-proach to make computer systems learn from user experience. Langley and Simon (1995) suggest five basic machine learning paradigms that are applicable to the development of intelligent information agent systems, which include: neural networks (focus on analogies to neurobiology), instance-based or case-based learning (focus on human memory), genetic algorithms (based on evolution), rule induction (focus on heuristic search) and analytic learning (focus on reasoning in formal logic).
Even with continuing attempts to develop expert systems, the number of successful Expert systems is surprisingly small ( Blair, 2002 ). Blair (2002) asserts that human decision making is a kind of expertise, it is the activity of knowledgeable individuals, and this expertise is not something that, in general, can be easily supplemented or replaced by computer tech-nology. For DSS and ES, the expert is external to the system. The tacit knowledge used for managerial decision making cannot be easily captured and codified, this may undermine the promise of agent-based information interpretation.
It would be interesting and important to know executives X  views on using assisted interpretation tools and the associated challenges. Only executives who are the actual knowledge holders can tell how information ought to be interpreted. Given the optimistic notion of using an interpretation function, we hypothesize that:
H3. Executives perceive an information interpretation agent highly useful to make sense of information. 2.4. The preconception of vigilant alerting
There has been an increasing trend of using executive dashboards, scorecards to present synthesised information to senior management in recent business intelligence (BI) toolkits ( Simons, 2008 ). Being vigilant has been seen an important feature of an information system for executives ( Walls, Widmeyer, &amp; El Sawy, 1992; Houghton, EI Sawy, Gray, Donegan,
Houghton et al. (2004) argue that in a tight and turbulent economy with a lean and high velocity supply chain environment, an effective way to improve an enterprise X  X  sense-and-response capabilities is to have a vigilant information system. The key functionality of a vigilant system is the alert rules about whether an indicator is within preset allocable bounds. Alerts are displayed and accessed through executive dashboards or wireless devices. The benefit is to entail both sensing capabilities to detect changes and enhance managerial visibilities, and responding capabilities to enable corporate decisions and actions to be taken. Houghton et al. (2004) conclude that the ability to link executive decision making with operations in real-time through dashboards has given the company a strategic edge as a responsive supply chain partner.

Business globalisation has significantly changed the working pattern of many managers. It seems to be a common phe-nomenon for business executives to be constantly on the move. Thus, proactively sending alerts of strategic information, pro-cessed from the intelligent system, can keep executives instantly informed. There appears to be fewer technical challenges in creating and sending alerts. For example, E-mail alert based on web content changes (e.g. KBCrawl 4  X  Watch station) can be automatically generated and sent to registered users. Credit card transactions can be automatically alerted on mobile phones ( Riivari, 2005 ). With the enhanced functionality of wireless communication technologies, mobile operating systems, and innovative smart handset (e.g. iPod, iPhone, iPad), business executives on the move are able to receive relevant significant information alerts where they are and when they are. This leads to the forth hypothesis that
H4. Executives perceive an intelligent agent sending vigilant alerts highly useful to keep them informed wherever they are. 3. Research methodology
This research adapts a qualitative and interpretive approach to test the hypotheses. Mackrell et al. (2009) argue that a qualitative, interpretive nature of the study (in the domain of DSS) can provides in-depth insights into technology adoption and use, particularly from a client perspective. Because an in-depth study of a situated experience would provide deeper understanding than gathering standardized quantitative data from a large sample of population. Being interpretive means that constructs emerged from the interview data rather than being determined beforehand. Moreover, the phenomena ex-plored were understood through meaning assigned by participants rather than survey instruments. Due to the nature of executive work, focus group discussion and interviews with executives are adopted to examine their views on using agent-based systems. Thus, the data collected is primarily qualitative in nature, which is considered appropriate for this re-search. According to Krueger (1994) , a focus group method is essentially a qualitative data gathering method that allows par-ticipants to freely express their thoughts and perceptions on a defined scope of issues in a permissive, non-threatening environment. The group synergy also allows more issues to be uncovered ( Hines, 2000 ). In order to facilitate executive X  X  understanding of the concepts of an intelligent agent-based system, a visualization prototype was designed. The prototype served as a demonstration tool for stimulating executives X  thinking and conducting interactive conversation with executives, rather than as a tool for technological implementation and evaluation. As such, the visualization model did not direct or has an effect on the participants X  answers. 3.1. The visualization prototype
The web-based visualization prototype was designed to demonstrate the main attributes of the said intelligent function-ality in executive information searching/scanning, information filtering, interpretation and agent learning. According to
Buchenau and Suri (2000) , interface prototypes can range from sketches to different kind of models at various levels, e.g.
Fig. 1 shows one of the windows demonstrating information scanning.
By default, the left-hand window is an environment for executive X  X  browsing and searching activities. Executive may browse in this window to search both internal and external information (e.g. Intranet and Internet). Search engines and scan-ning tools are rapidly expanding with the potential to be personalized according to individual user X  X  interests and behavior.
For example, tools to alert  X  X  X hat X  X  Related X , tracking user-browsing history, and recommending new pages ( http://www.a-lexa.com ). The right-hand window is the agent window. This agent is assumed to perform its own browsing activity and sending signals and relevant information to the executive in a dynamic manner based on the past information search activ-ities and pre-defined information needs in user profiles. Nevertheless, executives also have the flexibility to express new information needs from time to time. Executives can set up his personal agent through  X  X gent Set Up X  (see Fig. 2 ), by prede-fining his information needs and requirements in simple natural language to guide continuous and autonomous scanning. only relevant to the executive.

In addition to the regular information provided by reconnaissance agents based on past executive information search behavior, the interpretation agent ( Fig. 3 ) is expected to intelligently analyse the information using case-based learning to understand the meaning and implication of information. They are acting like learning agents that infer user preferences and interests by tracking interactions between the user and the machine. The agent window acts like a personal assistant that triggers executive X  X  attention to the information that might be critical to strategic decision making. The vision is that the software agents provide the executive with recommendations for further exploration, and alert the executive of impor-tant information in a continuous and autonomous basis. To enable agent learning, executives are able to give feedback to the information agents through a rating system, or giving explicit comments. 3.2. The focus groups and interviews
Three focus group sessions were conducted with a total of 31 middle and top-level executives. Details of the focus group participants are given in Table 1 .

Most of the participants are at strategic (48%) level and tactical level (39%) and involved in some forms of executive intel-ligence activities. Each session began with a brief statement on the rationale and objectives, the confidentiality and ground rules for the discussion (e.g. role of moderator, one participant talks at a time, and disagreement is welcomed), and the dem-onstration of the visualization model. Focus group sessions took about an hour to complete. The focus group discussion al-lows taping into human tendencies. Attitudes and perceptions relating to concepts, products, services, or programmes are developed in part by interaction with other people ( Krueger, 1994, pp. 10 X 11 ). The method of thematic qualitative analysis ships between the themes and the meaning from the text in the transcripts. The focus group discussions were transcribed and compared with the field notes taken by a colleague who served as an observer to assure the validity of the focus group study. Reliability was assessed through inter-rater reliability analysis ( Morse, 1997 ), it is achieved through the use of two research colleagues as separate interpreters with a view to reaching the inter-subjective agreement among interpreters.
To enhance the validity of using qualitative data to test hypotheses, a further 25 executives were selected using a pur-poseful sampling strategy, and interviewed individually. The criteria for selecting interviewees were senior managers who participate in strategic intelligence activities. The sample was taken from the Financial Analysis Made Easy (FAME) on-line database with the SIC code of 65  X  Financial Intermediation (except Insurance and Pension Fund); code 66  X  Insurance and Pension Fund (except Compulsory Social Security); code 67  X  Financial Auxiliary; code 63  X  Travel; code 70  X  Real Estate.
These industries are identified because of their relative high intensity of information usage for strategic decision making ( Franke, 1987 ). Table 2 shows the profile of the 25 interviewees.

Over 80% of the participants were senior executives who are involved in strategic intelligence activities. Most of the par-ticipants worked in medium and large organizations in the City of London. Each interview lasted from 45 to 75 min, and was conducted in the workplace of the interviewee. Interview contents were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Due to the high volume of raw data obtained from the interviews, qualitative analysis software  X  NVivo was em-ployed to analyze this data. Extract of quotations from focus group participants and interviewees are provided as evidence.
The remarks of study participants provide a rich and informative qualitative account of participants X  experiences in acquiring and using information and perceptions on the agent-based intelligent system. 4. Findings and discussion 4.1. Overview of supporting executive information processing
The study reveals that overall, executives perceive the agent-based system as a complementary but not a replacement tool, which can provide useful but limited support in acquiring and processing executive information. Such a system, if func-tions as anticipated, would support decision making process, rather than making decision for executives. There are rich sup-porting evidence generated from the study, the following two quotes are typical:  X  X  X  would just see it as a completely complementary. I would never see it replacing discussion with competitors in the market place, with competitors X  customers, with their employees.  X   X  X  X  think continuous and autonomous is a good idea. I guess the things for senior management, that they spend majority of day the meeting rooms, in different places around the building or outside with clients.  X  (Tim, Middle Manager) The above evidence reinforces the understanding that executives perform different roles and tasks with different agendas.
The main reason explained by the participants is the personal and information networks used by executives in information gathering and the intuitive nature of management decisions, which requires human intelligent instinct. Table 3 illustrates the evidence concerning the use of personal networks.

Executive X  X  confidence on their intuition and judgment in decision making lead them to doubt the capability of the intel-ligent information processing function, particularly, the decision making and interpretation capability. Participants believed that the decision-making activity and interpretation activity should be performed by the users themselves. They found it difficult to place their trust on a system that has no human intelligence. For example, decision from some instincts ... that software doesn X  X  have this intelligence instinct.  X 
This confirms the notion of intuitive nature of managerial decision making. Kotter (1982, 1999) explains that the infor-mational and interpersonal roles allow managers to build networks of people and set agenda for their decisional roles, but argues that in the process of gathering information and evaluating information, executives can actually either exhibit per-ceptive or receptive approach, systematic or intuitive approach.

The intelligent system has been perceived as being useful in assisting executives acquiring additional information for the purpose of gaining background knowledge of strategic issues, using recommendation and rule of thumb to support decision making. Comments are cited below:  X  X  X  think senior executives would use it more (as a tool for) gaining background knowledge and keeping up-to-date.  X   X  X  ... the agent is going to prompt me with additional information that I might find useful, ... an agent which is actually working with (Adam, Deputy Managing Director)
The perceptions of the specific functions proposed for intelligent systems  X  scanning, filtering, interpreting and alerting are reported and discussed next. 4.2. Perceptions on specific functionality of the intelligent system 4.2.1. Test of hypothesis 1  X  autonomous information scanning
Hypothesis 1 assumes executives are busy with other activities and have limited time and capacity to scan all possible information, thus an automated information scanning agent may be perceived useful by executives. The study generated rich evidences that support this hypothesis. Fourteen out of twenty-five executives interviewed emphasize the needs for auto-mated information scanning. The perceived benefits include systematically searching for information on behalf of the exec-utives, processing information continuously in the background, identifying information that might be of interest to executives, and bringing up to executive X  X  attention on what is unexpected: as is evidenced by the following comments:  X  X  X canning keep you updated with information from external business environment that is spontaneous.  X   X  X  X he agents identify everything that could be critical in moving your business forward. I mean this way of identifying that as if nothing comes as liam, Operations &amp; Systems Director)  X  X  X  am looking for this information, the search function on the browser is doing automatically, ... scanning and searching that could happen without input probably, that would be far better than if I have to go and recreate. (John, Managing Director)
Louis and Sutton (1991) argue that the condition for active thinking is provoked by: (1) one experiences a situation as difference between expectations and reality; and (3) by deliberate initiative  X  usually in response to a request of increased useful to enhance manager X  X  active thinking.

Executives X  responses on agent-based scanning are particularly helpful to define the functionality and features of the scanning system. The following scanning scenarios are captured from the study: two hours later and see what it discovers. (Larry, Head of CEO)  X  X  X ou set up to run (the agent-based system) overnight, or whatever, and when I come in the morning, there will be something to 4.2.2. Test of hypothesis 2  X  information filtering
It is assumed that executives are suffering from over-abundance of information. The critical deficiency with existing sys-tems is a lack of relevant information, as a result, executives may receive more information than they can possibly absorb.
Furthermore, scanning without filtering could lead to over-abundance of irrelevant information that exacerbates the prob-inaccurate, incorrect and sometimes fraudulent information. It is highly probable that scanning can bring duplication of sim-ilar information that collated from multiple sources. Another reason for using a filtering function is that executives can only digest a small amount of the information provided. Thus, filtering is assumed essential to ensure information relevancy. This study found that views on using filtering function are divided. On the one hand, participants in favour of filtering function see information filtering as an effective means to reduce the amount of information to a manageable and digestible level; On the other hand, participants raised concerns on the possibility of screening out potentially relevant information. Ten out of twenty-five executives interviewed (40%) recognized the problem of information overload and the need to reduce informa-tion to a digestible, manageable level. A variety of evidences was generated, (see Appendix A ), which strongly support this hypothesis. Below are the most significant examples:  X  X  X  think the key to it (the system) is it does come out with relevant information, and it comes out with probably a digestible amount of relevant information. (William, Operations and Systems Director)  X  X  X f you want to make decisions very quickly, that X  X  what tactical and strategic decision based information, you want minimum amount of information, readily processed, so that you can click on.  X  (John, Managing Director)
One of the requirements to make scanning and filtering relevant to executives X  information needs is to enable executives to control the agents and set criteria for the agents, also the system should be capable to learn. Executives made the follow-ing comments: company is doing, or report all news on this particular type of business.  X  (Eve, Chief Operating Officer) very clearly what it X  X  that the executive is looking for and what structure or format he or she would like it.  X 
As executives X  information needs and interests change over time, user control on the information agents makes the sys-tem more acceptable to the specific needs of executives. Executives also recognize the importance of the learning capability of the agent in scanning and filtering information as illustrated by the following comments: or whatsoever X . From there, the system learns and how to turn and change.  X  it must have a sort of flexibility within itself to retain as well as to develop.  X 
It can be suggested that executives need to actively intervene with the agent in order to build a user profile with infor-mation interests and preferences, for example, by specifying specific search topics, examples used, search criteria, level and format of synthesized/summarized results required, as well as feedback on the usefulness of the information received. Pat-riotta (2003) suggests that a distinctive process of knowledge acquisition is learning by example. A repertoire of concrete examples is functioned as templates to which present occurrences can be reconnected. An important issue in understanding the process of knowledge acquisition is to determine which case will become part of the knowledge repertoire of the middle managers. The approach of PBE  X  Programming By Example ( Repenning &amp; Perrone, 2000 ) appears relevant to the executive X  X  cases. This approach allows the user to manipulate information on the graphical user interface (GUI), but demands a lot of user effort. To be effective, executives have to take initiatives to build the agent and endow it with explicit knowledge in information processing. It can be suggested that the agent X  X  capability to learn and the extent of using managerial knowledge hold the key to the development and implementation of intelligent system for executives.

The functionality of information filtering, as suggested by participants, needs to be extended to include (or integrate with) indexing, categorizing, ranking, etc. Some executives also require analytical tools to perform advanced modeling, forecasting, comparison, and strategic mapping. For example, the system should have  X  X  X o predict and forecast as well, but that will be the next level  X  ; to priorities ... if you X  X e not going to read anything else  X  (Adam, Deputy Managing Director)  X 
The example of ranking given by a manager is as follows:  X  X  X s far as you know, every document could be important. I do not know how the system can get around it if the information just critical something like that (Chris, Director)  X 
Although evidences support for the hypothesis that filtering and synthesizing information are important to the function-ality of an intelligent system, some executives are concerned with using intelligent filters and describe it as a dilemma, i.e. filtering can be useful but it can also screen out potentially valuable information, which is shown below: eficial to you than the initial information that you are looking for in the first place.

This could happen in two situations: firstly, the pre-determined criteria set for filtering may no longer reflect executives X  changing needs and preferences; secondly, the filter is not able to semantically and contextually recognize incoming mes-sages. This has been recognized by a number of executives:  X  X  X oftware agents need to be knowledge-based in order to process and understand the level of importance ... I think for me the way to improve is to understand the natural language.  X  This implies that the filter needs to be intelligent enough to understand the semantics and the context of the information.
As discussed earlier, human knowledge is critical to the success of this type of system, as such, the finding uncovers a con-tinuous challenge facing the development of knowledge-based intelligent information processing system. Jones (2007, Chap-ter 10) suggests that the computer model of the mind neglects the semantic dimension of knowledge-making processes.
Similar findings are reported by Vandenbosch and Huff (1997) who identify that lack of knowledge in executive information systems has been one of the main problems leading to many EIS failures. The absence of a predefined model with expert knowledge failed to guide how data could and should be used. 4.2.3. Test of hypothesis 3  X  interpretation and sense making
The preconception is that executives are hungry for meaningful and actionable information. It is hypothesized that exec-utives would welcome intelligent information interpretation. The findings from this study, however, do not support the need for interpretation. Most executives want to interpret data and to make sense of the data themselves. The concerns with auto-mated interpretation are evident from the following comments: done by executive, and I think it has to be a low level interpretation first.  X 
The reasons to reject the interpretation hypothesis, as explained by executives, are centred around experience and judge-ment used in interpreting information, which is not easily replaceable and substitudable. When referring to using experi-ence, the following selectd quotes are typical evidence:  X  X  X  use my experience and my education and training to make sense of information.  X  (Larry, Head of CEO)  X  X  X f I am honest, I think you do it through intuition and experience.  X  (Ford, Service Director)  X  X  X ut up to a point, you really have to base on experience which is fundamentally guts feeling that would come from industry experience, or from experience of other type of industry ...  X  (Robert, Vice President)
Executives also rely on their gut feelings and judgment to make sense of information.  X  X  X t X  X  a jigsaw always, you take different parts of information and then you make a judgment based on that.  X  (Quin, Business
Development Director)
Officer) on experience, that X  X  what we are paid for ...  X  (Robert, Vice President)
The findings reveal the distinctive nature of executives in making sense of information, i.e. primarily using feelings and judgment that are underpinned by their past experience. This extends Mintzburg X  X  description on managerial roles and tasks, and confirms Bhattacharjee &amp; Moreno X  X  (2002) study that professional experience is one factor that influences individuals X  assessments of the informational value. The findings support El Sawy and Pauchant X  X  (1988) argument that executives do not and will not delegate their interpretation activities to software agents. The rejection of the hypothesis raises question on the assertion that interpretation of data should be considered a unique and ideal feature for executive information systems ( Liu, 1998a, 1998b; Young, 1987 ). The implication of this finding is that any attempt to empower an agent with sense making capability seems neither technically possible, nor socially desirable. The challenge rests on what Patriotta (2003) maintained that common-sense points to expertise that has been developed through experience by seeing the problem many times. Because common-sensical knowledge is tacit, it cannot be articulated and therefore transferred to newcomers. On the other hand, if common sense was made explicit it would be transformed into proce-dural knowledge and probably lose its effectiveness. Ginzburg (1990, pp. 114 X 115) echoed this view by arguing that knowledge in this sort in each instance was richer than written codification; it was learned not from books but from the living voice, from gestures and glances; it was based on subtleties impossible to formalize, which often could not even be translated into words. These insights are bound by a subtle relationship: they had all originated in concrete experience. 4.2.4. Test of hypothesis 4  X  intelligent alerting
It is assumed that alerting as a result of intelligent scanning is vital to keep executive instantly informed about strategic useful. From the interview, 11 out of 25 participants expressed the needs for alerting functionality by means of automatically prompting, and recommending related information. Evidences generated from the focus groups and the interviews support this hypothesis; selected quotes are given below:  X  X  X nce the information comes in, ... the agent probably can give a flash, for example, about new information.  X   X  X  X f the agent hasn X  X  searched for a while, it could actually suggest to the user.  X  information that has been used or which information is regularly used and then it somehow remember that and update that, that obviously be a useful facility.  X  (Larry, CEO)
It is revealed that executives want to be alerted with changes (both textual and numeric), new information and informa-executive dashboard, if not yet equipped with an alert function, needs to proactively send alerts to executives, in addition to routinely presenting key performance indicators. Unexpected information and disruptive events (e.g. breakdowns, interrup-tions) often trigger executive X  X  sense-making process. Patriotta (2003) echoes that sense making on the shop floor is trig-gered by occurring at the interface between the  X  X  X usiness as usual X  of routine situations and the conscious awareness of problem-solving activities.

In addition to alerting changes and new information, some executives are interested in related information recommended by the intelligent agent. For example,  X  X  ... the recommendation feature might be useful (Tim, Middle Manager),  X   X  X  X  X  X  say providing recommendation on the related articles (Smith, Chief Finance Officer)  X  another European country is ...  X   X  (Smith, Chief Finance Officer)
As discussed earlier, recommending related items to users has been common on many online shopping websites and social networks. The key to trigger recommendation and make the recommendation relevant to the enquirer is the under-standing of the semantics, the learning of user behavior and building user profile. This suggests that the alerting shall not be only trigged by changes in source information, but also by continuous monitoring of executives information usage and behavior.

Although the information alerting function is perceived as useful, some executives would not wish it to be trig-gered too frequently. One executive states that,  X  X  X  wouldn X  X  want something flashing out on my screen every five minutes to say that the information is there and I wouldn X  X  want to actually go looking for it myself. I think it would be something if you would notify on a minimal daily basis, maybe twice daily to see whether the system had updated (Mark, Trading Director)  X  .
 4.3. Concerns over the adoption of the intelligent system
This section reports findings on executive X  X  concerns of the possible impact of using intelligent agents in supporting infor-mation processing. Two notable themes emerged from the study: fear of changing managerial roles and fear of limiting exec-utive X  X  creativity. 4.3.1. Fear of changing managerial roles
Firstly, participants expressed their concerns of possible changes in their managerial roles, in particular informational roles. They feared that their managerial roles could be weakened or replaced by the system, if the system is becoming capa-ble of learning and performing the information processing tasks on behalf of executives, the roles of executives will be threa-tened. Some comments were: at things that I don X  X  want to look at.  X  4.3.2. Fear of limiting executive creativity
Another possible impact perceived by executives is over-dependence on the system, which will limit executives X  creative thinking and strategic vision. This is particularly a concern if software agents begin to mimic executive X  X  information pro-cessing activities effectively. They expressed:  X  X  X  think you will be becoming more and more dependent on the software and not thinking for themselves.  X   X  X  ... thus reducing probably people would completely start depending on the system rather than using their own brain.  X  5. Implications
This study reveals that intelligent agent-based information processing is both a possibility and necessity to support exec-utives X  information processing, particularly, with regard to using advanced intelligent technology to assist in information scanning, filtering (refining) and alerting capabilities. The findings have implications, systems developers and organizations. 5.1. Developing knowledge agent with personalized features
The findings suggest that an agent-based information processing system is a useful complementary tool to enhance executive information scanning, filtering and alerting. These functions should be personalized according to individual user X  X  profile and preferences. Central to this requirement is the extent of executive X  X  control and coaching and the degree of agent X  X  learning capability. The design of intelligent agent-based system for executive information processing may need to shift from developing a unified system to developing a common platform on which executives can engage, control and coach the agent. Developing the intelligent capabilities also requires (1) identifying external environment sectors relevant to the company for scanning; (2) applying semantic and contextual information retrieval techniques in scanning and filtering; (3) extending business intelligence (BI) functionality (dashboard) to include the alerting of strategic intelligence to executives; (4) embedding managerial knowledge within the information agents to enable effective scanning, filtering and alerting; and (5) integrating external intelligence with internal key performance indica-tors and capacity to identify possible actions. The value of gaining strategic information through the intelligent system should not be overstated, however, strategic intelligence can lead to appropriate and prompt action that is ahead of major competitors. 5.2. Developing social information networks and knowledge workers
Managerial knowledge is vital for developing intelligent scanning, filtering and analyzing software agents. This study con-firms the challenge that executives X  information processing behavior is often governed by the feelings and judgment based on intuition and experience, less relying on logical and systematic processes. Thus, organizational solutions are needed to enhance executives X  information processing capability. This could include, for example, social information networks and knowledge workers. Social information networks can provide a platform where tacit knowledge and soft information can be effectively shared. Knowledge workers, sometimes referred to as  X  X  X nformation workers X , or  X  X  X ntelligence specialists X , as-sist executives in information searching and processing. They need to have a wide knowledge of information sources and skills in exploiting and organizing information, coupled with analytical skills in evaluating and interpreting information.
Blair (2002) cited Drucker (1998) by stating that knowledge workers must have strong critical thinking skills, in particular, they must have a well-developed ability to evaluate the validity and reliability of information obtained from unfamiliar sources because data or information relevant to knowledge management may come from an unpredictable variety of sources, many of them outside of the organization. 6. Conclusions
This paper unfolds an alternative, more human, perspective to the development of intelligent information processing sys-tem for executives. The preconceptions concerning agent-based information scanning, filtering, interpreting and alerting have been challenged with rich qualitative evidences. Evidences support the hypotheses that an intelligent agent-based sys-tem is perceived useful, particularly in automated scanning, semantic filtering, and being vigilant. However, agent-based information interpretation and sense making are not supported, due to the nature of managerial work and the difficulty in acquiring executive X  X  tacit knowledge used in processing information. Developing usable intelligent agents for informa-tion scanning, filtering and alerting faces less technical and social challenges than do agents for information interpretation.
The key factors that emerged from the users perspective include user control and intervention with the agents, the learning capability of the agents; and the extent of using human knowledge by the agent in processing information.
The study provides useful insights into executives X  information processing behavior and perceptions on adopting system-atic intelligent information processing systems. Rich qualitative evidences add new knowledge to the understanding of the nature of managerial work. Due to the increasing complexity and dynamism of strategic information processing, it should be noted that even successful implementation of an agent-based intelligent information scanning-filtering-alerting system for executives, manager X  X  informal, social information networks may never be replaced by the computer systems.
The limitations of his study are noted as follows: (a) the sample is not industry specific, thus the results only reflect gen-ments, in which the level of uncertainty and information intensity may be different. Future study based on a specific industry could determine the specific scope of scanning, and the knowledge specific to that industry. (b) Executive X  X  individual dif-ferences are not considered in the study. Future research with consideration of individual differences in processing informa-tion and help identify specific patterns to empower the learning agent. (c) The current study used a visualization model. It would be valuable to examine executives experience after having used intelligent system to carry out information scanning, could lead to new insight into more technological and organisational issues related to developing and implementing intel-ligent information systems for executives.
