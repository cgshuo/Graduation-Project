 As we face an explosion of potential new applications for the fundamental concepts and technologies of information retrieval, recommending to question answering systems, many researchers are spending unnecessary time reinventing ideas and relationships that are buried in the prehistory of information retrieval (which, for many researchers, means anything published before they entered graduate school). Much of today X  X  received wisdom may be nothing more than the fossilized residue of lively debates concerning such things as . estimation of value and evaluation of systems. Returning to those discussions may open the door to genuinely new insights. On the other hand, of the ideas that surface as  X  X ew X  in today X  X  super-heated research environment have very firm roots in earlier developments in fields as diverse as citation analysis, statistics, and era of increasing commercial secr ecy about methods, the problems to be solved, the algorithms for solving them, and the heuristics that are the bread and butter of a working operation. Among the important new topics whose foundations will be the growing management of persona l image collections for search and for commercial purposes. While some might think that an examination of the roots is of that you would not normally reach, because it was not considered important by your instructors when you were learning about the problems. In addition to pattern recognition and citation analysis, the tutorial will also expose and revi ew some of the relations to the fields of statistics and operations research. Participants will become familiar with roots in Pattern Analysis, reappear in the current developmen t of Information Retrieval as it applies to Search Engines, Social Media, and Collaborative Systems. They will be able to separate problems from algorithms, their own research and/or developm ent activities. Course materials will be made available on a Web site two weeks prior to the tutorial. that will be discussed; and mechanisms for chat among the tutorial participants, before, during and after the tutorial. Specific Topics will include: 1. The earliest  X  X utomated retrieval; 2. Vectors and Logarithms: their pragmatic origins; 3. Probabilistic approaches. A frequentist foundation; 4. The quest for a theoretical foundation; 5. Generative approaches; 6. Network approaches; 7. Binding approaches together. IBM technical reports by H.P. L uhn and I.J. Good will be scanned public site, we will need some information on advance registration to add participants to the site. H.3.0 General; H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval General Terms: Algorithms, Measurement, Performance, Theory Keywords: Foundations of Information Retrieval The purpose of this tutorial is to survey those roots, and their relation to the contemporary fru its on the tree of information retrieval, and to separate, as mu ch as is possible in an era of increasing secrecy about methods, the problems to be solved, the and butter of a working operation.
