 We live in a world where the pace of everything from communica-tion to transportation is getting faster. In recent years a number of  X  X low movements X  have emerged that advocate for reducing speed in exchange for increasing quality, including the slow food movement, slow parenting, slow travel, and even slow science. We propose the concept of  X  X low search, X  where search engines use additional time to provide a higher quality search experience than is possible given conventional time constraints. While addi-tional time can be used to identify relevant results within the ex-isting search engine framework, it can also be used to create new search artifacts and enable previously unimaginable user experi-ences. This talk will focus on how search engines can make use of additional time to employ a resource that is inherently slow: other people. Using crowdsourcing and friendsourcing, it will highlight opportunities for search systems to support new search experienc-es with high quality result content that takes time to identify. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  search process . Slow search, crowdsourcing, speed, information retrieval. Substantial research and engineering effort has been devoted to achieving low latency in large, complex computing systems like search engines. Search engines target speed for good reason. Re-search suggests that people perceive results that are delivered quickly as higher quality and more engaging than those delivered more slowly [10] . To achieve near-instantaneous speed, search engines make a number of compromises and limit the complexity of the features and models used to identify relevant documents. The resulting fast, word-oriented matching used by search engines ignores the rich semantics of text but is an efficient way to capture some aspects of the similarity between queries and documents. Although searchers have grown accustomed to rapid responses to their queries, recent advances in our understanding of how people search suggest there are scenarios where a search engine could take significantly longer than a fraction of a second to return rele-vant content [9] . People often invest minutes, hours, or even days in more complex or exploratory search tasks. A person planning a vacation or researching a medical diagnosis, for example, may be willing to wait for better results or insights. By building slow search user experiences [2] , search engines can make use of addi-tional time to identify the most relevant content [4, 6], load bal-ance responses over time, and incorporate slow resources [1, 3]. One slow resource that is particularly interesting to explore is people. Although computers can consider billions of documents much faster than a person can, a person can better understand each document . Crowdsourcing research suggests paid crowd workers can be incorporated into the search process in a way that is personalized [8] and accounts for privacy considerations [5] . This enables underperforming search engine components, such as those for query understanding and result processing, to be done by crowd workers [4] . Initial explorations show that while incorpo-rating crowd workers in to existing search pipelines increases ro-bustness, the increase in performance is not significant enough to warrant the extra time and cost involved. Instead, approaches that use crowd workers to drastically change the search experience [1, 3] or that incorporate feedback from highly relevant people (e.g., friends) [3, 7] appear most likely to be successful. Our hope is that slow search will inspire new and creative re-search into how search experiences can be enriched with a more nuanced notion of relevant search resources and time constraints.
