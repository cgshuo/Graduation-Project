 The primary energy function of relaxed EP is min subject to where c is the constant and r i is the relaxation factor. outliers).

 as used in the relaxed EP. we present how to compute the value of this cost function: where  X  Z i = + (1  X  2 )  X  ( z ), and the term F i,b can be computed as follows: as equations (5.64) to (5.74) in [1], except two critical modifications: Institute of Technology, 2011.
 Lemma 1. No function can satisfy Uniform Convex- X  = 1 . 5, then we have for all x,y  X  S Take x,y both on the positive x -axis. The Taylor ex-pansion would require, for some c  X  [ x,y ], f ( y )  X  f ( x )  X  g &gt; x ( y  X  x ) = the Taylor condition requires the residual to grow like (going to zero fast), but the UC condition requires zero slow). At some small enough value of , this would not be possible. Since the definition of UC needs to no f can be uniformly convex for any  X  &lt; 2 P Lemma 2. If f  X  F  X  , then for any subgradient g x  X   X  X  ( x ) , we have k g x k 2  X   X  k x  X  x  X  k  X   X  1 2 . Proof. By convexity, we have Rearranging terms and since f  X  X   X  , we get By Holder X  X  inequality, Putting them together, we have giving us our result.

The BZ algorithm works by dividing [0 , 1] into  X  x T to be the midpoint of this interval, and hence get e  X  x E |  X  x T  X  x  X  | = O ( log T Proof. We again follow the same proof as in [CN07]. above, =  X   X  on choosing m proportional to T log T [CN07] elaborate in detail how to avoid the assumption that the grid points don X  X  align with x  X  . They use a more complicated variant of BZ with three interlocked assumption. The reader is directed to their exposition for clarification.

First we will show this for the special case of t = 1 / 2. We need to argue that: Let  X  = 4 / 2 k . We will prove a stronger claim -Since k  X  2 proving the above for t = 1 / 2 is actually sufficient.  X  2 tf  X  tf ( x ) + tf ( y )  X  2 t  X  tf ( x ) + (1  X  t ) f ( y )  X  t (1  X  t )
