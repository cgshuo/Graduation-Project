 Viral marketing or word-of-mouth has been acknowledged as an effective marketing influence maximization in the social network eventually? 
There are a lot of works in influence maximization on social networks [1-8]. One can X  X  guarantee the accuracy. summarized as follows:  X  diffusion model more practical.  X  nodes in each iteration.  X  which one has the best effect for the micro-blog network.  X 
We optimize CBG with CELF strategy to form CBGCELF. Our experiments show accuracy comparing with StaticGreedyCELF which is a very efficient greedy algo-edges, CBGCELF only needs less than 1/3 of the StaticGreedyCELF X  X  time to find the same number of seeds and they almost have the same spread effect. Section 6. propose NewGreedy which removes the edges that will not contribute to the propaga-and more effective for large-scale networks. the impact on the propagation of information are discussed in [10]. 3.1 Micro-blog Network Modeling sist of three parts: content similarity, act intensity and mutual followees.  X  have, the more likely they have common interest and they are more likely to influ-ence each other. The mutual followees ( mf ) is defined in (3):
So the weight of edge ( u , v ) is defined as (4): 3.2 The Diffusion Model vation happens. weight as the model adopted in [8], the propagation probability is set as:  X  reasonable that v is more likely to be influenced by u . 4.1 Selecting the Candidates seeds are selected.  X

X  is the number of the shortest paths that pass v between s and t . number of shortest paths between s and t .  X   X  according to their remaining degree, which is obtained by successively pruning of nodes with degree smaller than the k .  X  degree. However, node 1 and node 5 belong to the same community, most of their vated. large degree from each community proportionally. the candidates N is defined as:  X  is a parameter to adjust the efficiency and accuracy. 4.2 Candidates-Based Greedy Algorithm Algorithm 1. CBG Algorithm Input : Graph G =( V , E , W ),number of total seeds k , parameter  X  , global influence probability  X  ,iterations number r .

The CBG algorithm consists vance. So we pay more attention to the seed selection part. 
Like the complexity of StaticGreedy in [5], the time complexity of our seed selec-is much less than StaticGreedy. 5.1 Dataset The experiments are to ev a the micro-blog network w e We summarize some basic information, such as user p r

 5.3 Varying  X  part of CBGCELF. We set the spread result of StaticGreedyCELF as baseline. k=10, k=20, k=30. We can get: (1) the CBGCELF-degree and CBGCELF-community ence in micro-blog network. (2) Actually CBGCELF-community has a bit advantage same range of  X  . become more, the seed selection will cost more time, almost in a linear way. 5.4 Varying k we set 15  X  = here. In Fig.6 we can see CGBCELF-degree, CGBCELF-community and 5.5 Varying  X  CELF-degree costs less time than CBGCELF-community while they almost have the same spread result. networks. 
Theoretically CBG algorithm can apply to most social networks because most so-candidate selection method will change with different networks. Acknowledgement.
