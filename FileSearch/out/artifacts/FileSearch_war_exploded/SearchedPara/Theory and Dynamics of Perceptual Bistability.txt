 Our visual system is remarkably good at producing consisten t, crisp percepts of the world around us, in the process hiding interpretation uncertainty. Perc eptual bistability is one of the few circum-stances where ambiguity in the visual processing is exposed to conscious awareness. Spontaneous switching of perceptual states frequently occurs during co ntinuously viewing an ambiguous image, and when a new interpretation of a previously stable stimuli is revealed (as in the sax/girl in fig-ure ?? a), spontaneous switching begins to occur[ ? ]. Moreover, although perceptual switching can be modulated by conscious effort[ ? , ? ], it cannot be completely controlled. Figure 1: Examples of ambiguous figures: (a) can be interpreted as a wom an X  X  face or a saxophone player. (b) Stimuli that produce bistability are characterized by havi ng several distinct interpretations that are in some sense equally plausible. Given the successes of Baye sian inference as a model of perception (for instance [ ? , ? , ? ]), these observations suggest that bistability is intimat ely connected with mak-ing perceptual decisions in the presence of a multi-modal po sterior distribution, as previously noted by several authors[ ? , ? ]. However, typical Bayesian models of perceptual inferenc e have no dy-namics, and probabilistic inference per se provides no reas on for spontaneous switching, raising the possibility that switching stems from idiosyncracies in th e brain X  X  implementation of probabilistic inference, rather than from general principles.
 In fact, most explanations of bistability have been histori cally rooted in proposals about the nature of neural processing of visual stimuli, involving low-leve l visual processes like retinal adaptation and neural fatigue[ ? , ? , ? ]. However, the abundance of behavioral and brain imaging da ta that show high level influences on switching (like intentional contro l which can produce 3-fold changes in alternation rate[ ? ]) have revised current views toward neural hypotheses invo lving combinations of both sensory and higher order cortical processing[ ? ]. The goal of this paper is to provide a simple explanation for the origins of bistability based on general principles that can potentially handle both top-down and bottom-up effects. The basic ideas that constitute our theory are simple and par tly form standard assumptions about perceptual processing. The core assumptions are: The intuition behind the model is that most percepts of objec ts in a scene are built up across a series of fixations. When an object previously fixated is eccentrica lly viewed or occluded, the brain should store the previous interpretation in memory until better da ta comes along or the memory becomes too old to be trusted. Finally, the interpretation space requir ed for direct Bayesian inference is too large for even simple images, but sampling schemes may provide a si mple way to perform approximate inference.
 The theory provides a natural interface to interpret both hi gh-level and low-level effects on bista-bility, because any event that has an impact on the relative h eights or positions of the modes in the posterior can potentially influence durations. For example , patterns of eye fixations have long been known to influence the dominant percept[ ? ]. Because eye movement events create sudden changes in image information, it is natural that they should be assoc iated with changes in the dominant mode. Similarly, control of information via selective atte ntion and changes in decision thresholds offer concrete loci for intentional effects on bistability . To analyze the proposed theory, we need to develop temporal d istributions for the maxima of a multi-modal posterior based on a sampling process and describe cir cumstances under which a current sample will produce an interpretation better than the one in memory. We proceed as follows. First we develop a general approximation to multi-modal posterio r distributions that can vary over time, and analyze the probability that a sample from the posterior are close to maximal. We then describe how the samples close to the max interact with a sample in memo ry with decay.
 A tractable approximation to a multi-modal distribution ca n be formed using a mixture of uni-modal distributions centered at each maxima.
 where  X  t is the vector of unknown parameters (e.g. shape for Necker Cu be) at time t ,  X   X  t,i is the location of the maxima of the i th mode, D t is the most recent data, D 0: t  X   X  t is the data history, experience 1 .
 Near the maxima, the negative log of the uni-modal distribut ions can be expanded into a second-order Taylor series: log P (  X   X  t,i | D 0: t ) represents the effect of the predictive prior on the posteri or height at the i th mode. Thus, samples from a posterior mode will be approximat ely  X  2 distributed near the maxi-mum with effective degrees of freedom n given by the number of significant eigenvalues of I  X  1 i . Essentially n encodes the effective degrees of freedom in interpretation space. 2 3.1 Distribution of transition times We assume that the perceptual interpretation is selected by a decision process that updates the in-terpretation in memory m  X  ( t ) whenever the posterior probability of the most recent sampl e both exceeds a decision threshold and the discounted probabilit y of the sample in memory. Given these assumptions, we can approximate the probability distribut ion for update events. Assuming the sam-pling forms a locally stationary process d 2 i ( t ) , update events involving entry into mode i are first passage times T i of d 2 i ( t ) below both the minimum of the current memory sample  X  t and the deci-sion threshold  X  : where  X  i t = d 2 i ( t )  X  k i , time t is the duration since the last update event and  X  t = The probability of waiting at least t for an update event is related to the minima of the process by: P ( T i (  X ,  X  t ) &lt; t ) = P ( M i t &lt; min {  X ,  X  t } ) This probability can be expressed as: where P ( i | t ) = P (  X  t  X  S i ) denotes the probability that a sample drawn between times 0 a nd t is in the support S i of the i th mode. To generate tractable expressions from equation ?? , we make the following assumptions.
 Memory distribution Assume that the memory decay process is slow relative to the s ampling events, and that the decay process can be modeled as a random w alk in the interpretation space m zero mean and variance  X  we assume to be small. Because variances add, the average eff ect on the distance  X  t is a linear increase:  X  t =  X  0 +  X  X t , where  X  is the sampling rate. These disturbances could represent changes in the local of the maxima of the post erior due to the incorporation of new data, neural noise, or even discounting (note that linearly increasing  X  t corresponds to exponential or multiplicative discounting in probability). To understand the behavior of this memory process, notice th at every m  X  (0) must be within dis-tance  X  of the maximum of the posterior for an update to occur. Due to t he properties of extrema of distributions of  X  2 random variables, an m  X  (0) will be (in expectation) a characteristic distance m (  X  ) below  X  and for t &gt; 0 drifts with linear dynamics 3 . This suggests the approximation, p (  X  t &lt;  X  )  X   X  ( m +  X  X t  X   X  t ) , which can be formally justified because p (  X  t &lt;  X  ) will be highly peaked with respect to the distribution of the sampli ng process p (  X  i  X  ) . Finally assuming slow drift means (1  X  P (  X  t &lt;  X  ))  X  0 on the time scale that transitions occur 4 . Under these assumptions, equation ?? reduces to: where P ( i ) is the average frequency of sampling from the i th mode.
 Extrema of the posterior sampling process If the sampling process has no long-range temporal dependence, then under mild assumptions the distribution o f extrema converge in distribution 5 to one of three characteristic forms that depend only on the dom ain of the random variable[ ? ]. For  X  2 samples, the distribution of minima converges to where N is the number of samples, c ( n ) = 2  X  a +1  X ( a ) , a ( n ) = n 2 . Set N =  X t and let  X  = 1 for convenience, where  X  is the effective sampling rate, and equation ?? can be written as: The probability distribution shows a range of behavior depe nding on the values of a = n/ 2 and m (  X  ) . Note that the time scale for switching. In particular, for n &gt; 4 and m (  X  ) relatively small, the distribution has a gamma-like behavior, where new memor y update transitions are suppressed near recent transitions. For n = 2 , or for m (  X  ) large, the above equation reduces to exponential. This behavior shows the effect of the decision threshold, as without a decision threshold the asymp-totic behavior of simple sampling schemes will generate app roximately exponentially distributed update event times, as a consequence of extreme value theory . Finally, for n = 1 and small m (  X  ) , the distribution becomes Cauchy-like with extremely long t ails. See figure ?? for example distribu-tions. Note that the time scale of events can be arbitrarily c ontrolled by appropriately selecting  X  (controls the time scale of the sampling process) and  X  (controls the time scale of the memory decay process).
 Effects of posterior parameters on update events The memory update distributions are effected primarily by two factors, the log posterior heights and thei r difference  X  k ij = k i  X  k j , and the effective number of degrees of freedom per mode n .
 Effect of k i ,  X  k ij The variable  X  k ij has possible effects both on the probability that a mode is Figure 2: Examples of cumulative distribution functions of memory update times. Solid curves are generated by simulating the sampling with decision proc ess described in the text. Dashed lines represent theoretical curves based on the approximation in equation ?? , showing the quality of the approximation.
 Effect of n One of the surprising aspects of the theory above is the stron g dependence on the effec-Relating theory to behavioral data via induced Semi-Markov Renewal Process Assuming that memory update events involving transitions to the same mode are not perceptually accessible, only update events that switch modes are potentially measurable . However, the process described above fits the description of a generator for a semi-Markov renewal process. A semi-Markov renewal process involves Markov transitions between discrete stat es i and j determined by a matrix with the conditional probability of first transition between sta tes i  X  j in time less than t , given first P The main reason for introducing the notion of a renewal proce ss is that they can be used to express the relationship between the theoretical distributions an d observable quantities. The most commonly collected data are times between transitions and (possibly contingent) percept frequencies. Here we present results found in Ross[ ? ]. Let the state s ( t ) = i refer to when the memory process is in the support of mode i : m  X  ( t )  X  S i at time t . The distribution of first transition times from state s = i can be expressed formally as a cumulative probability of firs t transition: update of type j . For two state processes, only G 01 ( t ) and G 10 ( t ) are measurable. Let P (0) , denote the probability of sampling from mode 0 . The relationship between the generating process and the distribution of first transitions is given by: which appears only to be solvable numerically for the genera l form of our memory update transition functions, however, for the case in which P ( T 0 &lt; t ) is exponential, G 01 ( t ) is as well. Moreover, for gamma-like distributions, the convolution integral te nds to increase the shape parameter, which means that gamma parameter estimates produced by fitting tra nsition durations will overestimate the amount of  X  X emory X  in the process 7 . Finally note the limiting behavior as P (0)  X  0 , G 01 ( t ) = P ( T 0 &lt; t ) , so that direct measurement of the temporal distributions i s possible but only for the (almost) supressed perceptual state . Similar relationships exist for survival probabilities, defined as S ij ( t ) = P ( s ( t ) = j | s (0) = i ) In this section we investigate simple qualitative predicti ons of the theory, that biasing perception toward one of the interpretations will produce a coupled set of changes in both percept frequen-cies and durations, under the assumption that perceptual bi ases result from differences in posterior heights . To bias perception of a bistable stimuli, we had obs ervers view a Necker cube flanked with  X  X ields of cubes X  that are perceptually unambiguous and match one of the two percepts (see figure ?? ). Subjects are typically biased toward seeing the Necker cu be in the  X  X ooking down X  state (65-70% response rates), and the context stimuli shown in fig ure ?? a) have little effect on Necker cube reversals. We found that the looking up context, boosts  X  X ooking up X  response rates from 30% to 55%. 4.1 Methods Subject X  X  perceptual state while viewing the stimuli in fig. ?? were collected using the methods described in[ ? ]. Eye movement effects[ ? ] were controlled by having observers focus on a tiny sphere in the center of the Necker cube, and attention was con trolled using catch trials. Base rates for reversals were established for each observer (18 total) in a training phase. Each observer viewed 100 randomly generated context stimuli and each stimulus wa s viewed long enough to acquire 10 responses (taking 10-12 sec on average). For ease of notatio n, we represent the  X  X ooking down X  condition as state 0 and the  X  X ooking Up X  as state 1 . 4.2 Results We measured the effect of context on estimates of perceptual switching rates, R i = P ( s ( t ) = i ) , first transition durations G ij , and survival probabilities P ii = P ( s ( t ) = i | s (0) = i ) by counting the number of events of each type. Additionally, we fit a semi-Markov renewal process Q ij ( t ) = P ij F ij ( t ) to the data using a sampling based procedure. The procedure i s too complex to fully describe in this paper, so a brief description follows. For e ase of sampling, F ij ( t ) were gamma with separate parameters for each of the four conditionals { 00 , 01 , 10 , 11 } , resulting in 10 parameters overall. The process was fit by iteratively choosing paramet er values for Q ij ( t ) , simulating response data and measuring the mismatch between the simulated and hu man G ij and P ii distributions. The effect of context on G ij and P ii is shown in Fig. ?? and Fig. ?? for the contexts  X  X ooking Down X  and  X  X ooking Up X  respectively. The figures also show th e maximum likelihood fitted gamma functions. Testable predictions generated by simulating t he memory process described above were verified, including changes in mean durations of about 2sec, coupling of the duration distributions, and an increase in the underlying renewal process shape para meters when the percepts are closer to equally probable. Although [ ? ] also presents a theory for average transitions times in bis tability based on random pro-cesses and a multi-modal posterior distribution, their the ory is fundamentally different as it derives switching events from tunneling probabilities that arise f rom input noise. Moreover, their theory predicts increasing transition times as the posterior beco mes increasingly peaked, exactly opposite our predictions.
 In conclusion, we have presented a novel theory of perceptua l bistability based on simple assump-tions about how the brain makes perceptual decisions. In add ition, results from a simple experiment show that manipulations which change the dominance of a perc ept produce coupled changes in the probability of transition events as predicted by theory. Ho wever, we do not regard the experiment as a strong test of the theory. We believe the strength of the the ory is that it can make a large set of qual-itative predictions about the distribution of transition e vents by coupling transition times to simple properties of the posterior distribution. Our theory sugge sts that the basic descriptive model suffi-cient to capture perceptual bistability is a semi-Markov re newal process, which we showed could successfully simulate the temporal dynamics of human data f or the Necker cube.
