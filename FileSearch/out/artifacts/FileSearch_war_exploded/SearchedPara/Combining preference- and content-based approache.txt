 1. Introduction
With advances in and the proliferation of information and networking technologies, organizations have increasingly participated in or shifted to the Internet environment to conduct business transactions, gather competitive intelligence information from various online sources, streamline their supply chains, and facil-itate information and knowledge sharing within or beyond organizational boundaries. Such e-commerce and knowledge management applications generate, consume, and maintain tremendous amounts of online information that typically is available as textual documents. To facilitate the subsequent access of and leverage from these textual documents, the efficient and effective management of the ever-increasing volume of documents is essential to organizations and online information providers. This document management need also is commonly observed at the individual level, where individuals must effectively and efficiently organize the documents they currently hold and use.

Existing document management practices suggest the popularity, among both organizations and individ-uals, of using categories (e.g., folders) for organizing, archiving, and accessing documents. The sheer vol-ume and availability of online documents to be managed often make a manual category-creation approach prohibitively tedious and unpractical. Therefore, an automated document clustering approach represents an appealing alternative. Essentially, document clustering automatically organizes a large document collec-tion into distinct groups of similar documents and discerns general themes hidden within the corpus ( Kim &amp;
Lee, 2000, 2002; Pantel &amp; Lin, 2002 ). Understandably, document clustering applications go beyond simply organizing document collections to facilitate subsequent retrievals and accesses ( Roussinov &amp; Chen, 1999, 2001; Wu, Fuller, &amp; Wilkinson, 2001 ). For example, document clustering has been applied to improve the results as one long list, some emerging search engines (e.g., Teoma, ler, 3 WebCrawler 4 ) use a document clustering approach to support cluster-based browsing by automatically organizing search results into meaningful categories on the fly.

Traditional document clustering techniques group together similar documents, using the similarity of the documents  X  feature sets as the measure of inter-document similarity. Such feature-based techniques operate at the lexical level and often encounter the word mismatch problem, which results in unsatisfactory clus-tering effectiveness. Word mismatch refers to the phenomenon that people use different words to describe the same concepts. According to Furnas, Landauer, Gomez, and Dumais (1987) , two people use the same term to describe a concept less than 20% of the time. Therefore, without properly addressing the word mis-match problem, semantically similar documents might be considered dissimilar because of the differences in of word mismatch on clustering effectiveness, several prior studies have sought to incorporate noncontent information into document clustering process. For example, the adaptive document clustering technique ( Yu, Wang, &amp; Chen, 1985 ) and the user-oriented document clustering technique ( Deogun &amp; Raghavan, 1986; Raghavan &amp; Deogun, 1987 ) take the documents  X  relevance to the user queries into account when clus-tering a collection of documents. Because these two techniques do not make references to document contents, they generally will not encounter the word mismatch problem and have the potential to improve clustering effectiveness. Alternatively, Kim and Lee (2000) propose a semi-supervised document clustering technique, a hybrid of content-and noncontent-based document clustering approaches, that considers not only content similarity but also users  X  perceptions of document similarity using a relevance feedback mechanism. Essentially, these three techniques assume that two documents are similar if they are frequently co-relevant to the users  X  queries. However, the characterization of the relevance of documents to queries is complex and may involve considerations of document traits, user characteristics, and query intention.
Thus, due to its multifaceted nature, relevance of documents to user queries may not be appropriate for measuring document similarity, thereby constraining the effectiveness of these document clustering techniques.

In this study, we attempt to exploit users  X  document grouping preferences as an additional source of information to improve the effectiveness of document clustering. Many e-commerce shopping stores (e.g., Books24  X  7.com 5 ) and digital libraries (e.g., ACM, functionality of personal bookshelves to users for indexing and organizing product information or research articles (both available as textual documents) of their interest into personal folders. This functionality en-ables users one-click access to documents that already have been included in their folders. Such document grouping behaviors are intentional acts that reflect the individual  X  s preferential perspective on semantic coherency or a relevant categorization of documents ( Rucker &amp; Polanco, 1997 ). Thus, individuals  X  folders are useful for measuring document similarities and can be employed to support preference-based document clustering. Imaginably, if most users place two documents in different folders, these two documents are likely dissimilar, regardless of whether their contents are similar. In contrast, two documents deposited in the same folders by most users should be considered semantically related.

However, in practice, when a large collection of documents in an e-commerce shopping store or digital library is available, users may index only a low percentage of documents into their personal folder sets. As a result, given a set of documents to be clustered, many may not appear in any user  X  s folder set. This sparsity problem prevents a pure preference-based document clustering approach from being either practical or fea-sible. Hence, in this study, we propose a hybrid technique that combines preference-and content-based doc-ument clustering approaches. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2 ,we overview document clustering approaches relevant to this study. In Section 3 , we describe the proposed technique, including its overall process and algorithmic details. Subsequently, we provide our empirical evaluation design and then summarize the important evaluation results in Section 4 , followed by an in-depth evaluation of the proposed technique on the basis of synthetic data sets in Section 5 . We conclude with a summary, discussion of our research contributions, and some further research directions in Section 6 . 2. Overview of document clustering approaches In this section, we provide an overview of the traditional content-based document clustering approach.
In addition, we review and assess the literature on noncontent-based and hybrid document clustering tech-niques that are related to our proposed technique. 2.1. Content-based document clustering approach
In essence, document clustering groups similar documents into clusters. The documents in the resultant clusters exhibit maximal similarity to those in the same cluster and, at the same time, share minimal sim-ilarity with documents in other clusters. Most prior document clustering techniques are anchored in doc-ument content analysis and generally comprise three main phases: feature extraction and selection, document representation, and clustering ( Jain, Murty, &amp; Flynn, 1999; Wei, Hu, &amp; Dong, 2002 ).
Feature extraction begins with the parsing of each source document to produce a set of features (typi-cally nouns and noun phrases) and exclude a list of prespecified stop words that are non-semantic-bearing words. Subsequently, representative features are selected from the set of extracted features. Feature selec-tion is important for clustering efficiency and effectiveness because it not only condenses the size of the ex-tracted feature set but also reduces the potential biases embedded in the original (i.e., non-trimmed) feature set ( Dumais, Platt, Heckerman, &amp; Sahami, 1998; Roussinov &amp; Chen, 1999 ). Previous research commonly has employed such feature selection metrics as term frequency (TF), TF  X  IDF (inverse document fre-quency), and their hybrids ( Boley et al., 1999; Larsen &amp; Aone, 1999 ).

According to the top-k selection method, the k features with the highest selection metric scores are se-lected to represent each target document in the document representation phase. Thus, each document is represented as a feature vector jointly defined by the previously selected k features. A review of prior re-search suggests the prevalence of several representation methods that include binary (presence or absence of a feature in a document), TF (i.e., within-document term frequency), and TF  X  IDF ( Larsen &amp; Aone, 1999; Roussinov &amp; Chen, 1999 ).

In the final phase of document clustering, the target documents are grouped into distinct clusters on the basis of the selected features and their respective values in each document. Common approaches include ( El-Hamdouchi &amp; Willett, 1986; Roussinov &amp; Chen, 1999; Voorhees, 1986 ), and Kohonen neural network ( Guerrero Bote, Moya Anego  X  n, &amp; Herrero Solana, 2002; Lagus, Honkela, Kaski, &amp; Kohonen, 1996; Lin,
Chen, &amp; Nunamaker, 1999; Roussinov &amp; Chen, 1999 ). Generally, a partitioning-based approach (e.g., k -means Anderberg, 1973 ) partitions a set of documents into multiple non-overlapping clusters. In contrast, a hierarchical approach builds a binary clustering hierarchy whose leaf nodes represent the documents to be clustered. A representative hierarchical clustering algorithm is the hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) method, which starts with as many clusters as there are documents; that is, each cluster contains only one document ( Voorhees, 1986 ). On the basis of a specific intercluster similarity measure of choice (e.g., single link, complete link, group-average link, Ward  X  s method), the two most similar clusters are merged to form a new cluster. This merging process continues until either a hierarchy, with a single cluster at the top, emerges or a termination condition (e.g., the intercluster similarity is less than a prespecified threshold) holds. The Kohonen neural network approach, also known as a self-organizing map, uses an unsupervised two-layer neural network ( Kohonen, 1989, 1995 ). Within a Kohonen neural network, an input node corresponds to a feature in the selected feature vector space, whereas an output node represents a cluster in a two-dimensional grid. The network is fully connected; that is, each output node is connected to every input node with a particular connection weight. During the training phase, the source documents are fed into the network multiple times to train or adjust the connection weights in such a way that distri-bution of the output nodes would accurately represent that of the input documents. 2.2. Noncontent-based and hybrid document clustering approaches
In addition to the described pure content-based document clustering approach, prior research has pro-posed noncontent-based or hybrid document clustering approaches. For example, Yu et al. (1985) propose the adaptive document clustering technique, which captures users  X  perceptions of the closeness between documents according to the documents  X  relevance to user queries. Given a document collection
D ={ d 1 , d 2 , ... , d n } to be clustered and a set of user queries Q ={ q ments relevant to q j be D qj ), the adaptive technique proceeds as follows: each document d signed to an arbitrary position on a real line. For each query q averaging the positions of all documents in D qj . Accordingly, every document d x , where the amount of movement is proportional to the distance between d ferred to as the converging operation. However, the positions of all documents in D eventually may bunch together if the converging operation is repeated for many different queries. To avoid this situation, after the execution of the converging operation for a query q j , the adaptive document clustering technique performs a pulling operation by randomly selecting a subset of documents D
D s away from the centroid of D s by the amount proportional to the distance between the document and the centroid of D s . After the converging and pulling operations are performed for all queries in Q , the clusters for D are determined on the basis of the distances between adjacent documents. That is, if the distance be-tween two adjacent documents is less than a prespecified threshold, we consider that the two documents belong to the same cluster; otherwise, they appear in different clusters.

Deogun and Raghavan ( Deogun &amp; Raghavan, 1986; Raghavan &amp; Deogun, 1987 ) also have proposed a two-phase, user-oriented document clustering technique that is based solely on document relevance to user queries. The first phase divides the document collection D into clusters on the basis of document relevance sets to the first query q 1 . Then, for a subsequent query q intersection with D qj is divided into two clusters (relevant and irrelevant). The divisive process continues until all queries in Q are processed. The second phase then merges the clusters to form larger ones. For each cluster C i generated in the previous phase but that has not been combined in this phase, its affinity to every other cluster C h is calculated as affinity  X  C i ; C h  X  X  w d (for each d p 2 C i ) and d q (for each d q 2 C h ) co-occur in D in C i that co-occur with any documents in C h , and E 2 is the number of documents in C combined with the cluster with which its affinity is the maximum and satisfies a predefined threshold. After all clusters are processed, the resultant clusters constitute the clusters for the document collection D .
Alternatively, Kim and Lee (2000) propose a semi-supervised document clustering technique that con-siders not only content similarity but also the user  X  s perception of document similarity through a relevance feedback mechanism. Specifically, this hybrid technique consists of preclustering, supervising, and reclu-stering phases. Using the HAC algorithm, the preclustering phase initially places each target document in a separate cluster and merges the two clusters whose merger produces the smallest increase in diameter.
The merging process then repeats until the diameter of the merged clusters reaches a given threshold. Each of such resultant clusters is referred to as a  X  X  X recluster X  X . Subsequently, the supervising phase obtains rel-evance feedback from a user for cluster formation in a later phase. It determines the training document set
T that includes all documents within preclusters of less than g documents. Accordingly, a document d sented to the user, who then judges whether each of the retrieved documents is relevant to the query (i.e., d ). Thus, two types of document bundles are formed for d i positive bundle, which the user has judged as relevant to d those in the negative bundle must be located in clusters other than d volves the formation of clusters for the entire document collection. The preclusters created in the first phase are assigned to the nearest positive bundle. For every precluster assignment, larger clusters are generated, and the set of local cluster prototypes is incrementally updated. Furthermore, each residual document that has not been retrieved or has been ignored during the relevance feedback process is assigned to the cluster with the nearest local prototype. At this point, documents in negative bundles are examined to verify whether they are located in the same clusters. If such documents are found, each is reassigned to the cluster with that document  X  s second-nearest local prototype.

The described noncontent-based (i.e., adaptive and user-oriented techniques) or hybrid (i.e., semi-super-vised technique) approaches exploit document relevance to queries as the sole source of information or a supplement to document content for their document clustering processes. However, these techniques encounter several drawbacks. First, to be feasible, the adaptive and user-oriented techniques must assume that all documents in the target collection D are relevant to at least one user query. If a document is con-sidered irrelevant to all queries, its similarity with any other documents in D cannot be estimated. As the size of D expands, the number of documents considered irrelevant to all queries would increase, thus cre-ating a serious problem for both techniques. Second, the use of document relevance to user queries by all three described techniques as the basis for estimating document similarity may not be appropriate. The rel-evance of documents to a query often depends on document traits (e.g., quality, readability), user charac-teristics (e.g., user  X  s previous knowledge), and query intention. Thus, due to its multifaceted nature, the relevance of documents to user queries may not provide appropriate estimates for measuring document similarity and thus may constrain the effectiveness of these document clustering techniques. Third, the semi-supervised technique involves real-time relevance feedback from a user during the supervising phase.
However, relevance feedback becomes time consuming and, more seriously, impractical for many docu-ment clustering applications (e.g., supporting cluster-based browsing in digital libraries or by search engines), which possibly limits the applicability of the semi-supervised technique.

In response to these limitations and drawbacks of prior noncontent-based or hybrid techniques, this study attempts to combine the use of users  X  personal folder sets and document content to improve docu-ment clustering effectiveness. As a hybrid technique, our approach minimizes the first problem encountered by the adaptive and user-oriented document clustering techniques. Furthermore, because document group-ing behaviors exhibited in users  X  personal folder sets are intentional acts, they should be more appropriate for measuring document similarities than is document relevance to queries. Finally, because users  X  personal folder sets are readily accessible in many e-commerce sites and digital libraries, the proposed technique does not require real-time feedback from users. Thus, the applicability of the proposed technique should be greater than that of the semi-supervised technique. 3. Design of preference-and content-based document clustering technique
The proposed hybrid document clustering technique, which combines the preference-and content-based approaches, takes as its inputs the document collection to be clustered and users  X  folder sets. In this study, we refer to a  X  X  X ser folder set X  X  as a collection of folders, each of which contains one or more documents, organized by the user. As we show in Fig. 1 , the proposed technique consists of five phases: (1) feature extraction and selection, (2) document representation, (3) content-based document similarity estimation, (4) preference-based document similarity estimation, and (5) clustering. The first three phases represent the process of traditional content-based document clustering and essentially analyze the document contents to derive content-based similarities between documents. On the other hand, the analysis of users  X  folder sets through the preference-based document similarity estimation phase measures document similarities through users  X  document grouping preferences. Both similarities will then be taken into account to deter-mine the appropriate clusters for the target document collection. In the following, we detail the design and implementation of each phase. 3.1. Feature extraction and selection
When performing feature extraction, our proposed technique extracts from the document collection a set of representative features (specifically, nouns and noun phrases) to represent the target documents. We adopted the rule-based part-of-speech tagger developed by Brill (1992, 1994) to syntactically tag each word in the target documents. Subsequently, we employed the approach proposed by Voutilainen (1993) to implement a noun-phrase parser for extracting noun phrases from each syntactically tagged document.
Furthermore, we adopted the TF  X  IDF method for feature selection because of its popularity in prior re-
Chen, 1999; Salton &amp; Buckley, 1988; Yang, 1994 ). As a result, the technique constructs a set of k features with the highest TF  X  IDF metric scores. 3.2. Document representation
According to the document representation scheme of choice, each target document is represented using the representative features selected in the previous phase. Specifically, we employed the binary and TF schemes for document representation and empirically evaluated their effects on clustering effectiveness (de-tails in Section 4 ). Each document d i is described by a feature vector presence or absence of the feature f j in document d i for the binary representation scheme or the within-doc-ument frequency of f j in d i for the TF representation scheme. 3.3. Content-based document similarity estimation
This phase measures the content-based similarity between any two documents in the collection. Let the feature vectors of documents d i and d j be ~ d i and ~ d as where j ~ d i j is the length of ~ d i . 3.4. Preference-based document similarity estimation
In this phase, we measure the similarity between any two documents from the perspective of users  X  grouping preferences. For the purposes of the intended feasibility assessment and illustration, we concen-evaluated both documents d i and d j (i.e., included both d users who deposited these two documents in the same folder be v similarity between d i and d j is then defined as 3.5. Clustering
The clustering phase first combines the content-and preference-based document similarities to arrive at an overall similarity measure for each pair of documents in the collection. Specifically, we adopted a linear combination function for the intended similarity measure: where sim overall ( d i , d j ) is the overall similarity between d based document similarity between d i and d j to their overall similarity (where 0 6 k
The choice of the function for k ij must consider the number of users (i.e., u in their folder sets, as well as the percentage of users (i.e., v
An increase in u ij thus will result in a greater k ij . However, as u k is expected to level off. In this study, we employed a prespecified threshold Sig N to model the described d and d j in the same folder, and half place them in different folders), we are highly uncertain about the sim-about the preference-based document similarity would be reduced, which in turn would decrease k about whether d i and d j should be put in the same folder, which will result in an increase of k in this study, k ij is defined as a function of u ij and v where Sig N is a prespecified significance threshold of the effect of u
Apparently, when u ij =0or v ij / u ij = 0.5, k ij becomes 0 (i.e., the overall similarity between d entirely on their content-based document similarity). In contrast, when v will be 1 (i.e., the overall similarity between d i and d similarity). Given any values for u ij , v ij (where v ij result in the decline in k ij . Similarly, given any values for u sired clustering, the choice of lower values for Sig N and h would be more desirable. Fig. 2 shows the curve of the described function for k ij with h = 1.3 and Sig N =20.

Through the use of the overall document similarity measure defined previously, the clustering of docu-ments can proceed. As mentioned, common document clustering approaches include partitioning-based, hierarchical, and Kohonen neural network. The hierarchical clustering approach has an advantage over the partitioning-based approach because the number of clusters need not be prespecified and can be decreased (increased) by simply moving up (down) the resultant clustering hierarchy. Furthermore, the hierarchical approach can achieve comparable clustering effectiveness to that of the Kohonen neural net-work ( Roussinov &amp; Chen, 1999 ). Accordingly, we adopted the hierarchical approach (specifically, the
HAC algorithm) for clustering documents and employed the group-average link method for measuring the similarity between two clusters. That is, two clusters whose average similarity among all intercluster old ( a ) to determine whether the two most similar clusters should be merged. That is, at each step of HAC, if the similarity between the two most similar clusters is less than a , HAC halts the merging process and generates, as the clustering result, those clusters that are not children of any other clusters. 4. Empirical evaluation
This section reports the empirical evaluation of the proposed hybrid document clustering technique. We highlight the document clustering techniques employed for performance benchmarks, then discuss the data collection, evaluation procedure, evaluation criteria, and our analysis of the empirical evaluation results. 4.1. Performance benchmarks
To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the proposed hybrid document clustering technique, we adopted the traditional content-based approach as a performance benchmark. Specifically, we employed the HAC algorithm purely on the basis of the content-based document similarity measure. Furthermore, a variant of our proposed hybrid technique, the preference/content switching technique, was also developed as a performance benchmark. In the preference/content switching technique, the weight of the preference-based similarity of d i and d j (i.e., k ij ) is set to equal 1 (i.e., the overall similarity of d by their preference-based similarity) if there exists one or more users who included d set. Otherwise, we set k ij as 0 (i.e., the overall similarity of d similarity). That is, in the preference/content switching technique, 4.2. Data collection
The document collection for our evaluation consisted of 424 research articles related to information sys-tems and technologies collected from a scientific literature digital library website (i.e., CiteSeer Scientific and keywords. A senior faculty member of Management Information Systems reviewed the 424 articles to develop a  X  X  X old standard X  X  clustering. The resultant clusters encompassed 13 categories, as shown in Table 1 , and were considered the true categories for this document collection.

In addition, the proposed hybrid technique requires users  X  folder sets to estimate the preference-based document similarities. A total of 48 users, graduate students majoring in management information systems, participated in this user folder collection. All participants had adequate knowledge about at least two sub-ject areas included in the document collection. Each participant was assigned approximately 50 X 80 docu-ments randomly selected with different probabilities from the document collection, then asked to categorize the selected documents into a set of folders according to his or her knowledge and preference. No hints about the underlying true categories or the number of true categories were given before or during the cat-egorization process. Furthermore, a participant could remove any document whose content he or she had difficulty understanding or that he or she found difficult to assign to any folder. As a result, the maximum number of documents organized by a user in his or her folder set was 73 and the minimum was 19, with an average of 35.67. On average, participants created 9.96 folders each, and each folder contained 3.58 doc-uments. Table 2 summarizes the users  X  folder sets collected. 4.3. Evaluation procedure
To expand the number of trials when evaluating the clustering effectiveness of each technique under dis-cussion, we randomly selected 80% of the documents in the collection. Accordingly, we employed this document subset to estimate the clustering effectiveness of the content-based technique investigated. On the other hand, we combined the document subset with relevant users  X  folder sets to estimate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid technique and the preference/content switching technique. To minimize the potential biases resulting from the sampling process, the described sampling-and-clustering process was performed 10 times, and the overall effectiveness of each technique was estimated by averaging the performance estimates obtained from the 10 individual sampling-and-clustering processes. 4.4. Evaluation criteria
We employed cluster recall and cluster precision ( Roussinov &amp; Chen, 1999 ), defined according to the concept of associations, to measure the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid technique and its benchmark techniques. An association refers to a pair of documents that belong to the same cluster. As mentioned pre-viously, we assumed that the manually produced categories were true categories. Accordingly, the cluster recall ( CR ) is defined as in both the clusters generated by a document clustering technique and the true categories. The cluster precision ( CP ) is defined as where G is the set of associations in the clusters generated by a document clustering technique.
Assume that documents d 1 , d 2 , ... , and d 7 are organized into two true categories, T
T
T ={( d 1  X  d 2 ),( d 1  X  d 3 ),( d 2  X  d 3 ),( d 4  X  d 5 a document clustering technique for the same set of documents be G
G nique is G ={( d 1  X  d 2 ),( d 3  X  d 4 ),( d 3  X  d 5 ),( d CA ={( d 1  X  d 2 ),( d 4  X  d 5 ),( d 6  X  d 7 )}. Hence, 4.5. Parameter tuning experiments and results
As we have discussed, the proposed hybrid technique involves five parameters or design choices, includ-ing the number of features k for representing the target documents, the representation scheme (i.e., binary or TF), h and Sig N for determining the weight of the preference-based similarity to the overall similarity, and the similarity threshold ( a ) as the halting criterion of HAC. In contrast, the content-based technique involves three parameters or design choices, namely, k , the representation scheme, and a . For both the hy-brid and the content-based document clustering techniques, we examined the number of features k ranging from 200 to 3000 in increments of 200 and the similarity threshold a ranging from 0.02 to 0.98 in increments of 0.02. Moreover, for the proposed hybrid technique, we investigated six different values for h , namely, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5. Finally, because only 48 participants were involved in our user folder collection, we set Sig N as 10 for the proposed hybrid technique in subsequent experiments. 4.5.1. Tuning experiment on number of features k
We first investigated the effects of the number of features k on clustering effectiveness. To address the inevitable tradeoffs between cluster recall and cluster precision, we employed precision/recall tradeoff (PRT) curves, which represent the effectiveness of a document clustering technique with different a . Evi-dently, a higher a halts the merging process of HAC earlier and produces a larger number of clusters. ument clustering technique with its PRT curve closer to the upper-right corner would be desirable. As we show in Fig. 3 (to reduce the complexity of the figure, we show only a subset of values for k ), at almost any level of a examined, the PRT curve of the content-based technique using the binary representation scheme moves toward to the upper-right corner as k increases from 200 to 3000 and achieves a stable result when k is around 3000.

Furthermore, the clustering effectiveness of the content-based technique using the TF representation scheme exhibits a similar trend over different values for k . Similarly, in both representation schemes (i.e., binary and TF) and at any levels of h investigated, the proposed hybrid technique achieves better clustering effectiveness when k increases from 200 to 3000. Thus, we selected 3000 as the number of features ( k ) for both the content-based and the hybrid techniques in subsequent experiments. Finally, as a variant of the proposed hybrid technique, the preference/content switching technique also adopted 3000 as its feature size. 4.5.2. Tuning experiment on document representation scheme
With the previously determined number of features (i.e., k = 3000), the binary representation scheme generally outperforms the TF in the PRT curve for the content-based technique, as shown in Fig. 4 . Like-wise, for the proposed hybrid technique, at any level of h investigated, the clustering effectiveness achieved by the use of the binary representation scheme is superior to that attained by the TF representation scheme.
Fig. 5 shows the comparative clustering effectiveness of the hybrid technique when k and h are set to 3000 and 1.3, respectively. Therefore, we employed the binary representation scheme for the three document clustering techniques under investigation. 4.5.3. Tuning experiment on h for the hybrid technique
In this tuning experiment, we examined the effects of h on the clustering effectiveness of the hybrid tech-technique generally improves when h decreases from 1.5 to 1.0; in other words, a smaller value for h is more desirable for the proposed hybrid technique. A plausible explanation for this result may involve the sparsity sured by the number of users (i.e., 48) and the average number of documents organized in a user  X  s folder set (i.e., 35.67), most document pairs appeared in none or only one of the users  X  folder sets. As Fig. 7 shows, 73.05% of document pairs (i.e., 65,512) were not found in any user  X  s folder set, whereas 20.72% of them (i.e., 18,577) appeared in only one user  X  s folder set. Only 1.93% of document pairs were included in three or more users  X  folder sets. That is, when Sig N = 10 and h = 1.0, k ment pairs would be no greater than 0.3. Consequently, the increase of h would reduce k to the insignificant weight of the preference-based similarity compared with the overall similarity for most document pairs. Hence, in this study, we chose 1.0 for h for the proposed hybrid technique in subsequent experiments. 4.6. Comparative evaluation results
Using the parameter values and decision choices determined previously, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid technique, using the effectiveness achieved by the content-based and the preference/ content switching techniques as performance benchmarks. As we show in Fig. 8 , the proposed hybrid tech-nique outperforms the content-based one at any level of a investigated. This result suggests that the incor-poration of users  X  document grouping preferences in the proposed hybrid technique can improve document clustering effectiveness as measured by cluster recall and cluster precision. Furthermore, combining the users  X  document grouping preferences and textual content to measure document similarities (as in the pro-posed hybrid technique) generally is more appealing than taking users  X  document grouping preferences as a sole measure for estimating document similarities and then switching to content-based similarity when users  X  document grouping preferences are not applicable (as in the preference/content switching technique).
As Fig. 8 illustrates, the preference/content switching technique outperforms the content-based one when the required cluster recall is higher than 0.3. In contrast, at any level of cluster recall lower than 0.3, the content-based technique achieves a significantly better clustering effectiveness than does the prefer-ence/content switching. In this particular situation, both techniques generate a large number of clusters (i.e., the underlying HAC algorithm halted its clustering process with a higher similarity threshold a ). As mentioned, the preference/content switching technique adopts either the users  X  document grouping prefer-ences or the content-based similarity for measuring document similarities. As we show in Table 3 , across the entire document corpus and the users  X  folder sets, 1619 (or 1908) document pairs experienced preference-based similarity higher than 0.9 (or 0.5), but only 9 (or 20) document pairs had content-based similarity within this specific range. Thus, given a higher a as the halting criterion of HAC, it is highly possible that preference-based similarity dominates the clustering process of the preference/content switching technique.
As depicted in Fig. 7 , the number of users (i.e., u ij ) who evaluated both documents d cluster merger decision would have been based on the perspective of a very small number of users and not discussed situation.

When users only index a very small percentage of documents in their personal folder sets, compared with the entire document collection to be clustered, the user preference sparsity problem may degrade the per-formance of the proposed hybrid technique. To better understand its effects, we further conducted an empirical evaluation by reducing the number of documents contained in each user  X  s folder set. That is, we randomly selected certain percentages of documents from users  X  folder sets and evaluated the effective-ness of the proposed hybrid technique accordingly. Specifically, we examined percentages ranging from 100% to 20% in decrements of 20%. As we show in Fig. 9 , the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid tech-nique degrades as the amount of user preferences decreases. However, the proposed hybrid technique still outperforms the content-based one, even when only 20% of user preferences are available. In this particular case, the proposed hybrid technique only relies on approximately 7.13 documents per user  X  s folder set (i.e., 1.68% of the documents in the target collection) to estimate preference-based document similarities. This encouraging result suggests that though the proposed hybrid technique is sensitive to the size of user  X  s doc-ument grouping preferences, the hybrid technique with small-sized user preferences remains superior to the content-based technique. 5. In-depth analysis using synthetic data sets
In this evaluation, we intended to analyze the effects of Sig N and h on the effectiveness of the proposed in a real-world setting and across a range of characteristics for our analysis would have been extremely dif-ficult, if not impossible. Thus, we adopted the document collection employed in the previous section and generated synthetic users  X  folder sets for this evaluation purpose. 5.1. Generation of synthetic users X  folder sets
As with our aforementioned empirical evaluation, we regarded the 13 manually generated categories for the 424 articles as true categories (i.e., gold standard clustering). In this experiment, we considered two dimensions X  X evel of sparsity and degree of conformity to the gold standard clustering X  X o characterize preferences available to support the proposed hybrid technique. By appropriately manipulating u distribution of u ij (as shown in Fig. 7 ) significantly conformed to a geometric distribution with p = 0.71.
In this experiment, we adopted p = 0.71 for the low sparsity scenario and p = 0.90 for the high sparsity one. That is, the number of document pairs that appeared in at least one user  X  s folder set (i.e., u pared with the total number of document pairs was 29.09% and 10.00% for the low and high sparsity sce-narios, respectively. Fig. 10 shows the distribution of u
The degree of conformity measures the compliance of the clustering in a collection of users  X  folder sets with the gold standard clustering. Specifically, we considered four different degrees of conformity: high, medium high, medium low, and low. The high conformity scenario refers to a situation in which users  X  clus-tering behaviors are highly similar to the gold standard clustering, so that if a pair of documents belongs to the same true category (or different true categories), the percentage of users who place both documents in high conformity scenario, we first organized all document pairs into two classes on the basis of the gold standard clustering: intra-true category and inter-true categories. A document pair belongs to the intra-true category class if the two documents appear in the same true category, whereas a document pair occurs in the inter-true categories class when the two documents are actually in different true categories. Given all document pairs whose u ij &gt; 0 in the gold standard clustering, the mean and variance of v centage of users who deposit the document d i and d j in the same folders) were 0.6691 and 0.4400 for the intra-true category class and 0.0366 and 0.1768 for the inter-true categories class, respectively. As we show in Table 4 , for the high conformity scenario, we set the means of v category and inter-true categories classes, respectively. We assumed that the distribution of v mal distribution, with the variance being 0.4400 and 0.1768 for the two classes, respectively.
The synthetic collection of users  X  folder sets is of medium high conformity if a user places a pair of doc-uments in the same folder, they are likely to appear in the same true category. However, if a pair of doc-uments appears in the same true category, a user may not place them in the same folder. Conversely, if a pair of documents actually belongs to different true categories, users are likely to place these documents in finer granularity compared with the gold standard clustering. As Table 4 depicts, we set the means of v to 0.55 and 0.10 for the intra-true category and inter-true categories classes, respectively, for the medium high conformity scenario.
The medium low conformity scenario, in contrast, simulates the situation in which users prefer organiz-ing their folder sets with coarser granularity. That is, if a pair of documents appears in the same true cate-gory, users are likely to place both documents in the same folder, but if a pair of documents actually ses, respectively. Finally, the low conformity scenario refers to the situation in which users  X  clustering behaviors are dissimilar from the gold standard clustering. In other words, the percentage of users who place two documents that are actually in the same true category (or different true categories) in the same (or different) folders is low. Specifically, we set the means of v gory and inter-true categories classes, respectively, for this particular conformity scenario.
Given a specific combination of the sparsity and conformity scenarios, the generation process of a syn-nario under discussion. If u ij is determined as 0, v ij is set to 0 as well. In contrast, if u whether d i and d j appear in the same true category, v ij for the target conformity scenario. Subsequently, we derive v u ) of the product of the previously determined v ij / u ij the corpus of the 424 documents thus is generated for that specific combination of the sparsity and confor-mity scenarios. To expand the number of trials when we evaluated the effects of Sig N and h , we performed the described synthetic data generation process 10 times. The overall clustering effectiveness (i.e., measured by cluster recall and cluster precision) across the range of Sig N and h examined was estimated by averaging the performance estimates obtained from the 10 trials. 5.2. Analysis of effects of h
When analyzing the effects of h , we set Sig N to be constant (10 in this experiment) and examined the range of h from 0.7 to 1.6 in increments of 0.3. As Fig. 11 (a) shows, when the users  X  clustering behaviors proposed hybrid technique. Across the range of h examined, the proposed hybrid technique also outper-forms the content-based technique. In this high conformity scenario, when the sparsity level increases ( Fig. 12 (a)), a decreasing h results in a marginal performance improvement compared with the performance achieved by the content-based technique. In the medium high conformity scenario, Figs. 11 (b) and 12 (b) show that the effects of h on the clustering effectiveness of the proposed technique are slight for both levels of sparsity investigated.

When the degree of conformity further deteriorates from medium high to medium low, the proposed hy-brid technique becomes ineffective, especially when h is 0.7. In the low conformity, low sparsity scenario ( Fig. 11 (c)), the content-based technique significantly outperforms the proposed technique, whose cluster-ing effectiveness degrades as h decreases from 1.6 to 0.7. However, in this conformity scenario, when the sparsity level increases ( Fig. 12 (c)), the hybrid technique with the use of an h no less than 1.0 results in a performance comparable to that of the content-based technique. 5.3. Analysis of effects of SigN
When analyzing the effects of Sig N , we set h to be constant (i.e., 1.0) and investigated the Sig N effects at proposed hybrid technique outperforms the content-based technique across the range of Sig N examined, and Sig N appears to have marginal effects on the proposed technique  X  s clustering effectiveness. As the de-gree of conformity degrades, the proposed hybrid technique benefits from the use of a higher Sig N value.
For example, in the medium high conformity scenario ( Fig. 13 (b)), the proposed technique with Sig N as 20 or 15 achieves a clustering effectiveness better than that of the content-based technique. However, as
Fig. 13 (d) shows, in the low conformity scenario, setting Sig N to 20 leads to a clustering effectiveness com-parable to that of the content-based technique. In this particular conformity scenario, the use of Sig N as 5 reaches a clustering effectiveness far worse than that of the content-based technique.

As the sparsity level increases ( Fig. 14 ), the effects of Sig N become less pertinent except when a lower value for Sig N is employed (i.e., 5). Across all conformity scenarios, the proposed hybrid technique with
Sig N as 10, 15, or 20 achieves a clustering effectiveness comparable to or better than that attained by the content-based technique. When setting Sig N to 5, the proposed hybrid technique significantly suffers from the use of unreliable users  X  folder sets in the medium low and low conformity scenarios ( Fig. 14 (c) and (d)). 6. Conclusions and future research directions
Observations of document management practices by organizations and individuals suggest the popular-ity of using categories to organize, archive, and access documents. As the number of documents to be man-aged escalates, especially in the e-commerce and knowledge management era, document clustering represents an appealing approach to support those organizations and individuals by automatically creating and maintaining document categories. Existing document clustering techniques, which usually group together similar documents on the basis of their textual content similarity, operate at the lexical level and greatly suffer from the word mismatch problem. In this study, we attempt to address this problem by employing users  X  document grouping preferences to support document clustering. Specifically, we pro-pose a hybrid document clustering technique that combines preference-and content-based approaches.
Using benchmarks of a traditional content-based and a preference/content switching document clustering technique, we find empirically that the proposed hybrid technique improves the clustering effectiveness measured by cluster recall and cluster precision.

Some ongoing and future research directions might include the following: as we mentioned, most doc-ument pairs may exist in few or none of the users  X  folder sets, which may minimize the weight of the pref-erence-based document similarities to their overall similarities. Hence, the development and empirical evaluation of an alternative weighting scheme to address the described sparsity problem would represent an interesting research direction. Furthermore, this research has concentrated on the exploitation of users  X  folder sets that were organized non-hierarchically. However, it is common that users organize their folders in a hierarchical structure. Therefore, the proposed hybrid document clustering technique should be ex-tended to accommodate users  X  folder hierarchies. In addition, the current design of the proposed hybrid document clustering technique generates a flat set of clusters, and it would be desirable to extend the pro-posed technique to organizing documents into a hierarchical cluster structure. Finally, the empirical eval-uation of this study was conducted in a laboratory setting. It would be essential to port the proposed hybrid document clustering technique to an e-commerce shopping store or digital library and subsequently to per-form empirical evaluations in such a real-world setting.
