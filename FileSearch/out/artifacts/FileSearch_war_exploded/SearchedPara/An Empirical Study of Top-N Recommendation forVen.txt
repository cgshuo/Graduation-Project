 This paper concerns the task of top-N investment oppor-tunity recommendation in the domain of venture finance. By venture finance, specifically, we are interested in the in-vestment activity of venture capital (VC) firms and their investment partners. We have access to a dataset of record-ed venture financings (i.e., investments) by VCs and their investment partners in private US companies. This research was undertaken in partnership with Correlation Ventures, a venture capital firm who are pioneering the use of predictive analytics in order to better inform investment decision mak-ing. This paper undertakes a detailed empirical study and data analysis then demonstrates the efficacy of recommender systems in this novel application domain.
 H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Search and Re-trieval X  Information Filtering Information Retrieval, Recommender Systems, Venture Fi-nance, Industry Classification
Early-stage investment is a key driving force of technologi-cal innovation and is vitally important to the wider economy, especially in high-growth and hi-tech industries (such as Life Sciences, Clean-tech, Information Technology). Venture fi-nance refers to the financing of private companies through the use of venture capital. Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity, a medium to long-term form of finance pro-vided in return for an equity stake in potentially high growth companies. Early-stage investment is typified by venture capital firms (VCs) who deploy capital towards high-risk ventures. Venture capital has five main characteristics [9]: is a financial intermediary; invests only in private compa-nies; takes an active role in monitoring and helping portfolio companies; primary goal is to maximise financial return by exiting investments through sale or an initial public offer-ing (IPO); invests to fund the internal growth of companies. Whilst there have been some applications of recommender systems to the broader domain of finance, including micro-finance [3], there has seemingly been no previous academic research in applying such techniques directly to venture fi-nance.

Traditionally, investment opportunities are either referred or identified through technology scans [13], however, mod-ern information retrieval techniques such as recommender systems have emerged in the past several years as an effec-tive way to help people cope with the problem of information overload [12, 10]. The VC investment process involves sever-al main stages: deal origination, screening, evaluation, struc-turing, and post investment activities [6]. Our intention is to apply recommender systems with the goal of recommend-ing top-N relevant investment opportunities to VC firms and their investments partners. In recent years the traditional venture financing landscape has also shown signs of evolving [2] plus the emergence of entirely new funding sources such as  X  X rowdfunding X  which generally operate through online platforms (e.g., AngelList). Such shifts create new opportu-nities and provide additional impetus and scope for applying information retrieval techniques to this domain. This new domain is quite distinct from existing applications of rec-ommender systems (e.g., Movies) and, as such, represents unique challenges (see Section 2).
 Figure 1: Venture capital (VC) fund structure.

Figure 1 illustrates the typical structure of a VC fund. Al-though with some variations a typical VC fund is managed by a VC firm (legally referred to as a General Partnership) consisting of several investment partners. The VC fund is es-sentially an investment fund raised from various institutional investors (legally referred to as Limited Partners, not shown in our figure) such as pension funds, university endowments and family offices. Beyond fundraising the main responsi-bilities of investment partners (also referred to as General Partners) are sourcing investment opportunities, making in-vestment decisions and taking board membership to assist the management of investee private companies (also referred to as portfolio companies). We have access to a dataset of historical recorded venture financings (i.e., investments) by VCs and their constituent investment partners in private US companies.
Beyond screening prospective investment opportunities and assessing their  X  X it X  for a particular investor several other tasks in venture finance are reliant on some form of company classification such as identifying peers for competitor anal-ysis or comparables for valuation purposes. With advances in information retrieval, particularly text mining and relat-ed techniques, it is possible to envision an improved form of industry classification for describing the activities and rela-tionships of private companies. We are interested in resolv-ing the shortcomings of existing classification schemes (i.e., out-of-date, misrepresentation, misinterpretation). Further-more, an alternative representation of private companies ac-tivities (see Section 3.1) offers the potential for improved u-tility in applying techniques such as recommender systems. Through our empirical study we observe investment strate-gies, user-item interactions and attempt to improve upon existing industry classification schemes ultimately seeking to improve the top-N recommendation of investment oppor-tunities.
Our dataset was provided by Dow Jones VentureSource, a leading data provider to the venture capital industry, cour-tesy of Correlation Ventures, a venture capital firm who are pioneering the use of predictive analytics in order to better inform investment decision making. In total we have 21,610 investee private companies (i.e., items), 7,560 venture capi-tal firms and 32,710 investment partners (i.e., two distinct sets of users). In regards to investment relationships VC firms have 83,264 and investment partners have 82,897 rela-tionships with an average of 11.01 and 2.53 relations respec-tively. Our most prolific VC firm and investment partner have each, respectively, made 600+ and 60+ past invest-ments. On average an investee private company has distinct relationships with 3.85 VC firms and 4.41 investment part-ners.

Comparing the sparsity directly to other datasets, such as MovieLens1M [8] (95.5%) and Netflix (99.8%), Venture-Source is extremely sparse (over 99.9%) and long-tailed which will prove challenging for generating relevant recommenda-tions using existing IR techniques.

The VentureSource dataset includes historical venture fi-nancings in the US. Beyond investment relationships we also Figure 3: Number of investments against number of classes by user. Figure 4: Average pair-wise cosine similarity for VC and investment partner portfolios. have a principal component representation of the investee private companies X  descriptions and an industry hierarchy, shown in Figure 2, with three tiers (Group, Segment and Code). Group describes broad industry sectors (e.g.,  X  X nfor-mation Technology X ) and the subsequent tiers Segment (e.g.,  X  X oftware X ) and Code (e.g.,  X  X nterprise Software X ) provide further granularity. An initial analysis in Figure 3 shows the number of investments by VC firms and investment partners. Investments are plotted against number of distinct industry classes covered at different levels of the hierarchy. We see a concentration of investments in a small number of industry classes, particular for investment partners, even at the low-est level of the industry hierarchy (i.e., Code). This industry classification is similar to other public (e.g., SIC, NAICS) or private (e.g., Capital IQ) classification schemes. It offers a more sophisticated classification scheme compared to similar datasets, such as CrunchBase, which uses a simple category code (e.g.,  X  X ames, Video &amp; Entertainment X ,  X  X obile X ). As noted in studies on capital market research [4], despite the widespread use of industry classification schemes by academ-ic researchers, few studies directly test their efficacy. Our intention is to utilise VentureSource X  X  industry hierarchy to improve our recommendation performance.
We are interested in the decision making trade-offs made by investors (e.g., specialize or diversify) under conditions of uncertainty. In particular discovering whether VC firms and their individual investment partners specialize in terms of industries or sub-industries in which they make their invest-ments. Intuitively we would expect individual investment partners, and to a lesser extent VC firms, to specialize in their investment strategies.

Whilst there are is no strict limits an  X  X verage X  VC firm (i.e., $100 million fund size) will have a small number (i.e., less than 10) of investment partners who will take board seats in the companies in which they chose to make invest-ments. These individual investments constitute the VC fir-m X  X  overall portfolio of investments, which we would, again only intuitively, expect to be specialized to some degree, at least beyond a random portfolio of private companies. For a portfolio P of n companies we calculate n ( n  X  1) / 2 similarity (a) User-item interaction difference between venture capital firms (VC) and investment partners (P). measures aggregated using an average pair-wise similarity s across the portfolio, based upon the principal components derived from company descriptions. Figure 4 shows the dis-tribution of average pair-wise cosine similarity s for port-folios across all VC firms and all investment partners. The positively skewed distributions, suggest the dominant invest-ment strategies are in favour of specialization, especially for investment partners. This provides the motivation for us-ing the industry hierarchy in generating relevant investment opportunity recommendations for VC firms and investment partners.
We conducted an investigation of the user-item interac-tion data from VentureSource, observing both the VC firm and investment partner interactions with investee private companies. In Figure 5(a), we show histograms with log-log and semi-log of the user and item popularity distributions identifying some interesting characteristics.

For the VC firm and investment partner datasets, the distributions appear to be quite distinct. Observing Fig-ure 5(a), in relation to item popularity, the VC firms follow an exponential distribution (upper second panel), while the investment partners follow a power-law (lower first panel). On the contrary, for user popularity, the VC firms follow a power-law (upper third panel) and investment partners follow an exponential distribution (lower fourth panel).
From this observation we can see that the two datasets have some fundamental differences in their network proper-ties, which may coincide with the algorithm performances on the two datasets. From a complex network perspective, the power-law distribution represents the existence of very active VCs, which is referred to as  X  X he fat tail effect X  [1]. In comparison, the exponential distributions on the investee private companies and the investment partner sides indicate that there is no such extreme properties. Since each investee private company or individual partner cannot be involved in such a large number of investment relationships.

In order to explain such network properties, specifically from the VC firm perspective, we ran a simulation (see Fig-ure 5(b)). For items (upper two panels), it displays an ex-ponential distribution. The rule is that the probability that one item gathers one more connection is proportional to it-s current degree. For users (lower two panels), it displays a power-law distribution. The rule is that the probability that one user creates one more connection is proportional to the second order of its current degree. Hence, the effect that the  X  X ich get richer X  is even greater in approximating the power-law distribution (i.e., for the VC firm).
In the simulation experiment, if we sample the user/item by their current degrees, both sides will have exponential distributions. In order to model the power-law distribution, we need to be more biased on the node degrees. As a re-sult, when we sample one side by a quadratic form of the nodes X  current degree, we can approximate the power-law. An explanation might be that active VC firms (i.e., those that making more investments) become more popular and well known subsequently receiving more investment oppor-tunities and therefore making more investments. From the perspective of the VC firm, if VC firm A has two times as many investments as VC firm B, then A is more than two times popular than B, which makes the investment popular-ity of VC firms a power-law distribution.
Given the extreme sparsity of collaborative data for our particular use case, with investors making only a small num-ber of investments and with limited co-investment, content-based recommender systems utilising industry hierarchy in-formation seem appropriate. Equipped with industry hierar-chy information, our recommendation techniques have been developed (in Section 3.2). We are interested in improving the accuracy and relevance of top-N recommendations in our particular use case but also in evaluating the utility of alternative industry classification schemes (in Section 3.1).
Our particular focus is around industry assignment or how companies are assigned to different industry classes (or cat-egories). An inherent limitation of existing industry clas-sification schemes means companies must be fully assigned to a single industry class (i.e., at each tier of the industry hierarchy). There is no notion by which a company may be assigned to more than one single class (i.e., multiple assign-ment). This is a common limitation amongst several widely adopted industry classification schemes (e.g., CrunchBase) not solely VentureSource.

In order to generate multiple category information for each investee private company, we propose a supervised learn-ing approach whereby we are given a description of a doc-ument (i.e., private company descriptions) and a fixed set of labels (i.e., industry classes). Through implementing var-ious learning methods (Na  X   X ve Bayes 1 , SVM, Random For-est) we learn a classification function for each industry class for all investee private companies with textual description-s (i.e., multi-label classification). This process allows us to
Na  X   X ve Bayes offered superior classification accuracy. classify new companies against an existing scheme (e.g., Ven-tureSource) but also to generate novel classification schemes (e.g., multiple assignment). By using the confidence level of the classifier for each industry class we can simply define a threshold confidence level (e.g., 0.5) and we can generate the multiple class assignment, essentially industry  X  X ags X .
The recommendation models we use are based on the item-based k -Nearest Neighbor (kNN) [5]. The reason for choosing item-based neighborhood models is because (i) it is still the most frequently used recommendation method in industry applications; (ii) it naturally incorporates the com-pany attributes such as industry hierarchy, which are nor-mally used in traditional screening methods; (iii) we have also tried latent factor models but they appear not as ef-fective as the item-based models, which might be caused by the extreme sparsity and unique user-item interaction prop-erties.

The key component in item-based models is the item-item similarity function. Specifically, we have two basic settings of the item-item similarity. The first one is based on the cosine similarity of the industry hierarchy of the companies (i.e., content-based). The second one is based on the overlap of the VC firms or investment partners of investee private companies (i.e., collaborative filtering). We develop various item-based models based on these two item-item similarity functions. Also, we leverage the linear ensemble method [14] to combine the advantages of the different models.
VentureSource is chosen as the test dataset in our ex-periment. We use the MyMediaLite recommender system library [7] to implement a standard item-based k -Nearest Neighbor collaborative filtering ( CF ) approach and then we incorporate both existing ( Group , Segment , Code ) and gen-erated ( Multi ) item attributes (i.e., industry hierarchy) in order to improve our performance. Our results are bench-marked against the performance of a random recommender system. In order to evaluate the performance of our rec-ommendation model we calculate the following commonly used evaluation metrics: area under the curve (AUC), mean average precision (MAP) and precision (Prec@ N ).
The overall results of the compared algorithms are shown in Table 1 for VC firms and Table 2 for investment partner-s. From our results we make the following observations: (i) All the algorithms obtain improved performance against the baseline Random , which indicates the efficacy of our item-based and ensemble models. (ii) The general performance on AUC is not as satisfactory as traditional CF datasets, such as 0.92 on Netflix [11], which indicates the difficulty of performing traditional CF algorithms on this investment opportunity recommendation task. (iii) The recommenda-tion performance is improved by introducing the existing in-dustry hierarchy information ( Group , Segment , Code ). (iv) By combining the item-based kNN CF and industry Code information using the linear ensemble method, we get our empirical best model on the AUC measure. (v) Initially the multiple industry assignment ( Multi ) leads to some addi-tional improvement, however, it seemingly has no significant impact on the ensemble methods. (vi) The values of MAP and precision are quite low, which is most likely due to the extreme sparsity of the VentureSource dataset.

In this paper we demonstrate the efficacy of recommenda-tion techniques in relation to the novel application domain of venture finance. Through our venture finance data analysis, we discover fundamental differences in user-item interaction patterns between VC firms and their individual investment partners. Our methodology takes advantage of our access to venture financing data to improve the investment opportu-nity recommendation quality on the VentureSource dataset.
In future work, we plan to take more investment factors into consideration, such as the investment amount, stage and location. In addition, we hope to conduct a user study within such a venture finance scenario to further assess the real-world applicability of our models beyond offline evalu-ation metrics.
