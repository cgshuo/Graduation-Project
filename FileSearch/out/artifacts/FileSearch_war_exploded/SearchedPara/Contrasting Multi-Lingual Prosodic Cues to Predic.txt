 Culture-specific aspects of speech and nonverbal be-havior enable creation and maintenance of a sense of rapport. Rapport is important because it is known to enhance goal-directed interactions and also to pro-mote learning. Previous work has identified cross-cultural differences in a variety of behaviors, for example, nodding (Maynard, 1990), facial expres-sion (Matsumoto et al., 2005), gaze (Watson, 1970), cues to vocal back-channel (Ward and Tsukuhara, 2000; Ward and Al Bayyari, 2007; Rivera and Ward, 2007), nonverbal back-channel (Bertrand et al., 2007)), and coverbal gesturing (Kendon, 2004).
Here we focus on the automatic prediction of lis-tener verbal feedback in dyadic unrehearsed story-telling to elucidate the similarities and differences in three language/cultural groups: Iraqi Arabic-, Mexican Spanish-, and American English-speaking cultures. (Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal, 1990) identified coordination, along with positive emo-tion and mutual attention, as a key element of in-teractional rapport. In the verbal channel, this co-ordination manifests in the timing of contributions from the conversational participants, through turn-taking and back-channels. (Duncan, 1972) pro-posed an analysis of turn-taking as rule-governed, supported by a range of prosodic and non-verbal cues. Several computational approaches have inves-tigated prosodic and verbal cues to these phenom-ena. (Shriberg et al., 2001) found that prosodic cues could aid in the identification of jump-in points in multi-party meetings. (Cathcart et al., 2003) em-ployed features such as pause duration and part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences for back-channel pre-diction. (Gravano and Hirschberg, 2009) investi-gated back-channel-inviting cues in task-oriented di-alog, identifying increases in pitch and intensity as well as certain POS patterns as key contributors. In multi-lingual comparisons, (Ward and Tsukuhara, 2000; Ward and Al Bayyari, 2007; Rivera and Ward, 2007) found pitch patterns, including periods of low pitch or drops in pitch, to be associated with elic-iting back-channels across Japanese, English, Ara-bic, and Spanish. (Herrera et al., 2010) collected a corpus of multi-party interactions among American English, Mexican Spanish, and Arabic speakers to investigate cross-cultural differences in proxemics, gaze, and turn-taking. (Levow et al., 2010) identi-fied contrasts in narrative length and rate of verbal feedback in recordings of American English-, Mexi-can Spanish-, and Iraqi Arabic-speaking dyads. This work also identified reductions in pitch and intensity associated with instances of verbal feedback as com-mon, but not uniform, across these groups. To enable a more controlled comparison of listener behavior, we collected a multi-modal dyadic corpus of unrehearsed story-telling. We audio-and video-recorded pairs of individuals who were close ac-quaintances or family members with, we assumed, well-established rapport. One participant viewed a six minute film, the  X  X ear Film X  (Chafe, 1975), de-veloped for language-independent elicitation. In the role of Speaker, this participant then related the story to the active and engaged Listener, who understood that they would need to retell the story themselves later. We have collected 114 elicitations: 45 Arabic, 32 Mexican Spanish, and 37 American English.
All recordings have been fully transcribed and time-aligned to the audio using a semi-automated procedure. We convert an initial manual coarse tran-scription at the phrase level to a full word and phone alignment using CUSonic (Pellom et al., 2001), ap-plying its language porting functionality to Spanish and Arabic. In addition, word and phrase level En-glish glosses were manually created for the Span-ish and Arabic data. Manual annotation of a broad range of nonverbal cues, including gaze, blink, head nod and tilt, fidget, and coverbal gestures, is under-way. For the experiments presented in the remainder of this paper, we employ a set of 45 vetted dyads, 15 in each language.

Analysis of cross-cultural differences in narrative length, rate of listener verbal contributions, and the use of pitch and intensity in eliciting listener vocal-izations appears in (Levow et al., 2010). That work found that the American English-speaking dyads produced significantly longer narratives than the other language/cultural groups, while Arabic listen-ers provided a significantly higher rate of verbal con-tributions than those in the other groups. Finally, all three groups exhibited significantly lower speaker pitch preceding listener verbal feedback than in other contexts, while only English and Spanish ex-hibited significant reductions in intensity. The cur-rent paper aims to extend and enhance these find-ings by exploring automatic recognition of speaker prosodic contexts associated with listener verbal feedback. Predicting verbal feedback in dyadic rapport in di-verse language/cultural groups presents a number of challenges. In addition to the cross-linguistic, cross-cultural differences which are the focus of our study, it is also clear that there are substantial inter-speaker differences in verbal feedback, both in frequency and, we expect, in signalling. Furthermore, while the rate of verbal feedback differs across language and speaker, it is, overall, a relatively infrequent phenomenon, occurring in as little as zero percent of pausal intervals for some dyads and only at an av-erage of 13-30% of pausal intervals across the three languages. As a result, the substantial class imbal-ance and relative sparsity of listener verbal feedback present challenges for data-driven machine learn-ing methods. Finally, as prior researchers have ob-served, provision of verbal feedback can be viewed as optional. The presence of feedback, we assume, indicates the presence of a suitable context; the ab-sence of feedback, however, does not guarantee that feedback would have been inappropriate, only that the conversant did not provide it.

We address each of these issues in our experi-mental process. We employ a leave-one-dyad-out cross-validation framework that allows us to deter-mine overall accuracy while highlighting the differ-ent characteristics of the dyads. We employ and evaluate both an oversampling technique (Chawla et al., 2002) and class weighting to compensate for class imbalance. Finally, we tune our classification for the recognition of the feedback class. We define a Speaker pausal region as an interval in the Speaker X  X  channel annotated with a contiguous span of silence and/or non-speech sounds. These Speaker pausal regions are tagged as  X  X eedback (FB) X  if the participant in the Listener role initi-ates verbal feedback during that interval and as  X  X o Feedback (NoFB) X  if the Listener does not. We aim to characterize and automatically classify each such 0.30 (0.21) 0.152 (0.10) 0.136 (0.12) region. We group the dyads by language/cultural group to contrast the prosodic characteristics of the speech that elicit listener feedback and to assess the effectiveness of these prosodic cues for classifica-tion. The proportion of regions with listener feed-back for each language appears in Table 1. 4.1 Feature Extraction For each Speaker pausal region, we extract fea-tures from the Speaker X  X  words immediately preced-ing and following the non-speech interval, as well as computing differences between some of these measures. We extract a set of 39 prosodic fea-tures motivated by (Shriberg et al., 2001), using Praat X  X  (Boersma, 2001)  X  X o Pitch... X  and  X  X o In-tensity... X . All durational measures and word posi-tions are based on the semi-automatic alignment de-scribed above. All measures are log-scaled and z-score normalized per speaker. The full feature set appears in Table 2. 4.2 Classification and Analysis For classification, we employ Support Vector Ma-chines (SVM), using the LibSVM implementation (C-C.Cheng and Lin, 2001) with an RBF kernel. For each language/cultural group, we perform  X  X eave-one-dyad-out X  cross-validation based on F-measure as implemented in that toolkit. For each fold, train-ing on 14 dyads and testing on the last, we determine not only accuracy but also the weight-based ranking of each feature described above.
 Managing Class Imbalance Since listener verbal feedback occurs in only 14-30% of candidate posi-tions, classification often predicts only the majority  X  X oFB X  class. To compensate for this imbalance, we apply two strategies: reweighting and oversampling. We explore increasing the weight on the minority class in the classifier by a factor of two or four. We also apply SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2002) oversam-pling to double or quadruple the number of minority class training instances. SMOTE oversampling cre-ates new synthetic minority class instances by iden-tifying k =3 nearest neighbors and inducing a new instance by taking the difference between a sample and its neighbor, multiplying by a factor between 0 and 1, and adding that value to the original instance. Table 4 presents the classification accuracy for dis-tinguishing FB and NoFB contexts. We present the overall class distribution for each language. We then contrast the minority FB class and overall accuracy under each of three weighting and oversampling set-tings. The second row has no weighting or over-sampling; the third has no weighting with quadru-ple oversampling on all folds, a setting in which the largest number of Arabic dyads achieves their best performance. The last row indicates the oracle per-formance when the best weighting and oversampling setting is chosen for each fold.

We find that the use of reweighting and over-sampling dramatically improves the recognition of the minority class, with only small reductions in overall accuracy of 3-7%. Under a uniform set-ting of quadruple oversampling and no reweight-ing, the number of correctly recognized Arabic and English FB samples nearly triples, while the num-ber of Spanish FB samples doubles. We further see that if we can dynamically select the optimal training settings, we can achieve even greater im-provements. Here the number of correctly recog-nized FB examples increases between 3-(Spanish) and 6-fold (Arabic) with only a reduction of 1-4% in overall accuracy. These accuracy levels corre-spond to recognizing between 38% (English, Span-ish) and 73% (Arabic) of the FB instances. Even un-der these tuned conditions, the sparseness and vari-ability of the English and Spanish data continue to present challenges.

Finally, Table 3 illustrates the impact of the full range of reweighting and oversampling conditions. Each cell indicates the number of folds in each of Arabic, English, and Spanish respectively, for which that training condition yields the highest accuracy. We can see that the different dyads achieve optimal results under a wide range of training conditions. Feature Type Description Feature IDs
Intensity Maximum, minimum, mean pre imax, pre imin, pre imean Baseline 53 (950) 23 (2167) 23 (1066) S=2, W=1 145 (878) 67 (2120) 47 (1023) To investigate the cross-language variation in speaker cues eliciting listener verbal feedback, we conduct a feature analysis. Table 5 presents the features with highest average weight for each lan-guage assigned by the classifier across folds, as well as those distinctive features highly ranked for only one language.

We find that the Arabic dyads make extensive and distinctive use of pitch in cuing verbal feed-back, from both preceding and following words, while placing little weight on other feature types. In contrast, both English and Spanish dyads exploit both pitch and intensity features from surrounding words. Spanish alone makes significant use of both vocalic and pause duration. We also observe that, al-though there is substantial variation in feature rank-ing across speakers, the highly ranked features are robustly employed across almost all folds. Because of the size of our data set, it may be pre-mature to draw firm conclusion about differences between these three language groups based on this analysis. The SVM weighting and SMOTE over-sampling strategy discussed here is promising for improving recognition on imbalanced class data. This strategy substantially improves the prediction

The resulting feature ranking also provides insight into the contrasts in the use of prosodic cues among these language cultural groups, while highlighting the widespread, robust use of pitch features.

In future research, we would like to extend our work to exploit sequential learning frameworks to predict verbal feedback. We also plan to explore the fusion of multi-modal features to enhance recogni-tion and increase our understanding of multi-modal rapport behavior. We will also work to analyze how quickly people can establish rapport, as the short du-ration of our Spanish dyads poses substantial chal-lenges.
