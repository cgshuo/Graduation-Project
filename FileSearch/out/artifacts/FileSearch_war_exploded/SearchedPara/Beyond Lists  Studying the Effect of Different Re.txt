 Recommendation Systems have been studied from several perspectives over the last twenty years  X  X rediction accuracy, algorithmic scalability, knowledge sources, types of recommended items and tasks, eval uation methods, etc. -but one area that has not been deeply investigated is the effect of different visualizations and their interacti on with personal traits on users X  evaluation of the recommended items. In this paper, I survey visual approaches that go beyond presenting the recommended items as a textual list or as annotations in context. I also review related literature from recommendations X  explanations. In this thesis, I aim to understand how diffe rent visualizations and some personal traits might influence users X  assessment of recommended items, particularly in domains where multidimensional data or contextual constraints are involved. I present the prototype of 2 recommendation visualizations and then briefly propose the research approach of this investigation. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Filtering.

Recommendation Systems (RS) aim to provide users relevant items from a crowded information space. RS have become popular commercially and as a research field in the latest 10 years as evidenced by online contests such as the Netflix Prize, and by the interest in related conferences like ACM RecSys. On the research field, among the several issues that has been investigated over the years  X  X rediction accuracy, algorithmic scalability, knowledge sources, types of recommended items and visualizations and their interacti on with personal traits over users X  preference on recommended items has been studied but not at the same extent as the aforementioned issues. One can identify three main reasons that make this an important area of research: a) Recommendation Transparency : Explaining how the recommendations were generated to RS users has shown to have a positive effect in users X  trust in th e RS [1], and visualizations of recommendations can provide better ways than textual lists to comprehend how recommendations were generated. b) Multivariate Data : most current state-of-the-art recommender systems rely not only on one dimension of user feedback  X  X uch as user ratings--but also on implicit feedback, time, location, and many other forms of contextual information. In addition, some domains such as Event R ecommendations pose additional constraints, such as the limited life time of the items. Visualizing recommendations beyond textual lists might facilitate incorporating several dimensions [2] when presented to users to make sense of the recommendations. c) The Effect of Personal Traits : Considering human traits as factors affecting how users evaluate recommendations has been studied [3, 4], but not their interaction with rich visualizations as those implemented in [5-7]. In this research proposal, I aim to bridge the lack of investigation on the effects of rich visualizations, interface interactions and some traits of users upon how users X  evaluate recommendations: users X  perceived relevance, novelty and serendipity, users X  satisfaction, and users X  trust on the recommendation process. In section 2, I survey related work about visualizing and explaining recommendations. Then, in section 3, I introduce two systems that will be used to test the influen ce of different visualizations. In section 4 I briefly describe my re search plan, and in section 5 I summarize the challenges and expectations of this research proposal. Research on visualizing recommenda tions beyond a textual list or as annotation in context [8] is not abundant. Some of these studies have shown the positive effect on us er satisfaction of visualizing recommendations and allowing richer interaction [5-7, 9]. PeerChooser [5] was introduced by O X  X onovan et al. to show movie recommendations interactively. The active user was depicted as the center node in an ego-network, and PeerChooser X  X  users could explore their nearest neighbors, movie genres, and check their recommendions in different ways. The recommended movies were pres ented as top-N, clusters and rating predictions on user-selected items. A study with 25 users that compared four recommendation methods showed that adding user interaction significantly improved the system X  X  rating predition and users X  satisfaction. On a diffe rent domain, Gotz and Wen [9] developed an approach called Behavior-Driven Visualization Recommendation (BDVR), by which th ey detect patterns of user behavior in a data analysis sy stem called HARVEST. Based on the detected behavioral pattern s, HARVEST recommend other visualizations to analyze the data. A user study with 20 users, that considered two different tasks per user on three possible scenarios, showed that using the BDVR on HARVEST decreased the average time needed to complete the tasks and also the error rate, compared to those users that were assigned to the group without BDVR support. Despite its novel approach, BDVR innovates in the way that recommendations are identified based on user behavior, rather than the way in which the recommendations are presented to the user  X  X  link blinking that suggest a nother way to analize the data to the user. Another interesting work us ing visualizations to show user recommendations is SmallWorlds [6 ], a visual recommender system implemented as a Facebook applicati on that utilizes the profiles of the active user and her connections to generate recommendations. A user study allows the authors of SmallWorlds sustaining that system X  X  transparency and interface interaction increases user satisfaction, and even under the constraints of the Facebook API  X  that allows to get information only from the user X  X  direct connections X  the recommendations enhanced by pre-existing friends X  information boost the users X  satisfaction on recommendation predictions. The main limitation of this study is the assessment based only on user pr eferences of movies, although Facebook profiles provides various other types of items for recommendation. More recently, in the music domain, Gou et al. present SFViz [7], a sunburst visua lization to allow users exploring and finding friends interactively under a context of interest. Their visualization and iteraction method is novel, and although they introiduce a case study using the social network and tags of a last.fm dataset, no user study is presented to empirically assess their design. The second related area of research is explaining recommendations to users and how visualizations he lp increasing users X  trust in the system and overall user satisfaction. Zhao et al. [10] present Pharos, a content-centric system able to recommend items, people and communities. They try to tackle the cold-start problem and also explain the recommendations by visu alizing a social map with terms organized in latent communities. A within subjects study with ten users shows that Pharos helped the subjects to complete exploratory tasks faster and better than BlogCentral, an existent tool. Although user knowledge and tasks were considered and they didn X  X  affect the significant differences between Pharos and BlogCentral, the small amount of subjects calls for a larger user study to generalize these personalization. The social map displayed the same communities and terms to every user, and user s X  feedback suggests adding this feature in an future version. Zhang et al. [11] go beyond textual explanation by presenting a visual interface for a critiquing-based RS. In an e-commerce system, they present various critiques by a set of meaningful icons, and thei r results show how the visual presentation and the aided interaction improve the shopping experience of the users. However, the visualizations are not rich visualizations as those presented in [5-7]. The main limitation of the aforem entioned studies, excepting Pharos [10], is the absence of users X  traits in the analysis of factors interacting with visualizations on users X  perceived relevance of the recommendations. The importance of users X  traits on recommendation peformance is shown in [3, 4]. Knijnenburg et al. [3], show that the users X  domain knowledge is a factor influencing what kind of interaction method they prefer in an energy-saving RS. Tkalcic et al. [4] show how aff ective parameters, based on users X  emotive responses, im prove the performance of a recommender system. These two studies do not negl ect user traits but they do not consider rich visualizations (suc h as ego-network graphs, sunburst plots, circle packs, etc.) in their evaluations. Building on the results of these artic les, I will consider the users X  domain knowledge and the type of visualization as the main independent factors of my investigation. I plan to test the effect of rich recommendation visualizations and their possible interaction with user X  X  domain knowledge in two systems developed in the PAWS lab 1 at the University of Pittsburgh: Conference Navigator and CoMeT (Collaborative Management of Talks). http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/ Conference Navigator 2 , shown in Figure 1.a), is a system which supports attendees at academic conferences. It provides usual information about a conference such as the list of papers with authors and abstract, the schedule of the conference, details of each talk and in some occasions the list of attendees. Conference Navigator allows users scheduling the talks they are interested to attend, and in a ddition, it allows users connecting each other as followed/follower, and also as reciprocal connections. Furthermore, Conf erence Navigator has useful features that present aggregated users X  behavior, such as the ranking of the most scheduled papers, the most active contributors, the institutions of the most active contributors, a cloud of the tags which users have attached to papers, and a feature similar to Amazon.co m about papers:  X  X eople who scheduled paper X also sche duled paper Y X . Conference Navigator also provides a personalized textual list of recommended talk constructe d upon content and tag-based algorithms. Since the talks are part of a larger event, the conference, they can be classified inside days or sessions. Moreover, talks present characteristics such as popularity or whether they are recommended that make them prone to be presented in a richer visualization than a list. CoMeT 3 , shown in Figure 1.b), stands for Collaborative Management of Talks. It is a system that aggregates information about open academic lectures and talks in the Pittsburgh area, mainly at the University of Pittsburgh and at Carnegie Mellon University. Some of the talks are manually entered to the system by users and the rest are automatically collected by web crawlers. CoMeT provides socially aggregat ed data about the talks: how many people has viewed, bookmarked and e-mailed each one. CoMeT features the most popular talks of each day in its homepage, but it also provides di fferent ways to navigate and search throughout all the talks available. Although some talks are entered as isolated events, they us ually belong to series of talks or to special department events, wh at makes them good candidates to be grouped and classified under se veral categories. The social activity associated to talks, and their temporal restrictions, makes http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/cn3/ http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/comet/ them good candidates to be recommended and presented in visualization richer than lists. Currently, CoMeT provides users a textual list of recommended talks by e-mail once per week. Choosing a set of layouts or visual structures to represent multivariate data that convey recommendations is a difficult task. However, I first decided choosing only two types of visualizations given the number of users that are usually active in our systems and the statistical power that we might need to find a significant effect in case that one exists, wh ich is around 30 users. Under this circumstance, the ego-network s eems a good model to pick since it has been already studied but not under the effects that I have considered, what would make our results more comparable with previous research. On the other hand, I decided choosing a circle pack layout (also called nested circle layout) since it has been shown to be an efficient way to represent a tree structure [12], and in this case I want to represent multivariate hierarchical data. A conference program where days, se ssions and papers form a tree is a good example of this kind of st ructure. Finally, it is important noticing that I am undertaking an incremental empirical approach, where I plan testing these visualizations in two conferences during the summer of 2012. Dependi ng on the results, I might test other visualizations in conferences at the beginning of 2013. Considering a layout that shows concentric circles helps visualizing a tree, which is one of the possible ways to structure the contents of a conference consecutively as days, sessions and talks. Figure 2.a) shows a prototype of talk recommendation for Conference Navigator, where the largest circle represents the conference, the largest circles inside represent days, and inside them, sessions and talks. The talk s which the user has scheduled to attend are presented with orange color, the ones not scheduled with white, and the recommended talks with green. The different size of the recommended talks (the green circles) represent their recommendations score: the larger the recommendation score, the larger the circle. Planned interaction will allow the users clicking on a circle and obtaining additional information of the day, session or talk clicked on. Furtherm ore, they will be able to rate the recommended talks and we will track user interactions with the system. This model has been already explored in [5, 6] and a prototype implemented in Conference Naviga tor is shown in Figure 2.b). The active user will be represen ted as the central node in a network, and every node in the network will be at most 3 hops away from the central user. The other nodes will represent neighbors, articles, and in some cases users X  tags  X  X epending on the method used to provide the recommendations: content-based or tag-based. In the user study, I plan comparing the 2 aforementioned layouts (Circle Pack and Ego-Networ k) with a textual list of recommendation, and a recommendation list enhanced with facets in both Conference Navigator and CoMeT. The reason for comparing with a faceted list comes for the advice given by Hearst in [11], where faceted lists provide support to present multivariate data beyond lists, that is difficult to overcome by other richer visualizations in terms of user performance to complete search tasks. The proposal presented in this paper is ongoing work, in an early stage of development, but it highlights its importance and introduces the research a nd initial evaluation plan. I have outlined the reasons, surveyed the related work, and presented an initial description of the approach to investigate the recommendations. First, regarding the reasons, there is a lack of research that integrates the influence of different visualizations, interactions and user traits in recommender systems. Moreover, the need of transparency in recommendations, the multivariate nature of the data, and the lack of studies incorporating the effect of personal traits makes this propos al and important research goal. The related work highlights the positive effect of different interaction on user satisfaction, but it presents limitations. They are restricted to recommend movies [5, 6] X  X n area already deeply investigated whose results cannot be generalized to other fields, such as event recommendations--, their recommendation visualizations are not rich in interaction [9], their user studies have few users [10] or they completely lack a user study [7]. The expected number of subjects for the study in Conference Navigator and CoMeT is around 20 and 30. However, a power analysis is necessary to establish the minimum number of users needed to detect an effect in cas e it exists. This analysis will be conducted in the next stage of this research. I appreciate the feedback provided by Roman Bednarik to clarify some terms that might lead to confusion, and some ideas to describe better the purpose of this research.
