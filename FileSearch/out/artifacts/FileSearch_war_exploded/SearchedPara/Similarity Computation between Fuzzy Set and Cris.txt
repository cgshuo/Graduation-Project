That is where propose similarity measure to overcome the drawbacks of existing similarity: where ** (, ) denoted by 1 if 0 3.2 Similarity Measure with Distance Function propose the following theorem as the similarity measure. and ( , ) ( , ) CC dAB dA B = , then is the similarity measure between set A and set B . then is also a similarity measure. Proofs of Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 are found in [10]. 
From Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 we can compute the degree of similarity between fuzzy set B into crisp set near A . Similarly, are found in [6]. As mentioned before, similarity measures based on fuzzy number have to depend on obtained through fuzzy number. Chen and Chen compute the degree of similarity as follows membership function pairs like Fig. 1. general types of fuzzy membership functions. funded by KRF(Korea Research Foundation).
