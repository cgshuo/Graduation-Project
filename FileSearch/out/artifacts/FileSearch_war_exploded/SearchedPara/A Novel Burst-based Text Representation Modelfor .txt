 Mining retrospective events (Yang et al., 1998; Fung et al., 2007; Allan et al., 2000) has been quite an im-portant research topic in text mining. One standard way for that is to cluster news articles as events by following a two-step approach (Yang et al., 1998): 1) represent document as vectors and calculate simi-larities between documents; 2) run the clustering al-gorithm to obtain document clusters as events. 1 Un-derlying text representation often plays a critical role in this approach, especially for long text streams. In this paper, our focus is to study how to represent temporal documents effectively for event detection. Classical text representation methods, i.e., Vector Space Model (VSM), have a few shortcomings when dealing with temporal documents. The major one is that it maps one dimension to one term, which com-pletely ignores temporal information, and therefore VSM can never capture the evolving trends in text streams. See the example in Figure 1, D 1 and D 2 may have a high similarity based on VSM due to the presence of some general terms (e.g.,  X  X lection X ) re-lated to U.S. presidential election, although general terms correspond to events in different periods (i.e., November 2004 and November 2008). Temporal information has to be taken into consideration for event detection. Another important issue is scala-bility, with the increasing of the number in the text stream, the size of the vocabulary, i.e., the number of dimensions in VSM, can be very large, which re-quires a considerable amount of space for storage and time for downstream processing.

To address these difficulties, in this paper, we pro-pose a burst based text representation method for scalable event detection. The major novelty is to nat-urally incorporate temporal information into dimen-sions themselves instead of using external time de-caying functions (Yang et al., 1998). We instantiate this idea by using bursty features as basic representa-tion units of documents. In this paper, bursty feature refers to a sudden surge of the frequency of a single term in a text stream, and it is represented as the term itself together with the time interval during which the burst takes place. For example, (Olympic, Aug-08-2008, Aug-24-2008) 2 can be regarded as a bursty feature. We also call the term in a bursty feature its bursty term. In our model, each dimen-sion corresponds to a bursty feature, which contains both temporal and semantic information. Bursty fea-tures capture and reflect the evolving topic trends, which can be learnt by searching surge patterns in stream data (Kleinberg, 2003). Built on bursty fea-tures, our representation model can well adapt to text streams with complex trends, and therefore provides a more reasonable temporal document representa-tion. We further propose a split-cluster-merge algo-rithm to generate clusters as events. This algorithm can run a mutli-thread mode to speed up processing.
Our contribution can be summarized as two as-pects: 1) we propose a novel burst-based text rep-resentation model, to our best knowledge, it is the first work which explicitly incorporates temporal in-formation into dimensions themselves; 2) we test this representation model via scalable event detec-tion task on a very large news corpus, and extensive experiments show the proposed methods are both ef-fective and efficient. In this section, we describe the proposed burst-based text representation model, denoted as BurstVSM . In BurstVSM, each document is represented as one vector as in VSM, while the major novelty is that one dimension is mapped to one bursty feature instead of one term. In this paper, we define a bursty fea-ture f as a triplet ( w f ,t f s ,t f e ) , where w is the bursty term and t s and t e are the start and end timestamps of the bursty interval (period). Before introducting BurstVSM, we first discuss how to identify bursty features from text streams. 2.1 Burst Detection Algorithm We follow the batch mode two-state automaton method from (Kleinberg, 2003) for bursty feature detection. 3 In this model, a stream of documents containing a term w are assumed to be generated from a two-state automaton with a low frequency state q 0 and a high frequency state q 1 . Each state has its own emission rate ( p 0 and p 1 respectively), and there is a probability for changing state. If an interval of high states appears in the optimal state sequence of some term, this term together with this interval is detected as a bursty feature. To obtain all bursty features in text streams, we can perform burst detection on each term in the vocabulary. In-stead of using a fixed p 0 and p 1 in (Kleinberg, 2003), by following the moving average method (Vlachos et al., 2004) ,we parameterize p 0 and p 1 with the time index for each batch, formally, we have p 0 ( t ) and p 1 ( t ) for the t th batch. Given a term w , we use a sliding window of length L to estimate p 0 ( t ) and p 1 ( t ) for the t th batch as follows: p 0 ( t )= N j are w  X  X  document frequency and the total num-ber of documents in j th batch respectively. s is a scaling factor lager than 1.0, indicating state q 1 has a faster rate, and it is empirically set as 1.5. W t is a time interval [max( t  X  L/ 2 , 0) , min( t + L/ 2 ,N )] , and the length of moving window L is set as 180 days. All the other parts remain the same as in (Kleinberg, 2003). Our detection method is denoted as TVBurst . 2.2 Burst based text representation models We apply TVBurst to all the terms in our vocabu-lary to identify a set of bursty features, denoted as B . Given B , a document d i ( t ) with timestamp t is represented as a vector of weights in bursty feature dimensions :
We define the j th weight of d i as follows
When the timestamp of d i is in the bursty inter-val of B j and contains bursty term w B j , we set up the weight using common used tf-idf method. In BurstVSM, each dimension is mapped to one bursty feature, and it considers both semantic and temporal information. One dimension is active only when the document falls in the corresponding bursty interval. Usually, a document vector in BurstVSM has only a few non-zero entries, which makes computation of document similarities more efficient in large datasets compared with traditional VSM.

The most related work to ours is the boostVSM introduced by (He et al., 2007b), it proposes to weight different term dimensions with correspond-ing bursty scores. However, it is still based on term dimensions and fails to deal with terms with mul-tiple bursts. Suppose that we are dealing with a text collection related with U.S. presidential elec-tions, Fig. 2 show sample dimensions for these three methods. In BurstVSM, one term with multiple bursts will be naturally mapped to different dimen-sions. For example, two bursty features ( presiden-tial, Nov., 2004) and ( presidential, Nov., 2008 ) cor-respond to different dimensions in BurstVSM, while VSM and boostVSM cannot capture such temporal differences. Some methods try to design time de-caying functions (Yang et al., 1998), which decay the similarity with the increasing of time gap be-tween two documents. However, it requires efforts for function selection and parameters tuning. We summarize these discussions in Table 1. In this section, we discuss how to cluster documents as events. Since each document can be represented as a burst-based vector, we use cosine function to compute document similarities. Due to the large size of our news corpus, it is infeasible to cluster all the documents straightforward. We develop a heuristic clustering algorithm for event detection, denoted as split-cluster-merge , which includes three main steps, namely split, cluster and merge. The idea is that we first split the dataset into small parts, then cluster the documents of each part independently and finally merge similar clusters from two consecutive parts. In our dataset, we find that most events last no more than one month, so we split the dataset into parts by months. After splitting, clustering can run in paral-lel for different parts (we use CLUTO 4 as the cluster-ing tool), which significantly reduces total time cost. For merge , we merge clusters in consecutive months with an empirical threshold of 0.5. The final clusters are returned as identified events. 4.1 Experiment Setup We used a subset of 68 millon deduplicated timestamped web pages generated from this archive (Huang et al., 2008). Since our major focus is to detect events from news articles, we only keep the web pages with keyword  X  X ews X  in URL field. The final collection contains 11 , 218 , 581 articles with total 1 , 730 , 984 , 304 tokens ranging from 2000 to 2009. We run all the experiments on a 64-bit linux server with four Quad-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Pro-cessors and 64GB of RAM. For split-cluster-merge algorithm, we implement the cluster step in a multi-thread mode, so that different parts can be processed in parallel. 4.2 Construction of test collection We manually construct the test collection for event detection. To examine the effectiveness of event de-tection methods in different grains, we consider two type of events in terms of the number of relevant documents, namely significant events and moder-ate events. A significant event is required to have at least 300 relevant docs, and a moderate event is required to have 10  X  100 relevant docs. 14 grad-uate students are invited to generate the test collec-tion, starting with a list of 100 candidate seed events by referring to Xinhua News. 5 For one target event, the judges first construct queries with temporal con-straints to retrieve candidate documents and then judge wether they are relevant or not. Each doc-ument is assigned to three students, and we adopt the majority-win strategy for the final judgment. Fi-nally, by removing all candidate seed events which neither belong to significant events nor moderate events, we derive a test collection consisting of 24 significant events and 40 moderate events. 6 4.3 Evaluation metrics and baselines Similar to the evaluation in information retrieval , given a target event, we evaluate the quality of the returned  X  X elevant X  documents by systems. We use average precision, average recall and mean average precision(MAP) as evaluation metrics. A difference is that we do not have queries, and the output of a system is a set of document clusters. So for a sys-tem, given an event in golden standard, we first se-lect the cluster (the system generates) which has the most relevant documents, then sort the documents in the descending order of similarities with the clus-ter centroid and finally compute P, R ,F and MAP in this cluster. We perform Wilcoxon signed-rank test for significance testing.

We used the event detection method in (Swan and Allan, 2000) as baseline, denoted as timemines- X  tried two versions: 1) using all nouns and 2) us-ing all named entities. Recall that BurstVSM re-lies on bursty features as dimensions, we tested dif-ferent burst detection algorithms in our proposed BurstVSM model, including swan (Swan and Al-lan, 2000), kleinberg (Kleinberg, 2003) and our pro-posed TVBurst algorithm. 4.4 Experiment results Preliminary results. In Table 2, we can see that 1) BurstVSM with any of these three burst detection al-gorithms is significantly better than timemines- X  2 , suggesting our event detection method is very ef-fective; 2) TVBurst with BurstVSM gives the best performance, which suggests using moving average base probability will improve the performance of burst detection. We use TVBurst as the default burst detection algorithm in later experiments.

Then we compare the performance of differ-ent text representation models for event detection, namely BurstVSM and boostVSM (He et al., 2007b; He et al., 2007a). 7 For different representation mod-els, we use split-cluster-merge as clustering algo-rithm. Table 2 shows that BurstVSM is much ef-fecitve than boostVSM for event detection. In fact, we empirically find boostVSM is appropriate for clustering documents in a coarse grain (e.g., in topic level) but not for event detection.

Intra-class and inter-class similarities. In our methods, event detection is treated as document clustering. It is very important to study how similari-ties affect the performance of clustering. To see why our proposed representation methods are better than boostVSM , we present the average intra-class simi-larity and inter-class similarity for different events in Table 3. 8 We can see BurstVSM results in a larger intra-class similarity and a smaller inter-class simi-larity than boostVSM.

Analysis of the space/time complexity. We fur-ther analyze the space/time complexity of different representation models. In Table 4. We can see that BurstVSM has much smaller space/time cost com-pared with boostVSM, and meanwhile it has a better performance for event detection (See Table 2). In burst-based representation, one document has fewer non-zero entries.
