 We propose a kernel-based model to automatically extract social relations such as economic re lations and political relations between two people from news articles. To determine whether two people are structurally associated with each other, the proposed model uses an SVM (support vector machine) tree kernel based on trigrams of h ead-dependent relations between them. In the experiments with the automatic content extraction (ACE) corpus and a Korean news corpus, the proposed model outperformed the previous systems based on SVM tree kernels even though it used more shallow linguistic knowledge. I.2.7 [ Artificial Intelligence ]: Natural Language Processing Social Relation Extraction, Dependency Trigram Kernel, Dependency Kernel, Support Vector Machine In natural language documents, a huge number of social relations are described. Automatic extraction of these social relations from documents would be highly benefici al to social network analysis (SNA) studies on business economic s, public administration, and political science. In this paper, we propose a model to automatically extract social relations between people from news articles using support vector mach ines (SVMs). Table 1 shows the categories of social relations that the proposed model aims to extract from news articles. The proposed model first selects sentences describing social relations between people X  X  names (the names are automatically recognized by a conventional named entity tagger). Then, it classifies th e selected sentences into one of the six categories in Table 1. Recently, kernel-based models based on SVMs have shown good performance on this task. The shor test path kernel model [3] showed the best results in terms of both computational complexity and performance [2]. However, it exhibited low recall rates owing to hard-matching constraints (i.e., two sub-trees should share the same depth or length) between the comparisons of two target sub-trees. To resolve this problem, we propose a dependency trigram kernel to efficiently compute the structural similarity between pairs of dependency trees. CONGRATULATE Celebrate, defend, encourage, praise Given n words w 1,n in a sentence S describing social relations, let w denote the i-th word in the sentence, and let  X  w trigram set S T as shown in Equation (1). In Equation (1), w k is the first common head word of w Further, w l and w r are child nodes that are both directly dependent on w k . Thus, we can design a dependency kernel function that uses the defined dependency trigra ms as function inputs, as shown in Equation (2). In Equation (2), A and B are input sentences of the kernel function K that consist of n and m dependency trigrams, respectively. is the i-th dependency trigram for sentence A , whereas j-th dependency trigram for sentence B . The similarity score s AB is calculated using the weighted sum of the common attributes between i T A and j T B , as shown in Equation (3). of each node in a dependency trigram. In other words, () the dependency trigram i T A , respectively. Further, N binary function that returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the q-th attribute of i T A is the same as that of. j T attributes used for the compar ison of two dependency trigrams. Part-of-speech The morphological category (e.g., noun, verb) Gramm. role The grammatical category (e.g., sub, obj) As shown in Table 2, we do not use high-level semantic knowledge such as named entity cat egories and semantic codes in order to increase domain portability and decrease the effort related to a language change. The weight value w q for the q-th of the r attributes is assigned according to Equation (4). total information quantity for all attribute values included in the q -th attribute. Further, MaxE and MinE are normalizing factors denoting the maximum and the minimum of all the entropies of attributes. To experimentally evaluate th e proposed model, we used two types of test collections: One was the well-known automatic content extraction (ACE) corpus [5], and the other was a Korean news corpus that contains 1, 540 sentences. The Korean news corpus consists of two groups: One is 770 sentences describing social relations between two people, and the other is 770 sentences containing two people X  s names, but with no social relations describing them. The fi rst was manually annotated with the category names in Table 1. We implemented a social relation extraction system by replacing the default kernel of LibSVM [4] with the proposed dependency tr igram kernel. For experiments with the ACE corpus and the Korean news corpus, we used a Stanford dependency parser, a Korean POS tagger (precision = 95%) based on a hidden Markov model, and a Korean dependency parser (precision = 85%). compared with the previous relation extraction systems in the ACE corpus. Proposed model 0.702 0.554 0.626 In Table 3, Bunescu indicates a relation extraction system using the shortest path kernel [3]. Wang indicates a relation extraction system based on a convolution depe ndency path kernel, which is known as well relaxing the same lengt h constraints of the shortest path kernel [6]. All systems first selected sentences with relations and then discriminated among th e top five classes (i.e., AT, NEAR, PART, ROLE, and SOCIAL) in the ACE corpus. The Bunescu system and the Wang system use named entity categories and semantic code as i nput features. As shown in Table 4, the proposed model exhibited a considerably higher recall rate than the previous systems. Consequently, their high recall rates resulted in the best F1 scores. Table 4 shows the performance of the proposed model in the Korean news corpus. Proposed model 0.646 0.602 0.623 In Table 4, the Bunescu system us es the same input features with the proposed model. As shown in Table 4, the Bunescu system showed a low recall rate when it does not use high-level semantic knowledge such as named entity cat egories and semantic codes. We presented a social relation extraction model based on a dependency trigram kernel of SVM. In the experiments, we found that the newly designed kernel could relax the hard-matching constraints of the Bunescu syst em. Moreover, the proposed model showed good performance even though it used only low-level syntactic knowledge.
