 1. Introduction
A story link detection system determines whether or not two randomly selected stories discuss the same event. Link detection is a component technology which can be used for topic detection and tracking. For example, detecting stories can be done by comparing each incoming story to the on-topic stories. Recent researches on story link detection focus on document representation, decision threshold and similarity met-rics to make more accurate the determination of decision boundaries for the same event stories.
In this study, we propose a method of detecting event expressions based on document representation on a collocation map, which represents event terms of a document and their relations. Here  X  X  X vent expres-sions X  X  means a group of event terms or a phrase that describes the event referred to in the document, and  X  X  X vent terms X  X  are essential terms that constitute event expressions. On the basis of the event term weights on the collocation map, a story link detection system determines whether two documents deal with the same event or not, by judging relevance degree.

Compared to methods based on overall representation of concepts in a document, our method is inclined to using linguistic expressions of a event; compared to some work that focus on rigid linguistic representa-tions of events, our method is more inclined to event concepts than event expressions. This is expected to be advantageous because (1) introducing some degree of restrictions to  X  X  X vent expressions X  X  can contribute to distinguishing significant event concepts from significant but non-event concepts, and (2) using collocation maps gives more flexibility in extracting groups of terms that represent events than looking for varieties of rigid linguistic expressions of events.

In weighting event terms on a collocation map for each document, we use the following information, based on our observations of event expressions:
Internal properties : An event is most typically described with elements: who, where, when, what, why and how. So an event term represents the information. As such, recognition of named entity such as person, organization, location, country, time, and activity is helpful to give confidence to event term candidates.
Behaviors in a document : Relevant event terms tend to occur throughout the story. In news articles, an event is basically announced as a declarative sentence. Therefore event terms tend to cooccur within a sentence throughout the story. Since an event expression tends to consist of two or more event terms, representing cooccurrence of terms is a useful way to obtain reliable event expressions.

Distributional properties on timelines : Significant term shifts and rapid changes in the term frequency dis-tribution are typical of stories reporting a new event on time. An aspect of term significance therefore can be calculated by the documents on a day and the total document collection.

Contrastive properties on multilingual spaces : The amount of articles reported on an event would be dif-ferent depending on the interest of societies, nations, cultures or languages. It has an effect on term sig-nificance on multilingual spaces. Since two language spaces provide more information than one language space, term significance is measured on each language space and can be used as a clue for event terms on the other language space instead of mixing multilingual spaces into one.
 We have evaluated the proposed method on multilingual story link detection test set with Korean and
Japanese news articles. 2. Related researches
Traditional information retrieval is useful for content-based queries when a user knows more precisely the nature of the events or facts, but deficient for generic queries when a user does not have any knowledge of recent events to generate specific queries. The study of topic detection and tracking (TDT) ( Fiscus,
Doddington, Garofolo, &amp; Martin, 1999 ) enables a user to obtain the event-oriented information. TDT works with chronologically ordered news stories from broadcasts or newswire sources to detect new events and stories which describe the same event.

Many researches on topic detection and tracking are not very different in dealing the event-oriented tasks from the subject-oriented problem such as document clustering and categorization although the tasks are defined differently. Carbonell, Yang, Brown, Zhang, and Ma (2002) tested different combinations of similarity metrics for story link detection in TDT. The best performance was achieved not with a combi-nation of the N best individual metrics, but with a mix of best and second-tier metrics. Chen and Chen (2002) showed that nouns, verbs, adjectives and compound nouns are useful to represent story, and story expansion used by information retrieval approach is helpful. They showed the results by testing several thresholds for monolingual and multilingual link detection.

Some researches have considered the event term properties to track events or to capture major events on timelines. Fukumoto and Suzuki (2000) considered the behaviour of event terms called domain dependency of terms for event tracking by assuming that an event associated with a story appears throughout para-graphs, but a subject term does not. This method was applied to event tracking with some training stories and the event defined to track. Swan and Allan (2000) showed term significance on timelines was useful to get major topics. They suggested a method to generate clusters of terms that capture the information cor-responding to major news topics covered in the corpus. Atlam, Okada, Shishibori, and Aoe (2002) pro-posed an evaluation method of word  X  s popularity with time-series based on the frequency change by and document frequency in traditional information retrieval. However, these studies tackled topics not for the document but for the document collection. Eichmann (2002) and Yang, Zhang, Carbonell, and Jin (2002) considered named entities as event features.

On multilingual topic detection and tracking researches, Arabic and English link detection were con-ducted by an Arabic X  X nglish bilingual dictionary and translation probability ( Lam &amp; Huang, 2002 ). Le-vow and Oard (2000) and He, Park, Murray, Subotin, and Oard (2002) showed that the two-best translation selection based on a statistical lexicon and post-translation document expansion outperforms over one translation by machine translation system in Mandarin and Arabic to English multilingual topic tracking. After language translation based on a dictionary or a machine translation, multilingual detec-tion methods concentrate language source specific normalization of similarity with lower thresholds compared to monolingual story pairs ( Chen &amp; Chen, 2002; Lam &amp; Huang, 2002; Leek, Jin, Sista, &amp;
Schwartz, 1999 ). 3. Document representation, event term weighting and link detection 3.1. Document representation by collocation map
In our research, we deal with news articles in two languages, i.e. Korean and Japanese. To deal with these two languages, we used ezTrans Korean-to-Japanese/Japanese-to-Korean machine translation system ( ChangshinSoft, 2001 ). Korean news articles are translated into Japanese by the machine translation sys-tem. Note that for a pair of similar languages like Korean and Japanese, the use of machine translation in application as it can provide translated stories to users.

A document is represented on a collocation map consisting of nodes and directed edges. Nodes represent terms and edges show the co-occurrence information of connected nodes (terms) in a sentence. To make a representation of a document as a collocation map, terms are selected by part-of-speech information (noun, proper noun, adjective and verb) based on part-of-speech tagging. To identify main objects of an event, bal noun or verb is assigned to  X  act  X  to represent an action or status.

Fig. 1 shows a collocation map for the document which reports  X  Russia-Chechen armistice agreement  X  event. This sample shows the highest terms and their neighbors on the collocation map in directed graph.
When terms appear in the same sentence, they are connected by directed edges. The document is Korean news reported in January 18, 1995, which is translated into Japanese by machine translation system.
Below we will elaborate how terms and edges are weighted in the collocation map and how document link is detected. 3.2. Term significance on timelines and multilingual spaces
In order to give distinctive weight to event nodes (terms) in the collocation map, term significance is first calculated on the basis of timelines and multilingual spaces.
 compare term distribution with two languages, terms should be translated into the same language. In Fig. 2 ,
Language 1 is after the translation process into Language 2 . To get information from each language, term significance is measured on each language space and used to refer the other language space in multilingual spaces ( a = b \ c ). Terms in the area a may be general terms or event terms commonly happened in mul-tilingual spaces. 3.2.1. Term significance on timelines
The term significance on timelines is calculated by the v dence between term t and class t0 . Here the class is time which has the documents reported during certain table, time t0 is each day, which means the total number of documents on that day is equal to the sum of a and b .
 where wTime ( t , t 0, l ) represents significance of a term t on the language space l on the time t0 . The term changes in v 2 value for significance on timelines are shown in Fig. 3 for two events happened in
Korean news articles. The event  X  Kim Il Sung death  X  happened on July 10, 1994. The event  X  Kobe earth-quake  X  happened on January 18, 1995. Around the time period related to the event, the terms  X  Kim Il Sung  X  and  X  earthquake  X  have significant values. 3.2.2. Term distribution on multilingual spaces
A Korean location name,  X  Inchon  X  , appeared in 261, 31 and 3 days on Korean, Japanese and English language space in one year news articles, respectively. A Japanese location name,  X  Hiroshima  X  , appeared in 307, 61 and 25 days on Japanese, Korean and English language space, respectively. Since it is a location name of a country, the term tends to frequently occur in documents on its own country/language space. The number of documents reporting the same event on that day depends on a national interest for the event ( Table 2 ).

The term significance on timelines is separately calculated depending on each language space to reflect the term distribution of each language. Then lookup the weight on other language space and take higher weight. If the term weight is high in one space, it is possible to be reported to other country. The term
Korean space means Japanese translation. The term changes in significance on multilingual spaces are shown in Fig. 4 . The term has higher values in Japanese news articles since Japanese articles reported about the event  X  earthquake  X  which happened in Japan much more than Korean news. It indicates the event term is affected on time and lingual space.
Therefore using term information in other language space would be helpful. 3.3. Event term weighting on collocation map
Each document is represented on a collocation map which has nodes and directed edges to consider the co-occurrence relation of a term with neighbors on the same sentence. Highly weighted nodes and edges on the collocation map would be the candidates of event terms to describe an event of the document.
A node has a weight which is calculated based on the event term properties as follows: where wnode i means the weight of node i . tf is term frequency in a document. wNE which gives higher weight to named entities. wTimeSpace i cance in timelines on multilingual spaces.

An edge represents that two nodes co-occurs on the sentence. The window size for co-occurrence is set as 5. An edge is weighted by the co-occurrence of a node pair and the weights of two nodes as follows: where an edge weight wedge ij is affected by the weight of a neighbor node wnode occurrence frequency cooc ij proportionally. It is based on assumption that some of key event terms will be co-occurred throughout the document.

To reflect the context of edges to the nodes, a node weight is re-calculated by edge weights for highly weighted edges wedge ik : A document vector is represented with a pair of a node and its weight calculated by Eq. (6) .
To decide whether a pair of documents deals the same event, the documents link is determined based on the relevance degree by cosine coefficient.
 4. Experiments
We have evaluated the effectiveness of proposed method on the multilingual test collection of Korean and Japanese news articles. 4.1. Experimental set-up
Documents consist of Korean news articles from the website of Hankyoreh and Japanese news articles from Mainichi newspaper, spanning from January to June, 1998. The number of documents is 40,000 and 61,637 for Korean and Japanese, respectively.

Korean documents are translated to Japanese by a machine translation system. Japanese documents and translated Japanese from Korean documents are tagged by ChaSen system ( Matsumoto et al., 2002 ). The number of terms from the documents is 193,730 and 353,210 for Korean and Japanese, respectively, which have more than 3 in the document frequency from documents spanning from July 1994 to May 1995. For test documents, the document frequency is applied incrementally to calculate the weight of a term. To rec-ognize named entities, NExT named entity extraction system ( Masui, Suzuki, &amp; Hukumoto, 2002 ) is used.
To evaluate a story detection system for Korean and Japanese news articles, we developed the test col-lection, which consists of 13 events which are taken from TDT2 test collection, and the evaluation set judged by two human assessors for each event on each language of Korean news and Japanese news arti-cles. Table 4 shows the event list, which is a subset of TDT2 events. For the 13 events, 5902 documents are judged by two human assessors for each language with the rules used by Linguistic Data Consortium, and 3,875 documents are on the events. The numbers of target and non-target pairs for story link detection are 1,731,419 and 5,224,891, respectively.

We used evaluation metrics defined using contingency table, including precision, recall, miss alarm, false alarm, and micro-average F1 ( Table 3 ).
 Precision: a /( a + b ).
 Recall: a /( a + c ).
 Miss alarm: c /( a + c ).
 False alarm: b /( b + d ).

F1:2  X  Precision  X  Recall/(Precision + Recall) = 2 a /(2 a + b + c ). 4.2. Experimental results
To observe the effectiveness of the proposed weighting method based on event term properties, we have evaluated multilingual story link detection by thresholds of relevancy.

We have compared the tfidf weighting scheme by term frequency, inverse document frequency and vector normalization as the base weighting method, and the proposed weighting method by Eq. (6) . The base weighting scheme is selected by our previous work which yields the best retrieval result in Lee, Park, and Choi (2001) among variants in tfidf formula.

The term vector of a document is shown in Fig. 5 according to the weighting methods. Some terms are more distinctive in the weighting method by the event properties. The similarity is calculated by the cosine coefficient between two document vectors for the weighting methods.

Table 5 shows the experimental results for monolingual pairs. The proposed weighting method based on event term properties achieved 17.3% improvement for Korean story pairs, 9.4% improvement for Japanese story pairs, and 14.3% improvement for multilingual story pairs over the base weighting method in micro-averaged F1 measure. These results are modestly encouraging. Table 6 shows the effect by applying multi-lingual space component of terms which appear in two language spaces, which calculates with Eq. (3) . The proposed method considering terms on times and lingual spaces achieved 16.74% over the base weighting scheme for Korean X  X apanese news pairs. For multilingual pairs the weighing method without considering lingual spaces does not improve the performance over the base weighting scheme. This result indicates that information from other language space is effective for multilingual story link detection. The performance changes depending on thresholds from 0.005 to 0.35 for decision making are shown in Fig. 6 . The performance of Table 5 and Table 6 is the best result for each weighting scheme on thresholds. The proposed method outperforms over all thresholds.

We have examined the effect of the weighting schemes in similarity value. The relevant story pairs for an in TDT-2 topics is as follows:
WHAT: Student protests against Indonesian president Suharto based on political differences, motivated by the crushing economic crisis.
 WHERE: Jakarta, Indonesia.
 WHEN: Spring 1998.
 Table 7 shows the chi-square values calculated by Eq. (1) on a focal time, May 15, 1998 in Korean and
Japanese language spaces. The terms related to the event show relatively high values and different values depending on lingual spaces.

The document vectors weighted by proposed weighting method are shown in Fig. 7 . Terms commonly appeared in two documents are as follows:
As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the weights of terms commonly appeared in two vectors are not dominant for the document vectors. The weights for other terms show high values overall. On the other side, Fig. 7 (d) shows that the common terms of two vectors have higher weights and other terms have lower weights in the whole vectors. This contributes the similarity value between story pairs and makes positive effect in link detection. 4.3. Verification of the results
To verify the performance improvement of the proposed method, we have measured the document space density. In correlation between indexing performance and document space density, Salton, Wong, and
Yang (1975) showed that the best retrieval performance can be obtainable with a clustered space exhibiting ify our performance improvement whether the proposed weighting method could make the intra-event sto-inter-event stories density can produce the better performance.

To calculate similarity, cosine coefficient measure is used. For a given event class K comprising m doc-uments, each centroid C k is defined as the average weight of the documents which belong to the event class
E . The main centroid C main for all documents is defined as the average weight of all N documents. We measured document space density as follows:
Intra-event density ( DensityIntraC ): by averaging similarity between documents d troid C k within a single cluster (factor x ).

Inter-event density for main centroid ( DensityInterByCmain ): by averaging similarity between cluster centroids C k and main centroid C main .

Inter-event density on clusters ( DensiyInterC ): by averaging similarity between pairs of cluster centroid ( C i and C j ) (factor y ).
 Space density ratio: to measure the overall document space density by y / x .

All density measures are smaller for the proposed weighting scheme compared to the base weighting scheme. The distances of the clusters are greater than the distance of documents inside each cluster. The proposed weighting scheme reduced the space density by maximizing intra-event density and by minimizing inter-event density, as shown Table 8 . The results of Tables 5 and 6 are supported by the notion that im-proved performance is associated with decreased density in the document space. 5. Conclusions
We have proposed a method of detecting event expressions based on the document representation using terms the distinctive weights, we utilized the distributional features of terms in timelines and multilingual spaces, together with selected types of named entities. Evaluation on Korean and Japanese story link detec-tion test collection showed that the proposed features are effective by achieving 14.3% improvement. The proposed method is verified by measuring the space density. This result indicates that the proposed weight-on times and multilingual spaces are not restricted to Korean and Japanese language, the proposed method can be applicable to other language pairs.
 Based on the collocation map of documents, users can identify the stories that contain the target events. point of view.
