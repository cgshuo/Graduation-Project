INTRODUCTION processing on topics such as named entity recognition (NER), cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), question an swering (QA) and machine transl ation (MT). It is a process of translating a word in one language into another by preserving its pronunciation in the system, as shown in studies of NER [Chen and Lee 1996]; CLIR [Lee and Choi 1998; Qu et al. 2003; Virga and Khudanpur 2003]; machine transliteration [Knight and Graehl 1998; Wan and Verspoor 1998; Al-Onaizan and Knight 2002; Lin and Chen 2002]; and the bilingual transliteration lexicons are small in scale and/or compiled manually. Considering the amount of potential translitera tion pairs in the open domain, it is almost impossible to construct a comprehensive translite ration lexicon. To mitigate this problem, an automatic approach for extracting transliteration pairs from Web corpora could serve as a good solution. (TM) and extraction of transliteration pair s (EX). There have been many reports on transliteration modeling for different language pairs, such as English-Chinese [Chen et al. 2003; Gao et al. 2004; Li et al. 2004]; English-Japanese [Knight and Graehl 1998; Qu et Kang and Kim 2000; Oh and Choi 2002]; English-Arabic [Al-Onaizan and Knight 2002]; Kuo and Yang 2004a; 2004b; Lin et al. 2004; Kuo and Yang 2005]. The former approach models transliteration rules with a generative m odel that is trained from a large bilingual transliteration lexicon, with the objective of translating unknown words on-the-fly in the problem through transliteration modeling. be alleviated if translators observe common rules which follow the translation-by-sound principle. For example, translation professionals in mainland China follow guidelines recommended by the Xinhua News Agency [1992]. Words transliterated by closely observing common guidelines are referred to as regular transliterations. However, in Web publishing, translators in different countries and regions may not observe the same flavors or to introduce semantic implications, also known as wordplay, resulting in casual multiple Chinese phonetic equivalents for an English word. For example,  X  X isney X  and differentiate from English words and syllables. Instead of relying on a parallel corpus, we exploit techniques to acquire transliteration 
Honeywell pairs from a nonparallel corpus, such as pr edominantly Chinese text mixed with English words or Chinese anchor text with English counterparts, which are obtained from a corpus is generally more accessible than a parallel one. basics of English-Chinese transliteration. We refer to all Latin-scripted words as English words, although some of them originate from Romanization of Chinese. In Section 3, we Section 4, we conduct several experiments and report the results. In Section 5, we discuss related and future work. We conclude with Section 6. 2. BASICS OF CHINESE TRANSLITERATION The idea of transliteration is to preserve the sound of the original language, or to follow the translation-by-sound principle. Research on automa tic transliteration has reported observe rigid guidelines. However, in casual transliteration, the generative models fail in and provide an analytical study on a development database. 2.1 Transliteration Principle comparison between sounds in two languages. Note that English and Chinese have different syllable structures. Chinese is a syllabic language, with each Chinese character pronounced as a syllable in either conson ant-vowel (CV) or consonant-vowel-nasal (CVN) structure. A Chinese word consists of a sequence of characters, or phonetically a sequence of syllables. As such, in the task of English-Chinese tran sliteration, it would be a natural choice to syllabify an English word by converting the phoneme sequence into a sequence of Chinese-like syllables so as to predict how its Chinese transliteration would be like. phonemes, referred to as G2P or letter-to-sound, then syllabify the phoneme sequence into a syllable sequence. Techniques for G2P are studied intensively, driven by the need in text-to-speech research. Successful t echniques include heuristic rules [Wan and Verspoor 1998] and machine-learning methods [Pagel et al. 1998; Galescu and Allen Martin [2000]. and consonant-vowel-consonant structures, denoted as CV, CVN, and CVC, whereas Chinese only has CV and CV-n asal (CVN) syllable structur es. English phonetic rule allows consonant clusters (CC) such as /-sk/ in  X  X isk X  and /-str-/ in  X  X treet X ; Chinese, on the other hand, follows rigid CV or CVN rules where C is an optional single consonant. nucleus. When transliterating an English CV or CVN syllable into Chinese, we typically preserve the English syllable structure. To deal with consonant clusters and CVC decompose a consonant cluster into a sequence of individual consonants (ICs). Hereafter, we denote IC as a single consonant for clarity. Second, a CVC syllable in English is split into a CV and an IC. English words, and then apply syllable structure conversion rules. In this article we take the strategy of syllabification followed by a syllable conversion. For example, following the approach in Jurafsky and Martin [2000], the English word  X  X oulder X  is converted into syllables are separated by hyphens. The syllable conversion rules try to resolve the difference between English and Chinese phonetic systems by segmenting and finding the closest equivalents of syllable structures . They can be summarized as follows: CVC English CV IC English CC English IC IC IC English known as phonetic elision. The elision can be formulated as a mapping to a null syllable  X  . They are given in rule (2). To summari ze, we list the mapping rules in Table II. I C English C Nucleus a Chinese CV syllable
IC English elided in Chinese  X  d  X  /  X  /bo-l-d  X  / by rule (1) and /bo-l-d  X  /  X  /BO-ER-DE/ (  X  X  X  X  ) or /bo-l-d  X  /  X  /BO-DE/ (  X  X  X  ) by rule (2). The syllabification of an English word results in a sequence of Chinese-like syllables.

The creative pro cess also leads to phonetic variations as a result of the strategies in transliteration. For example,  X  X isney X  has phonetic variants such as  X  X  X  the most prominent property of a casual transliteration is that there are multiple commonly used Chinese variants for an English word. In this article we propose a cases. 2.2 Statistical Analysis researches. The proposed trans literation pair extraction method allows us to tap the Web for transliteration lexicons. To conduct ou r study, we first construct a development Universal Resource Locators, URLs). We th en obtain new URLs from the returned Web pages by parsing the page contents. In this way, the new URLs are discovered and resubmitted iteratively. We aggregate a corpus of about 500MB Web pages in diverse word EW . With this criterion, 80,094 qualified sentences are extracted automatically. 
Individual consonant Each qualified sentence is manually validat ed based on the following transliteration only the phonetic transliteration constituent is ex tracted to form a transliteration pair; (ii) and vice versa. The validation process results in 8,898 qualified transliteration pairs, also referred to as distinct qualifie d transliteration pairs or DQTPs. due to mismatches between the two phonetic systems. As phonetic confusion will be here. elided IC. It is interesting to note that elis ions take place much more often in the middle of a word than at the end of a word. We break down the elision rates of the top six ICs as shown in Table III in terms of total elision rate and elision rate by position. Each IC has its own elision pattern. For example, /r/ is e lided much more often in the middle than at English word are 3.8 and 2.7, respectively. It reveals that the longer the word is, the more likely that its ICs will be elided. Kuo and Yang [2005] have shown that the statistics of elision patterns are informative in helping to improve the extraction performance. English could be either dropped by elision, blended with a neighboring consonant, or augmented with a nucleus vowel, known as inse rtion. In English, we can combine two or more ICs to form a blend such as /tr/, /dr/ and /pr/ which do not have Chinese equivalents. On the other hand, one can also insert a nucleus vowel into an IC to make it a Chinese-like syllable. For exam ple, /k-/-&gt;/Ke-/ and /t-/-&gt;/Te-/ by inserting the nucleus vowel /e/. Although phonetic insertion adds a nucleus vowel to an IC, it does not increase syllables, then its Chinese transliteration would have NM  X  syllables. In the case of no elision, we have NM = . choice of characters in a tran sliteration is decided from the cultural and aesthetic point of statistics of character usage. A similar idea was reported earlier in Xiao et al. [2002]. To database in Table IV. takes place very often. This leads to multiple transliteration variants for an English word with their counts from our development database SET1. English Words Transliteration variants (count) transliterations are not unusual in Web publishi ng. The observation also suggests that it is crucial to adequately model phonetic confusion to cover the widespread casual transliterations. 3. PHONETIC SIMILARITY MODELING Assuming that Chinese transliterations always co-occur in proximity to their original English words, the proposed phonetic similarity modeling (PSM) approach aims to identify the transliteration pairs by measurin g phonetic similarity between candidate transliteration pairs. In a Chinese-pred ominant text, when an English word EW is spotted, in its close context . For the PSM approach to work, we need to address three issues: (1) the candidacy of transliterations; (2) the search strategy of candidates; and (3) the training of PSM. 3.1 Formulation of Chinese Transliteration CS cs cs cs = be the sequence of Chinese syllables derived from CW , which is represented by a Chinese character string. CW c c c  X  . (3) The transliteration can be considered a generative process formulated by the noisy (|) PEW CW is estimated to characterize the nois y channel, known as the transliteration the Bayesian rule, we have (|) . PCW EW probability (|) PEW CW can be approximated by the phonetic confusion probability (|) PES CS , which is given as (|)max(,|), PES CS PES CS where  X  is the set of all possible alignment paths between ES and CS . It is not trivial to find the best alignment path  X  . We can resort to a dynamic programming algorithm, which is discussed in Section 3.3. Assuming conditional independence of syllables m es , we have can be rewritten as (|) . PCW EW The language model in Eq.(6) can be represented by Chinese character n -gram statistics, transliterated names. () (|,..., ,)
PCW pc c c c  X  X  X  In this article we adopt a bigram with unig ram back-off, equation(7) can be rewritten as equation(8): ()() (| )
PCW pc pc c  X  (|) PCW EW in Eq.(6) can be used to rank a number of CW candidates. In this article the context of EW provides us with a set of competing Chinese transliteration candidates  X  . We rank the candidates to find the most likely CW for a given EW . This is equivalent to the generative process that generates the most likely CW from EW in most of the machine transliteration literature. In the ranking process, () PEW can be ignored because it is the same across all CW candidates. The CW candidate that gives the highest posterior probability is considered the most probable candidate CW  X  . CW PCW EW PES CS PCW Now that we have short-listed one candidate CW  X  once, the next step is to see if CW  X  indeed forms a genuine E-C pair with the English word EW . This can be achieved by a hypothesis test. We take the ratio between (|) PCW EW  X  and (|) as the confidence index. We have 0 H , which hypothesizes CW  X  and EW forms an E-C pair, and 1 H , which hypothesizes otherwise. The confidence index can be given as follows:  X  process to come up with the most probable CW  X  . We then qualify the E-C pair by confidence index shows how much the genuine E-C pair overtakes the rest. This is referred to as the recognition followed by validation strategy . if then H is true else then H is true  X  X  F -measure. precision recall
F measure  X = The E-C pair qualifying process can be summari zed in a 4-step algorithm, as follows. (In the following sections we will discuss each of the steps in detail.) 
Recognition followed by validation Algorithm 1. Spot an EW from a Chinese sentence; 2. Decide the candidacy of transliterations in the close context of EW ; 3. Convert E-C candidates to syllables, ES and CS identify the most probable CS X  4. Qualify CS X  through the hypothesis test and accept CW X  as transliteration of EW . 3.2 Candidacy of Transliteration We aim at extracting transliteration pairs in predominantly Chinese Web pages, where transliterated words are collocated closely with their original English words and the English words are often appositives of neighboring Chinese words in a close context . In their original English words in parenthese s [Nagata et al. 2001]. The cross-lingual apposition has been observed not only in Japanese but also in Korean and Chinese articles as well. The Web corpus of such ap positions serves as an important source from which to extract transliteration pairs. We make the following assumptions: (1) The close context is within a sentence boundary delimited by punctuation such as full stop, question, and exclamation marks. A close context is a range of proximity where an English word and its Chinese transliteration collocate. (2) In a close context there could be word pairs of both semantic translation and phonetic transliteration; only translite ration pairs are extracted. Let X  X  look at an example:  X  ...  X  X  X  Kuro  X  X  P2P  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  3  X  X  X  X  P2P  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X   X  X 2C (Content to Community)...  X  In the example, C2C is not a transliteration of  X  X ontent to Community, X  it is an acronym expansion. On the other hand,  X   X  X  /KU-LUO/ X , not in parentheses, presents a transliteration for  X  X uro X . What is important is that the English words and their transliterations are always closely collocated. In spired by this observation, we propose an candidate. a predominantly Chinese Web page is segmen ted into sentences that are delimited by punctuation. Such a segmented sentence may or may not be a grammatical sentence. Second, we search for any English words EW in each sentence; there could be more than neighborhood is defined as in Fig. 1, which serves as the close context of the recognized neighborhood form a candidate set  X  for CW . Suppose that we syllabify an English word EW into M syllables. We search in the candidate set  X  over the k -neighborhood for syllable number of EW . As discussed in Section 2.2, we typically have NM  X  ; in modeling. neighborhoods. Two candidate pairs,  X  X uro- X  X  X   X  and  X  X uro- X  X   X  will be examined further phonetically. 3.3 Search Strategy validation strategy. First, given an English syllable sequence ES and its Chinese candidate CS , we find the best alignment path. Second, among the competing candidates, we identify the best CS X  and therefore the best CW X  . adopt a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm [Myers and Rabiner 1981] to eliminate the length differences between the two syllable se quences, which is also known as dynamic warping. To help understand the nature of dynamic warping, let us consider an M-N plane, as in Fig. 2. The alignment between ES and CS can be depicted by a sequence of K points (,) mn  X  = :  X  X  X  X  . The sequence can be considered to represent a function that approximately warping function. Each warping function is th e trace of a search path. All possible search with the diagonal line () () happens more often, that is, NM  X  . conditional independence of the syllables, the similarity between two syllable sequences given by a warping function  X  is (|,) ( | )

The length of CS both the collection of CWs and their corresponding CSs .) all the possible warping functions into acco unt. Equation(9) can be rewritten as equation warping path CS  X   X =  X  , (15) CS candidates, CS P ES CS P CW In the validation step, we qualif y the resulting CW  X  with a hypothesis test that examines the posterior odds of the corresponding E-C pair as given in Eq.(11). 3.4 Phonetic Similarity Model phonetic confusion probability matrix, or confusion matrix . A confusion matrix is a V being the syllable vocabulary size in th e respective language . To establish the confusion matrix, we convert the words from their orthography to phonemes using G2P [Galescu and Allen 2001]. Then, we convert the phoneme sequence further into a sequence of Chinese-like syllabl es [Jurafsky and Martin 2000]. As a Chinese character is rendered by a syllable, it is pr eferable to compare the PSM at the syllable level. There are several ways to estimate the sy llable-based confusion matrix: an automatic speech recognition (ASR) sy stem. We run a labeled English speech pescs can be obtained to serve as an educated guess about how syllables across estimate (|) A SR m n pescs as follows: pescs (2) Syllable-PSM : We can estimate the syllable confusion probability (|) mn pes cs convert the bilin gual entries into syllables and phoneme s. We then align the syllables and es &lt;&gt; and n cs &lt;&gt; . We estimate (|) SYL m n pescs as follows: pescs (3) Subsyllable-PSM : We can estimate the syllable confusion probability (|) mn pes cs by final, es ei ef cs ci cf finals, we have p es cs p ei ci p ef cf = (20) pescs , (|) SYL m n pescs and (|) SS m n pescs , can be exploited in different stages. In the initial stage, only ASR-PSM is availabl e. Therefore, we use ASR-PSM to bootstrap parameter smoothing. The smoothed confusion matrix (CM) of PSM can be expressed by equation (21): p es cs p es cs p es cs  X   X  =+ 1.0,  X   X  += (21) respectively, and can be obtained empirically through cross-validations. In the cross-validation, we split SET1 into 10 sets. We w ithhold 1 set and use the remaining 9 sets to adopt the parameters that give the highest average F -measure. 3.5 Learning Strategy We conduct learning to train the confusion matrix from sta tistics derived from a corpus. Given a transliteration pair, the alignment be tween cross-lingual syllables and phonemes statistics, PSM parameter (|) mn pes cs can be estimated by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process [Dempster et al. 1977]. We first obtain an ASR-PSM through speech recognition. The ASR-PSM is used as the initialization of PSM parameters. In the E-C pairs in the training corpus  X  . The force-alignment process is described by Eq.(15) non-decreasing lik elihood probability (|) PES CS until (|) PES CS Start : Bootstrap confusion matrix (|) mn pes cs by ASR-PSM as in equation(17); E-Step : Force-align corpus  X  using (|) mn pes cs , then estimate the counts of M-Step : Re-estimate (|) mn pes cs using the counts from E-Step; Iteration : Repeat E-Step and M-Step until (|) PES CS 4. EXPERIMENTS We implement the phonetic si milarity model and conduct several experiments. We start with a set of handcrafted syllable-mapping rules for mapping between English and results are regarded as the baseline performan ce of the extraction. We then compare the three PSM training approaches, namely ASR-PSM, Syllable-PSM, and Subsyllable-PSM, following the formulation in Section 3.4. We also compare supervised and unsupervised SET1 development database. We also carr y out our experiments on an independent database SET2 from a different source. SET2 consists of 3GB of Web pages acquired in a similar way as SET1. As a result, 24,507 DQTP s are expected to obtain at the estimated precision of 82.6%. SET2 allows us to examine our proposed method on a corpus from different sources. The precision, recall, and F -measure, collectively referred to as extraction performance, of the E-C pair extraction are reported for the experiments. in which we build a confusion matrix based on direct orthographical mapping. In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we discuss two methods for using ASR-PSM to bootstrap a confusion matrix; In Section 4. 4, we use the confusion matrix resulting from Section 4.3 predominantly Chinese Web pages to a hype rlinked English-Chin ese bilingual Web. 4.1 Orthographical Confusion Matrix for Romanized Chinese Since we focus on Chinese-predominant text, it is common that ma ny English words are in fact their Romaniza tion Chinese equivalents, which follow certain Romanization rules; Table VI gives some examples. An effective way to link them up is through direct orthographical mapping [Li et al. 2004] between the EW and CW . It is noted that there are multiple common Chinese Roma nization systems, such as Pinyin, Tong-yong, Wade- X  X hong-li X , and  X  X hong-li X  using Wade-Giles, Tong-yong , and Hanyu Pinyin , the Romanization system is just as important as identifying the origin of words in general One is that some syllable vocabularies are common across different Romanization systems. Hence we are unable to correctly identify a Romanization system based on only a few syllables. Another problem is that it is not un common to see a mixture of syllable vocabulary from different Romanization systems in a single translite rated word [Kuo and Yang 2004b]. confusion matrix. The confusion matrix establishes a correspondence between Romanized syllable codes and their Chines e characters for the above-mentioned three Romanization systems. A CW is parsed from left to right using a substring longest-match possible, the most common one is retained according to unigram counts of syllables. word CW can be easily validated. In SET1, we have 135 Romanized Chinese names which constitute 1.5% of the total 8,898 DQTPs. Usi ng the orthographical confusion matrix, we correctly extract 134 Romanized Chinese DQTPs in SET1. In Table VII we candidates, of which 134 are correct DQTPs. This translates to 84.2% (134/159) precisi-on and 99.3% (134/135) recall for Romanized Chinese. If the syllable segmentation is unsuccessful, we follow the E-C pair qualifying process, as in Section 3.1. 4.2 Phonetic Confusion Matrix with Hard Decision Human translators rely on p honetic rules that convert English ph onemes into their Chinese equivalents [Wan and Verspoor 1998]. To establish the baseline performance, we generate a set of handcrafted syllable-mappi ng rules; a similar approach was reported mapping mn es cs  X  and (|) mn pes cs is set to 0 otherwise. Assuming no-elision, we call this the rule-based approach . To account for the elision of English sounds, we conduct a search, as formulated in equations (15) and (16), with the rule with elision approach . The results on SET1 are reported in Table VIII. We observe that the rule with elision approach slightly improves the F -measure. However, either approach gives too low a set to 0.3. 4.3 Phonetic Confusion Matrices with Soft Decision The handcrafted rules are good for most regular transliterations [Xinhua 1992]. In generalize to account for varia tions. So a learning mechanism to automatically derive the soft decision from a corpus is desirable. In automatic speech recognition (ASR), we report th e confusion matrix across sound bootstrapping cross-lingual syllable-base d PSM. A confusion matrix reports the confusion statistics of syllables between two languages. The diagonal line in the confusion matrix reflects the desired matching results. An ASR system typically provides a confusion matrix with strong correlation values along the diagonal and weak correlation off the diagonal. When English utterances pass through a Chinese ASR system, we obtain a confusion matrix between English phonemes and Chinese phonemes, and similarly between English syllables and Ch inese syllables. It is expected that similar sounds across We conduct three experiments here. First, we generate a cross-lingual syllable-based PSM in the format of a confusion matrix with soft decision using the ASR-PSM approach, referred to as the SCM approach. Second, we generate a similar phoneme-based PSM using the ASR-PSM approach, referred to as PCM. Third, we use linear interpolation to combine PCM and SCM, as in Eq. (21), for model smoothing, referred to result of the 10-fold cross-validation on SET1. The hypothesis test threshold  X  is empirically set to 0.3. The test results on S ET1 are shown in Table IX. Compared to the results in Table IIX, we see that the soft decision confusion matrix significantly improves extraction performance over the hard decision strategy. 4.4 Learning Confusion Matrices through EM Process We have discussed how to establish confusion matrices from linguistic knowledge such as an orthographical confusion matrix and from phonetic knowledge such as ASR results. discussed a model training method by means of an EM process. Now we would like to see how such a confusion matrix learning process can help improve performance. We first split the 8,898 DQTP s in SET1 into 10 sets and then conduct 10 cross-remaining 9 sets for the training of sylla ble and phoneme confusion matrices, as formulated in Syllable-PSM and Subsyllable-PSM in Section 3.4. We consider this experiment a supervised training process, referred to as a supervised learning . development corpus, SET1. In this experiment, we do not rely on the gold standard as the the PCM, SCM, and CM. Multiple iterations ar e carried out until a convergence criterion noteworthy that PCM outperforms SCM at the beginning, whereas SCM overtakes PCM after a few iterations. This is pr obably due to the fact that there are fewer parameters in the PCM than in the SCM, which allows PCM to conve rge quicker. As expected, SCM eventually captures the sylla bic characteristics of Chinese transliteration well. performance, with supervised learning giving slightly better results. The unsupervised transliteration pairs. report a precision rate of 82.6%, which is cl ose to the results in CM, as shown in Table X Japanese and Korean origin are translat ed to Chinese through direct orthographic map-Table XI.

An iterative method was proposed to identify hubs and authorities in this hyperlinked environment and to refine search topics by using information on hub pages and authoritative pages [Kleinberg 1998]. Hyperlink analysis has been widely used in information retrieval research [Brin and Page 1998], and has achieved promising results E-C pairs across different languages, we extend our close context proximity from sentences to hyperlinked cross-lingual Web pages. We further collect 1.98 million Web pages using a Web spider. Among these pages, 109,416 linked text pairs (anchored texts similar way to SET1. We use confusion matrices from Section 4.3 for bootstrapping, and apply the unsupervised learning technique to extract E-C pairs from SET3. To understand the extraction performance, we randomly select 400 extracted E-C pairs for manual validation. Results are reported in Table XII, where we see that precision is comparable technique can be reliably extended to transl iteration extraction from a bilingual Web. 5. RELATED WORK Let us revisit the two categories of machine tr ansliteration research that we discussed in (EX). The proposed PSM benefits from the both studies: it adopts the TM approach to the EX problem. noisy channel modeling fr amework [Brown et al. 1994]. It learns from multiple levels of knowledge sources, such as orthography in Section 4.1, and syllables and phonemes in sources help in the transliteration process. For example, Kuo and Yang [2004a] and Lam [2001] proposed a phon eme-based name entity transliteratio n. Li et al. [2004] proposed a direct orthographical mapping framework. The PSM framework effectively fuses the three levels of knowledge sources in the decision making process. bilingual corpora su ch as bilingual text, interlinked b ilingual Web pages, etc. Al-Onaizan and Knight [2002] and Qu et al. [2003] reported using Web pages as a live thesaurus to validate generated transl ations and transliterations. The EX approach allows us to extract real life transliteration pairs. The problem in EX research centers on how to establish the transliteration co rrespondence be tween words. context of a bilingual wo rd pair, with the assumption that if the contexts of two words in their respective lang uages are similar in a comparable/p arallel bilingual corpus, then the word pair is considered to be a translation pair. The same approach, known as the does not make use of the phonetic link between words. Lu et al. X  X  approach [2002] falls comparable/parallel corpus. phonetic correspo ndence between b ilingual words. Many effo rts have been reported texts, which are more accessible than either query logs or comparable corpora. We start with the targeted monolingual texts where Chinese translitera tions are collocated closely with their appositives in English. We use the collocation proximity to constrain the search space and propose a two-stage extraction process, known as recognition followed by validation . 6. DISCUSSION will be). In Table XIII, we sh ow the word and syllable sta tistics for the entire SET1 and characters (1,210) for transliteration than th e entire SET1 does (3,5 95), since the Chinese vocabulary is a few times larger than Engl ish because SET1 is a Chinese-predominant Chinese and English syllables re flects the complexity of the PS M. We find that there are 394 and 1,012 distinct Chinese and English syllables in the entire SET1, and 333 and 824 SCM and PCM models allow us to learn the rules effectively from the data. experiments. The extracted transliteration pa irs form a bilingual lexicon, and it is desirable to look into the statistic s of the extracted lexicon as well. Pronunciation Dictionary 4 and the Shorter Oxford En glish Dictionary , we discovered that 31.1% and 47.8% of the English words were not found in the respective dictionaries. acquired a significant amount of new English vocabulary from the Web. The unsupervised learning mechanism also allows us to acquire new transliteration pairs in a more scalable and cost-effec tive manner than the manual one. 5 Furthermore, the PSM English word. Despite the fact that statis tics show that 68.48% of casual transliterations in SET1 were successful, extracting causal transliteration remains a challengi ng task that is affected by inventories and phonic rules differ from language to language. Words in the Latin [2004], a single G2P system does not work for English words of different origins. In this article, we show that prior knowledge about the Romanization system of a Chinese name Error analysis on the extracted lexicon shows that the recall rate is low for foreign words Whole SET1 80,501 394 (3,595) 21,353 1,012 of Korean and Japanese origins, which is pr obably due to the fact that Romanization rules of Korean and Japanese names were not adequately captured in a PSM model trained mainly on English-Chinese pairs. percentage of translated name entities; the PSM framework in this ar ticle does not handle such cases. There are some results reported by Al-Onaizan and Knight [2002]; Chen et al. believe that the combination of context-based and PSM approaches will provide a good solution to the problem of mixed translation and trans literation pair extraction. 7. CONCLUSIONS algorithms for PSM modeling in an EM framework. The unsupervised training algorithm performs closely to the supervised one, and provides a low-cost alternative to tap the live and dynamic Web for new transliteration pairs; (iii) we propose an e ffective EX process, recognition followed by validation . Recognition is done via a dynamic programming search strategy; validation is achieved through a hypothesis test; and (iv) we propose an expands the scope of corpus sources, as monolingual corpora are much more prevalent than parallel corpora.
