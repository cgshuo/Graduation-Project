 1. Introduction
Soft computing approaches include neural networks (NNs), fuzzy logic, support vector machines, genetic algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). Each has unique benefits when applied to particular application categories. NNs are the most commonly used soft computing approaches for inference tasks, from which many NN derivatives have been developed and applied ( Tran et al., 2007 ; Mehrjoo et al., 2008 ; Moghaddas Tafreshi and Tavakoli Mehrjardi, 2008 ; Behzad et al., 2009 ; Tsai, 2009 ; Tsai, 2010 ; Ismail and Jeng, 2011 ; Rezania et al., 2011 ). However, NNs have been characterized as  X  X  X lack box X  X  models due to the extre-mely large number of nodes and connections within their struc-tures. Since it was first proposed by Koza (1992) , GP has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to model nonlinear relationships for input X  X utput mappings. Baykasoglu et al. (2008) compared a promising set of GP approaches, including Multi Expression Programming (MEP), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) ( Oltean and Dumitrescu, 2002 ; Ferreira, 2001 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2001 ). Notably, LGP was the most efficient algorithm for studied lime-stone strengths. Differences between these algorithms are rooted in the methodology utilized to generate a GP individual. A chromo-some representation, a tree topology, and a linear string are used by MEP, GEP, and LGP, respectively. Although, some formulas generated by MEP, GEP, and LGP have coefficients, all coefficients utilized GP derivatives for construction industry problems.
Baykasoglu et al. (2009) applied GEP to determine concrete strength, cost, and slump. Yeh and Lien (2009) developed a genetic operation tree (GOT) to investigate concrete strength. The GOT uses a tree topology (as does GEP) and optimized coefficients that differ from other GP derivatives. Coefficients do not frequently appear in formulas programmed using any of these GP models. Tsai (2011) proposed a weighted GP (WGP) to introduce weight coefficients into tree connections and generate a fully weighted formula.
Shallow foundations have a depth-to-width ratio less than four. Two fundamental performance criteria are ultimate bearing capacity and foundation settlement. Ultimate bearing capacity, which depends on soil strength, is calculated using equations developed by Terzaghi (1943) , Meyerhof (1963) , Vesic (1973) , and so on. Available methods for determining the ultimate bearing capacity include limit equilibrium method ( Silvestri, 2003 ), slip line method ( Bolton and Lau, 1993 ), limit analysis method ( Soubra, 1999 ), finite element method ( Griffiths, 1982 ), etc . Of these, the limit equilibrium method is the most popular.
However, figuring out various factors affecting on the ultimate bearing capacity is difficult. Most methods require assumptions that are inconsistent with experimental data. A basic method of determining the ultimate bearing capacity of a foundation is in situ testing. However, this method is time consuming and costly. Soft computing approaches are therefore alternatives for estimating ultimate bearing capacity based on historical datasets.
Lee and Lee (1996) successfully applied NN to predict pile bearing capacity. Padmini et al. (2007) used neurofuzzy to analyze shallow foundations on cohesionless soils. Kalinli et al. (2011) also used hybrid models with fuzzy theory and NN for shallow foundations.
Although these studies agreed that soft computing approaches are more accurate compared to analytical formulas, they could not meaningfully represent ultimate bearing capacity. Although, Kalinli et al. (2011) provided formulas with ant colony optimization to calculate ultimate bearing capacity, the formula formats were for-matted before the optimization. Soft computing approaches can are potential to provide visible formulas additionally without any assumption of formula types.
 regression (EPR) and its applications had been validated in civil and Savic (2006) argued that GP is not very powerful in finding constants and that it tends to produce functions that grow in length over time. This paper significantly improves GP in finding constants and controls formula length with layered tree structures and a terminal. Additionally, EPR has to set up the number of additive terms. Detailed comparisons on EPR and the proposed model will be revealed after resultant formulas are available.

Section 5 gives conclusions. 2. Weighted genetic programming method with an NL -layered tree structure ( Fig. 1 ). The eventual layer has 2 NL 1 parameter nodes and each parameter node ( x selects one input (including a unit parameter  X  X 1 X  X ). When a unit parameter is selected, the value of the parameter node uses its weight ( i.e ., value of w is not 1) to create a coefficient. x i  X  one 1 P 1 P 2 where x i NL represents nodes in the NL -th layer and i is a related node number; P j is the j -th input parameter; and NI is the number remaining layers are operator nodes, which use operators to calculate the values of parent nodes in a down-top order and are functions of child nodes ( Fig. 1 ). Each operation node y is operated by a set of defined functions with the two child nodal inputs of x i and x j with weights of w i and w j , respectively. y  X  F  X  w i , w j , x i , x j  X  X  one
This study adopts f 0 and nine functions in Eq. (2) for each the value of the left-most parameter node as its nodal value directly. Therefore, some operator nodes do not exist in the final function and novel in WGP when compared to the work of Tsai and Lin (2011) . The f 1 is designed to inherit the left-hand side represent). Such  X  X  S  X  X  is absent in GP function sets. f operator using  X  X   X   X  X . However  X  X   X  X  operator is absent in WGP, because of f 2 being able to fulfill such with minus weights. f weights. Additionally, a lucky guess function f NF is suggested. Generally, each adopted function should be unique. However, exceptions are permitted based on user requirements. The last function in Eq. (2) is an example where a user has confidence in a lucky guess function. Although such a function can be repro-appropriate function as a candidate can markedly accelerate convergence or increase the probability that the function will appear in the final WGP results. Consequently, variables needed to be optimized includes (2 NL 1 1) operator selections, (2 parameter selections, and (2 NL 2) weight optimizations. 2.1. Soft computing polynomials Many operator functions can be created to model problems. If a lucky function is suggested, training performance will be improved markedly. However, such good luck is rare. Thus, another choice for modeling problems in a concise and simple format seems to be a good idea. Polynomials exist in a wide range of disciplines, including mathematics and applied sciences. Math-ematically, a polynomial is an expression of finite length con-structed from variables and constants using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. This study further designs a novel WGP derivative to provide polynomials for modeling engineering problems, namely, soft computing polynomials (SCP). Therefore, a new function set is designed for WGP to create SCP: y  X  F  X  w i , w j , x i , x j  X  X  one exponent term, w j ,in f 4 uses integers 1 X 10 to create positive integers as exponent terms for polynomials. The division function ( f ) in Eq. (2) is not allowed for polynomials. All materials for the WGP and SCP are considered ready, with the exception of operator selection, parameter selection, and weight optimization. Obviously, optimization generates difficult challenges for the WGP and SCP when a large NL is used. Further, trying to optimize all variable simultaneously is very difficult. A minor discrepancy in operator selection will result in very different optimized weights. Fortunately, GA is powerful for global optimization. 2.2. Genetic algorithms
The GA which imitates parts of the natural evolution process, were first proposed by Holland (1975) . GA is a stochastic search approach inspired by natural evolution that involves crossover, mutation, and evaluation of survival fitness. Genetic operators work from initial generation to offspring in order to evolve an optimal solution through generations. Each individual of a genera-tion generates a result for the problem, which is represented as a string-named chromosome. This relatively straightforward and simple implementation procedure gives GAs exceptional flexibility to hybridize with domain-dependent heuristics to create effective implementation solutions tailored to specific problems. Based on these merits, the potential to use GAs in optimization has been studied intensively ( Gen and Cheng, 1977 ). However, simple GA is difficult to apply directly and successfully to a large range of difficult-to-solve optimization problems ( Michalewicz, 1996 ).
MATLAB was employed in this study because it is a powerful tool that incorporates various function sets, including genetic algorithm ( ga function). To study how the MATLAB ga function works is essential due to the numerous parameter settings that must be set properly in order to ensure correct results. The five basic steps to use GA are (1) Initialize population  X  Initial individuals in a population are randomly generated in types of  X  X  X ouble Vector X  X  varied within 0 X 1, containing parameter selections (one x i NL node selects an attached P j ); operator selection ( F ) and weights ( w ). Values are linearly transferred to boundaries of x i NL , F , and w at integer 0 X  NI , integer 0 X 9, and float 10 X 10 respectively. (2) Evaluate individuals  X  Fitness is a major index used to evalu-ate individual status, with decreasing fitness values correlated to increasing degrees of achievement of the model objective.
In this study, the fitness function was directly set as inverse of the training root mean square error (RMSE). A larger fitness value indicates a healthier individual. (3) Perform crossover  X  A positive scalar should be set for parts of the population to perform crossover. To create crossover children, a function must be selected. This study performed a scattered (function of @crossoverscattered in MATLAB) crossover with a crossover rate of 0.8. (4) Perform mutation  X  A mutation produces spontaneous ran-dom changes in chromosomes. The MATLAB function @muta-tionuniform with a mutation rate at 0.05 was used herein. (5) Select individuals  X  The @selectionstochunif was used herein to select parents of crossover and mutation children. In additional, two elitist individuals were guaranteed to survive to the next generation herein.

Prior to model execution, two other additional major parameters that should be set include population size and iteration number.
Two parameters are set on case by case in accordance with the experienced input of experts. Th e population size chosen for this study was 200 and 5000 iterations, respectively, by trial and error. 3. Ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations
Terzaghi (1943) proposed a well known semi-empirical equation (1943) , Meyerhof (1963) developed an equation considering shearing resistance caused by a failure surface above the bottom of the foundation. The ultimate bearing capacity can be expressed as q and density bearing capacity, respectively; F cs , F qs ,and F centric loading without inclination on granular soil, most engineers apply the Meyerhof equation: q  X  Thereafter, Hansen (1970) and Vesic (1973) modified the
Meyerhof (1963) approach. Kalinli et al. (2011) , however, argued that the equations required excessive restrictions and assump-tions and inadequate calculation accuracy. 3.1. Data for ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations
Various studies have attempted to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of a shallow foundation, which primarily depends on the angle of shearing resistance and the geometry of foundations. Compared to other factors, the angle of shearing resistance f has the largest impact on the ultimate bearing capacity. The geometry of a foundation considers depth ( D ), width ultimate bearing capacity. Another important factor in ultimate bearing capacity is the unit weight of the soil ( g ). A reliability analysis by Foye et al. (2006) indicated that the key factors were f , D , B , L , and g . The current study uses datasets from Gandhi (2003) , which were tested on small-scale foundations in cohe-sionless soil. Of 50 foundation experiments, 40 were used for training and 10 were used for testing ( Table 1 ). Randomly selected training sets included all extreme values of inputs and the ultimate bearing capacity. Although, there are 47 data sets 2007 ), this study uses the data sets from Gandhi (2003) to maintain consistent data needed for providing visible formulas, parameter studies, and high accuracy for small-scale foundations.
Moreover, results herein are not useful for foundations in clayey soils, owing to datasets from tests on cohesionless soil, and they are valid within the ranges of variables ( Table 1 ). Additionally,
Padmini et al. (2007) showed that adaptive neurofuzzy inference system, artificial neural network, fuzzy inference system provide accuracies of 26.4/52.3, 52.9/77.2, and 71.1/98.0 kPa, respectively, for training/testing patterns in RMSE. 4. Results and comparisons 4.1. Predictions and visible formulas bearing capacity ( q u ) of shallow foundations. Statistical results adopts 20 runs for q u . Results focus on training/testing RMSE and  X  X  X ount X  X . The  X  X  X ount X  X  is used to count the number of activated operators. For instance, a fully linked four-layer tree has 7 opera-layer, three operator nodes are eliminated and the  X  X  X ount X  X  is 4.
Therefore, the  X  X  X ount X  X  is designed to represent the number of operator nodes needed to determine q u The  X  X  X ount X  X  is markedly related to prune the complexity of GP trees and effect on conciseness of resulted formulas. Additionally, the use of one-handed operators also positively decreases tree complexity. As
NL increases, computational time increases, the complexity of the tree structure increases, and the accuracy of computational results increases. Overall five-layer tree structures are sufficient for achieving good prediction accuracy around 10 X 15 kPa, as in WGP findings obtained by in Tsai and Lin (2011) .At NL  X  2, both
WGP and SCP perform poor. When NL is increased to 3, both WGP and SCP achieve significant improvements in prediction accuracy.
Moreover, SCP uses fewer operators to model q u and concise polynomials can be expected accordingly. The q u data ranges from 58.5 to 423.6 kPa and averaged 188.0 kPa, and models achieve accuracy from 10 to 15 kPa in RMSE, which is clearly adequate.
However, WGP has a slightly longer run time compared to SCP since WGP uses relatively more complex operator functions.
Finally, the best trial is selected among the 20 runs according to minimum training and testing RMSE summations. The final q formulas for WGP and SCP, which are expressed as q WGP uNL uNL , respectively, are as follows: q q q q q u 6  X  51 : 4log  X  10 P 2  X  X   X  4 : 56exp  X  5 : 18sin  X  4 : 43exp  X  0 : 707exp  X  0 : 0311 P q u 2  X  5 10 8 P 5 6  X  11  X  q u 3  X  29 : 5 P 2 P 5 259 P 4 P 5  X  12  X  q u 4  X  7 : 26 10 11 P 1 5 P 5 10  X  588 P 2  X  17 : 5 P 5 565  X  13  X  q u 5  X  X  0 : 116 P 5  X  0 : 00593 P 4  X  32 : 1 P 2 2 4 : 14 P q u 6  X  67 P 1  X  0 : 0535 P 5 2 : 11 P 1  X  6 : 05 P 2 2  X  5
Among WGP results, q WGP u 5 has the best RMSE accuracy at 9.61 kPa/11.8 kPa and its associated values of coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) are 0.988/0.984 for training/testing patterns.
Comparing to WGP formulas, SCP formulas are effective and easily read and studied. Of them, q SCP u 6 is proposed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations with 11.5 kPa/11.1 kPa in RMSEs and its R 2 values are 0.984/0.987.
Tree structures and optimized coefficients of q WGP u 5 and q SCP shown in Fig. 2 . Both WGP and SCP can obtain formulas without any prior setting for equation formats. Fig. 3 reveals the predic-
Values of predicted ultimate bearing capacity are consistent with desired values pretty well. 4.2. Comparisons on EPR and SCP The proposed WGP and SCP are models of symbolic regression. EPR is another symbolic data-driven technique. One of the general model structures of EPR is formed as y  X  a 0  X  Z  X  where a is a coefficient term, m is the number of non-constant terms, P is a input parameter (candidate-independent input therein), ES is a NI by m exponent matrix valued within user-defined bounds, and Z is a product of inputs. Since ERP and SCP are innately different, this paper compares them with SCP resultant formulas. In terms of Eq. (13) , four terms are included and the coefficients are products of several SCP weights. To obtain the same polynomial of Eq. (13) , EPR needs settings: four coefficient terms ranged within [ 565, 588], and a 3 by 5 ES matrix valued from 10 to 10. In Eq. (14) , there are 35 terms after simplification. Using EPR to obtain Eq. (14) , the maximum value of a should be greater than 32.1 3 , and a 35 by 5 ES matrix valued from 6 to 6 should be used. As aforementioned comparisons,
SCP shows advantages over EPR in settings of resultant polyno-mial, high flexibilities in polynomial forms, and products of weights to provide extreme coefficient values. Additionally, SCP improves GP in finding constants and does WGP in resulting polynomials. Furthermore, an extend use of SCP is revealed in the coming sub-section. 4.3. Improving semi-empirical equations
The abilities of SCP were proved in Section 4.1 . Another use is to improve analytical models using the proposed SCP. The idea of improving analytical models can be found in the work by Tsai (2011) , which used previous WGP (without  X  X  T  X  X  operators). The idea is to make a prediction based on a summation of calculations by analytical models and SCP prediction to fit the targets. There-fore, the SCP makes predictions basing on semi-empirical equa-tions and improves them. Four semi-empirical equations are selected herein for the SCP improving, namely Mey ( Meyerhof, q u
WGP 5 q u
SCP 6 1963 ), ImM (Improved Meyerhof in Kalinli et al., 2011 ), Han ( Hansen, 1970 ), and Ves ( Vesic, 1973 ). The ImM was derived from
Mey with optimized coefficients by ant colony optimization. Their associated RMSE can be calculated by the original semi-empirical equations with training/testing values at 100/117 kPa, 71.1/ 84.8 kPa, 43.4/47.6 kPa, and 62.0/79.0 kPa for Mey , ImM , Han ,and semi-empirical equations can be improved is the most important object to this SCP improving. The prediction accuracy is improved with increasing NL . However, the accuracy that a SCP achieves depends on the target semi-empirical equation and used data sets.
Huge discrepancies between the semi-empirical equation and experiment data may exist to reduce SCP accuracy in improving semi-equations. The SCP gives outstanding improvements for the four semi-empirical equations and achieves accuracy around 10 X  15 kPa ( Table 2 ). The final improved semi-empirical equations are Ves , respectively, basing on minimization of training and testing
RMSEs. The formulas are as follows: q Mey u 2  X  Mey 19 : 9 P 2 P 5  X  18  X  q Mey u 3  X  Mey  X  X  38 : 8 P 5 83 : 6 P 4  X  X  0 : 0998 P 3 10 : 1 P q Mey u 4  X  Mey  X  X  411 12 : 6 P 5  X  X  P 3 3  X  0 : 0523 P 5 q Mey u 5  X  Mey  X  X  0 : 0824 P 3 3 292 P 2  X  P 1 q Mey u 6  X  Mey 42100 P 2 P 25 1 7 : 31  X  0 : 0276 P 5  X  0 : 0181 P q ImM u 2  X  ImM  X  10 P 3 1 : 78 P 5  X  23  X  q ImM u 3  X  ImM  X  X  0 : 982 P 3 62 : 3 P 2  X  X  4 : 51 P 5 9 : 74 P q ImM u 4  X  ImM  X  2 : 75 P 3  X  0 : 102 P 5  X  9 : 97 P 2  X  q ImM u 5  X  ImM  X  9 : 27 P 3 7 : 58 q u 6  X  ImM  X  32600 P 2 2 1000 P 2 2 P 5 333 P 1 P 2 P 3 q u 2  X  Han 9 : 99 10 8 P 2  X  28  X  q u 3  X  Han  X  3 : 4 P 4  X  5 : 04 P 3 23 P 2 P 5  X  29  X  q u 4  X  Han  X  6 : 53 P 3 230 P 2  X  314 P 1  X  700 P 2  X  9 : 99 0 : 42 P q u 5  X  Han  X  X  9850 P 3 18500 P 5  X  P 4 2 83 : 3 P 2 q u 6  X  Han  X  4 : 73 P 3  X  25 : 4 213 P 2  X  4 : 58 10 9 P 9 q u 2  X  Ves 12 : 1 P 2 P 5  X  33  X  q u 3  X  Ves  X  43 : 1  X  6 : 77 P 3 29 : 7 P 2 P 5  X  34  X  q u 4  X  Ves  X  X  8070 P 2 413  X  10 12 P 7 5  X  87 P 2 P 3 q u 5  X  Ves  X  0 : 0124 P 2 P 4  X  1 : 75 P 5  X  68 P 1  X  24 : 2  X   X  82 : 8 P 2 P 5 14 : 4 P 3 30 17800000 P 7 2 1810 P 2  X  X  36  X  q u 6  X  Ves  X  0 : 909  X  0 : 302 P 2 P 5  X  8 : 82 P 2  X 
This study selects q Mey u 5 , q ImM u 5 , q Han u 5 ,and q Ves based on prediction accuracy and simple polynomials for improving semi-equations with accuracy at 16.9/16.7 kPa, 16.1/9.1 kPa, 11.4/9.8 kPa, and 10.8/10.5 kPa, respectively. Their associated R 2 are 0.965/0.970, 0.968/0 .991, 0.984/0.990, and 0.960/0.975 with good consis tency between predicted and desired values. Additional to SC P prediction, visible formulas facilitate parameter studies. Table 3 shows the occurrences of input parameters in the Eqs. (18) X (37) . Obviously, P 1 does not frequently impact on improving ImM and neither does P 4 on both Han and Ves. P 2 , P 3 ,and P 5 are indeed significant in improving all semi-empirical equations, especially P 5 .The resultant formulas are restricted for foundations lying on cohesionless soils in lab conditions which are not under eccentric loading. Additionally, the same process can be applied to Eqs. (6) X (15) to discuss parameter impacts in directly modeling q u . However, quantitative evidences are hard to be achieved for studying parameter impacts on modeling q u or improving semi-empirical equations of q u . 4.4. Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis can be applied to assess the impact of parameters ( Scardi and Harding, 1999 ). A common approach in sensitivity analysis is to change one factor at a time to deter-mineitseffectonoutput.Thisworkadoptsmeanvaluesforall inputs and standard deviation of a targeted input is treated as the variation of the factor changed.

SA  X  V  X  M  X  d i  X  V  X  M  X  X  38  X 
SA  X  V  X  M d i  X  V  X  M  X  X  39  X  where M represents mean values of all inputs, d i is the standard deviation of the i -th input and impacts the mean value of the i -th input ( Table 1 ), and V is an output value calculated by SCP formulas. Therefore, SA 1 i is a sensitivity measurement with a positive variation on the i -th input and SA 2 i with a negative variation. Table 4 lists the sensitivity results of SCP formulas.
When an input parameter is linear in an SCP formula, the values of SA 1 i and SA 2 i are the same. As the effect of the i -th 1 . 4 + + insensitive to outputs, it can be omitted or replaced.
From Table 4 , P 1 and P 4 are absent or not significant in improving Ves and can be removed from q Ves uNL formulas.
Thereby, P 2 , P 3 ,and P 5 are concern with modifying or improving parameter impacts. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis process is no doubt applicable for Eqs. (18) X (32) to study factors in improving modeling q u . 4.5. Pruned SCP formulas pruning technique ( Peng et al., 2009 ), which replaces an input with a fixed value ( e.g ., a mean or median) to determine how outputs are affected by the input. The pruning technique can also be used to prune/compact formulas. For instance, q Ves training/testing RMSEs of 10.8/10.5 kPa (step (a) in Table 5 ).
Process follows that replacing a parameter step by step. As P replaced by its mean value, RMSEs increase to 49.8/54.8 kPa (step (b) in Table 5 ), which are not acceptable. Removing P
RMSEs of 31.2/31.2 kPa are slightly unacceptable. To prune (f) X (j) in Table 5 , P 1 and P 4 are the options to be replaced by their mean values. Therefore, P 1 and P 4 are selected for simultaneous removal as in step ( k ), and the attached RMSEs are 13.3/11.0 kPa. Since the polynomial in step ( k ) gives a good accuracy, it is suggested to be a substitution for q Ves u 5 ever, the coefficients in the polynomial of step ( k )arenotyet optimized. Step (l) uses GAs to optimize coefficients in step ( m ) and achieves further accuracy of 12.2/10.6 kPa. Summarily, the polynomial in step (l) is more suitable to be a substitution for
Summarily, the polynomial in step (l) supports the significance of D , L / B ,and f in improving Ves . Parameter impacts on improving Ves are studied sequentially in Fig. 5 . The studied parameter is varied within t he data boundaries and other parameters use their mean values 7 1 standard deviation of training data ( D : 0.0819 7 0.0398; L / B :3.98 7 2.46; and f : 38.8 7 3.30 in Table 1 ). Among the three parameters, D impacts the most and almost all of the three add negative impacts on improving Ves .Theimpactsof D and f are negatively corre-lated to the additive q u for improving Ves and L / B shows positive correlation to the additive q u . Such evidences give useful information for researchers who work on improving Ves .
Certainly, other semi-empirical equations can be handled with similar process and the pruning techniques are also applicable for Eqs. (6) X (15) to model q u . 5. Conclusions
This study proposes WGP and SCP for modeling the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations and improving its semi-empirical equations. Both models achieve good prediction accu-as follows: 1. Previous WGP is improved with a terminate operator, which reduces tree complexity and makes formulas compact.
 2. Visible formulas are bonus production of the WGP and
SCP compared with black-box approaches. Unlike analy-tical models, the proposed WGP and SCP directly provide functional relationships for the ultimate bearing capacity based on fitting data without a prior setting of equation formats. 3. The SCP provides polynomials for the ultimate bearing capa-city and gives simple solutions for problems. 4. Improving semi-empirical equations with soft computing approaches is a novel idea. It is initiated by WGP X  X  and SCP X  X  abilities of generating visible formulas. This may open a new avenue for improving existing models using soft computing approaches. 5. Visible formulas make parameter studies, sensitivity analysis, and application of pruning techniques easy. 6. This paper obtains D , L / B , and f as significant factors for improving the semi-empirical Ves for foundations on cohesion-less soils without eccentric loading.
