 Search result diversification has recently gained attention as a means to tackle ambiguous queries. While query ambigu-ity is of particular concern for the short queries commonly observed in a Web search scenario, it is unclear how much di-versity is actually promoted by Web search engines (WSEs). In this paper, we assess the diversification performance of two leading WSEs in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks. Our results show that these WSEs perform effectively for queries with multiple in-terpretations, but not for those open to multiple aspects related to a single interpretation. Moreover, by deploying a state-of-the-art diversification approach based on query sug-gestions from these WSEs themselves, we show that their diversification performanc e can be further improved.

Queries submitted to a Web search engine (WSE) are typ-ically short and often ambiguous [5]. In such a scenario, an effective approach is to diversify the search results. By doing so, the probability of satisfying potentially different informa-tion needs underlying an ambiguous query is maximised [3]. Although search result diversification is a naturally moti-vated approach in a Web search scenario, it is unclear how much diversity is actually promoted by existing WSEs. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of two leading WSEs in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks [1, 2]. By breaking down this assess-ment over queries with different levels of ambiguity, we show that these WSEs perform effectively for queries open to mul-tiple interpretations, but not for those open to multiple as-pects of a single interpretation. In the latter case, we show that both WSEs can be further improved by leveraging ev-idence readily available to them X  X .e., query suggestions X  within a state-of-the-art diversification approach.
In the rest of this paper, Section 2 describes our method-ology and the experimental setup that supports our investi-gations in Section 3. Our conclusions follow in Section 4.
Our investigations aim to answer two research questions: 1. How diverse are WSEs X  search results? 2. Can we improve WSEs X  diversification performance?
We investigate both questions in the context of the di-versity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks [1, 2]. These tasks provide a total of 98 queries (50 from 2009, 48 from 2010), each classified by TREC assessors as ei-ther ambiguous (i.e., open to different interpretations )or underspecified (i.e., open to different aspects of a single in-terpretation) [3]. Moreover, each query comprises relevance assessments for 1 to 6 sub-topics, identified by TREC as-sessors as representing differe nt interpretations or aspects of the query. Besides reportin g average performance figures over all 98 queries, we break down our evaluation for queries with different types (ambiguous vs. underspecified) as well as with different number of sub-topics (1 to 6).

As WSEs, we consider Bing and Google, henceforth re-ferred to as WSEs A and B, in no particular order, so as to preserve anonymity. In particular, for each of the con-sidered 98 queries, we obtain up to 1000 results from these WSEs using their public APIs. 1 The URLs retrieved by each WSE are then normalised and matched against those in the TREC ClueWeb09 corpus. While this procedure is necessary to enable the reuse of the TREC Web track rele-vance assessments, the obtained rankings should be seen as a  X  X ower bound X  of what these WSEs could have produced if they constrained themselves to the ClueWeb09 corpus. To provide an ample analysis, we consider both ClueWeb09 A, with 500 million English Web pages, and its first-tier subset, ClueWeb09 B, which comprises 50 million pages.

To investigate whether there is room for improving the di-versification performance of these WSEs, we deploy a state-of-the-art diversification framework to re-rank their retrieved results. In particular, the xQuAD framework [4] X  X ne of the top performers at the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks [1, 2] X  X uilds upon an explicit represen-tation of the aspects underlying an ambiguous query. Fol-lowing Santos et al. [4], we re-rank the results retrieved by each WSE using xQuAD, with query suggestions X  X rovided by the WSE itself X  X epresenting different query aspects. As xQuAD requires an estimation of the relevance of each result for every query aspect, we score all the results retrieved for a query with respect to each query suggestion using BM25. Requests were sent anonymously to the US version of the WSEs, so as to isolate any customisation or localisation ef-fects. All results were retrieved on February 7th, 2011.
Clarke et al. [1, 2] have shown that rankings produced by a WSE outperform all systems in the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks. While this result suggests that WSEs indeed seek to diversify their search results, it is unclear how much diversity they actually promote under different scenarios. To investigate this, Table 1 shows the diversification performance of WSEs A and B in contrast to each other and as input to the xQuAD diversification frame-work. In particular, we break down this evaluation across two orthogonal dimensions: document corpora and query ambiguity level. The first dimension covers a large sample of the Web (ClueWeb09 A) and a high-quality, first-tier subset of this sample (ClueWeb09 B). The second dimension groups all 98 available queries from the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks according to their type (ambiguous or underspecified) or their number of sub-topics. Diversification performance is given by ERR-IA and  X  -nDCG, both at rank cutoff 20. Significance is verified for WSE B compared to WSE A, as well as for xQuAD compared to WSEs A and B, according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In particular, the symbols ( )and ( ) denote a significant increase (decrease) at the p&lt; 0 . 01 and p&lt; 0 . 05 levels, respectively, while the symbol = denotes no significant difference.

Focusing on the ClueWeb09 A results, we note that WSE B outperforms WSE A on the whole set of 98 queries (signifi-cantly for ERR-IA). Looking at the breakdown by type, we observe that the higher performance of WSE A comes mostly from underspecified queries, for which it significantly outper-forms WSE B. Indeed, when ambiguous queries are consid-ered, the two WSEs do not differ significantly. In terms of the number of sub-topics underlying a query, WSE B con-sistently outperforms WSE A regardless of the number of sub-topics, although not significantly. When xQuAD is de-ployed on top of these WSEs (using each WSE X  X  own query suggestions), no significant difference is observed for am-biguous queries. Regarding our first question, this suggests that Web search results are highly diverse, at least for am-biguous queries. For underspecified queries, however, both WSEs can be markedly improved (significantly for WSE A) with xQuAD. Regarding our second question, this shows that there is room for improving these WSEs X  diversification performance, by leveraging their own query suggestions. The results for ClueWeb09 B confirm these observations. In particular, WSE B significantly outperforms WSE A on the entire query set. Besides still markedly outperforming WSE A for underspecified queries, we observe that WSE B is now also significantly superior for ambiguous queries. Once again, the number of sub-topics does not play a signifi-cant role in explaining the relative performance of these two WSEs, with WSE B consistently outperforming WSE A. Lastly, we once more observe that xQuAD significantly im-proves both WSEs, with gains coming from underspecified queries, but not from ambiguous queries.
We have thoroughly investigated the diversification per-formance of two leading WSEs in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks. Our results ex-pand on initial observations from the literature by analysing how diverse Web search results are for queries with differ-ent ambiguity levels. In particular, we have shown that the considered WSEs are already very effective at diversifying the results for ambiguous queries. However, when under-specified queries are considered, we have shown that there is room for significantly improving these WSEs X  performance by leveraging their own query suggestions. [1] C. L. A.
