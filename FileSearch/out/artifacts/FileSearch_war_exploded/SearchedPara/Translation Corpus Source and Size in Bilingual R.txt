 Large parallel corpora are an increasingly available commodity. Such texts are the fuel of statistical machine translation systems and are used in appli-cations such as cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). Several beliefs are commonly held regard-ing the relationship between parallel text quality and size for CLIR. It is thought that larger texts should be better, because the problems of data sparseness and untranslatable terms are reduced. Similarly, par-allel text from a domain more closely related to a document collection should lead to better bilingual retrieval performance, again because better lexical translations are available.

We compared four sources of parallel text us-ing CLEF document collections in eight languages (Braschler and Peters, 2004). English topic sets from 2000 to 2007 were used. Corpus-based trans-lation of query terms was performed and documents were ranked using a statistical language model ap-proach to retrieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998). Exper-iments were conducted using unlemmatized words and character 5-grams. No use was made of pre-translation query expansion or automated relevance feedback. Information about the four parallel texts used in our experiments is provided in Table 1. We restricted our focus to Dutch (NL), English (EN), Finnish (FI), French (FR), German (DE), Italian (IT), Portuguese (PT), Spanish (ES), and Swedish (SV). These lan-guages are covered by each parallel corpus. 2.1 Bible The bible corpus is based on the 66 books in the Old and New Testaments. Alignments at the verse level were used; there are 31103 verses in the English text. 2.2 JRC-Acquis v3 This parallel text is based on EU laws comprising the Acquis Communautaire and translations are avail-able in 22 languages. The English portion of the acquis data includes 1.2 million aligned passages containing over 32 million words, which is approxi-mately 40 times larger than the Biblical text. Align-ments were provided with the corpus and were pro-duced by the Vanilla algorithm. 1 The alignments are at roughly the sentence level, but only 85% corre-spond to a single sentence in both languages. 2.3 Europarl v3 The Europarl corpus was assembled to support ex-periments in statistical machine translation (Koehn, 2005). The documents consist of transcribed dia-logue from the official proceedings of the European Parliament. We used the precomputed alignments that are provided with the corpus, and which are based on the algorithm by Gale and Church (1991). The alignments are believed to be of high quality. 2.4 Official Journal of the EU The Official Journal of the European Union covers a wide range of topics such as agriculture, trade, and foreign relations. We constructed this parallel cor-pus by downloading documents dating from January 1998 through April 2004 and converting the texts from Adobe X  X  Portable Document Format (PDF) to ISO-8859-1 encoded text using pdftotext . The doc-uments were segmented into pages and into para-graphs consisting of a small number of sentences (typically 1 to 3); however this process was compli-cated by the fact that many documents have outline or tabular formatting. Alignments were produced using Church X  X  char align software (1993).

Due to complexities of decoding the PDF, some of the accented characters were not extracted properly, but this is a problem mostly for the earlier material in the collection. In total about 85 million words of text per language was obtained, which is over twice the size of either the acquis or europarl collections. Using the pairwise-aligned corpora described above, parallel indexes for each corpus were created using words and 5-grams. Query translation was accom-plished as follows. For each query term s , source language documents from the aligned collection that contain s are identified. If no document contains this term, then it is left untranslated. Each target lan-guage term t appearing in the corresponding docu-ments is scored: where F l and F c are relative document frequencies based on local subset of documents and the whole corpus. IDF ( t ) is the inverse document frequency, or log 2 ( N highest score replaced the original query term and the transformed query vector is used for retrieval against the target language collection.

This is a straightforward approach to query trans-lation. More sophisticated methods have been pro-posed, including bidirectional translation (Wang and Oard, 2006) and use of more than one translation candidate per query term (Pirkola et al., 2003).
Subword translation, the direct translation of character n-grams, offers several advantages over translating words (McNamee and Mayfield, 2005). N-grams provide morphological normalization, translations of multiword expressions are suggested by translation of word-spanning n-grams, and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words can be be partly trans-lated with n-gram fragments. Additionally, there are few OOV n-grams, at least for n = 4 and n = 5 . We describe two experiments. The first examines the efficacy of the different translation resources and the second measures the relationship between cor-pus size and retrieval effectiveness. English was the sole source language. 4.1 Translation Resources First the relationship between translation source and bilingual retrieval effectiveness is studied. Table 2 reports mean average precision when word-based to-kenization and translation was performed for each of the target collections. For comparison the cor-responding performance using topics in the target language ( mono ) is also given. As expected, the smallest bitext, bible , performs the worst. Averaged across the eight languages only 39% relative effec-tiveness is seen compared to monolingual perfor-mance. Reports advocating the use of religious texts for general purpose CLIR may have been overly op-timistic (Chew et al., 2006). Both acquis and eu-roparl are roughly 40 times larger in size than bible and both do significantly better; however europarl is clearly superior and achieves 75% of monolingual effectiveness. Though nearly twice the size, ojeu fails to outperform europarl and just barely beats acquis . Likely reasons for this include difficulties properly converting the ojeu data to text, problem-atic alignments, and the substantially greater length of the aligned passages.

The same observations can be seen from Table 3 where 5-grams were used for tokenization and trans-lation instead of words. The level of performance with 5-grams is higher and these improvements are statistically significant with p &lt; 0 . 01 ( t-test). 2 Av-eraged across the eight languages gains from 30% to 47% were seen using 5-grams, depending on the re-source. As a translation resource europarl still out-performs the other sources in each of the eight lan-guages and the relative ordering of { europarl, ojeu, acquis, bible } is the same in both cases. 4.2 Size of Parallel Text To investigate how corpus size effects bilingual retrieval we subsampled europarl and used these smaller subcorpora for translation. The entire cor-pus is 33 million words in size, and samples of 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% were made based on counting documents, which for europarl is equivalent to counting sentences. Samples were taken by processing the data in chronological order.
In Figure 1 (a-d) the effect of using larger parallel corpora is plotted for four languages. Mean average precision is on the vertical axes, and for visual effect the chart for each language pair uses the same scale. The general shape of the curves is to rise quickly as increasing subsets from 1% to 10% are used and to flatten as size increases further. Curves for the other four languages (not shown) are quite similar. The deceleration of improvement with increasing cor-pus size can be explained by Heap X  X  Law. Similar results have been obtained in the few studies that have sought to quantify bilingual retrieval perfor-mance as a function of translation resource size (Xu and Weischedel, 2000; Demner-Fushman and Oard, 2003). In the higher complexity languages such as German and Finnish, n-grams appear to be gaining a slight improvement even when the entire corpus is used; vocabulary size is greater in those languages.
The data for the 0% condition were based on cognate matches for words and  X  X ognate n-grams X  that require no translation. The figure reveals that even very small amounts of parallel text quickly im-prove performance. The 2% condition is roughly the size of bible , but is higher performing, likely due to a better domain match. 3 Using a subsample of only 5% of available data from the highest perform-ing translation resource, europarl , 5-grams outper-formed plain words using any amount of bitext. We examined issues in corpus-based bilingual re-trieval, including the importance of parallel corpus selection and size, and the relative effectiveness of alternative tokenization methods. Size is not the only important factor in corpus-based bilingual re-trieval, the quality of alignments, compatibility in genre, and choice of tokenization are also important.
We found that character 5-gram tokenization out-performs words when used both for translation and document indexing. Large relative improvements (over 30%) were observed with 5-grams, and when only limited parallel data is available for translation, n-grams are markedly more effective than words.
Future work could address some limitations of the present study by using bidirectional translation mod-els, considering other language families and source languages other than English, and applying query expansion techniques.
