 The paper systematically explores the social dimens ion of external interruptions of human activities. Interruptions an d interruption handling are key issues in human-computer interacti on (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) research . However, existing research has almost exclusively d ealt with effects of interruptions on individual tasks. In th is paper we call for expanding the scope of analysis by including th e effect of interruptions on the social context. We identify fo ur facets of the social  X  X ipple effect X  of interruptions: location, communication, collaboration, and interpersonal relation. We discu ss the advantages of extending the notion of interruptions and its implications for future research.

Modern communication technologies prompt task inter ruptions: for instance, e-mail clients may provide interrupti ons throughout the day when notifying about incoming messages [48] . As a consequence, knowledge work often takes place in wo rk settings characterized by frequent interruptions [24, 36, 57 , 61]. The problem is aggravated by the fact that the work of the knowledge worker consists, to a large degree, of tasks that i nvolve high cognitive load and are therefore vulnerable for int erruptions [6]. Interruptions are likely to continue to be a popula r object of CSCW studies in the years to come. Despite a relati vely strong history of research on the issue, dealing with inte rruptions remains a problem that still awaits effective and r eliable solutions. In our view, a necessary condition for further prog ress is developing a deeper, more comprehensive understandi ng of interruptions that would take into account the actu al complexity of the phenomena. Current studies of interruptions are mostly dealing with the effect of interruptions on individ ual work. There are examples of studies, in which the scope has bee n expanded, for instance, by including into analysis those indi viduals who are responsible for interruptions [51, 69], but most st udies only deal with individual tasks directly affected by an inter ruption, and often focus on a single technology or feature [19, 24]. In this paper we provide arguments that a narrow fo cus on individual tasks and individual users is an obstacl e to further research. An adequate understanding and support of interruptions requires placing the phenomena into a broader conte xt. Without taking into account a broader social context, inter ruptions cannot be even judged as negative or positive [13, 36, 46, 52, 54, 68, 71]. Furthermore, without taking into account the social dimension of interruptions we cannot understand the reasons why people react to interruptions in a certain way and how they use different interruption handling strategies under different ci rcumstances. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an overview and discussion of existing stu dies of interruptions in HCI and CSCW. The section conclud es that an important next step in interruption research would be to widen the scope of analysis and include collective and organi zational factors in order to complement the partial picture created by prior studies. The third section presents and illustrates four fa cets of the  X  X ipple effect X  of interruptions, that is, the effect that transcends the immediate impact of an interruption on the individu al X  X  task at hand. The facets of the  X  X ipple effect X  are describ ed through the notions of location, communication, collaboration, and interpersonal relation . The fourth section reflects on the implication of the notions of the social dimension of interruptions  X  and the identified facets of the  X  X ipple effect X  --for HCI and CSCW research. The fifth section discusses the limi tations of existing technologies. Finally, the sixth section c oncludes the paper with a summary and reflections on the prospec ts for future research. In this section we present an attempt to categorize previously conducted HCI and CSCW research on interruptions an d interruption handling according to the foci of the studies, namely: (1) research concerning the effects of interruption s on the individual, (2) research concerning the ways to sto p disruptive interruptions from occurring, and (3) research conc erning the ways to limit the damage caused by interruptions. S ome studies appear in several categories due to the fact that t hey touch upon several aspects of interruptions at the same time. Most studies found interruptions to be intrusive an d having almost exclusively negative effects [13, 46, 54, 68 ]. Interruptions are generally characterized as corporate time-waste rs that we need to deal with. They have also been blamed for affect ing our mental state negatively [8, 71]. Some studies, however, de scribe a more complex picture and suggest that some effects of in terruptions are not necessarily negative [52, 71]. For instance, positive effects of interruptions wer e found by Speier et al. [59, 60] and Bailey et al. [7, 8]. O X  Conaill and Frohlich [52], who conducted a study of work practi ces of information workers using the shadowing observation technique, found the recipients of interruptions to experience some benefits from the interruptions in 64 percent of the cases. Other researchers also reported a mixed effect of i nterruptions on task performance. The results of a series of experi ments conducted by Burmistrov and Leonova [14] suggest that interru ptions facilitate individual performance in case of simple tasks, but inhibit performance in case of complex tasks. McCri ckard et al. [50] also observed both negative and positive effec ts of interruptions. Examples of positive effects include d awareness of peripheral information, access to instantaneous com munication, and fast availability of important information. Thi s ambivalent characteristic of interruptions is the reason why t he attitudes towards them are characterized by a tension between avoidance and appreciation [36]. Existing research provides ample evidence that inte rruptions are common in modern workplaces. In organizations worke rs spend a considerable amount of time having short conversati ons [36, 53, 70], many of which --up to 90 percent  X  are not pl anned [70]. This suggests that these conversations may imply in terruptions for at least one of the involved parties [57]. O X  X onail l and Frohlich [52] found that mobile professionals usually act in environments characterized by constant interruptions, where appr oximately 10 minutes in every hour are spent on being engaged in activities initiated by an interruption. Gonzalez and Mark [31 ] found that their subjects (analysts, managers and software dev elopers) on average were able to focus on a task for about thre e minutes before switching to another task. Sproull et al. [6 2] found that 80 percent of the daily work of managers was spent in short interactions and that their activities were interru pted 21 percent of the time. According to Cutrell et al. [20], one of the factor s that determine the potential damage of an interruption is timing. Most damage is caused when interruptions occur during the evaluati on phase of a task. Such interruptions result in longer completio n times compared to interruptions that occur during other p hases of work. Another aspect that affected the disruptive effect of an interruption was the relevance of an interruption t o the current task. Interruptions, which were irrelevant to the c urrent task, caused more disruption and longer resumption time t han interruptions that were relevant to the task at han d. Similar results concerning the consequences of interruptions were f ound in other studies, as well [2, 7, 12, 22, 59]. Since interruptions are often disruptive, a natural strategy of dealing with them would be to simply stop them from happening. The most obvious way to avoid being interrupted is to make people aware that we do not want to be disturbed. I n the physical office this can be achieved quite easily, for examp le when we arrange the spatial layout of stacks of books and p apers as an attempt to create a  X  X all X  behind which we can work in peace and quiet [10] or when we keep our office doors closed [40]. Lightweight techniques of this kind are much more d ifficult to employ when it comes to computer-mediated interrupt ions. In computer-mediated communication availability is typ ically understood as a binary,  X  X es or no X  state [44]. Som e studies [42, 43] question this understanding. Instead, they sugg est that people want to be constantly available --but not for all sorts of communication. This statement leads to the concept of availability management, a concept defined as  X  X he ways in which a person signals to other persons in the surroundings (inclu ding also online contacts) if he/she is open to communication or not  X  [33]. According to Harr and Wiberg [33], there are two ap proaches for managing one X  X  availability, the explicit approach and the implicit approach. By explicit availability management they refer to design of different kinds of technical support that consid er availability as presence and enable users to toggle between diverse availability/presence profiles or modes, as in earl y versions of ICQ (users made explicit switches between diverse m odes of status,  X  X way X  or  X  X ccupied X ). There have also been some attempts to deal with availability through implicit means an d two approaches can be identified, the strategy of autom ated calculation and the use of different kinds of offic e shares, i.e. technologies that connect several distributed offic es together through some or several kinds of media. Automated calculation is a strategy based upon auto mated information gathering from diverse input sensors, s uch as speech detectors (e.g., [27, 28, 29, 37]), or combinations of diverse sensors, such as sound and motion detectors (e.g., [9]). Employing this strategy has resulted in a number of examples of computer-based techniques that supervise the mouse and keyboard activity of the individual as an indicator of whether or not the individual is present in a certain setting. This information is then converted into a signal for others to act u pon, such as icons with different colors and shapes [32, 67], or sound s [18, 32, 45]. The second strategy, the use of  X  X ffice shares X , em ploys various types of video glimpses [64], video snapshots [26, 38, 41], or Media spaces, [1, 11, 15, 30, 34, 47, 56]. These of fice shares enable individuals to verify the availability of ot hers based upon the information presented through glimpses, snapsho ts, or audio/video transmissions. Since the work of individuals, groups and organizat ions might benefit from some interruptions, while being disrup ted by others, there have been attempts to develop different kinds of filtering systems [e.g. 9, 27, 28, 29] and explore more fine-grained availability management techniques [33]. As a whole , this line of research indicates that most people prefer taking t he trouble of dealing with interruptions to shutting down complet ely from external interruptions and thus running the risk of missing valuable information. If individuals cannot shield themselves from interr uptions, for instance, because they are concerned about missing valuable information, an alternative way to deal with interr uptions could be trying to decrease the damage caused by interruptio ns that do occur. In section 2.1 we mentioned some studies inv estigating the disruptive effects of interruptions. These studies suggest certain strategies of making interruptions less harmful, su ch as managing the timing of an interruption or only allowing inte rruptions, which are relevant to the task at hand. For example, if s ufficient awareness information is provided, the timing of in terruptions could be adjusted to decrease the disruptive effect of an interruption [2, 22]. Other strategies for minimizing the damage caused b y interruptions include using different communication channels or modal outputs. For example, interruptions can be m ade less disruptive by using different modalities such as he at, smell, sound, vibrations and light [5] to minimize interfe rence between perceptual and cognitive processes involved in inte rruption handling and task performance. An example of technology specifically designed to m ake interruptions less disruptive is The Negotiator sys tem developed by Wiberg and Whittaker [69]. The system supports t he user in handling interruptions that have already attracted attention of the individual; it aims to make interruption handling l ess cognitively demanding. Among other things The Negotiator allowe d the receiver of an incoming call to negotiate with the sender an appropriate time for interaction if the received ca nnot take care of the interruption at the moment of the call. This wa y of dealing with interruptions does not stop them from occurrin g. In fact, it might increase the number of interruptions for the individual, but could make them less disruptive. The system makes i t possible for the individual to decide upon the time when he or s he wants to handle an interruption, and thus brings to synchron ous communication some advantages of asynchronous media [52, 55] Another way to cope with the disruptive effect of i nterruptions is to shorten the resumption lag, that is, the time ne eded to collect one X  X  thoughts and resume working on a task when th e interruption is over [3]. Altman and Trafton [3] ex amined the role of external cues associated with the interrupted ta sk. It was found that providing cues that are available to the indiv idual just before an interruption can help increase his or her perfor mance immediately after the interruption. In a similar ve in, Czerwinski et al. [23] found a navigable video log of the compute r screen to be beneficial for resumption of a previous task after a longer period of time. However, reviewing those logs demands time from the user, which somewhat undermines the usefulness of t he logs, since time is a scarce resource for many informatio n workers [24]. The previous research, discussed above, indicates t hat when dealing with interruptions people face three fundam ental dilemmas. If workers make themselves unavailable fo r interruptions they may be able to more fully focus on their current tasks, but by doing so they also increase the proba bility of missing important news. If workers provide ample informatio n about the current status of their activities they may help ot hers to select an optimal time for an interruption, but by doing so t hey also may jeopardize their privacy. If workers postpone deali ng with an interruption to a more convenient time they could p ay more attention to the task at hand, but by doing so they also engender one more thing to take care of in the future. There are no simple universal solutions to these di lemmas. In each particular case individuals need to find optimal tr adeoffs between seclusion and availability, openness and privacy, a nd direct or delayed handling of an interruption. Finding optima l interruption handling strategies is anything but trivial. Unfort unately, existing research does not provide much insight on how peopl e select specific strategies depending on the specific conte xt. Most prior studies of interruptions are laboratory experiments conducted in artificial controlled environments (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 8, 14, 19, 71]). Not all interruption research is based on controlle d experiments; a number of papers report studies conducted in real w ork environments (e.g., [36, 57, 63]). However, studies of the latter type are relatively rare. As a result, most studies  X  even those conducted in everyday settings  X  focus on individual behavior and attitud es towards interruptions [2, 3, 5, 14, 24, 25, 35, 57], while somewhat underplaying the importance of the social context, in which individuals, as members of teams, groups or organiz ations, suffer or benefit from interruptions. The implications of explicitly or implicitly adopti ng the positivist paradigm in studies of groups and teams  X  and espec ially the way it promotes laboratory experiments as a  X  X olden sta ndard X  of research  X  have been discussed elsewhere. For insta nce, Shea and Guzzo [58] argue that laboratory experiment is a le ss suitable method for studying team performance because it ove rsimplifies the natural contexts of teamwork. 1 We believe an important next step in studying inter ruptions is to widen the scope of analysis and include the social context in interruption research. The social dimension of inte rruptions should become a key issue in interruption research because it can help: (a) understand the role interruptions play in work practices, (b) understand the strategies used by collaborating individuals to initiate and handle interruptions in concrete conte xts, and (c) identify the prospects for technological support of people and organizations in managing interruptions as a part o f their everyday work. As repeatedly emphasized throughout this paper, the focus of existing studies of interruptions has been predomin antly on individual tasks. An interruption as an event is ty pically described in such studies by identifying the following aspect s: Similar claims have been made by Arrow et al. [4] and 
Kaptelinin and Harr [39]. However, this analytical framework, which does not include the social context, in which the event is taking place, is not sufficient. In the rest of this section we will identify a numb er of facets comprising the social dimension of interruptions. T his is a preliminary exploration, and our aim is not to prov ide a definitive and comprehensive description of the social context . Our ambition is more modest: we propose a first draft o f a conceptual map of the problem; a map that is expected to be fu rther elaborated and revised in future research. In the following sections we identify four differen t facets, or  X  X imensions X , along which an interruption can have effects beyond particular tasks directly affected by the in terruption. The discussion below is only related to cases where another person causes an external disruption of a person X  X  task. The cases of internal interruptions (or  X  X elf-interruptions X ) , such as cases when we suddenly remember that we have to do someth ing and then switch to another task, as well as cases of  X  X  mpersonal X  interruptions, such as those caused by fire alarms or earthquakes, are outside the scope of our analysis. Furthermore, we do not consider the positive effects of interruptions, lim iting our focus to negative effects. This leads us to the following de finition of an external interruption: an external event that cause s a disruption of the process of completing a task. 2 When one person interrupts another, the interruptio n event takes place within the context of an interpersonal relati on between the one who initiates the interruption (the interrupter ) and the one who is interrupted (the interruptee ). The event is, at least partly, determined by the past history of the relation, and , in turn, the event may influence the way that the relation is go ing to develop in the future (see Figure 1). For instance, the int erruptee may feel obligated to return a favor received in the past an d because of that may endanger his or her current task by positively responding to an interrupter X  X  request. In general, the interrupter and the interruptee hav e different agendas and priorities, and their choice of strateg ies is likely to be determined by anticipated costs and benefits of ava ilable options. The interrupter has to assess the situation and mak e a decision about whether or not he or she can or should interr upt. If the interrupter decides not to interrupt, then a number of further decisions should be made, such as deciding to make an attempt later on and, probably, creating a reminder. Defining tasks is a separate issue, which is beyon d the scope of this paper; one way to deal with it is to let the s ubjects define what their tasks are, cf. [24]. Other social factors such as power relations, work roles or friendship might also affect the behavior of both t he interruptee and the interrupter. For instance, it is reasonable to believe that an interruptee is more inclined to accept an interrupt ion from someone positioned higher up in the organizational hierarchy. Therefore, most interruptions can be properly descr ibed as an unfolding interaction between two (or more) parties , in which they mutually ascertain each other X  X  positions, est ablish priorities, assess available options, and negotiate a range of issues. For instance, the interaction between the interrupter a nd the interruptee can take the form of availability negot iation [69]. Other issues negotiated by the interrupter and inte rruptee can include the relative urgency of their respective ta sks, local norms and rules, the impact of the outcome of the interru ption on the interpersonal relation between the actors, and so f orth. Even if an interruption is specifically directed at one person, it can also have an effect on other persons that happen to be at the same location. For instance, in certain settings, such a s the theater, it is not uncommon to ask people in the audience to switc h off their mobile phones. The main concern here is not about p otential call receivers but rather about other people attending t he performance, as well as the actors, who can be affected by the r ing signals. Therefore, an interruption of one person may result in interruptions, often unintended, of other people, w hich we call  X  X ollateral disruptions X  (see Figure 2). Figure 2 shows a collateral disruption, where the i nteraction between Actor D (the interrupter) and Actor B (the intended interruptee) also influences two other actors (Acto r A and C). Actor A is disturbed by the actions of the interrup ter (such as the ring signal), while Actor C is affected by the resp onse of Actor B to the interruption (such as talking on the phone w ith Actor D). A specific case of collateral disruptions is  X  X raff ic jam X . This notion refers to various situations where people wa it for their turn to be served or have to follow one after another th rough a limited  X  X assageway X  and where failing to keep moving will make other people stop. Examples of such situations include al l kinds of lines, such as lines to the cashier in a grocery st ore or at an ATM (see Figure 3).  X  X raffic jam X  is a version of colla teral disruption where people can be affected not necessarily by act ions of an intended interruptee but also by his or her inactio n, the failure to keep going to avoid a bottleneck. 
Figure 1. An interruption in the  X  X istorical X  conte xt of an Interrupted tasks carried out by individuals often include interaction with other people. Let us consider a ge neral case of synchronous communication, where a person is involv ed in casual or serious conversation with other people. If the p erson is interrupted, the communication process often  X  X reez es X   X  the others may need to wait until the interruptee is ba ck. Figure 4 shows that sort of situation. Two actors (B and C) carry out a task through synchronous communication, either face-to-f ace communication or telecommunication. When Actor B de als with an interruption caused by Actor A (the interrupter) , Actor C has to wait until Actor B is back. The tasks carried out by interruptees can be  X  and typically are -sub-tasks within collective activities, that is, ac tivities collaboratively carried out by a group of people. W hen an individual X  X  task is interrupted, the overarching c ollective activity is likely to be interrupted, as well. In some cases interruptions of collective activities are immediately obvious. For instance, when a card game player has to attend an urgent matter, ot her players may have to wait until he or she is back. This case is similar to  X  X reezing X , shown in Figure 4. In other cases the impact of individual task interr uptions on collective activities can be less obvious and immed iate, such as a deadline missed because a person had been  X  X oo busy with other things X . Two examples of such cases are presented i n Figure 5 and Figure 6. Figure 5 shows actors B and C, who collab oratively take care of a group task (GT), carried out within a col lective activity (CA). If Actor A interrupts Actor B, then Actor C m ay need to cover for Actor B while Actor B is not involved in carrying out the task. The type of interruptions of collective activities that we dub  X  X ropping the ball X  is shown in Figure 6. Actors B and C take part in a collective activity through their contrib utions to the activity. They may not even communicate with each o ther directly, but Actor C may critically depend on the content, quality, and timeliness of the outcomes of the work done by Actor B. Therefore, when Actor B is interrupted by Actor A, it may cause a disruption of the collective activity and thus crea te an interruption for Actor C. Alternatively, an interruption of Acto r B may cause a general disruption of the collective activity and A ctor C can be affected even if he or she is not directly influenc ed by the outcomes of tasks carried out by Actor B. Finally, in some cases interruptions of individual tasks may have no tangible impact on a collective activity. Theref ore, the relationship between interruptions of individual an d collective activities is not straightforward. We believe a pro per understanding of interruptions should combine analy sis at the level of individual tasks with analysis at the leve l of collective activities. The analysis above, however sketchy and straightfor ward, has a number of implications for the issues mentioned in the beginning of this paper, namely, understanding the effects of interruptions, the strategies used to manage interruptions, and th e prospects for technological support. The analysis indicates that when dealing with these issues a focus on the individual task di rectly affected by an interruption is not sufficient: various rippl e effects should be taken into consideration. We preliminary identif y four types of ripple effects, X : The logical analysis of the social dimension of int erruptions in the previous section produced a number of descriptive c ategories. They provide a basis for describing objective conse quences of interruptions, that is, consequences that can mater ialize irrespective of whether or not people who handle in terruptions are affected by them. Therefore, the relevance of these categories to res earch of how people handle interruptions is not obvious. Are the identified categories only meaningful for an external observer or do they also affect the actual behavior of people who initi ate or handle interruptions? In our view, this is a question that can be answered through empirical research. In this section we argue that the aspects of the so cial dimension of interruptions discussed above do provide guidance i n studies of interruptions. We will focus on two issues. First, we will discuss how the facets of the social dimension of interrupt ions can be used in generating hypotheses about the mechanisms of decision making in interruption handling. Second, we will di scuss the implications of our analysis for developing researc h methodology suitable for studies of interruptions. Earlier in this paper we identified several facets, or  X  X imensions X , of the social context, along which interruptions of an individual X  X  task may result in remote consequences transcending the effect on that particular task. Here we go a step further and make an assumption that people actually take into account the ripple effec t of interruptions when making decisions about how to handle a particular interruption. Of course, we cannot claim that this assumption is correct (and, if yes, to what extent) . What we claim is that the assumption can be assessed empirically. The typology of ripple affects proposed above provides a basis f or formulating concrete hypotheses that can be tested in empirical studies. For instance, concrete studies can inquire how exactly interruption handling strategies depend on the relationship betw een the interrupter and interruptee; the presence of other people in the same location as the interruptee; the type of commu nication activities the interruptee is involved in at the mo ment of interruption; and the nature of collaborative activ ities in which the interruptee and/or the interrupter are taking part.
 We believe that it is not sufficient to focus on is olated facets of the social dimension of interruptions. In real life -settings there is an interaction between interruption effects categor ized in terms of location, communication, collaboration, and social relation; and they all interact with the interruption of the task at hand. In our view, studies of various interactions between  X  X ain  X  interruption effects can help reveal the whole picture of how/if task interruption and various ripple effects are compreh ended by people and influence their strategies of handling i nterruptions. Research of that kind seems to be rather complicate d and the taxonomy of ripple effects proposed in this paper a ppears to do little to reduce the complexity. However, the taxon omy does constrain the way that context can be treated. By i dentifying the four facets of the social dimension of interruption s it renders context complex but  X  hopefully  X  more manageable. There is a possibility that, if through extensive research, a coherent understanding of the context can eventually be achi eved. A vague, unconstrained notion of context does not seem to ha ve any chances at all. Extending the focus of research from the direct eff ect of an interruption on the task at hand to the social cont ext in which the interruption is taking place is associated with maj or challenges for research methodology. First of all, the possibiliti es to investigate social context by using the traditional methodology of controlled experiments are severely limited. An isolated task can be meaningfully modeled and studied in a controlled la boratory-type setting. However, an understanding of an interrupti on event in the context of an interpersonal relation between the in terrupter and interruptee can only be achieved by taking into acc ount the past and the potential future of the relation. The conte xt of a relationship extends far beyond the time span of an interruption event, which makes it difficult, if possible at all , to model in a laboratory. Similar arguments apply to other facets of the social dimension of interruptions. Of course, one can crea te artificial conditions simulating various situations of colloca tion, communication, and collaboration. However, empirica l data collected in such studies can be very different fro m what can be found in formally identical situations but taking p lace in real life contexts. For instance, when struggling to meet a r eal deadline (and facing real consequences for failing to do so) people may be much less inclined to get distracted from their tas ks. Another methodological challenge is the need to ove rcome the limitations of observational data. Observations can provide data on what people do during interruption handling. Obs ervational data can also be a valuable source of evidence abou t the location, in which distracting events are taking place. But o bservations do not tell much about the social relation between the actors. Even though the observer can make an informed guess abou t the nature of a relationship, the guess may be wrong, since it does not take into account the past and the anticipated future, w hich are not directly observable. Communication can be fruitfull y studied through observations if it is a face-to-face commun ication. Telecommunication is less amenable to an observatio nal inquiry: just imagine observing a person who is talking on t he phone and is intently listening during most of the conversati on. Therefore, research has to complement observational data with data obtained from the subjects. However, the usefu lness of traditional interviews or diary studies is rather l imited. Interviews that are heavily relying on subjects X  memory may fa il to reveal enough detail about interruption handling events, s ince the details may be quickly forgotten. Traditional diary studies [e.g. 24], in our view, do have a potential for exploring the soc ial dimension of interruptions, but they are associated with mass ive interruptions caused by the need to make records in a diary. A ve rsion of diary studies, called elicitation studies [16], in which media captured by participants is used as a prompt for discussion in interviews, seem to be a promising alternative to more traditional m ethods. However, much still needs to be done to develop res earch methodology appropriate for studies of the social d imension of external interruptions. The main focus of this paper is on understanding interruptions in technology-rich environments, not design of technol ogies supporting interruption handling. However, the conc epts introduced in the analysis above also have implicat ions for design, even though these implications are rather indirect and tentative. Undoubtedly, a number of existing technological sol utions have been influenced, implicitly or explicitly, by conce rns about the social context of interruptions. General-purpose co mmunication tools, such as mobile phones and IM systems, provid e the user with a variety of features for managing interruptio n handling depending on the context. The ease of switching to the  X  X ilent mode X  or the  X  X irplane mode X   X  intended to prevent collateral disruptions  X  has become a selling point for mobile phones. However, the usefulness of the feature critically d epends on the ability of the user to remember to switch the phone to an appropriate mode. More sophisticated technologies supporting interrup tion management are based on providing awareness clues for potential interrupters. Awareness support systems can, in pri nciple, help avoid collateral disruptions and other types of  X  X h e ripple effect X  of interruptions. However, so far this type of supp ort has been rather limited. The main focus of design exploratio ns has been on directly measurable parameters of individual activi ties. Such parameters are not reliable indicators of the socia l context. For instance, high keyboard/mouse activity may be an in dicator of editing an important document, discussing an urgent issue over email or IM, or playing a computer game. As a resul t, existing systems, including experimental prototypes, rarely help assess the impact of an intended interruption on other people than their direct  X  X argets X . Further empirical studies systema tically investigating the types of information about the so cial context that people actually take into account when initiating a nd handling interruptions can formulate more specific requireme nts to technologies supporting interruption handling. The concepts introduced in this paper, as well as future studies addressing the issues discussed above, may inform the search for m ore advanced technological solutions. The starting point of our analysis is what we consi der to be a shortcoming of previous research on interruptions. As our review of the previously conducted research indicates, the issue of interruptions has been almost exclusively addressed in experimental studies of individual activities. We c laim that there is a need to extend the scope of analysis of interr uptions to include not only individual tasks that are directly interrupted, but also less direct consequences of interruptions. The main conclusions of the discussion in the paper can be s ummarized as follows. The  X  X ipple effect X  of interruptions. First, we identify four types of the  X  X ipple effect X  of interruptions that add to the effect on a directly interrupted individual task. While the imp act of an interruption on the individual task at hand is unde niably of key importance, interruptions typically do not stop the re. Interruptions of individual tasks may also cause  X  X ollateral disr uptions X  affecting people who happen to be in the same locat ion as the interruptee. If the interruptee is engaged in commu nication, especially synchronous communication, an interrupti on can cause  X  X reezing X  of the unfolding process of communicatio n. In addition, interruptions can cause the interruptee t aking part in a collective activity to  X  X rop the ball X  and, thus, r esult in a disruption of collaboration. Finally, interruptions caused by other people always take place in the context of the soci al relation between the interrupter and the interruptee. We do not claim that our analysis of the types of  X  ripple effects X  of interruptions is either complete or sufficiently detailed. Undoubtedly, several other aspects of the social an d organizational context affect interruptions and the strategies for dealing with them. Such aspects may include organiz ational culture, conventions, power relations, and so forth . The purpose of this paper is to present a preliminary explorati on that can be further developed or revised in further research. H owever, even this preliminary analysis has at least two implicat ions for studies of interruptions. Are Ripple Effects Anticipated? The analysis above indicates that interruptions of individual tasks may cause ripple effects that can manifest themselves to an external observer. But do they influence the actual behavior of the interrupter and interrup tee? Is their decision-making when initiating or handling an inte rruption affected by the anticipated ripple effects of an in terruption? We believe this is an empirical question. Empirical st udies of the actual strategies used by interrupters and interrup tees appear to be the only way to find out how (and if) people are af fected by anticipated ripple effects. What we claim here is t hat anticipated ripple effects may influence how people initiate or handle interruptions, and thus, taking them into account c an help explain why certain people choose certain strategies. Toward an Appropriate Research Methodology. When widening the focus from individual tasks to the social conte xt of interruptions, we have to adapt new research method ologies. Arranging collective activities is not easily done in laboratory settings and transferring similar contextual factor s from a work setting to an experimental setting is virtually imp ossible. This requires the researcher to conduct much more resear ch in real life settings. As already mentioned, media elicitation a nd the feedback approach in diary studies appear especially promisi ng, since they support the need for situated annotations of events that is vital for capturing the social dimension of interruptions and interruption handling. When it comes to future work our next step is to em pirically ground the importance of expanding the focus of ana lysis. Toward Advanced Technological Support for Interrupt ion Handling. Our analysis of existing technologies that have be en developed to support collaboration and, in particul ar, interruption handling, indicates that designers have already bee n trying to take into account the ripple effect of interruptions. Ho wever, so far these attempts have not been based on a systematic analysis of the whole set of factors that influence the effect of i nterruptions. We think the preliminary  X  X onceptual map X  of the socia l context of interruptions proposed in this paper can be used as a simple but useful analytical tool that can help address interr uptions taking place in real-life settings in a more systematic wa y.
