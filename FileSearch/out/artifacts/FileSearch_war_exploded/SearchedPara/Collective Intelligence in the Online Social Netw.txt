 Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites such as Yahoo!Answers provide a platform where users can post questions and re-ceive answers. These systems take advantage of the collec-tive intelligence of users to find information. In this pa-per, we analyze the online social network (OSN) in Ya-hoo!Answers. Based on a large amount of our collected data, we studied the OSN X  X  structural properties, which re-veals strikingly distinct properties such as low link symmetry and weak correlation between indegree and outdegree. After studying the knowledge base and behaviors of the users, we find that a small number of top contributors answer most of the questions in the system. Also, each top contributor focuses on only a few knowledge categories. In addition, the knowledge categories of the users are highly clustered. We also study the knowledge base in a user X  X  social network, which reveals that the members in a user X  X  social network share only a few knowledge categories. Based on the find-ings, we provide guidance in the design of spammer detection algorithms and distributed Q&amp;A systems. We also propose a friendship-knowledge oriented Q&amp;A framework that syn-ergically combines current OSN-based Q&amp;A and web Q&amp;A. We believe that the results presented in this paper are cru-cial in understanding the collective intelligence in the web Q&amp;A OSNs and lay a cornerstone for the evolution of next-generation Q&amp;A systems.

Web search engine (e.g., Google and Bing) enables us to search information by keywords on the Internet. Recently, web search engines are improved by combining with social networks [1 X 5], enabling social friends to collaborate with each other to determine the relevance of the returned results to their queries. Users use web annotations or bookmarks to indicate the search results they are interested in, which helps their common-interest friends to quickly identify re-sults useful to themselves.

However, picking up useful information from the over-whelming returned results still remains a challenge. Users sometimes prefer to directly receive the answers rather than going through a long tedious searching process. In addi-tion, although the search engine based information retrieval performs very well in answering factual queries for infor-mation already existing in databases, it is not suitable for non-factual or context-aware queries, which are more subjec-tive, relative and multi-dimensional in context, especially for information not existing in databases (e.g., suggestions, rec-ommendations and advices). This remains as a formidable challenge facing current search engines without big break-throughs in machine learning and natural language process-ing techniques.

Actually, people are the most  X  X ntelligent machines X  that are capable of parsing, interpreting and answering questions, provided they are familiar with the questions. Each person has knowledge from his careers, education, life, experience, interests and so on, which forms his knowledge base .Bycol-lecting the intelligence of people to find information, Ques-tion and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites such as Yahoo!Answers [6] (YA) and Ask.com [7] have naturally emerged as an alterna-tive way for Q&amp;A. These websites provide a platform where users can post questions and receive answers. If user A wants to frequently visit/track all questions and answers of user B, A adds B to its contact list by building a link to B. Then, A becomes B X  X  fan. Thus, a knowledge-oriented online social network (OSN) with unidirectional links between nodes is formed in the Q&amp;A system. YA classifies knowledge into 26 general knowledge categories (KCs) (e.g., Sports, Health). Each general knowledge categories has a number of detailed KCs (e.g., Golf, Tennis). Users with many points are recog-nized as top contributors , whose profiles indicate the general and details KCs they are knowledgeable in.

Although Q&amp;A websites are becoming increasingly popu-lar and can provide high quality answers [8], they have some shortcomings in satisfying users X  needs. First, the latency for receiving a satisfying answer is high with the average equals 2:52:30 (hh:mm:ss) even when the number of the registered users is very large (290,000) [9]. This is because most users log in the Q&amp;A website only when they have questions to ask. Even if some users may intend to answer others X  ques-tions, since all questions in one topic appear together in one forum, it is difficult for a user to identify the questions he can answer. Second, as Q&amp;A websites are normally open to all anonymous users in Internet, spam is a difficult problem.
In recent years, OSN-based Q&amp;A systems [8,10 X 14] have been developed. Facebook launched a Q&amp;A application in July, 2010. In an OSN-based Q&amp;A system, users post and answer questions through the OSN in order to take advan-tage of the collective intelligence of their friends. Specifi-cally, a centralized server identifies possible answers from the questioner X  X  friends in his social network, and forwards the question directly to them. Expertise location systems [15 X  18] that search experts in specified fields share similarity with OSN-based Q&amp;A in answerer location. Research [12] shows that the answerers in the OSN are willing to and able to provide more tailored and personalized answers to the questioners since they know a great deal about the back-grounds and preference of the questioners. However, the characteristics of the knowledge of the friends in a user X  X  social network may affect the qualify of the answers for the user X  X  questions. Factual questions such as X  X hat is the time complexity of the X algorithm X  need the answers from ex-perts in the computing theory field, which may not be offered by the OSN-based Q&amp;A systems.
 By synergistically integrating the web Q&amp;A system and OSN-based Q&amp;A system, both systems X  shortcomings can be overcome. To achieve this, it is important to understand the nature and impact of collective intelligence in the OSNs of both systems. However, no previous work has been devoted to studying the OSN in the Q&amp;A websites, though previ-ous research investigated the OSN-based Q&amp;A systems. In this paper, we analyze the OSN in YA, a popular online Q&amp;A website. For this effort, we have collected Q&amp;A trace data during three months, and a large amount of personal data and their associated relationship in YA. The main con-tribution of this paper is an extensive trace-driven analy-sis of OSN structure, user behavior, user knowledge base and their relationships. Our analysis yields very interesting results and the highlights of our work are summarized as follows:  X 
Examination on the structural properties of the YA OSN shows that though it shares a common property with other previously studied OSNs in that the node indegree and outdegree exhibit power-law distribution, it has strikingly distinct properties: (1) It has low link symmetry; (2) It exhibits weak correlation between indegree and outdegree; (3) Users tend to connect to other users with different degrees from their own; (4) Users exhibit an extremely low clustering coefficient.  X 
Investigation on the knowledge base and behaviors of users in YA reveals that (1) A small portion of the users (i.e., 10%) contribute to the most of the high quality answers; (2) The 12 most popular general KCs account for 80% of all general KCs in the system; (3) The top contributors steadily contribute high-quality answers. Many top con-tributors focus on one general KC, and 56.5% of them have multiple general KCs, but all of the them have multiple detailed KCs; (4) There exists positive linear correlation Table 1: High level statistic of the crawled YA social network. between the number of fans and points of a user but no correlation between the number of contacts and points of a user; (5) The KCs of the users are highly clustered.  X 
Analysis on the relationship of knowledge base and OSN structure shows that (1) The size of the knowledge base within a user X  X  one-hop OSN neighbors is small, and in-creases, though not significantly, within two-hop OSN neigh-bors; (2) Reciprocity (i.e., bidirectional connected) users share more common KCs than one-way connected users, who share more KCs than disconnected users.  X 
We finally discuss the implications of our findings on the design of spammer detection algorithms in Q&amp;A systems and a distributed Q&amp;A system that integrates both web Q&amp;A system and OSN-based Q&amp;A system.
 Our analysis provides critical insights regarding the differ-ent properties of the YA OSN and other friendship and/or knowledge oriented OSNs. The analytical results provide cornerstone for the performance improvement on current Q&amp;A systems and the evolution of next-generation Q&amp;A systems. YA, as a knowledge market, was launched by Yahoo! on July 5, 2005. It has an OSN with unidirectional links be-tween nodes. The nodes in a user X  X  contact list are called outdegree nodes , which form the node X  X  contact network ,and the nodes in a node X  X  fan list are called indegree nodes ,which form the node X  X  fan network . Thus, YA OSN incorporates two directional networks: contact network and fan network . The former includes all nodes and their outdegree nodes and the latter includes all nodes and their indegree nodes.
We wrote a crawler using Python. The crawler started from the first 4000 top contributors and inserted these users into an initially empty queue. It fetched the first user from the queue, recorded his profile information (i.e., total num-ber of earned points, answers, best answers and questions), retrieved and inserted his public visible contacts and fans to the queue, and finally removed this user from the queue. This process repeated until the queue became empty. Crawl-ing was started on Aug. 17 and ended on Oct. 19, 2011. As the crawled OSN data is seeded at 4000 different users with various KCs, it can well represent an actual knowledge-oriented OSN. In addition, for each user, we recorded its profile information for the activities during every week from Aug. 17 to Oct. 19 2011. In our trace data, about 8% of the users are top contributors. Table 1 shows the high level statistics of the crawled YA OSN.
In this section, we study the structural characteristics of the YA OSN. We also are interested in answering a ques-
