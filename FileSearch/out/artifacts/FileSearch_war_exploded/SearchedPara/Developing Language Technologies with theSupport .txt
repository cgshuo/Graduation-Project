 JOSEPH MARIANI 1. Introduction Much research has been devoted to human language science and technology over the past several years, and considerable progress has been made. However, it is now clear that the language processing problem is more complex than it was thought to be in the earliest days of machine translation work in the 1950 X  X  and 60 X  X  and will demand more and broader efforts in order to be solved. These efforts include both scientific research aimed at exploring the mysteries of human language processes and technological research aimed at developing computer systems with human language pro-cessing capabilities, both for analysis and generation.
 nowadays accepted by most researchers, the main components of which are (1) language resources , to enable development and testing; (2) language technology evaluation , to measure the quality of systems and progress; (3) norms and standards , to enable the exchange and reuse of data and software; and (4) technology survey , to monitor the latest developments worldwide. The U.S. paved the way in addressing these needs through NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology: http://www.nist.gov) and the various language technology programs supported by DARPA starting in the late 1980 X  X , and with the creation in 1992 of the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC: http://www.ldc.upenn.edu) to distribute the resources required to support language technology (LT) development. In Europe, the European Commission (EC) has also supported major projects devoted to language technology development and the establishment of the European Language Resources Association (ELRA: http://www.elra.info), launched in 1995 as a result of the Relator EC project with Antonio Zampolli as its first president. The association subsequently created ELDA, originally the  X  X  X LRA Lan-guage Resources Distribution Agency X  X  and recently changed to  X  X  X valuation and Language Resources Distribution Agency X  X  (http://www.elda.org) and LREC, the  X  X  X anguage Resources and Evaluation Conference X  X , which was first held in 1998 and had its fourth biennial instantiation in Lisbon in Spring 2004.
 language processing systems is recognized as a critical need to support LT development, as mentioned in the Survey of the state-of-the-art in Human Language Technology  X  Cole et al. , 1997  X  . At the EU-US joint workshop on Multilingual Information Management (MLIM), organized at LREC 1998, language resources and their evaluation were mentioned as two of the key required areas to support progress in language processing (Hovy et al., have undertaken the organization of evaluation exercises, among the first of which was the multilingual, trans-national speech recognition evaluation campaign organized by the NATO RSG10 Group on Speech Processing in 1980. Later initiatives in Europe include several projects supported by the European Commission (e.g., Sqale, Class, Eurococosda, CLEF), and several national initiatives (e.g., SPEX, BAS, Collate, CLECT). CoCoSDA (Coor-dinating Committee on Speech Databases and speech input/output systems Assessment, http://www.cocosda.org) was created in 1991 in order to coor-dinate production of speech data and speech systems evaluation worldwide, and the follow-on Oriental CoCoSDA. A comparable initiative for written language was launched in 2003 by Antonio Zampolli and colleagues with the creation of ICCWLRE (International Coordinating Committee for Written Language Resources and Evaluation). 2 aimed at the development of language resources and evaluation. We then outline a new project, Lang-Net, intended to create a European infrastruc-ture by enhancing collaboration, cooperation, and resource sharing among the international language processing research community.
 36 2. The AUPELF-UREF Francil Program The AUPELF-UREF (Association of French Speaking Universities) laun-ched a research network for Language Engineering in June 1994, called Francil (Francophone Network on Language Engineering) (Mariani and Ne  X  el, 1995). The network included 69 research laboratories, both public and private, in nine countries (Belgium, Canada, Egypt, France, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Switzerland, Tunisia). The goal of the Francil network was to ensure communication and collaboration between laboratories working in the field of Language Technologies for the processing of the French Spoken and Written language.
 Strategic Research Actions) and managed the Actions de Recherche Partage  X  e (ARP, Cooperative Research Actions) of Aupelf-Uref. The ARCs were concerned with the evaluation of both written and spoken language pro-cessing systems, on various topics. For each topic, there were three tasks: (i) Organize the test campaign (involving an organizer and a coordinating committee), (ii) Provide data (raw or annotated), (iii) Participate in the test campaigns. A Call for offer was sent in July 1994; fifty proposals were selected, including 35 different laboratories from four countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland).
 (ILEC), there were four actions: In the domain of  X  X  X poken language resources and systems evaluation X  X  (ILOR), 3 actions: Related data and evaluation packages are available from ELDA for some of these evaluation activities. 3. CNRS Actions The Silfide project ( X  X  X nteractive Server for the Identity, Distribution and Study of the French Language X  X ) (Bonhomme et al ., 1997) aimed at installing a French language resources and tools distributed server. The action involved the partnership of five laboratories (CRIN, INALF, LPL, CLIPS and LIMSI), and a first prototype of a single site Language Resources server has been designed. The GRACE action (Adda et al. , 1998), sponsored by CNRS within the  X  X  X ognition, Intelligent Communication and Language Engineering X  X  action (CCIIL), aimed at morpho-syntactic tagger evaluation. 13 laboratories par-ticipated in the test. The results were presented as a Precision  X  Decision matrix (% of tags assigned correctly versus % of tags assigned). This action aimed at making Language Resources available to the scientific community that have been created but are not yet distributed. Nine projects were selected in June 1997, among which two are indirect results from pre-viously mentioned actions: 4. The Techno-Langue French National Program The Techno-Langue program followed a report which was submitted to the French Prime Minister in November 2000, by the Conseil Supe  X  rieur de la Langue Franc  X  aise. This report was written by a working group chaired by Andre  X  Danzin, which recommended the development of language technol-ogies for the French language. Following a meeting organized by the Prime Minister with the participation of the major ministries, and especially those of industry, research and culture, it was decided to launch a national pro-gram on  X  X  X anguage technology survey and evaluation X  X  called Techno-Langue. This program addresses Basic Technological Research (RTB), aimed at developing generic technologies. It was decided to articulate this action with the on-going Technological Research and Innovation Networks 38 (RRIT), which support public research and industry cooperative projects in France. Three of the four RRIT in the field of Information and Communi-cation Technologies (ICT), those on Telecommunications, Software engineering and Audiovisual and Multimedia, already funded by the three previously mentioned ministries, were identified as being concerned by Language Technologies. Techno-Langue would support the development of generic technologies, while the RRIT would keep on supporting the devel-opment of application-oriented projects, which could benefit from the availability of validated language technologies.
 Techno-Langue supports 28 projects, including eleven on language resources, four on the development of Open Source software for various language processing sub-tasks (e.g., parser, speech and speaker recognizer, topic and named entity detector, summarizer, terminology extractor); two on stan-dards, including support for the International Standards Technical Com-mittee for Language Resource Management (ISO TC37-SC4); one to develop a technological survey, with a web site where all the information regarding Techno-Langue can be found (http://www.technolangue.net); and ten on evaluation, including nine on technology evaluation and one on usage evaluation, which address various topics, from system components to full system evaluation. The coordination is conducted by ELDA within the Evalda subprogram (Mc Tait et al ., 2004; Mapelli et al ., 2004) . Five of the evaluation projects are on written text processing: and four on spoken language processing: The results of the various Techno-Langue projects will be presented in fall 2005, with a special emphasis on the results of the evaluation campaigns. has been recently launched in France, on the same basis than Techno-Langue, but only focusing on evaluation. 10 projects have been selected in Fall 2004, and are now starting, covering 50 evaluation tasks, one being video information retrieval. 5. Lang-Net In the 6th framework program (FP6) for Research and Development of the European Commission (2002 X 2006), aside from the usual cooperative pro-jects supported by the European Commission, three new instruments have been proposed: the networks of excellence, the integrated projects and the European Research Area Networks (ERA-Nets). Those ERA_Nets aim at the construction of the European Research Area, based on the assumption expressed by Commissioner Busquin that 90% of the European R&amp;D is conducted within Member States, and that only 10% is conducted in the European Commission programs. Therefore, there is a need to better coor-dinate the national initiatives in order to have a coherent research agenda in Europe.
 programs, called Article 169. But the programs supported within this article of the European treaty needs approval both from the European Parliament and from the European Council. It seems that only one program has been supported within this framework, on infectious diseases, with a targeted 600 M  X  effort: 200 M  X  from the Commission, 200 M  X  from industry and 200 M  X  from Member States. ERA-Net projects are much lighter, but may prepare future heavier Article 169 projects.
 regional, research and innovation programs, within activities that may range from light coordination to joint projects: 40 Language is an especially important issue for Europe. Handling the multiple languages of the EU is an economical, cultural and political challenge, given that it demands both preserving the cultures of the European Union Member States (a survey conducted in Germany showed for example that 75% of the population prefer to have Web sites written in the German language), and allowing for communication among the European Union citizens. Within a European Union with 15 Members States and 11 official languages, there exist 110 language pairs; the mag-nitude of the task of dealing with this situation is demonstrated by the fact that in 2001, 1170 translators were employed by the European Commission, who translated 1.3 Million pages. Multilingualism represents 30% of the budget (that is 300 M  X  per year) of the European Parliament, which employs 500 translators. With the enlargement of the European Union, 10 more countries have been added since May 1st, 2004. This now represents a total of 20 languages  X  that is, 380 language pairs. becomes even more daunting with the addition of new Member States. Obviously, there is a critical need to benefit from Language Technologies in order to facilitate communication in a multilingual environment. But if we consider the number of language technologies multiplied by the number of European languages, it clearly shows that this investment itself is probably too large for the European Commission alone, and it therefore should be shared with the European Union Member States, in full agreement with the subsidiarity concept.
 European Research Area (ERA). The European Commission would support primarily  X  X  X anguage-independent X  X  activities: coordination of the program (management, standards, technology evaluation, communication etc), and the cost of generic language technologies development (speech recognition, speech synthesis, spoken language understanding, spoken dialog, language tagging, parsing, analysis and generation, text retrieval, document under-standing, machine translation etc). Each Member State would support at least the cost for covering its language, or languages when it has several, including the production of the necessary language resources, which are essential for system development (annotated or non-annotated written and spoken language corpus, lexicon (including pronunciation), dictionaries etc), and the development or adaptation of technologies to the specificities of their language(s). Based on this assumption of the need for a shared effort to develop language technologies for Europe, we proposed an ERA-Net project, called Lang-Net, of infrastructural nature, aiming at developing at the European level the same basic components addressed in Techno-Langue: Language resources, Lan-guage technology evaluation, Standards, Technological survey. This ERA-Net could be extended in the future to a larger program aimed at supporting the construction of a multilingual Europe, which would gather the European Commission projects and the European Union Member States X  national and regional programs into a coordinated, coherent effort. This could eventually result in an Article 169 program, if one thinks that the Language Technology topic is as important for Europe as the topic of infectious diseases. regions: France, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, the Trento region, Germany, Norway, The Netherlands and the Belgium Flanders together within the Dutch Language Union, Spain, the Basque region and Sweden. Other countries have been approached and have expressed interest in joining: Austria, the Catalan region, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Portugal, Switzerland, UK. It can be easily extendable to new partners: New Member States (Slovenia, Cyprus, Poland, Hungary, Malta, and the Baltic countries, where there is great interest in Language Technologies), Accessing countries (Romania, Bulgaria, which have a long tradition of activity in Language processing studies), and non-European countries that have also expressed their interest in participating (USA, Japan, South Africa, Israel, Canada). 6. Conclusions Given the increasing challenge of multilingualism in Europe, language technologies are an ideal topic to be dealt with under the national/European Commission coordination scheme promoted in the construction of the European Research Area and for international cooperation.
