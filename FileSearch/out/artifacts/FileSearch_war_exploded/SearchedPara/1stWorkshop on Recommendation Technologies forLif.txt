 The workshop on Recommendation Technologies for Lifestyle Change will be an opportunity for discussing open issues, and propose technical solutions for the designing of intel-ligent information systems that can support and promote lifestyle change. The objective of these systems is to pro-vide users with up-to-date information, and help them to make choices in every day life activities establishing a sus-tainable compromise between quality of life, individuality, and fun.

In today X  X  society, particularly in the affluent society, life-style is influenced by technology, and the abundance of fi-nancial resources. For instance, a large variety of computer games are excessively used, and people often travels by in-dividualized transportation means, such as car, just for fun. Moreover, the idea that technique and money can buy any-thing spreads also to health management: people believe that medical knowledge can be immediately applicable in case of illness, as technical knowledge can be used for re-pairing a broken car.

This results in lifestyles that do not care about the neg-ative long-terms effects on the environment, but also about well being of individual persons. The most prominent exam-ple of this is represented by various types of chronic illnesses in developed countries that result from poor lifestyle choices.
In this context, the aim of this workshop is to explore pos-sibilities for recommender systems to support users in tak-ing decisions related to various aspects of their lifestyle; we call them Lifestyle Change Recommender Systems (LSCRS). There are three main challenges for LSCRSs: firstly, such systems have to assess the user X  X  context for delivering such recommendations. Secondly, in order to promote any change in user X  X  lifestyle, they have to recommend a tailored se-quence of items, mostly actions, taking into account the de-pendencies between the recommended items and the effects of each item recommendation. Thirdly, LSCRS have to be designed to favor the user X  X  continuous attention, to enable the explanation of the reasons for the suggested changes in the user X  X  future behavior, and to recall the changes already effectuated.

Hence, in order to provide an effective support to lifestyle change, recommender systems need to provide communica-tive capabilities, e.g, with multi-modal dialogue systems. Recommendation technologies have to initiate a feedback-change-loop that could contribute to lowering the risks of severe illnesses for many individual users and improving the overall environmental situation.

In order to discuss recent developments and advances in this area, the workshop focusses on the following topics:
During the workshop, participants will present their pa-pers and discuss contributions to the field addressing a va-riety of issues:
The workshop is organized as a half day venue. It in-cludes the presentation of research papers as well as system demonstrations and a plenary discussion and brainstorming session on foundations for lifestyle change recommendation technologies.
