 The study of land cover change is an important problem in the Earth Science domain because of its impacts on lo-cal climate, radiation balance, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and the diversity and abundance of terrestrial species. Most well-known change detection techniques from statistics, sig-nal processing and control theory are not well-suited for the massive high-dimensional spatio-temporal data sets from Earth Science due to limitations such as high computational complexity and the inability to take advantage of seasonality and spatio-temporal autocorrelation inherent in Earth Sci-ence data. In our work, we seek to address these challenges with new change detection techniques that are based on data mining approaches. Specifically, in this paper we have per-formed a case study for a new change detection technique for the land cover change detection problem. We study land cover change in the state of California, focusing on the San Francisco Bay Area and perform an extended study on the entire state. We also perform a comparative evaluation on forests in the entire state. These results demonstrate the utility of data mining techniques for the land cover change detection problem.

Remote sensing data consisting of satellite observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans, combined with historical climate records and pre-dictions from ecosystem models, offer new opportunities for understanding how the Earth is changing, for determining what factors cause these changes, and for predicting future changes. One important area where remote sensing plays a key role is in the study of land cover change. Specifically, the conversion of natural land cover into human-dominated cover types continues to be a change of global proportions with many unknown environmental consequences. For ex-ample, studies [13, 20] have shown that deforestation has significant implications for local weather, and in places such as the Amazon rainforest, cloudiness and rainfall are greater over cleared land than over intact forest. Thus, there is a need in the Earth Science domain to systematically study land cover change in order to understand its impacts on local climate, radiation balance, biogeochemistry, hydrol-ogy, and the diversity and abundance of terrestrial species. Land cover conversions include tree harvests in forested re-gions, urbanization, and agricultural intensification in for-mer woodland and natural grassland areas. These types of conversions also have significant public policy implications due to issues such as water supply management and atmo-spheric CO 2 output. For example, Charbonneau and Kon-dolf [9] found that in California between 1984 and 1990, over half of all new irrigated farmland put into production was of lesser quality than prime farmland taken out of production by urbanization.

The land cover change detection problem is essentially one of detecting when the land cover at a given location has been converted from one type to another. Examples include the conversion of forested land to barren land (possibly due to deforestation or a fire), grasslands to golf courses and farmland to housing developments. There are a number of factors that make this a challenging problem including the nature of Earth Science data, which we will discuss later in this paper. Change detection, in general, is an area that has been extensively studied in the fields of statistics [22], signal processing [19] and control theory [24]. However, most tech-niques from these fields are not well-suited for the massive high-dimensional spatio-temporal data sets from Earth Sci-ence. This is due to limitations such as high computational complexity and the inability to take advantage of season-ality and spatio-temporal autocorrelation inherent in Earth Science data.

There are a number of problems in the Earth Science do-main that have a data mining requirement due to the unique challenges posed by the types of data encountered. There have been several recent applications of data mining tech-niques to Earth Science problems [15, 28, 31, 32] using a variety of data types ranging from remote-sensing data to data obtained from climate models. The land cover change detection problem is also one where data mining techniques can have a significant impact. In particular, with the in-creasing spatial and temporal resolutions of the underlying data sets the use of efficient and scalable pattern discovery algorithms is paramount. In our work, we seek to address these challenges with new change detection techniques that are based on novel data mining approaches. Specifically, these techniques will take advantage of some of the inherent characteristics of spatio-temporal data and will be scalable so that they can be applied to increasingly high-resolution Earth Science data sets. The long term goal of our work is to determine where, when, and why natural ecosystem conversions occur, which is a crucial scientific concern.
In this paper we have performed a case study for a new change detection technique for the land cover change detec-tion problem. Specifically, we study land cover change in the state of California, focusing on the San Francisco Bay Area and perform an extended study on the entire state. We also perform a comparative evaluation on forests in the entire state. We examine the results obtained by applying the new technique to the Bay Area and California data sets. For the forests data set, the proposed algorithm is systemat-ically compared with a previously proposed technique from the domain of Earth Science using ground truth information to verify the results of the algorithms. These results demon-strate the utility of data mining techniques for the land cover change detection problem. Finally, we also discuss possible directions for future work in using data mining techniques for the problem of land cover change detection.
The key contributions of this paper are as follows:
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe Earth Science data sets that we have used in this work as well as the data cleaning procedure used. We discuss previous related work in the area of change detection in Section 4. In Section 5 we present the two change detec-tion algorithms evaluated in this paper. Section 6 presents the results of applying the proposed algorithm to two data sets, and a comparative evaluation on a third data set.
The Earth Science data for our analysis consists of snap-shots of measurement values for a vegetation-related vari-able collected for all land surfaces (see Figure 1). The data observations come from NASA X  X  Earth Observation System (EOS) [2] satellites and the data sets are distributed through Global Snapshot for Time t 1 Global Snapshot for Time t 2
Figure 1: A simplified view of the problem domain. the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) [3].

The specific vegetation-related variable for this analysis was the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) product mea-sured by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiome-ter (MODIS). EVI is a vegetation index which essentially serves as a measure of the amount and  X  X reenness X  of vege-tation at a particular location. It represents the greenness signal (area-averaged canopy photosynthetic capacity), with improved sensitivity in high biomass cover areas. MODIS al-gorithms have been used to generate the EVI index at 250-meter spatial resolution from February 2000 to the present. In this study, the data coverage is from the time period February 2000 X  X anuary 2006.

In this preliminary case study, we focused our analysis on the state of California. Specifically, we apply our algorithm to EVI data for the San Francisco Bay Area, which has seen rapid population growth in recent years. We also system-atically compare our algorithm with a previously proposed algorithm from the Earth Science domain on forest regions of California, since most land cover changes in forests are due to forest fires and these are easily verified. We preprocessed the data to eliminate poor-quality measurements in order to simplify evaluation. Data cleaning was done by performing the following steps: 1. The MODIS data sets are tagged with a quality as-2. We also discarded any locations that contained missing
The final quality-filtered EVI data set for the San Fran-cisco Bay Area contained 180,400 locations (covering a re-gion of 100 miles  X  50 miles), the entire California data set contained over 5 million locations (covering a region of 800 miles  X  200 miles), and the data set for forest locations in the state of California contained 380,285 locations. The length of the time series for all three data sets is 76, cor-responding to 6 years and 4 months of monthly data from February 2000 through May 2006. Figure 2: This figure shows an example of a change
The land cover change detection problem studied in this paper is essentially one of taking a data set of vegetation-related time series and detecting changes by giving each lo-cation a change score based on the extent to which it is considered a change point. There are a number of specific challenges associated with Earth Science data that make this a challenging problem. The spatio-temporal nature of Earth Science data is especially challenging since traditional data mining techniques do not take advantage of the spatial and temporal autocorrelation present in such data. In particu-lar, change detection becomes challenging since changes in vegetation levels are occurring all the time, i.e., due to the seasonal growth cycles the EVI index is constantly fluctuat-ing. However, these changes in vegetation levels are usually uninteresting for the land cover change detection problem, although they may be useful for tasks such as land cover classification that are outside the scope of this work.
Furthermore, vegetation-related data sets are often of high spatial resolution, which poses computational challenges. Finally, there is the issue of high-dimensionality since long time series are common in Earth Science (and the temporal resolution is increasing).

Figure 2 shows an example of a land cover change pattern that is typically of interest to Earth Scientists. The time series shows an abrupt jump in EVI in 2003. The location of the point corresponds to a new golf course, which was in fact opened in 2003. Changes of this nature can be detected only with high-resolution data.
The problem of land cover change detection can be tied to previous work in two broad themes: change detection in general (in the fields of statistics, signal processing, etc.), and the specific land cover change problem studied in Earth Science. We will discuss the previous work related to this problem by organizing the discussion into these two themes.
The change detection problem has a very rich literature in the fields of statistics, signal processing and control the-ory. Although change detection has been studied for a very long time (at least since the 1920s [7]), most activity has occurred in the last several decades due to the growth of information technology. This has led to two developments: the increasing complexity of virtually all activities that use technology, and more detailed monitoring of such activities. This ranges from monitoring of the heart with implanted de-vices to satellite sensors that are used to detect vegetation levels on the Earth X  X  surface. As a result, there are a vari-ety of change detection problems with differing requirements and a large number of techniques seek to address specific problems. However, most of the previous work in change detection is not suitable for our land cover change detection problem for two reasons: (1) the techniques are computa-tionally expensive, making them infeasible for large scale high-resolution Earth Science data sets, and (2) the tech-niques are unable to take advantage of the inherent structure present in Earth Science data. The monograph by Brodsky and Darkhovsky [7], and the books by Basseville and Niki-forov [6] and Gustafsson [19] comprehensively discuss the major developments in change detection.

We briefly list a few recent developments in change de-tection that are relevant in the data mining context. Chen and Gopalakrishnan [11] presented the problem of acous-tic change detection where the goal is to segment an audio signal into homogeneous sections based on the speaker and surrounding conditions. Event detection, presented by Gu-ralnik and Srivastava [18], is the problem of recognizing the change of parameters in the underlying model or the change of the model itself at unknown times; given a time series and a set of basis functions, the problem is to find a piecewise segmented model where each segment is represented by a ba-sis function. Therefore, the number of change points, their locations in time, and the basis functions for each segment must all be determined. Ge and Smyth [17] proposed a semi-Markov (Markov model combined with a Bayesian update) model-based technique which uses state switching to detect change points. Their framework models individual segments using regression functions, and each segment is a state in an HMM; a change in states corresponds to a change point. A stream-based approach to change point detection was pro-posed by Yamanishi and Takeuchi [34]. This technique re-duces the problem of change detection in time series into that of outlier detection from time series of moving-averaged scores. Chan and Mahoney [8] proposed a technique called box modeling which divides time series into boxes, and con-structs a feature space based on boxes; an anomaly score is assigned based on the relationship between query time series and the boxes.

The problem of land cover change detection has been con-sidered extensively in the Earth Science literature, partic-ularly after the early 1970s when remote-sensing satellites came into use. The survey by Singh [30] gives an overview of the various land cover change detection techniques pro-posed in the 1970s and 1980s. The primary techniques in use at the time were simple thresholding, a variety of image-based methods (differencing, regression, and ratioing), and principal components analysis. The introduction of satel-lite instruments such as the Advanced Very High Resolu-tion Radiometer (AVHRR) led to an increase in the quality of multispectral data leading to more sophisticated change detection algorithms being developed. Lu et al. [25] provides a very comprehensive survey of all major change detection algorithms that were proposed until 2003. Another recent survey was provided by Coppin et al. [12]. Although high-resolution data from instruments such as MODIS have been available since 2000, as seen from the recent surveys [25, 12], most change detection techniques were proposed for data of coarser resolutions. A change detection technique devel-oped for MODIS data was proposed by Lunetta et al. [26] in 2006; they performed a case study applying their change detection technique (discussed in detail in Section 5.1) to a region known as the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System (this region is along the Virginia-North Carolina border). In this paper, we will compare the performance of our change detection algorithm with the one proposed in [26].
We introduce the following notation in order to describe the land cover change detection algorithms, as well as the properties of the underlying data sets. Let D be a data set with N land locations each of which has a time series of length T . The time series for a location corresponds to T monthly EVI observations at that location. We also define the following notation:
Recently, a change detection study that uses MODIS data was performed by Lunetta et al. [26]. This comprehensive study consists of a data cleaning method (based on the dis-crete Fourier transform), a change detection method, as well as an extensive discussion of the change patterns in the re-gion of interest. They also performed a case study apply-ing their change detection technique to a region known as the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System. For our study, the change detection method is of most relevance since it is one of the few change detection methods that has been applied to high-resolution MODIS data. Although Lunetta et al. do not work with EVI data in their paper, they do work with a closely related variable called the Normalized Differ-ence Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI, like EVI, is also a measure of the vegetation level at a given land location, the main difference being that EVI is designed to enhance the vegetation signal with improved sensitivity in high biomass (high vegetation density) regions [21].

Since NDVI and EVI are similar variables, we will ap-ply Lunetta et al. X  X  scheme to EVI data in this paper. Their change detection methodology essentially works with annual sums of NDVI for a given land location. The difference be-tween consecutive years is then computed; this is equivalent to applying first-order differencing [10] to the time series of annual sums. The resulting differences are assumed to fol-low an approximately normal distribution with  X  = 0, which represents that no change has occurred. This is justifiable in that most locations do not exhibit change and therefore on average the change in annual sum between consecutive years is expected to be 0. To detect whether a change has occurred between time t 1 and time t 2 , the z -score of the difference of annual sums is computed (the standard devi-ation is computed with respect to all land locations) and if the z -score is above a threshold, a change is considered to have occurred between t 1 and t 2 . The specific steps in Lunetta et al. X  X  algorithm for land cover change detection are as follows: 1. For each location n i , the annual EVI sum is computed 2. The difference between the annual sum for a given year 3. The z -score is computed for each of the Y  X  1 values 4. If z ij is above a certain threshold, then location n
In this paper we have slightly modified Lunetta et al. X  X  algorithm in order to apply it to our change detection prob-lem. Essentially, after applying Lunetta et al. X  X  algorithm to the data set, we are left with a list of z -scores for each location that corresponds to each pair of consecutive years. Since a single change score is assigned to each location in our problem setting, we adapt Lunetta et al. X  X  algorithm by tak-ing the absolute maximum for each location X  X  list of z -scores to be the change score for the location, i.e.,
We now present our technique (called the recursive merg-ing algorithm) for land cover change detection. We designed this technique based on some key characteristics of the un-derlying data set: (1) most land locations do not exhibit a change; given the large coverage of land cover data sets, it is fairly obvious that only a small fraction of points will ac-tually exhibit a change, (2) the major mode of behavior in the vegetation signal is seasonality, i.e., the natural seasonal growing cycle is a dominant characteristic of a time series and this intrinsic seasonality should not itself be called a change. The main idea behind the recursive merging algo-rithm is to exploit seasonality in order to distinguish be-tween points that have had a land cover change and those that have not. In particular, if a given location has not had a land cover change, then we expect the seasonal cycles to look very similar going from one year to the next; if this is not the case, then based on the extent to which the seasons are different one can assign a change score to a land location. The time series for each location is processed as follows: 1. The two most similar consecutive annual cycles are Figure 3: k -means cluster centroids for the Bay Area 2. Step 1 is applied recursively until one annual cycle is 3. The change score for this location is based on whether
Note that it is possible that min { s 1 ,...,s Y  X  1 } might be 0, in which case a small value can be added to this quantity.
Our technique bears some resemblance to the bottom-up segmentation algorithm discussed by Keogh et al. [23]: in the first step, the original time series of length n is replaced with an initial approximation of length n/ 2. Then, the cost of merging each pair of segments is computed and the pair with the lowest cost is merged. This procedure is repeated until a user-supplied threshold for the cost of merging is reached.

The computational complexity of the recursive merging algorithm is O ( NT ) (the cost of processing a single location is T  X  12 and there are N locations). The storage require-ment is O ( N ).
In this preliminary study, we focused our analysis on the state of California primarily because our team members have domain expertise in this region. In addition, due to high population growth in recent years, California has experi-enced many land use changes such as the urbanization of farmland and desert converted to farmland. The state also has many forest fires each year that can lead to temporary changes in the land cover.
We initially performed a clustering of the EVI data for the San Francisco Bay Area region in order to observe the high-level characteristics of the vegetation data. We used the k -means algorithm to cluster the EVI data to produce a minimum number of distinct centroids (in this case five cen-troids were found to have the optimal SSE). Figure 3 shows the cluster centroids for the Bay Area EVI data. What we Figure 4: Histogram of change scores produced by the observed was that most of the data was predominantly from 5 classes of vegetation thereby implying that for the vast majority of the points in the data set, there is no change in land cover. Additionally, when the clusters are viewed on a map and compared to satellite imagery, the clusters corre-sponded to the actual vegetation in the region very closely. The land cover type corresponding to each cluster is as fol-lows: Cluster 1 is high seasonal biomass density, moder-ate interannual variability (shrub cover); cluster 2 is moder-ate annual biomass density, moderate interannual variability (grass cover); cluster 3 is high annual biomass density, low interannual variability (evergreen tree cover); cluster 4 is low annual biomass density, low interannual variability (urban-ized cover); cluster 5 is high seasonal biomass density, high interannual variability (agricultural cover).

We then applied the recursive merging change detection algorithm to the Bay Area EVI data set. The output from the algorithm is a list of change scores, one for each location. Figure 4 shows a histogram of the change scores obtained. We observe that the distribution of the scores conforms to our expectation based on the clustering results that most of the locations in the data set do not exhibit a change. We manually examined the top 31 points which had a change score greater than a threshold of 8. Of these, 22 points were found to correspond to interesting land cover changes and others corresponded to changing crop patterns in farmland. A majority of the points with change scores less that 8 (but greater than 4) were from farmland. We briefly discuss a few of the interesting land cover changes discovered: 1. Barren land to golf course. Figure 2 shows the time 2. Construction of a housing subdivision. Figure 5 shows

These results show the effectiveness of the recursive merg-ing algorithm on the Bay Area data set. Specifically, in ex-amining the top ranked change locations from the algorithm, we observe that a variety of interesting land cover changes are detected. The ability of the algorithm to discount nat-ural seasonal changes (such as those seen in Figure 3) is particularly appealing.
Figure 7: Construction of a golf course in San Jose. Figure 8: Construction of the Pacific Commons shop-We performed an extended study on the entire state of California, which involves about a 30-fold increase in data over the Bay Area. For this data set we found 2,833 locations that had a change score greater than a threshold of 15, a vast majority of which corresponded to land cover change points. We analyzed about 1,000 of the top change locations for the larger California data set and we found that more types of changes were detected than in the Bay Area data set. In particular, we found numerous instances where the land cover had changed from desert to farmland, forests to barren (due to forest fires), farmland to housing subdivisions, and desert to golf courses.

A few interesting land cover changes that were discov-ered in the California data set are shown in Figures 9, 10 and 11 (note that the figures show several time series each; these correspond to groups of spatially close locations) and described below: 1. Desert to farmland. This is a group of points corre-2. Farmland to subdivision. This is a location in Sacra-3. Desert to golf course. This is an example of a new Figure 10: Farmland being converted into a housing
To provide a comparative evaluation, we also evaluated the recursive merging algorithm on the EVI data set con-sisting of forests in California in comparison to an algorithm from the Earth Science domain proposed by Lunetta et al. [26]. This specific data set was selected because most land cover changes in forests are due to forest fires, and forest fires can easily be verified using the incidents database available from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Pro-tection [1].

Similar to the Bay Area case study, we apply a given change detection algorithm to the vegetation data set and obtain a change score for each of the 380,285 land locations. The change scores are then sorted and grouped by spatial Figure 11: A newly constructed golf course in Palm Figure 12: This figure shows an example of a land cover location to give  X  X vents X : an event is a group of closely lo-cated pixels that exhibit the same change. For this study, the top 15 events (covering about 125 points in each case) were individually examined and the changes were verified using ground truth information. The results of applying the two change detection algorithms are shown in Table 1. We see that for all the events examined, the recursive merging algorithm finds locations with verifiable land cover changes. These include changes due to forest fires, conver-sion of forests to farmland and loss of forests due to construc-tion or logging. We also examined the top points discovered by the Lunetta et al. algorithm and found that several of those corresponded to forest fires. However, a significant number of locations did not exhibit an apparent land cover change and no change could be discerned by examining the EVI time series.

The dominant land cover change in forests in California is due to forest fires. Therefore, the most common pattern expected is reduction in EVI followed by regrowth (Figure 12). There is also some construction and logging activity that takes place in forests (Figure 13). These change pat-terns are different from those due to forest fires in that the reduction of EVI tends to be gradual rather than abrupt. Table 2 lists examples of fires detected.

Although we were unable to do a thorough evaluation of highly scored change points except for those covered by the top 15 events, we did examine the top 5% of the total points to get a sense of the nature of land cover changes being de-tected by our algorithm. We found that among the top 1% of the points (approximately 38,000 points), an overwhelming majority correspond to forest fires.

These results show that our proposed algorithm for change detection gives high quality results for forest data. In partic-ular, we showed that the top results from the recursive merg-ing algorithm are verifiable change points. This is significant since the results of change detection algorithms are often manually examined by expert analysts from the Earth Sci-ence domain. Therefore, the analyst X  X  time is used more ef-fectively if the algorithm produces high-quality change points in the top portion of the results.

Table 3 shows the total number of forest fires as well as the number of large fires (those that burn more than 300 acres) in California between 2000 and 2006. Two things that stand out from the Table are: (1) there are thousands of verified fires in California every year, and (2) the large Figure 13: This figure shows an example of a land cover

From this situation, it can be inferred that some small fires may occur every year that are not seen or verified, es-pecially in sparsely populated regions (i.e., these small fires occur in remote areas where they are not observed but some forest has been destroyed). Change detection algorithms have a significant role to play in detecting such burned re-gions. There have been a number of studies that have shown the utility of vegetation data for detecting burned regions [27, 14, 29, 16]. Most of these studies were performed in the 1990s on coarse-resolution vegetation data such as those from the AVHRR instrument. The results from our study with forest data suggest that the recursive merging algo-rithm has the ability to detect forest fires from vegetation data, and thus this approach could potentially be used to monitor fires on a global scale.
In this paper, we have performed a case study showing the application of change detection algorithms for the problem of land cover change detection. We focused on three data sets for the state of California corresponding to the San Francisco Bay Area, the entire state, and forests in the state. We ap-plied two change detection algorithms: the Lunetta et al. algorithm proposed by domain experts from Earth Science and the recursive merging algorithm proposed in this pa-per. The recursive merging algorithm was applied to the Bay Area data set and the results showed that it discovers high-quality change points. We also applied both algorithms to the forest data set in order to compare their performance and found that the locations given high change scores by the recursive merging algorithm are better-quality change loca-tions. These encouraging results mean that this algorithm is effective for the land cover change detection problem.
However, there are a number of limitations of the cur-rent algorithm which require further work. The current algorithm does not make use of spatial information that is present in the data. Since Earth Science data sets ex-hibit significant spatio-temporal autocorrelation, the use of spatial information can be expected to give superior perfor-mance. Some patterns X  X uch as changing crops on farmland X  may not be of interest to the analyst, in which case a scheme must be devised to filter such points. Another interesting extension would be to use clustering to discover the domi-nant land cover patterns in the data, and then characterize the changes in terms of clusters. This approach appears promising since there are a few major classes of data (for-est, farmland, shrubland, urban, etc.) and characterizing changes in terms of these major classes increases the infor-mation the algorithm provides to the analyst. In this prelim-inary study, we have not used statistics that are commonly used for land cover change detection [26], such as accuracy, kappa, omission error (false negative rate) and commission error (false positive rate). A more thorough evaluation of the results that incorporates such statistics and examines a much larger set of pixels must be done.
