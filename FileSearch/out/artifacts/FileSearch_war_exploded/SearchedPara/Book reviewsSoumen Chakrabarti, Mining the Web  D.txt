Web mining is an exciting field that attempts to identify the statistical similarities within Web content to extract value. Therefore, this book addresses a worthwhile subject of critical importance to Web research-ers. The book contains nine chapters, the Introduction that provides an overview of the material and major three parts of the book that contain the remaining eight chapters. The first part contains introductory mate-rial on Web crawlers and information retrieval concepts. The second part is the major component of the manuscript and focuses on Web mining and machine learning techniques. The third part presents a collec-tion of applications on Web mining and a look forward.

Each chapter begins with a short opening statement that sets the stage for the remaining material in the chapter. I found these introductions quite interesting, full of fascinating statements, which unfortunately were unsupported. The author could have greatly enhanced these opening paragraphs by providing refer-ences for some of the accounts presented. Some of the chapters read, and look like, conference or journal papers, which I found distracting since there was little integration of these into a greater whole. Most of the chapters contain bibliographic notes. A criticism in this area is the inconsistency of formatting and refer-ence styles. Sometimes even publications from the same outlet have a different reference style, even within the same chapter. This leads one to question the accuracy of the material presented elsewhere in the book. Part I contains two chapters, Chapter 2: Crawling the Web and Chapter 3: Web Search and Information
Retrieval . Chapter 2: Crawling the Web provides basics on crawlers, the design of large-scale crawlers, implementation details, and the related performance concerns. Chapter 3: Web Search and Information
Retrieval covers the fundamental concepts of the information retrieval and some introduction to Web data mining. There is very little to no content concerning Web searching.

Part II is the bulk of the book. If you are into algorithms, these chapters are for you. This section con-tains three chapters, Chapter 4: Similarity and Clustering , Chapter 5: Supervised Learning , and Chapter 6:
Semi-supervised Learning . It is this part that is the strength of the book. Chapter 4: Similarity and Clustering introduces similarity and clustering, various clustering techniques, and other related topics such as visual-ization and probabilistic approaches. Chapter 5: Supervised Learning discusses a variety of topics, such as nearest neighbor algorithms and Bayesian networks. Chapter 6: Semi-supervised Learning talks about, not surprisingly, semi-supervised learning algorithms using hyperlink content.
 Part III contains three chapters, Chapter 7: Social Network Analysis , Chapter 8: Resource Discovery , and
Chapter 9: The Future of Web Mining . Chapter 7: Social Network Analysis presents link-based techniques, although certain areas such as co-citation analysis are only briefly mentioned. Chapter 8: Resource Discov-ery focuses on locating desired resources using techniques such as focused crawling. Chapter 9: The Future of Web Mining presents the authors view of future research topics in the Web mining area.

A deliberate omission includes Web usage mining. The omission of the Web usage mining area is cer-tainly a shortcoming in the book  X  s content, as this research area has made important contributions in the area and is a key element of data mining on the Web.

Generally, I found the book solid and beneficial to readers interested in Web data mining, especially those interested in the details of algorithmic implementation. Although a little too disjointed for a textbook,
I would recommend it for those preparing a course on data mining as a reference to the broad field and orientation to other sources. With the exception of Web usage mining, researchers working on general
Web data mining issues will also find it helpful. A Web site (http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/mining-the-web/) is available with supporting materials and errata.

The Web emerged about fifteen years ago and has become one of the main information sources in the developed world. Documents on the Web not only provide information, but the underlying hypertext pro-tocol allows authors to easily create links to other pieces of information residing on the Web. Thus, doc-uments and links are the two major  X  X  X ngredients X  X  of the Web. Web links have been heavily studied by the computer science community in order to understand the structure and growth patterns of the Web and they are currently also one of the parameters in the ranking algorithms of most search engines. This book de-parts from the usual computer science approach and discusses the value of studying links for information and social science research.

The book has twenty-six chapters, divided into six parts. The first part provides the theoretical back-ground for the rest of the book and defines what is meant by  X  X  X nformation science approach to link ana-lysis X  X  in the context of the book. The author views it as nine step method comprised of: a research question; a pilot study; identification of appropriate web pages; collecting link data; data cleansing; link count val-idation; interpretation of results; and reporting the results and limitations of the study. Methodological issues related to sample size, data validation, and careful interpretation of relationships ( X  X  X eport results, remembering that correlation does not prove causation X  X , p. 42) are emphasized throughout the book. This part also includes a clear, non-technical description of web crawling, introduces different link counting models and the use of correlation tests for interpreting link counts.

The second part discusses the structure of the Web; provides an overview of growth models and topol-ogies of the Web based on the computer science approach. Another objective of this part is to demonstrate the relationship between web links and topics X  X his goal is achieved by exploring the content structure of the Web.

The topic of the third part is the academic Web and is largely based on the extensive studies carried out by Mike Thelwall and his collaborators, but results of other studies are reported as well. This part covers page and link types; the relationships between incoming link counts in the different models introduced in part one and traditional research indicators (e.g., grants, funding and national peer review), the relationship between geographic distances within a country and link counts; national versus international links; linguis-tic influences; disciplinary differences and linking to journal websites.
