 Readers are increasingly participating to news content creation by submitting user -generated content (UGC). We studied the participation motivations of active readers who send photo content to a hyperlocal news publisher . The first results based on an online questionnaire indicate that fun, the opportunity to get a mo netary reward and informing others of local issues are the strongest motivators. In addition, participation to the news making activity and self -expression are important motivations. T hose who intentionally planned and searched for topics to report with photos, reported more often the opportunity for extra income and development as a photographer as participation motivation s than those, who captured photos when a good topic came about . H.5.3 [ Group and Organization Inter faces ]: Computer -supported cooperative work Motivation, crowdsourcing, news, photo, content, UGC, participation, participatory journalism, hyperlocal. User -generated content (UGC) by readers is gaining increasing importance in news publishing [9] , especially within hyperlocal news. However, little is known about the motiva tions of the participation motivations helps the news organization s in management and development of their collaboration with the readers [2] , who are valuable and irreplaceable in the hyperlocal news production and news co-creation.
 Prior research in fields involving citizens as collaborators, innovators, or UGC creators [1] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [10] describes both community and activity. F or example, Brabham [3] reports that the strongest motivations to participate to the online photo agency iStockphoto are the desire to make money, develop individual skills and to have fun. In our earlier study in which nine re aders who had sent photos to the Finnish hyperlocal news publisher were interviewed, we found that the monetary reward, sharing one X  X  photos with others as well as informing the wider public about local issues were important motivations to participate [10] [11] . This paper presents first results on the participation motivations of 39 active readers, who submit photo content to a hyperlocal news content provider in Helsinki metropolitan area in Finla nd. We aim to answer the following research question based on an online questionnaire: What motivates readers to contribute to hyperlocal news that are published by a new s organization? We studied the readers X  motivations to send photos to the hyperlocal news p ublisher (Sanoma Kaupunkilehdet) which operates in the metropolitan Helsinki area (Finland) . Organization publishes two print tabloids, one weekly (Vartti) and one on weekdays (Metro), as well as online news daily (Omakaupunki.fi). Organizat ion uses readers X  photo content as a central form of tip -offs for reporting hyperlocal news . The received readers X  photos are published in an online gallery. The most newsworthy photos are used by the journalists as themes to report on, even within 10-15 m inutes in online news from receiving the reader X  X  photo [11] . Monetary incentives (varying from two movie tickets to 100 euros) are paid for photos that are selected to be published in the printed news tabloids [10] . Jointly with the news organization we carried out a two -month field trial on mobile crowdsourcing. In the trial participants were sent mobile assignments weekly as text messages (SMS) to their mobile phones. Study incl uded as research themes the experiences and development needs related to the crowdsourcing activity, and the participants X  background and motivations to participate in the news making activity as submitters of readers X  photo content. Results presented in this paper are based on closed -ended questions on the participation motivations of the first online questionnaire . It was conducted after the first half of the trial (one month). We exclude here the motivations to participate to the crowdsourcing trial. Th e further results on participation motivations from sentence completions, the second questionnaire after the trial and interview results from 20 interviews will be presented in the future. Participants were recruited to the two -month field trial on mobile crowdsourcing by the news organization. The project manager at the news organization contacted 90 most active readers, who had submitted photos and had been compensated for their published photos within the last half a year. 61 of the contacte d persons agreed to participate in the trial. After the first month, all participants were sent by email a link to the first online questionnaire and asked to fill in the questionnaire. 39 participants responded the questionnaire (18 females, 21 males) on a voluntary basis. Respondents were compensated with two movie tickets (value 17 euros).
 The respondents X  average age was 46 years (SD= 17.7, min=15, max=75, Md=48, q 1 =32, q 3 =61). Most respondents (37/39) had participated to news making by sending readers X  photos from one to five years (min=1, max=23, Md=3, q 1 =2, q respondents except one (38/39) reported capturing readers X  photos for this news organization when a good topic comes about ( X  X nappers X ) . F ourteen (14/39) respondents  X  including the one missing from the previous group of  X  X nappers X  -reported that they intentionally planned and searched for topics ( X  X unters X ). were sent by email a link to the first onlin e questionnaire. As one of the questions in the questionnaire, we asked the respondents to select their most important motivations to submit photos to the news organization. Participants were allowed to select multiple items from a list of eight items and as a ninth item  X  X ther X , with an open field to describe their other motivation(s). The eight items were created based on findings in our earlier study [10] , and earlier literature on sharing photos online [7] [3] , online open innovation communities [1] , idea contests [6] , and open source software development [5] , for example. The result s presented in this paper were analyzed by descriptive statistics and with crosstabulations for gender and content creation style based results. We first discuss the results of the whole sample and then discuss the gender and content creation style based differences.
 The most important reported motivations to participate were fun (84.6%) and the opportunity to get a monetary reward (84.6%) (Table 1). The third top motivation is informing others of local issues (74.4%). These three strongest motivatio ns are followed by participation to the news making activity (48.7%), and self -expression (46.2%). The sixth motivation is the opportunity for extra income (38.5%). These results indicate that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations have an important rol e for the active readers who participate in the news content creation.

T he percentages for the gender based difference between these motivations are shown in Table 1 as grey cells . Male respondents report these more often as important motivations to participate. It should be noted, that the type of method used for the selectio n of most important motivations in this study may affect the self -reports by respondents.
 Does the content creation style affect the reported motivations? We analyzed the reported motivations based on the type of the content creator X  X  activity . We compared the respondents who reported to intentionally plan and search for topics ( X  X unter X , N=14) to those that only captured photos when a good topic came by ( X  X napper only X , N=25) (Table 2) . Those, that intentionally planned and search ed for topics more frequently report ed as an important motivation the  X  X pportunity for extra income X  (64.3% vs. 24.0%),  X  X evelopment as a photographer X  (50.0% vs. 28.0%) as well as  X  X enefit for work experience or for professional development X  (21.4% vs. 4.0%). Results seem to indic ate that there is a difference between these two groups of content creators in their participation motivations.

These issues will be reported elsewhere as well as studied further in the same context. We studied the motivations of readers to participate in creation of user -generated content, in form of readers X  photos, to hyperlocal news. Based on 39 responses to an online questionnaire from active readers we found that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations exist for participation. The activity and participation seems to be fun and engaging in itself. Furthermore, it offers a possibility to inform others of loca l issues and enables self -expression. In addition, the opportunity to get a monetary reward and even the opportunity for extra income are important motivations . When comparing the content creators X  motivations based on how they come across their photo topics (content creation style) , we found that there is a clear difference in motivations between two groups. Those, who plan and search the photo topics (hunters) report more often the opportunity for extra income as a motivation compared to those who capture photos when a good topic comes about (snappers) .
