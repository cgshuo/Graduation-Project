 Networks with complex topology describe systems as diverse as the cell, the World Wide Web or the society. The emergence of most networks is driven by self-organizing processes that are governed by simple but generic laws. The analysis of the cellular network of various organisms shows that cells and complex man-made networks, such as the Internet or the world wide web, and many social and collaboration networks share the same large-scale topology. I will show that the scale-free topology of these complex webs have important consequences on their robustness against failures and attacks, with implications on drug design, the Internet's ability to survive attacks and failures, and the ability of ideas and innovations to spread on the network.
 Albert-L X szl X  Barab X si is the Emil T. Hofman Professor of Physics at University of Notre Dame. Born in Transylvania, and educated in Bucharest and Budapest, he received a Ph.D. in physics in 1994 from Boston University. After spending a year at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center he joined Notre Dame in 1995. His research has lead to the discovery and understanding of scale-free networks, capturing the structure of many complex networks in technology and nature, from the World Wide Web to the cell. His current research focuses on applying the concepts developed by his group for characterizing the topology of the www and the Internet to uncovering the structural and topological properties of complex metabolic and genetic networks. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. His recent general audience book entitled Linked: The New Science of Networks (Perseus, 2002) is currently available on ten languages. For more information see http://www.nd.edu/~alb.
