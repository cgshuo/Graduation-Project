 Alternate reality games (ARGs) represent a unique form of group collaboration. The comparison of ARGs to more traditional groupware systems around themes of group formation and collective storytelling provides several questions for the study of groupwork and groupware systems.

 Design, Human Factors, Theory. Alternate Reality Games, Group ware, Groupwork, Storytelling Traditional groupware systems enable organizations to manage and improve the effectiveness of employ ee collaboration, typically around a particular task or problem area. But what happens when the task is not well defined? What happens when the workers are autonomous, collaborate online, and have no real authority over one another? Such is the case for alternate reality games (ARGs), where users self-coordinate to orchestrate and comp lete a deep composition of tasks driven by a fictional story managed by game designers (who are often referred to as puppet masters). These games are characterized by their mixed use of online and offline components. For instance, players may be given a set of GPS coordinates hidden in the source code of a web page that refer to physical locations containing clues. The goal of this poster is to draw an initial comparison between ARGs and more traditional groupware systems across themes of group formation and collective storytelling. These themes emerged as areas of interest in the preliminary results from our open coding of a set of 30 discussion forums populated by the players of the popular ARG ILoveBees. Constructed to require the collective intelligence [2] of its players to solve a variety of puzzles, ILoveBees sought to provide an interactive bridge between the worlds of the Halo 1 and Halo 2 games. Many researchers have investigated this game as a gold standard in the ARG genre, documenting the types of tasks presented to players [1] and reporting on the co-evolution of the story by the players and puppet masters [4]. Player behaviors in ILoveBees have been witnessed in other ARGs [6]. In the following two sections, charac teristics from our investigation of the ILoveBees ARG are first discussed. We continue with a comparison of these characteristics to current and past groupware systems. A final section summarizes these comparisons and raises questions for future research. A prevailing reason for ARG creation is to promote some existing media, venue, or brand. As such, most ARGs are open systems where anyone can join and only minimal barriers to entry exist. Organizationally, these systems resemble amorphous peer-to-peer groups with rather flat management structures. For participants in the ILoveBees ARG, no formal hierarchy existed, though tensions occasionally arose between: newcomers and those more experienced with ARGs and be tween those primarily interested in playing the ARG and those primarily interested in the Halo content. While the overall membership for ILoveBees was substantial (estimated at over 600,000 at points [4]), most were passive observers, echoing the common online community pattern of lurkers outnumbering actives. Most intera ctions, then, took place among smaller informal subgroups of 10-15 individuals. Though membership in the community was continuous, membership in these subgroups was more fluid, often forming in response to a particular task or purpose. Participants vo lunteered personal information to facilitate subgroup formation; members were witnessed revealing competencies, knowledge, skills, resources, availability, and geographical location. Subgroups di ssolved as tasks were completed and their purpose no longer deemed necessary. A comparison can be made between the group formation traits of ARGs and those of other self-organiz ing communities of practice like Wikipedia and open-source softwa re. The Wikipedia system, for instance, plays host to a group of volunteers who come together to collaboratively author content. Ta sks are centered on developing a specific article; once it is finished the group dissolves. Similarly, in open source software development software creation is broken down into multiple subtasks, generally designated by the primary author or a small design team [5]. Multiple members volunteer for each task, contributing their skills to the project and debating problems in discussion forum style systems attached to the project subtasks. As each task is completed the team rearranges itself based on emerging tasks or new development projects. Similar to ILoveBees, membership in the community is generally continuous, though membership in subgroups is fluid and centers around the individual skills required to move the project as a whole to successful conclusion. In considering traits of group formation, ARGs bear more in common to self-organizing communities of practice than to traditional groupwork systems developed for use in organizational settings. In this latter environment, a top-down approach is predominantly used to encourage employees to take part in tasks of knowledge capture, dissemination, and problem solving. Here expertise is well known, reducing the need to volunteer self ratings. Further, specific tasks are generally assigned to task forces, as opposed to being voluntarily formed based on skill sets and personal interest. Once a task is completed, team members are reassigned to other tasks. In the context of ARGs (and ILoveBees specifically), we found that storytelling occurred on a few different levels. First, the game itself is based on a fictional story sketched out by puppet masters. To create the game, the puppet masters generate a storyline related to the focus of the game. In the case of ILoveBee s, the story is related to the Halo universe and is intended to promote the release of Halo 2. As a result, a side-story is created to attract and engage people in play in the Halo universe through the piece-wise telling of a story. Although the space of actions in the game is limited in some ways by the puppet masters through the selection of initial characters, settings and plot elements, the story is not completely specified at the beginning and evolves throughout the game. As the players solve puzzles and unlock more of the story, they speculate on what could happen next in the game. These meta-stories sometimes contribute new story lines and game content. For example, during a live phone call with a non-player character, a pl ayer decided to sing a song that relates to the game story. In a subsequent challenge, the character asks players to sing her a song. In this way, what was a player X  X  choice to sing a song is turned into a puzzle in the game that reveals more about the character X  X  personality. In some cases, the players introduced new characters or subplots as a result of speculation. Thus, the story emerges from the interaction between puppet master plans and player actions. In addition to speculative stor ies, some players engage in a complementary activity that involves collaboratively constructing the  X  X tory so far X  using elements that have been confirmed through the actions of non-player characters. In this process, the players produce a linear narrative that describes what has happened in the story so far. This type of story provides background for new and casual players and a reference for more up-to-date players. All of these story types form an ecology of collective storytelling in ARGs. All of the types of story are connected or related. To create the game, the puppet masters create a storyline on which to base the activities in the game. However, this story is not fully specified and depends on the actions of the players in the game. Player speculation influences the course of the story, which is then codified in a linear narrative by those focused on constructing the plot from beginning to end. The value of storytelling within group support systems has a rich history that has been shown to assist in sensemaking activities. For example, [7] discusses storytelling as a primary component of copy repair technicians X  ability to remember solutions to difficult tasks, transfer their knowledge to peers, and create solutions to new problems, and [3] discusses the valu e of  X  X ar stories X  in software maintenance tasks. Such activities provide a sense of information in context, and are often told through face-to-face exchanges. As groups become more dispersed, such as when organizations become distributed across the world, or when confederate groups of differing organizations coalesce to undertake a shared project, support for storytelling through groupware syst ems becomes critical to preserve context and disseminate information. In this area, groupware systems have faltered. Instead of active ly supporting storytelling, most groupware systems do little more than encourage the transfer of facts, offering little regard to rich underly ing stories [9]. In these situations, participants incorrectly assume shared context, a hazard that can result in incorrect conclusions when information is applied. Despite the difficulties in capturin g and disseminating rich contextual information within organization-based groupware systems, there are bright spots in successful storytelling that is aided by group support systems. For example, [8] describe s how storytelling in video blogs can be an effective means to disseminate craft knowledge in context to a wider community, which in tu rn frequently leads to new and novel methods, theories, and inventions. Individually, many of the behaviors and patterns observed in the ILoveBees ARG are not unknown to groupware systems. In comparing these different systems across themes of group formation and collective storytelling, new research questions emerge. Several questions emerge from the comparison of group formation in ARGs and groupware systems. Will the process of team formation in ARGs resemble those that exist in formal organizations and informal group systems such as the open source community, when examined across long time membership in an ARG (or across multiple ARGs)? Are there lessons that can be drawn from ARG group formation that can be applied to structure group formation in other organizational settings to increase the effectiveness and overall value of group work? Questions also arise from the comparison between the limited support of storytelling in traditional gr oupware systems and the engrained storytelling behavior found in the ILoveBees ARG. Given the challenges with capturing rich stories, would wrapping organizational groupware systems within ARG style environments help elicit an atmosphere that encourages storytelling to preserve context? Taken together, are there any lessons that we can learn from the study of these systems that we could no t get from other groupware systems, or that could exert influence on traditional groupware systems to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their processes? The study of ARGs can lead to richer understandings of groupware systems and spur research to help increase the effectiveness of groupware systems. [1] Kim, J. Y., Allen, J. P., &amp; Lee, E. (2008).
