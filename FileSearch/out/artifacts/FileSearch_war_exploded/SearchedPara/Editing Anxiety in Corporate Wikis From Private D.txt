 Wikis have recently erupted on to the Knowledge Management scene. However, their organizational and social impact is not yet fully understood. Wikis enjoy a great popularity partially due to the success of Wikipedia . Key to this success is a crucial innovation in the publishing model: review work after publication, not before [ 18 ]. This approach has been extremely successful for open communi-ties. Spurred by this success, organizations have rushed to tap into this facility for knowledge sharing and co-creation [ 14  X  16 , 21 ]. Specifically, wikis have been suggested as  X  X  place for ideation to occur by providing an open and demo-cratic environment for individuals and teams to share ideas. Wikis X  open and organic nature can allow the capture of ideas quickly and promotes the growth of ideas as they develop X  [ 20 ]. However, the basis on which Wikipedia X  X  success is based might not apply to other organizations. Wikipedia culture is charac-terized by volunteer, hobbyist, potentially anonymous, peer-based, no-deadline, factual contributions. If these contextual factors change, then results might vary [ 9 , 11 ]. Moving from open communities to closed organizations might change these contextual factors (e.g. named contributions, existence of power relation-ships, possible compulsory editing). This begs the questions as to whether wikis are still  X  X  place for ideation to occur X .
 generation) precedes writing. Flower states that  X  X  writer in the act of discovery is hard at work searching memory, forming concepts, and forging a new structure of ideas, while at the same time trying to juggle all the constraints imposed by his or her purpose, audience, and language itself ...This act of creating ideas, not finding them, is at the heart of significant writing X  [ 8 ]. Open wikis suggest that these activities (i.e. searching memory, forming concepts, forging a struc-ture of ideas) are collaboratively fleshed out. However, when wiki content goes beyond facts to enter the fuzzy realms of ideas, this model is challenged. For enterprises, Lykourentzou et al. report that a common employee concern is that sharing work-in-progress may negatively affect the assessments they receive [ 15 ]. This might be due to corporate users  X  X ften feel strong personal ownership of content they add (and are organizationally accountable for it) and a correspond-ing unwillingness to edit content owned by others X . This leads some authors to state that enterprises often use wikis as a technology but let the wiki philosophy of openness leave behind [ 18 ].
 tions. Yet, wikis are being used for other Knowledge Management activities [ 14 ], and hence, wikis might well be the place were ideas arise. Studies recommend anchoring ideas at the place where they emerge for easy remembering and con-textualization [ 1 ]. This raises this paper X  X  research question: how to reconcile the convenience of elaborating ideas within the Corporate wiki while, at the same time, overcoming the reluctance to publish work-in-progress.
 model with in-line drafting .  X  X n-line X  indicates that drafting should occur within the wiki.  X  X rafting X  suggests that idea generation is not off-the-cuff. Rather, ideas are the result of a crafting process where contribution opportunities are first spotted; next, raw material is collected and elaborated upon, till it eventually ends up as a draft ready to be published. This paper delves into in-line drafting as follows:  X  providing a model for in-line wiki drafting (Section 2),  X  realizing this model through Wikinote , a browser extension on top of Medi- X  validating this extension through the Wiki Anxiety Inventory-Editing ques-The latter supports the hypothesis that Wikinote reduces user anxiety when contributing to a Corporate wiki. We hypothesize that the fact that Wikinote allows users to share ideas once in a mature state is the major anxiety reducer, hence increasing positive affect towards wiki editing and reducing contribution judgement anxiety. This section looks into what compels people to edit in a wiki. According to one hypothesis [ 4 ], people contribute to solve cognitive incongruities between the current state of a wiki article and their own knowledge. Cress et al. hypoth-esize that the likelihood for this to happen is a function of two features: the size of the incongruity between the individual X  X  knowledge and the wiki X  X  information on the one hand, and the valence which the topic has for people on the other hand . Cross et al. conclude that  X  X nly a medium-level incongruity causes a cog-nitive conflict which motivates people to engage X  in wiki editing [ 4 ]. According to this model, the flow between the social system (i.e. the wiki) and the cognitive systems (i.e. the individual) is regulated along two processes:  X  Externalization . For contributing to the development of a wiki, people first have to externalize their knowledge. For that purpose, a person X  X  own knowl-edge has to be conveyed into a wiki article in a form that maps the person X  X  knowledge. The mental effort necessary for the externalization can extend people X  X  individual knowledge, because externalization requires deeper pro-cessing and clarification.  X  Internalization . Inter-individual knowledge transfer and collaborative knowl-edge building take place when people have the opportunity to work with a wiki and to internalize the information available in the wiki. This individual knowledge is enriched in two ways: (1) absorbing facts already existing in the wiki and (2), developing new knowledge as a result of the existing per-sonal knowledge being somehow challenged by the wiki facts (a.k.a. emergent knowledge). The latter is described through Piaget X  X  model of equilibration where the learning trigger is the cognitive conflict between individual knowl-edge and external knowledge (e.g. the one in the wiki).
 Externalization and internalization intermingle to output collaborative knowl-edge building, and emergent knowledge creation. This model might well explain people X  X  impulse to edit on open wikis. However, Corporate wikis bring into play other considerations. For a Justin Bieber fan who spots a mistake on Bieber X  X  Wikipedia article about his birthday date, the high valence of the topic, the easily-identifiable incongruity, and the lightweight effort required, will most likely lead to restore coherence (i.e. editing Bieber X  X  article, and correct the date). But, what if the incongruity emerges when reading a workmate X  X  edit in the Corpo-rate wiki? Unlike the Bieber example, this alters both the subject matter and the context:  X  Subject matter: facts vs. ideas. Encyclopaedia entries tend to be about facts.
For instance, Wikipedia articles must not contain original research. That is, thereisnoroomin Wikipedia to refer to  X  X aterial for which no reliable,  X  Context: open vs. close. Prestige and power relationships might act as stres-This new setting might prevent  X  X he incongruity impulse X  from surmounting the larger externalization effort and the anxiety brought by peer pressure. Notice however that the impulse is still there. The issue is how to channel this impulse into a medium-run effort that increases the chances of ending up in an edit. Our premise is that personal drafting might be such a channel, and that publish-ing more elaborated edits might reduce both editability anxiety and contribution judgment anxiety, hence, leading to a more participatory wiki. This begs the question of what is meant by  X  X laborated edits X , i.e. how much elaboration is needed before being ready to publication.
 the anxiety growth w.r.t. the degree of edit elaboration. If edits are published prematurely, then it might have a negative impact on the user prestige, hence, increasing user anxiety and eventually, putting users off. However, if users wait for edits to be fully elaborated, then the externalization effort increases, and so do the chances of conflicts with other wiki users, both aspects also discourag-ing editing. Our hypothesis is that a compromise can be found for  X  X aragraph edits X  (approx. less than 300 characters) where the upfront investment of exter-nalization pays off in terms of a reduction in anxiety.
 Previous considerations guide our design of a wiki-specific drafting facility, namely:  X  Internalization (specifically, emergent knowledge) results from being exposed to the wiki where  X  X he cognitive conflict X  emerges. This sustains in-line drafting.  X  Externalization does not require the interaction with other people in a nar-row sense. People can externalize their knowledge (and thereby extend their own knowledge) without necessarily addressing other people in the first place.
This sustains personal drafting.  X  Externalization might imply an important upfront investment that can later be challenged by the community. This sustains paragraph drafting (as opp-osed to document drafting) as a  X  X reakeven point X .
 The next section addresses how these insights guide Wikinote design . This section advocates a third wiki mode: the draft mode. Today X  X  wiki engines support two main modes: the edit mode (for article editing) and the talk mode (for article discussion). The draft mode departs from existing modes in the fol-lowing aspects:  X  Storage. Traditional modes (i.e. edit and talk ) differ in the subject matter (article content vs. article discussion) but the text is readily made public (i.e. moved to the MediaWiki database server). In contrast, when on the draft mode, edits are local, i.e. no trace is left on the MediaWiki database but on the browser local storage.  X  Rendering. Traditional modes promote contribution through WYSIWYG editors: no difference between the existing content and the new additions.
By contrast, draft edits are better reflected in a change-control manner.  X  Lifecycle. In traditional modes, edits are readily followed by publication. In contrast, drafts go through a maturity process before being published. Figure 2 depicts the idea maturity model along the following landmarks: spark, gather, elaborate and consolidate . Each landmark has a GUI counterpart. Wikinote extends MediaWiki X  X  Visual Editor 3 with the draft mode, i.e. a set of Graphical-User Interactions (GUIs) that realize each of the abovementioned actions. Wikinote has been tested with Google X  X  Chrome version 39, MediaWiki X  X  version 1.25 and Visual Editor X  X  version 0.1.0. It is available at the Chrome Web Store : https:// chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lohjainijkgonhljngepoaphjpljeiii .Next,we describe each action X  X  purpose and its support in Wikinote . These actions become available as soon as the user puts the draft switch on. Worth noticing the draft mode only makes sense for contributions of a certain calibre and size. Typo corrections and minor rewritings are not worth the effort. 3.1 Spark Purpose. Firstly, we consider the process of translating a thought into a physical or digital format. The  X  X ight-bulb moment X  can come at any time. It might well happen when the user is engaged in other activities with no time to further elaborate the idea. Frequently, users resort to digital/physical artefacts (e.g. Post-it notes) to record the idea. This calls for capturing ideas at the place where they arise. In addition, it contextualizes the idea by the setting where it emerges, hence, facilitating recovering [ 1 ]. Realization. In a wiki setting, ideas/incongruities might show up when reading wiki content. To not distract users from their current reading flow, spark aims only at noting the incongruity for later attention. The important point is the capture speed. Even seemingly minor difficulties or annoyances with tools could deter use of a tool. Striving to mimic wiki X  X  WYSIWYG editor, incongruities are noted in a very similar way to wiki references. Wikis X  bibliographical references are denoted as superscripts. Likewise, incongruities are conceived as  X  X ognitive references X , and denoted as  X  X ulb X  superscripts (see Figure 2 ). Select the text causing the incongruity, click the  X  X ulb X  icon in the editor bar, and a menu pops up to request the incongruity X  X  rationale (e.g.  X  X obile Augmentation benefits X ). This rationale will act as the  X  X ulb X  label for later indexing (see later). On acceptance, the  X  X ulb X  superscript appears by the wiki sentence. 3.2 Gather Purpose. Externalization is not a one-shot process but time is needed for the idea to mature. This might imply collecting evidence, thoughts and references that can be sought on purpose or stumbled upon. This is realized in terms of scraps . While bulbs act as reminders, scraps refer to generally small, discon-nected sentences that develop some of the twist brought about by the incongruity. Hence, scraps do not exist in a vacuum but qualify an incongruity.
 Realization. Again lightweight mechanisms become a must for both scrap gath-ering and posterior recovering. Coming across an interesting scrap might well occur when users are performing some other attentionally engaging primary tasks. For this reason, lowering both the actual and perceived cost of cognitive and physical effort may improve gathering.
 browsing the web, when reading an article at the desktop, when traveling, etc. So far, Wikinote supports two settings. In both cases, gathering is a click away:  X  When browsing the Web, the right-click contextual menu has been extended  X  When reading the wiki, manually-typed scraps can be created. Select first No matter how they are obtained, scraps are collected into the scrap box (see Figure 2 ). Wikinote only shows those scraps attached to the currently-selected  X  X ulb X . Move to a different  X  X ulb X , and so will do the scrap box. If no  X  X ulb X  is selected, the scrap box hides behind the namesake tab, so that it does not interfere with the reading. 3.3 Elaborate Purpose. So far, the article X  X  content has been left untouched. Except for the  X  X ulb X  annotation, we have not yet addressed changes on the content of the arti-cle. This has been so for presentation sake. Actually, users might change article content at wish. Nevertheless, directly changing article content makes sense for minor edits (e.g. typos, spelling mistakes, etc.) but this is not the scenario under consideration. Rather, we target changes that require some previous elaboration before being substantiated as article paragraphs.  X  X ulbs X  and scraps help to stage this development that will eventually produce a draft , i.e. a set of changes on the article content that stands for a meaningful unit to tackle a given  X  X ulb X . Realization. This action does not imply a change on the WYSIGYG way in which users are accustomed to modifying the article X  X  content. However, and unlike Visual Editor , modifications are reflected in a change-control manner. This is recommended when working on top of somewhere else X  X  content. Besides acting directly upon the wiki content, users might also drag&amp;drop scraps. This permits first working on the scrap box (e.g. rephrasing/tinging content obtained from the Web, merging scraps which convey a similar argument, etc.) till a scrap is elaborated enough to be moved to the content canvas. The scrap then becomes part of the draft.
 cally attached to the so-generated draft X  X  paragraph. In this way, Wikinote auto-matically supports provenance, i.e. keeping track of the sources. Second, draft changes are local, i.e. they have any no impact on the content of the underlying article. Except the author, no one can yet see the draft. Basically, actions gather and elaborate intertwine to gradually produce the draft. During this process, the underlying article can be changed by other wiki users. Those changes are visible for the draft author. On the upside, this implies that draft authors are always aware of the most recent version of the article. On the downside, article upgrades might unsettle draft edits. Indeed, drafts are implemented as layers on top of the article content, i.e. draft edits are  X  X nchored X  to the article content. Different mechanisms are implemented to make drafts resilient to changes on the underlying article content [ 5 ]. Nevertheless, it can happen that the article text that underpins a draft annotation is eventually removed annotation becomes dangling, and it is up to the author to re-anchor it again. Eventually, the draft is ready for consolidation. 3.4 Consolidate Purpose. Consolidate is the process whereby drafts become published, i.e. all the article X  X  drafts are publicly exposed as if they were a single MediaWiki edit. Realization. The  X  Consolidate  X  button achieves this transition. From an exter-nal reader, no differences should exist between edits achieved via Visual Editor or those obtained through Wikinote . Only the edit summary of the edit. An edit summary is a brief explanation of an edit to a wiki page. For Wikinote edits, this summary is automatically generated indicating the fact that this is a Wikinote edit. The summary also includes the incongruity rationale that triggered the edit in the first place. Wikinote aims at reducing anxiety users might feel when editing a Corporate wiki, thus fostering contributions. This section evaluates whether Wikinote fulfils such a goal while intending to quantify its effect. The driving hypothesis follows: Wikinote reduces user anxiety when contributing to a Corporate wiki.
 In a Corporate setting, users edit a wiki on a normal basis. Hence, we opted for evaluating Wikinote in their normal environment instead of bringing partic-ipants to a laboratory, where the anxiety motivated by the setting itself could interfere with our measures. The following section delves into the details of the experimental design. 4.1 Experimental Design We state the goal of the experiment using the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) method: analyse the wiki anxiety of users working with Wikinote, for the purpose of comparing it with a baseline alternative ( MediaWiki alone), with respect to user anxiety, from the point of view of a researcher trying to assess Wikinote, in the context of user X  X  usual wiki editing activities.
 users feel when editing the wiki will be the dependent variable . These variables lead to a unifactorial design [ 19 ]. As we want to evaluate the difference Wikinote introduces, we designed an experiment with repeated measures, where the same participants edited with and without Wikinote . In order to counteract the impact of the order in which participants edited, we counterbalanced it, i.e. half of the participants first edited without Wikinote and then tried it whereas the other half performed the edits in the opposite order.
 a questionnaire that has shown high validity and reliability ( =0.93) [ 3 ]. This instrument presents significant and strong correlation with state anxiety mea-sured directly after wiki editing [r(48) =0.73, P X 0.001] as well as with fear of negative evaluation [r(48)= 0.42,P=0.002]. It, however, has not shown significant correlation with trait anxiety [r(48) =0.27,P=0.06], suggesting that the anxiety it measures is more based on the context of a wiki edit than on the traits of the users performing it. A component analysis of WAI-E revealed three factors that explain 62% of the variance. They were termed positive affect , editability anxiety ,and contribution judgement anxiety that allow understanding different aspects of user anxiety in wiki editing [ 3 ].
 sity of the Basque Country using volunteer sampling. Three faculty members and five Ph.D. students, who all use a wiki on a daily basis in the context of a research group, answered the call. In particular Ph.D. students use the wiki as the main means to summarize their work and discuss it with their advisor. The experi-ment took place over a week and a half. The aim was to compare Wikinote (i.e. in-line drafting) with the baseline case (i.e. traditional review-after-publication as supported by MediaWiki). Since editability anxiety very much depends on what is being written and who reads it, we did not devise specific tasks but instructed participants to keep writing their reports in the wiki as usual. To counterbalance the effect of tool order (i.e., with and without Wikinote), partic-ipants were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group was asked to fill out the WAI-E questionnaire shortly after it had performed a substantial edit to the wiki (i.e., one that involved at least two paragraphs). They were given Monday and Tuesday for this task. Wikinote was then presented to both groups in a 45 X  session on Wednesday. Next, both groups were requested to complete the WAI-E questionnaire after a substantial edit they made using Wikinote dur-ing Thursday or Friday. Lastly, participants in the second group were asked to uninstall Wikinote and to answer the WAI-E questionnaire after a substantial edit during the following Monday or Tuesday, this time without Wikinote. In all cases, participants were requested to start the questionnaire (see less Table 1 ) than five minutes after the edit, so that the state anxiety generated by the wiki editing could be measured. 4.2 Analysis The data collected did not fulfil the assumptions of parametric tests. Specifically, Shapiro-Wilk tests showed a significant deviance from normality (as we had less than 50 subjects). Hence, we resorted to non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for this analysis. Eight subjects participated in the experiment (3 lecturers and 5 Ph.D. students), of whom 50% were male and 50% female. Regarding age, the average was 32.5 years with a standard deviation of 8.14. All of them use a wiki on a normal basis as part of their work: they all add content to a wiki from one to five times a week. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the WAI-E items. All items correspond to a five point Likert scale (1-Strongly Disagree, 5-Strongly Agree).
 deviation values of participants X  responses to the WAI-E scale and its sub-scales are presented: Baseline stands for editing with MediaWiki built-in facil-ities whereas Wikinote refers to editing with the namesake extension. T and p columns represent the T value of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the sig-nificance, respectively. In metrics where statistically significant differences were found (i.e., p  X  0.05), the effect size was calculated using r . A value of this parameter above 0.5 in absolute values denotes a large effect size as a result of the independent variable (i.e., the use of Wikinote ). The r values are presented in the last column of the table.
 ference when Wikinote is introduced as measured by WAI-E, and also, in each of its subscales (i.e., positive affect, editability anxiety and contribution judge-ment anxiety). Wikinote introduces the largest effect in increasing participants X  positive affect towards wiki editing (r=0.633) and decreasing their contribution judgement anxiety (r=-0.706).
 reduces user anxiety when contributing to a Corporate wiki. We hypothesize that the fact that Wikinote allows users to share ideas once they are in a mature state is the major anxiety reducer, hence increasing positive affect towards wiki editing and reducing contribution judgement anxiety.
 Threats to Validity. A main concern for internal validity is the appropriate-ness of the sample. The first issue relates to sample size. Even though our results show statistically significant differences and large effect sizes, larger groups are needed to corroborate these findings. A second issue involves the participants X  background. Participants are technically savvy, which may have had an impact in their attitude towards wiki editing. Moreover, the wiki they work with, is relatively small and only 15 people have access to it. The last issue concerns the external validity. We used an opportunistic sample of faculty and Ph.D. stu-dents. We hypothesize that contribution anxiety in a corporate setting might be larger than in academia. While this hypothesis might likely result in Wikinote performing better, the different environments might lead to different results. Specifically, Wikinote might delay idea sharing, specifically for people too per-fectionist or image conscious, hindering the chances of integrating someone else X  X  viewpoints in the early stage of idea conception. Wikinote combines features of an editor (i.e. it acts upon article content), an annotator (i.e. it introduces  X  X ulb X  annotations) and a note-taking facility (i.e. the scrap box). This unique blend and its wiki-oriented purpose differentiate Wikinote from related tools. The next paragraphs provide a review.
 Wiki Editors. Wikinote can be aligned with efforts of promoting wiki contribu-tion. Recent research shows that the number of active contributors in Wikipedia has been declining steadily for years. The blame is put on the restrictiveness of the encyclopaedia X  X  primary quality control mechanisms, and the algorithmic tools used to reject contributions [ 10 ]. As a result,  X  X oth newcomers and experi-enced editors are moving increasingly toward less formal spaces X  [ 10 ]. Wikinote can be regarded as providing one possible realization of this  X  X ess formal X  space. In the same vein (i.e. promoting contributions among newcomers), other works give support for validating content (e.g. ConstrainedWiki [ 6 ]), enhancing content (e.g. VisualWikiCurator [ 13 ]) or socially elaborating content (e.g. Teahouse [ 17 ]). Wikinote provides a different support by providing a secluded setting for drafting once the article is in full swing.
 Note Taking. Note-taking is the practice of recording information captured from another source. In the commercial front, Evernote is one of the best-known examples. In academia, MADCOW [ 2 ]and SPREADCRUMBS [ 12 ]present similitudes with Wikinote : the use of contextual menus for note-taking. Dif-ferences stem from the architecture. Both MADCOW and SPREADCRUMBS resort to a server for note storage. In contrast, we purposefully design Wikinote to be uniquely browser-based. No need to open an account in someone else X  X  server (like in Evernote ). All wikinotes are locally kept. This feature might be specially attractive for organizations that could be reluctant to offload sensi-tive information into third-party servers. Wikinote can afford to limit itself to local storage since it is not thought of for long-term storage (like Evernote ) but transient memory till the draft gets ready for wiki consolidation.
 Annotation Systems. There is a wide range of annotation tools for Web pages (e.g. Diigo ; see [ 7 ] for an overview). An annotation is an added note that explains something in a text. Hence, annotations are not the text as such but meta-data about the text. Most tools are generic. This is at the same time their strength and their weakness. The advantage is that they annotate no matter the website. The downside is that such decoupling forces users to cope with two different Web experiences: the one of the annotation tool (e.g. Diigo ) and the one of the annotated website (e.g. Wikipedia ). By contrast, Wikinote explores a differ-ent approach: wiki-specific annotation. This accounts for a seamless integration of editing and annotation commands (e.g. the  X  X ulb X  icon), hence promoting prompt in-line annotation, and eventually, editing. The bottom line is that if annotation is the prelude of editing, then facilitating annotation becomes a main wiki concern, not to be left to third-party generic software. This study addresses idea generation in Corporate wikis on two main premises. First, incongruities raised during wiki reading may spur contributions. This momentum should be readily captured and sustained as smoothly as possi-ble, and ideally, supported within the wiki realm. Second, lowering the bar for drafting might result in more elaborated edits being published. This, in turn, might decrease both editing anxiety and contribution judgement anxiety. To test this out, a personal in-line drafting browser extension is developed: Wikinote . Wikinote extends MediaWiki X  X  Visual Editor with the draft mode. First val-idations suggest that Wikinote is effective in reducing editing anxiety. Addi-tional validations are needed to assess not only effectiveness but also usability. In this respect, we are currently addressing scrap portability, i.e. notes captured by no matter the tool to be easily contextualized/rendered within wiki articles. Specifically, we are planning to capitalize on Evernote and Mendeley note-taking facilities to be seamlessly accessible through Wikinote X  X  scrap box.
