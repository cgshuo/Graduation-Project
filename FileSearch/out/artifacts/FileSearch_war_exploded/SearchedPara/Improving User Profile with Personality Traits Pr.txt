 Existing studies indicate that there exists strong correlation between personality and personal preference, thus personal-ity could potentially be used to build more personalized rec-ommender system. Personality traits are mainly measured by psychological questionnaires, and it is hard to obtain per-sonality traits of large amount of users in real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically identify personality traits with Social Media contents in Chi-nese language environments. Social Media content features were extracted from 1766 Sina micro blog users, and the pre-dicting model is trained with machine learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that users X  person-ality traits could be predicted from Social Media contents with acceptable Pearson Correlation, which makes it pos-sible to develop user profiles for recommender system. In future, user profiles with predicted personality traits would be used to enhance the performance of existing personalized recommendation systems.

The Internet is growing dramatically and has become part of daily life. Recommender systems using personalized user profiles are widely used in e-commerce sites. Exiting re-searches about personalized recommendation system enhanced A uthor for correspondence.
 recommendation system performance by taking users X  per-sonal preference into consideration when generating user profiles [8]. Some studies have been performed for discover-ing the correlation between psychological traits(personality) and personal preference [11] [15] [18]. Results of these re-searches indicate that personality could affect the desire of online purchase, musical taste, etc. Improving user profile with personality traits could probably enhance personalized recommendation system performance. Social Media is one of the most popular kinds of websites, and users are gen-erating large amount of text contents. Sina micro blog is the most popular micro blog in China, which is reported as having 300 million register users and over 100 million mi-cro blog statuses were posted every day [1]. Personalizing Recommendation Systems based on social media usage be-havior and content is among the top topics of the overall Internet area in both academia and business. However, user personality traits were mainly measured with psychological questionnaire. It is hardly possible to obtain personality traits of such large amount of users in real-world person-alized recommendation system application scenes. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically develop user profile (personality traits) with Social Media contents in Chinese language environments. Sogou Cell Lexicons and Simple Chinese dictionaries for LIWC were built for psycho-logical traits analysis in text contents.
 Personality is a typical and enduring topic in psychology. The rapid growth of SNS(Social Network Sites) Usage pro-vides a possible approach to automatically determine human personality.

Jon Oberlander found that classifying author personality from web blog text is promising [17]. Golbeck presented a promising method to predict user personality through the information on SNS in English language environment [6] [7].
Nass had demonstrated that personality factors could af-fect the desire of the users to buy products online [14]. Per-sonality was found to be related to musical taste too [18]. Many other studies have been done for discovering the cor-relation between personality and personal preference [15]. China will become the biggest market of e-commerce in the world within a few years. Both Chinese SNS and e-commerce websites will significantly benefit from knowing users X  personality and provide personalized service.
In this study, a method by which user big five personality traits can be accurately determined through text features ex-tracted from Sina Micro blog status was demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this paper may probably make the first attempt to determine personality from micro blog text features in Chinese language environment for recom-mendation system user profile enhancement.

The rest of the paper is organized as following: Section 2 shows the related work. The method by which data cor-pus was collected, processed and experiment results will be shown in Section 3. Section 4 concludes this work and indi-cates an open space for future work.
Musical tastes are related to personality [14] [19] [18], individuals with similar personality traits prefer to similar types of music. Individual X  X  potential music purchase could be sorted with deals which had been made by other people who share the same personality. People prefer to use graph-ical user interfaces designed for their personality types [11]. When people review product comments in e-commercial web sites, their desires to buy the product improve significantly if the comments were written by people who have similar personality types [14]. In western, some successful attempts had been made to improving recommendation systems with information getting from social network [14].

Personality could be predicted from micro blog statuses and individuals X  preferences are related to personality, pro-viding us a new approach to improve the performances of ex-isting recommendation systems. Otherwise, few study has been conducted in Chinese language environment. China will probably become the biggest market for e-commerce, so research on predicting personality and enhancing recommen-dation systems in Chinese language environment is essential. In this paper, a new approach was proposed to develop user profile (personality traits) for Recommendation Systems in Chinese language environment.
Studies had been done to investigate the relationship be-tween Language Usage and Personality [12] [17] [16]. Lin-guistic cues in conversation and text were proved to be capa-ble to recognize individuals X  personality [12]. Web blog texts generated by individuals could be used for classifying author personality [17] [16], it indicates that text content in the in-ternet environments is related with authors X  personality as well as language they use in real world. One study based on the corpus of CRV1 and Enron Email data demonstrates that language features can be used to predict author X  X  gen-der with accuracy of 85.1 percent [3]. In English language environment, a promising method to predict user person-ality through their information on SNS was presented by Golbeck [6] [7]. Micro blog status text features of 50 Twit-ter users X  were extracted by LIWC(Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) software. The correlation ship between text features and personality scores are significant [6]. A model for personality prediction was trained and tested with 279 Facebook users information, and the predicted personality scores and self-reported personality scores were strongly re-lated [7].
 All these studies indicate that predicting personality from Sina micro blog text content is feasible, and have potential
B ig five personality model is recently among the most re-garded and most widely used personality theory [4] [5] [13]. Big five personality model has been proved effective in differ-ent languages [5]. In the Sina Micro blog application, users were invited to complete the 44-question Big Five Inven-tory [2] [10]. In this inventory, user personality is measured in five dimensions:
Table 1 shows the score range of each dimension.
Original status texts of 1766 Sina micro blog users were analyzed in this study. An application was built based on Sina micro blog platform to collect status and administer Big-Five Inventory [8] to users. By calling Sina Application Programming Interface, the basic information (the number of published status, followers and friends) of 99,925,821 users was downloaded in 2012/4/18. These 99,925,821 users were the original user sample set of this text analysis.
Two kinds of users may be inappropriate to be taken into consideration in this text analysis. One kind is the inactive users. They published little original status, so their person-ality can hardly be reflected by text features of their status. The other kind is entertainment star users or advertisement users. Since almost all this kind of micro blog accounts are used for commercial targets. Thus their status should not be analyzed for personality related research.

All the 99,925,821 users were filtered by the following rules: 1. Users who did not publish any status in the last three 2. Users who publish more than 40 statuses per day are
Then, original status texts of 1,953,485 active users were collected as user sample set for this text analysis. About 30,000 users were randomly picked, they were invited to ac-complish widely used O. John X  X  brief 44-item Big-Five In-ventory [8] on our application based on Sina micro blog. 1766 volunteers accepted the invitation int the end and ac-complished Big-Five Inventory. In this study, these 1766 volunteers X  original status texts and Big-Five Inventory re-sult were used as label sample to train predicting model and cross-validation.
Text features were extracted from 1766 user X  X  Sina micro blog status, and then all the features vectors were analyzed to build a predicting model and 10-fold cross-validation with the algorithms Gaussian process, M5 X  X ules and Pace Re-gression. One hundred and sixty eight Text features were extracted in six perspectives: 1. Status statistics features (total number of statuses, to-2. Sentence-based features (average number of Chinese 3. Word-based features (number of emotion words, num-4. Character-based features (number of commas, number 5. Sogou Industry lexicon features. Pinyin input method 6. LIWC(Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) features.
The above features are probably the most related text features to subject information and personality [3]. Chinese text analysis has a challenge: Chinese Word Segmentation. ICTCLAS is one of the most widely used Chinese words parser. Sogou Cell Lexicons and Simplified Chinese dictio-naries for LIWC have been both imported into ICTCLAS as user dictionaries to improve recognition rate of parser. With randomly selected about 90% of 1766 Sina users, M5 X  X ules, Pace Regression and Gaussian process were ap-plied to build predicting models. These models were used to predict the rest about 10% users X  personality traits, and their performances were evaluated by Pearson correlation between predicted personality traits scores and Big-Five In-ventory ratings. Pearson correlation is among the most ma-jor criteria of correlation ship in psychology, thus it is taken as evaluation criteria to measure the accuracy of the pre-dicting model. It is widely accepted that Pearson correla-tion between 0.2 to 0.4 indicates weak correlation, 0.4 to 0.6 indicates mid correlation, and above 0.6 indicates strong or extreme correlation.
The results in Table 2 indicate that personality traits could be predicted through text features extracted from orig-inal micro blog status. Conscientiousness, Extroversion, and Openness to Experience have more significant correlation than Agreeableness and Neuroticism. That is consistent with many other studies [2] [14] [15]. In psychological point of view, the predicted personality has a bit weaker corre-lations with self-report personality than expertise observer ratings has [8]. The Pearson correlation between the pre-dicted personality and self-report is about 0.4, which means that they are fairly correlated. Since personality provides some clues to identify new users X  preferences, it might be an effective approach to alleviate cold start of recommendation system. Further works could be conducted to improve the correlations between predicted personality and self-reported personality. As predicted personality becomes more and more accurate, it could be used for personalized recommen-dation systems.

Some correlations between text features and personality dimensions are intuitively sensible. For instance, people us-ing second person pronouns  X  X ou X (  X  X i X  and  X  X imen X  in Chi-nese for single and plural) more often are more extraverted, and the more internet popular new words confers higher openness to experience. People with high scores in Neuroti-cism generated more words about religion and art. Other correlations between features and personality have not been interpreted yet. Exclamation mark usage is highly posi-tively related to conscientiousness and more count of num-bers usage and agreeableness are significantly negative re-lated, which leaves an open space for future researches to confirm and explain.
Experimental results demonstrate that Big Five personal-ity traits can be predicted from the users X  Sina micro blog status. Personality was proved to be related with personal preferences in music tastes and graphic user interfaces [11] [14] [18]. Recommendation systems accuracy could probably be im-proved by taking users X  personality traits into consideration. This work might provide a promising future to improve user profile with predicted personality traits, which could poten-tially improve the performances of existing recommendation systems.

On the other hand, while using LIWC2007 to process Chi-nese content, we found that it might not process Chinese p roperly. We are developing a prototype system TextMind that is optimum for Simplified Chinese analysis. TextMind might could provide an all-in-one solution on Simplified Chi-nese processing for researchers in the future.
