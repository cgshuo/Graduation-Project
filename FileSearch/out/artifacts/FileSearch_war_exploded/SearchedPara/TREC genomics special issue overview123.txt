 William Hersh  X  Ellen Voorhees Recent advances in biotechnology have changed the fundamental nature of biological research. Whereas scientists used to be able to manage their modest amount of experi-mental data in paper notebooks or simple spreadsheets, new tools such as gene chips for measuring gene expression (Mobasheri et al. 2004 ) or sequence variation (Pennisi 2007 ) have fundamentally altered their work. Not only do these gene chips generate massive amounts of data (as much as tens of thousands of data points per biological sample), they uncover potential associations and interactions with a wide variety of genes, diseases, and other biological entities. The field devoted to managing, utilizing, and evaluating this data is called bioinformatics (Baxevanis and Ouellette 2005 ), which is sometimes described as the intersection of biology (or biomedicine) and computer science.

The growth of biological data has resulted in a correspondingly large increase in sci-entific knowledge in what biologists sometimes call the bibliome or literature of biology. This requires new approaches to dealing with the biomedical literature, which is the main point of intersection between this field and that of information retrieval (IR) and related disciplines such as text mining.

In the early part of this decade, it became apparent that this situation was ripe for a track at the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC, www.trec.nist.gov ), a challenge evaluation for IR organized by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, http://www.nist.gov/ ) (Voorhees and Harman 2005 ). Started in 1992, TREC has provided a series of challenge evaluations and a forum for presentation of their results. TREC is organized as an annual event at which the tasks are specified and queries and documents are provided to participants. While TREC has historically focused most of its research on textual documents, the field has expanded in recent years with the growth of new infor-mation needs (e.g., question-answering, cross-lingual), data types (e.g., sequence data, video) and platforms (e.g., the Web) (Hersh 2003 ). This special issue is devoted to the TREC Genomics Track, which ran from 2003 to 2007.

The TREC Genomics Track coincides with an increasing amount of biological infor-mation resources becoming available in recent years (Galperin 2008 ). Probably the most important of these are from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) that maintains most of the NLM X  X  genomics-related databases (Wheeler et al. 2008 ). As IR has historically focused on text-based data, the NCBI resources of most interest to the IR community include MEDLINE (the bibliographic database of medical literature, accessed by PubMed and other systems) and textbooks such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). However, recog-nizing that literature is often a starting point for data exploration, there is also great interest in resources such as Entrez Gene (Maglott et al. 2007 ), which serves as a switchboard to integrate gene information as well as provide annotation of its function using the widely accepted GeneOntology (GO) (Anonymous 2008 ). PubMed also provides linkages to full-text journal articles on the Web sites of publishers. Additional genomics resources exist beyond the NCBI, such as the model organism genome databases (Bahls et al. 2003 ). As with the NCBI resources, these resources provide rich linkage and annotation.

Both the IR and bioinformatics communities have long histories of forums for evalu-ation of methods. The latter has the well-known Critical Assessment of Methods of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) initiative for protein structure prediction (Moult et al. 2003 ; Venclovas et al. 2003 ). More recently, challenge evaluations have been initiated for researchers interested in information extraction (IE) (Hirschman et al. 2002 ), including the Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD) Cup (Yeh et al. 2003 ) and the BioCreative initiative (Hirschman et al. 2005 ).

With the exception of the Genomics Track, TREC has not focused on biomedical content. The TREC Genomics Track ( http://ir.ohsu.edu/genomics/ ) was one of the largest and longest running challenge evaluations in biomedicine. The tasks of each year are listed in Table 1 and described in more detail in this paper. Instructions for obtaining the test collections for research use are available on the track X  X  Web site. The remainder of this paper will describe the details of the specific tasks of the TREC Genomics Track as well as the papers that were accepted for inclusion in this special issue. 1 Ad hoc retrieval tasks A major focus early in the TREC Genomics Track was on ad hoc retrieval. In 2003, before funding for substantial relevance judgments was available, a 1-year subset of MEDLINE was obtained and topics for the test collection were gene names. Documents were des-ignated as relevant if a Gene Reference into Function (GeneRIF) (Mitchell et al. 2003 ) was available for the article (Hersh and Bhupatiraju 2003 ). GeneRIFs are a textual annotation about the function of the gene that is maintained by NCBI along with MEDLINE and other databases. This clearly underestimated the number of relevant documents, since at the time there was a modest number of GeneRIFs annotated, probably not allowing true reflection of system performance. But it did allow researchers to start working with biologically oriented documents and topics.

When funding became available in 2004, the ad hoc retrieval task was expanded, allowing a larger test collection with true relevance judgments to be developed. This task modeled the situation of a genomics researcher entering a new area and having an infor-mation need in that area using an IR system to access the biomedical scientific literature. The document collection was based on a ten-year subset of MEDLINE. The rationale for using MEDLINE was that despite being in an era of readily available full-text journals (usually requiring a subscription), many users still entered the biomedical literature through searching MEDLINE. As such, there were still strong motivations to improve the effectiveness of searching MEDLINE. The ad hoc retrieval task ran in the TREC 2004 (Hersh et al. 2004 , 2006 a) and TREC 2005 (Hersh et al. 2005 ) Genomics Tracks.
The MEDLINE subset consisted of 10 years of completed citations from the database inclusive from 1994 to 2003. Records were extracted using the Date Completed (DCOM) field for all references in the range of 19940101 X 20031231. This provided a total of 4,591,008 records, which was about one-third of the full MEDLINE database. The data included all of the PubMed fields identified in the MEDLINE Baseline record. The subset was provided in the  X  X  X EDLINE X  X  format, consisting of ASCII text with fields indicated and delimited by two to four character abbreviations. The size of the file uncompressed was about 9.5 GB. In this subset, there were 1,209,243 (26.3%) records without abstracts.
Topics for the ad hoc retrieval task were based on information needs collected from real biologists. In the 2004 track, simple information needs were collected and formatted into 50 topics with the following fields:  X  ID X  X dentifier  X  Title X  X bbreviated statement of information need  X  Information need X  X ull statement information need  X  Context X  X ackground information to place information need in context In the 2005 track, instead of soliciting free-form biomedical questions, a set of five generic topic templates (GTTs) derived from an analysis of the topics from the 2004 track and other known biologist information needs were developed (see Table 2 ). These GTTs consisted of semantic types, such as genes or diseases, placed in the context of commonly queried biomedical questions. After development of the GTTs, biologists were interviewed to obtain specific information needs that conformed to each GTT. The topics did not have to fit precisely into the GTTs, but had to come close, i.e., have all the required semantic types. Ten information needs for each GTT were selected for inclusion in the 2005 track to obtain 50 topics.

Relevance judgments for both years were performed carrying out the usual pooling method of TREC, where the top-ranking results of all official runs submitted by track participants were pooled. The relevance judges in general were individuals who had backgrounds in either biology or medicine. The relevance assessors judged each document for the specific topic as definitely relevant (DR), possibly relevant (PR), or not relevant (NR). For the official results, which required binary relevance judgments, documents that were rated DR or PR were considered relevant. In the 2005 track, articles had to describe a specific gene, disease, impact, mutation, etc. and not just the concept in general. In addition, relevance judges were given more explicit instructions relative to the GTTs:  X  Relevant article must describe how to conduct, adjust, or improve a standard, a, new  X  Relevant article must describe some specific role of the gene in the stated disease or  X  Relevant article must describe a specific interaction (e.g., promote, suppress, inhibit,  X  Relevant article must describe a mutation of the stated gene and the particular For both the 2004 and 2005 tracks, the primary measure of performance was mean average precision (MAP) (Buckley and Voorhees 2005 ). Research groups were also required to classify their runs into one of three categories:  X  Automatic X  X o manual intervention in building queries  X  Manual X  X anual construction of queries but no further human interaction  X  Interactive X  X ompletely interactive construction of queries and further interaction with In the 2004 track, the best results were obtained by a combination of Okapi weighting (BM25 for term frequency but with standard inverse document frequency), Porter stem-ming, expansion of symbols by LocusLink and MeSH records, query expansion, and use of all three fields of the topic (title, need, and context) (Fujita 2004 ). These achieved a MAP of 0.4075. When the language modeling technique of Dirichlet-Prior smoothing was added, an even higher MAP of 0.4264 was obtained. Another group achieved high-ranking results with a combination of approaches that included Okapi weighting, query expansion, and various forms of domain-specific query expansion (including expansion of lexical variants as well as acronym, gene, and protein name synonyms) (Buttcher et al. 2004 ). Approaches that attempted to map to controlled vocabulary terms did not fare as well (Aronson et al. 2004 ; Nakov et al. 2004 ; Seki et al. 2004 ). As always in TREC, many groups tried a variety of approaches, beneficial or otherwise, but usually without comparing common baseline or running exhaustive experiments, making it difficult to discern exactly what techniques provided benefit and which techniques could be productively combined or were essentially equivalent.
 Somewhat similar results were obtained in the 2005 track. As with 2004, the basic Okapi with good parameters gave good baseline performance for a number of groups. Manual synonym expansion of queries gave the highest MAP of 0.302 (Huang et al. 2005 ), although automated query expansion did not fare as well (Ando et al. 2005 ; Aronson et al. 2005 ). Relevance feedback was found to be beneficial, but worked best without term expansion (Zheng et al. 2005 ).

Follow-up research with the TREC Genomics Track ad hoc retrieval test collections has yielded a variety of findings. One study assessed word tokenization, stemming, and stop mance impact while changes in the latter two had minimal impact. Tokenization of genomics text can be challenging due to the use of a wide variety of symbols, including numbers, hyphens, super-and sub-scripts, and characters in non-English languages (e.g., Greek) (Jiang and Zhai 2007 ). Another study found value for language modeling approaches to term weighting. Other studies have assessed improving the related-articles feature of PubMed (Lin and Wilbur 2007 ) and categorizing articles containing data for inclusion in comparative effectiveness reviews of drug efficacy (Cohen et al. 2006 ). 2 Summarization tasks Another task run in 2003 was a summarization task, where researchers where challenged with nominating the annotation text of the GeneRIF (Hersh and Bhupatiraju 2003 ). This was akin to text summarization, where systems had to nominate an excerpt of text that summarized what was in the document, which in this case was the full text of 139 doc-uments for which GeneRIFs were available. Performance was measured between overlap with the nominated text and the GeneRIF annotation using the Dice coefficient. The best-performing systems were found to use the text of the title of the article, achieve Dice coefficient scores approaching 60%. 3 Text categorization tasks A second task in 2004 and 2005 was a biomedical text categorization task. The mail goal of the task was to  X  X  X riage X  X  articles as requiring further analysis for human annotators in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) system ( http://www.informatics.jax.org/ ). Systems were required to classify full-text documents from a 2-year span (2002 X 2003) of three journals, with the first year X  X  (2002) documents comprising the training data and the second year X  X  (2003) documents making up the test data.

One of the goals of MGI is to provide structured, coded annotation of gene function from the biological literature. Human curators identify genes and assign Gene Ontology (GO) and other codes about gene function with another code describing the type of experimental evidence supporting assignment of the code. The huge amount of literature requiring curation creates a challenge for MGI, as their human resources are not unlimited. As such, they employ a three-step process to identify the papers most likely to describe gene function: 1. About mouse X  X he first step is to identify articles about mouse genomics biology. The 2. Triage X  X he second step is to determine whether the identified articles should be sent 3. Annotation X  X he third step is the actual curation with GO and other terms. In the case The TREC Genomics text categorization tasks focused on triage of articles since this function was believed by MGI to have the most value in automating. In addition, challenge evaluations such as Biocreative (described above) were already investigating annotation. The triage task required a system to decide whether an article should be sent to a curator for annotation. Performance was assessed by the utility measure from the TREC Filtering Track ( http://trec.nist.gov/data/filtering.html ), with the parameters u r and u nr tuned for each specific triage subtask. In TREC 2004, the triage task was to assign articles for GO annotation, whereas in 2005, the task was expanded to include triage for inclusion in databases about tumor biology (Krupke et al. 2005 ), embryologic gene expression (Hill et al. 2004 ), and alleles of mutant phenotypes (Strivens and Eppig 2004 ).

The documents for the categorization task consisted of articles from three journals over 2 years published by Highwire Press ( http://www.highwire.org/ ). The journals available and used by the task were Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC), Journal of Cell Biology (JCB), and Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS). Each of the papers from these journals was provided in SGML format based on Highwire X  X  Document Type Definition (DTD). Articles from the year 2002 were assigned as training data and articles from 2003 were assigned as test data.

The results from different groups are summarized in Table 3 and papers describing the task (Hersh et al. 2005 ; Cohen and Hersh 2006 ). These groups used a variety of NLP and machine learning tasks, with a wide range of results. One notable finding across all groups was the GO triage subtask was substantially more difficult than the tumor biology, embryologic gene expression, or alleles of mutant phenotypes subtasks. Over the two years that this task was repeated, very little could be done to improve triage of articles for GO annotation beyond the presence of the MeSH term Mice. However, performance on the other three subtasks was generally very good. Some additional work has used a subset of the TREC Categorization data to assess the detection of figures and their types for use as features (Shatkay et al. 2006 ). 4 Question X  X nswering tasks In the latter 2 years of the track, the focus shifted to question X  X nswering in the biomedical domain. In 2006 and 2007, the track implemented a task that covered entity-based question answering (Hersh et al. 2006 b, 2007 ). The rationale for the task was that information seekers, especially users of the biomedical literature, frequently desire something between strictly defined IR and IE, i.e., a system that provides short, specific answers to questions and that puts the answers in context by providing supporting information and linking to original sources. As such, the track developed a new task that focused on retrieval of short passages (from phrase to sentence to paragraph in length) that specifically addressed an information need, along with linkage to the location in the original source document.
Topics were expressed as questions and systems were measured on how well they retrieved relevant information at the passage, aspect, and document levels. Systems were required to return passages linked to source documents, while relevance judges not only rated the passages, but also grouped them by aspect. For this task, aspect was defined similar to its definition in the TREC Interactive Track aspectual recall task (Hersh 2001 ), representing answers that covered a similar portion of a full answer to the topic question. The track also drew upon experience in passage retrieval from the previous TREC High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) Track (Allan 2003 , 2004 ).

The documents for this task came from a new full-text biomedical corpus, as track members had also advocated a move from bibliographic (MEDLINE) to full-text docu-ments (journal articles). Permission was obtained from a number of publishers who used Highwire Press ( http://www.highwire.org/ ) for electronic distribution of their journals. Those publishers agreed to allow use of their full text in HTML format, which preserved formatting, structure, table and figure legends, etc. The document collection was derived from 49 journals and contained 162,259 documents, which was about 12.3 GB in size when uncompressed. In addition to the full-text data, the NLM provided MEDLINE records for the full-text documents in the collection.

Some additional files were made available:  X  Another file, legalspans.txt, contained all  X  X  X egal spans X  X  for all documents in the Retrieved passages could contain any span of text that did not include any part of an HTML paragraph tag (i.e., one starting with \ Por \ /P). Because there was some confusion about the different types of passages, the following terms were defined:  X  Nominated passages X  X hese were the passages that systems nominated in their runs  X  Maximum-length legal spans X  X hese were all the passages obtained by delimiting the  X  Relevant passages X  X hese were the spans that the judges designated as definitely or (Hersh et al. 2006 b). They were derived from the set of biologically relevant questions based on the GTTs developed for the 2005 track (Hersh et al. 2005 ). The questions (and GTTs) all had the general format of containing one or more biological objects and pro-cesses and some explicit relationship between them. The biological objects might be genes, proteins, gene mutations, etc. The biological process could be physiological processes or diseases. The relationships could be anything, but were typically verbs such as causes , contributes to, affects, associated with ,or regulates .

The relevance assessments were done by the usual TREC method of pooling the top-ranking passages from different groups that submitted official runs. For each topic, a pool of passages was created that consisted of maximum-length spans from those passages there were retrieved. The relevance judges were experts (usually having a PhD in biology or a related life science) who were provided with guidelines and a training session to improve the judging process. To assess relevance, judges were instructed to break down the question into required elements (e.g., the biological entities and processes that make up the GTT) and isolate the minimum contiguous substring that answered the question. In gen-eral, a passage was definitely relevant if it contained all required elements of the question and it answered the question. A passage was possibly relevant if it contained the majority of required elements, missing elements were within the realm of possibility (i.e. more general terms are mentioned that probably include the missing elements), and it possibly answered the question.

After determining the  X  X  X est X  X  answer passages, judges were instructed to group them into related concepts and then assign one or more Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms (possibly with subheadings) to capture similarities and differences among retrieved passage aspects. They were told to use the most specific MeSH term, with the option of adding subheadings, similar to the NLM literature indexing process. If one term was insufficient to denote all aspects of the gold standard passage, judges assigned additional MeSH terms. All passages judged as definitely or possibly relevant were required to have a gold standard passage and at least one MeSH term. For all the topics, the mean number of relevant passages was 35 (range 3 X 593), with a mean relevant passage length of 400 characters (range 27 X  6928). There were an average of 22 distinct relevant aspects per topic (range 7 X 96).
For this entity-based, question-answering task, there were three levels of retrieval performance measured: passage retrieval, aspect retrieval, and document retrieval. Each of these provided insight into the overall performance for a user trying to answer the given topic questions. Each was measured by some variant of MAP.  X  Passage-level MAP X  X his measure used a variation of MAP, computing individual  X  Aspect-level MAP X  X spect retrieval was measured using the average precision for the  X  Document-level MAP X  X or the purposes of this measure, any PMID that had a passage As shown in Table 4 , document MAP scores were highest, followed by aspect, and then passage, although these scores were not directly comparable since they measured precision at recall of different things. There was a general, though far from perfect, correlation between the measures across all submissions. It was clear from the results and techniques of the top-performing groups in passage retrieval that certain approaches were quite effective. In particular,  X  X  X rimming X  X  passages to shorten them was done in all the runs with the highest passage MAP. Indeed, because non-content manipulations of passages had substantial effects on passage MAP, an alternative passage MAP (PASSAGE2) that cal-culated MAP as if each character in each passage were a ranked document was developed for additional analysis and used in the TREC 2007 Genomics Track.

A further analysis showed that four system factors were associated with the best per-formance in passage MAP (Rekapalli et al. 2007 ):  X  Normalization of keywords in the query into root forms  X  Non-use of the Entrez Gene thesaurus for synonym terms expansion  X  Unit of text retrieved using respective IR algorithms at sentence level  X  Passage  X  X  X rimming X  X  to best sentence The TREC 2007 Genomics Track continued with the same task and document collection, but some modifications to the topics and relevance judging were made, along with adoption of a new official measure of passage retrieval performance (PASSAGE2) (Hersh et al. 2007 ). There were 36 official topics for the track in 2007, which were in the form of questions asking for lists of specific entities. As in the past, information needs were gathered from working biologists. In addition to asking about information needs, there biologists were asked if their desired answer was a list of a certain type of entity, such as genes, proteins, diseases, mutations, etc., and if so, to designate that entity type. An example topic was: What [GENES] are genetically linked to alcoholism?
Answers to this question were passages that related one or more entities of type GENE to alcoholism. For example, a valid and relevant answer to this topic would be, The DRD4 VNTR polymorphism moderates craving after alcohol consumption (from PMID 11950104). And the GENE entity supported by this statement would be DRD4. Table 5 shows the entities, their definitions, potential sources of terms, and topics with each entity type.
Relevance judging was once again by pooling of top-ranking passages retrieved by participating groups. Judges were required to have significant domain knowledge, typically in the form of a PhD in a life science. They were trained using a 12-page manual and a one-hour videoconference. They were given the following instructions: 1. Review the topic question and identify key concepts. 2. Identify relevant paragraphs and select minimum complete and correct excerpts. 3. Develop a topic-specific controlled vocabulary for entities based on the relevant There were an average of 124.8 relevant passages containing an average of 72.3 aspects from 69.2 relevant documents per topic. The mean relevant passage length was 968, with an average of 1.63 aspects per relevant passage.

As in all other years of the track, there were a variety of approaches used in 2007 that demonstrated varying levels of benefit. In the track overview paper, we tried to cluster runs by the features they employed and then compare results with the different measures. In the 2007 track, we found clusters of approaches that included query expansion, use of language models, and varying units of initial passage retrieval. The results made it clear that the explicit methods used within each of these was more important than the general approach. Two approaches found to achieve benefit in many but not all instances were query expansion with synonyms and retrieval based on paragraph-sized or larger units (Hersh et al. 2007 ).
Another recurring aspect of interpreting results in the 2007 track was the difficulty in interpreting results over all groups due to inadequate reporting in proceedings papers, use of variable baselines for comparison, and insufficiently exhaustive experimentation. These hensive experimentation. 5 Special issue papers Nine papers were submitted for review for this issue, of which four were accepted. Three of these papers explore aspects of query expansion while the fourth looks at factors related to the quality of the relevance judging process. The focus on query expansion is appro-priate, given that this method was among the most prominent in improving retrieval performance over the years but also had substantial variation in what particular approaches did and did not work well. Some of these papers also address other areas shown to be effective but variable, such as passage retrieval size.

The paper by Stokes et al. focuses on successful factors for query expansion using the 2006 track documents and topics (Stokes et al. 2008 ). Through a combination of approaches, they are able to advance passage MAP by 185% over the basic Okapi retrieval system. Through exhaustive experimentation, they find several factors most highly asso-ciated with success. One of these is the re-ranking of concepts that give the most weight to occurrence or not as opposed to the frequency of occurrence. It is also found that nor-malization of expansion terms is important. They also find the most benefit of term expansion comes from formal instead of ad hoc (e.g., co-occurrence or hierarchy based) terminologies and in particular from gene (as opposed to general biomedical term or abbreviation) synonyms.

Lu et al. focus on gene synonym expansion only, omitting experimentation on other aspects of retrieval, such as tokenization or stemming (Lu et al. 2008 a). They find with gene-only topics (i.e., the 2003 collection), query name expansion helps substantially. With the more verbose queries of the other years X  data (2004 X 2007), normalizing to gene names is crucial [similar to Stokes et al. ( 2008 )] and performance can be improved with a variety of language model approaches.

Lu et al. also focus on gene synonym expansion, omitting topics that do not allow such expansion (Lu et al. 2008 b). Using documents and topics from the 2006 and 2007 tracks, they find modest improvement with expansion based on the automated term mapping process in the operational PubMed system. However, of practical concern, they note that the benefit yields minimal improvements in the portion of output users would be likely to view, i.e., the top 20 X 30 documents of the search. Another interesting finding in this study warranting further research is the better MAP obtained by ranking using classic term weighting schemes over the reverse chronological sorting used as a default by PubMed.
The final paper in this issue looks at the relevance judging process, which was led from 2005 X 2007 by the paper X  X  first author (Roberts et al. 2008 ). There are many lessons learned, as this paper shows, in that the process works best when judges are given explicit training and instructions and have domain expertise. One unfortunate consequence noted by the authors was the changing of the task each year, which did not enable them to assess the benefits of specific improvements in the process. 6 Conclusions The TREC Genomics Track for the most part achieved what it set out to accomplish, which was to provide test collections for experimentation in IR in the genomics domain. The different collections, based on varying tasks, showed that some approaches appeared to benefit retrieval and related tasks specifically in this domain. As with all TREC activity, the short cycle of experimentation and reporting of results has prevented more detailed investigation of different approaches. However, there emerged some evidence that some resources from the genomics/bioinformatics could contribute to improving retrieval, especially controlled lists of terminology used in query expansion, although their improvement over standard state-of-the-art IR was not substantial.

The existence and continued availability of the collections will hopefully encourage researchers to delve into other aspects of IR in the genomics and larger biomedical domain. There are still many avenues of experimentation that may yield improvements in retrieval performance, which in turn will potentially improve scientific discovery in genomics and provide benefits to larger human health. The TREC Genomics Track web site will be maintained, including instructions for accessing the data collections for research purposes. References
