 The Social Web has been enjoying huge popularity in re-cent years, attracting millions of visitors on sites such as Facebook, Delicious or YouTube. Today, we are no longer mere consumers of information, but we also actively partic-ipate in social networks, upload our personal photos, share our bookmarks, write web logs and annotate and comment on the information provided by others. Following the expo-nential growth in the popularity of Social Web sites, many traditional, non-social sites, are now implementing social features. Likewise many enterprises are deploying internal social media sites to support expertise location and shar-ing of work-related information and knowledge. The Social Web therefore provides huge opportunities for recommender technology and in turn recommender technologies can play a part in fuelling the success of the Social Web phenomenon. (1) New application areas for recommender systems emerge with the popularity of the Social Web. Recommenders can not only be used to sort and filter Web 2.0 and social network information, they can also support users in the information sharing process, e.g., by recommending suitable tags during folksonomy development. (2) Social systems by their definition encourage interaction between users and both online content and other users, thus generating new sources of knowledge for recommender sys-tems. Web 2.0 users explicitly provide personal information and implicitly express preferences through their interactions with others and the system (e.g. commenting, friending, rat-ing, etc.). These various new sources of knowledge can be leveraged to improve recommendation techniques and de-velop new strategies which focus on social recommendation. This social layer can also be used as evidence on which to infer relationships and trust levels between users for recom-mendation generation. (3) The Social Web also presents new challenges for recom-mender systems, such as the complicated nature of human-to-human interaction which comes into play when recom-mending people. Or, the design and development of more interactive and richer recommender system user interfaces that enable users to express their opinions and preferences in an intuitive and effortless manner.
