 properties, and compare it to other published protocols.

Privacy, distributed data mining, security, scalar product . In the field of privacy preserving data mining, such as association present a new method to perform secure two-party computation of scalar product with a permutation approach. two parties A and B. Assume A has n transactions and product of X min_sup is the required minimum support of an association rule. result of vector X the n elements of vector Y than the ones on the main diagonal line are 0. 
M and N have 2 n randoms in real domain. Let 1  X  M and matrix. As ENNMM ==  X  X  X  11 , there exist relationships matrix which all the elements on the main diagonal are 1. Vectors n YY  X  is the element in matrix 1  X  N . the same vector X  X  the permutation of n Y X Y X permutation of n Y Y 1 . B arranges the n elements of ( n random permutation  X  to ( n Y Y  X   X  1 ) and matrix computes B. 1 correspond to n send them to A in permutation  X  .  X  and sends it to B. n randoms n  X   X  L 1 . It is impossible to solve n equations in 2n unknowns. Only if n values are disclosed at both sides all the data will be revealed. governed by function  X  and matrixes 1  X  M , N , 1  X  N random permutation with  X  is to avoid party A to solve construct the equations. there are n values needed to communicate respectively. In step 4, communication cost is and 1  X  N , and performs performs n scalar product. In step 4, A performs n additions and multiplications. Overall, the protocol requires computation cost is low. As all the computations except the permutation process are simple computation and communication. [1] Jaideep Vaidya and Chris Clifton, Privacy preserving [2] J. Vaidya and C.
