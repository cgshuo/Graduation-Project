 I. C. Mogotsi Information retrieval (IR) is not a very easy term to define. Writing a book on the subject, Lancaster ( 1968 ), with a footnote acknowledging van Rijsbergen ( 1979 ) X  X ongue in cheek X  X ut it this way:  X  X  X nformation retrieval is the term conventionally, though some-what inaccurately, applied to the type of activity discussed in this volume X  X . Usefully, Manning, Raghavan, and Schu  X  tze ( 2008 ) define it as  X  X  ... finding material (usually docu-ments) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections (usually stored on computers) X  X . Thus,  X  X  X n information retrieval system does not inform (i.e. change the knowledge of) the user on the subject of his inquiry. It merely informs on the existence (or non-existence) and whereabouts of docu-ments relating to his request X  X  (Lancaster 1968 ). In an age where  X  X  X nformation explosion X  X  and  X  X  X nformation overload X  X  have become cliche  X  s, the importance of IR as an area of academic activity cannot be overemphasized, and the book by Manning, Raghavan, and Schu  X  tze could not have been more timely.

The book is divided into 21 chapters the first nine of which focus on the foundational topics of IR. After defining IR, the first chapter discusses Boolean retrieval which was for many years the dominant approach to IR, and is still widely used today. The chapter also introduces key IR terms, such as  X  X  X elevance X  X ,  X  X  X recision X  X , and  X  X  X ecall X  X , and discusses the creation of inverted indexes. The chapter concludes by contrasting the extended Boolean model with ranked retrieval, such as that supported by approaches based on the vector space model. Chapter 2 considers the topic of index term selection, and the issues that have to be dealt with, such as tokenization, stop word removal, case folding and lemmatization. The chapter also revisits the subject of postings lists, first covered in chapter 1, and examines a postings list structured geared for fast retrieval. Chapter 3 discusses tolerant retrieval which, as our authors point out, is concerned with the use of  X  X  X echniques that are robust to typographical errors in the query X  X  (p. 45). In particular, the chapter considers the use of dictionaries and spell checkers in IR. Chapter 4 is devoted to index construction, and discusses various algorithms that can be employed to construct an index. Chapter 5 presents a number of techniques for compressing an index, thereby reducing disk space requirements and also speeding up the retrieval process.

Chapter 6 departs from Boolean queries X  X n which a document either satisfies or does not satisfy the query X  X nd introduces ranked retrieval, discussing parametric indexes (which allow searching by metadata elements such as date of publication), term weighting (which seeks to capture the intuition that some words are more representative of a docu-ment than others), and the ever popular vector space model of IR. Chapter 7 continues the discussion on ranked retrieval by considering some heuristics for term weighting. The chapter also gives as useful even if rather short overview of a complete search engine. Chapter 8 considers at length the all important question of evaluation. As the authors point out, when designing an IR system, one is invariably faced with wide array of alternatives at each step of the project: how, then, does one decide which alternatives to accept and which to reject? Evaluation, preferably using standard test collections, seeks to answer questions such as these. An important idea that our authors introduce is that of  X  X  X ser utility X  X  whose key indicator is user happiness. Users are likely to be happy if the IR system is fast, and returns relevant documents preferably ranked in some way: all these concerns are addressed in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 discusses relevance feedback and query expansion. As the authors point out, the basic idea behind relevance feedback is to involve the user in the retrieval process so as to improve the final result set. The chapter covers the Rocchio algorithm, probabilistic relevance feedback and query expansion through the use of, for example, thesauri.

Particularly with the explosion of the World Wide Web, the ability to handle semi-structured data has become crucial not just in data management in general, but also in IR in particular. As Connolly and Begg ( 2005 ), explain, semi-structured data is self-describing i.e. the information associated with a schema is contained within the data itself; this is in stark contrast to data management in relational systems where all data with the database must conform to a table-oriented schema defined a priori . In their book, Manning et al . focus on eXtensible Markup Language (XML) because it is the most widely used standard for encoding structured documents, but, as they also point out, most of what they say about XML also applies to other types of markup, such as HTML and SGML. After a quick overview XML basics, the book discusses some interesting challenges unique to XML retrieval X  X uch as schema diversity e.g. documents coming from different sources, a consequence of which may be different names for essentially similar elements. The chapter also discusses the application of the vector space model to XML retrieval, and considers evaluation within the context of XML retrieval.

Chapters 11 and 12 discuss, respectively, probabilistic information retrieval and lan-guage models for IR. After providing a brief but useful review of the relevant probability theory, Chapter 11 discusses the probability ranking principle and the binary independence model, as well as some extensions to the latter. Chapter 12 introduces the notion of a language model, discusses the query likelihood model, contrasts the language modelling approach with other approaches in IR, and also looks at extended language modelling approaches.

Chapters 13 through 15 discuss machine learning applications in IR specifically focusing on the classification problem. After informally motivating and formally intro-ducing the text classicisation problem, chapter 13 discusses Na X   X  ve Bayes classification in some detail. Chapter 14, on vector space classification, discusses the Rocchio and k nearest neighbour (KNN) classification algorithms. Support vector machines are the subject of chapter 15. In all three chapters, the treatment of the subject matter is sufficient for a mathematically inclined reader to develop a deep appreciation of the topics covered.
Chapters 16, 17, and 18 are devoted to document clustering. Clustering is perhaps the key question in IR: given a query X  X hich can itself be considered a document (Korfhage 1997 ) X  X he system should return a listing of other documents similar to the query i.e. a cluster to which the specified query may be shown to belong. Furthermore, according to the cluster hypothesis,  X  X  X losely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same query X  X  (Van Rijsbergen 1979 , p. 30). After motivating the importance of clustering by way of a number of interesting applications, Chapter 16 discusses flat clustering X  X s exemplified by both the k-means clustering algorithm, and model-based clustering i.e. the EM algorithm. Chapter 17 focuses on hierarchical clustering, and covers such topics as single-link and complete-link clustering, centroid clustering, and the optimality of hierarchical agglom-erative clustering.

The clustering approaches discussed in chapters 16 and 17 are so-called hard clustering approaches in which a document belongs to one X  X nd only one X  X luster. Chapter 18 discusses latent semantic indexing which  X  X  X an be viewed as soft clustering by interpreting each dimension of the reduced space as a cluster and the value that a document has on that dimension as its fractional membership in that cluster X  X  (pp. 382). Usefully, the chapter begins by reviewing the necessary mathematics X  X inear algebra X  X efore turning to latent semantic indexing itself.

The last three chapters of the book are  X  X  X ebby X  X . Chapter 19 introduces the basics of web searching. Topics covered include the graph-theoretic structure of the web, spam, index size estimation, and thorny issue of duplicate web pages (e.g. as a result of mir-roring). Chapter 20 discusses web crawling which undertakes the important task of locating, on the web, the documents to be indexed. Link analysis, discussed in chapter 21, is an important aspect of  X  X  X raditional X  X  data mining where it is used to  X  X  X stablish links ... between the individual records, or sets of records, in a database X  X  (Connolly and Begg 2005 , p. 1237). However, in the context of Information Retrieval, link analysis focuses on  X  X  X he analysis of hyperlinks and graph structure of the web X  X  with the intention of facili-tating web search. In particular, chapter 21 provides quite a comprehensive introduction to Google X  X  PageRank algorithm. As well as helping the reader develop a solid appreciation of the internals of what is arguably the world X  X  best known search engine, the chapter may also be used as a stepping stone into the emerging field of webometrics.
 Verdict The book provides a solid introduction to IR systems, and should prove essential to students, practitioners, and researchers within the field. A word of warning, though: the word  X  X  X ntroduction X  X  in the title might be misleading. The book is fairly advanced, and requires quite a solid foundation in the areas of data structures and algorithms, linear algebra, and probability theory. For graduate (and advanced undergraduate) students of Computer Science and allied disciplines, this should not be a major obstacle; for others, substantial preparatory reading will be required. For those seeking to go further in IR, the book is a veritable source of references in the field. For those seeking a hands-on approach to learning IR X  X nd perhaps to implement IR systems X  X he book is a rich source of algorithms. IR teachers and students would do well to give this book serious consideration. Indeed, for anybody serious about IR, this book is a must-have. References
