 This paper presents: (1) a new formulation of image segmenta tion as the maximum-weight indepen-dent set (MWIS) problem; and (2) a new algorithm for solving M WIS.
 Image segmentation is a fundamental problem, and an area of a ctive research in computer vision and machine learning. It seeks to group image pixels into vis ually  X  X eaningful X  segments, i.e., abounds with diverse formulations. For example, normalize d-cut [1], and dominant set [2] formu-late segmentation as a combinatorial optimization problem on a graph representing image pixels.  X  X eaningful X  segments may give rise to modes of the pixels X  p robability distribution [3], or min-imize the Mumford-Shah energy [4]. Segmentation can also be done by: (i) integrating edge and From prior work, we draw the following two hypotheses. First , surfaces of real-world objects are typically made of a unique material, and thus their correspo nding segments in the image are char-acterized by unique photometric properties, distinct from those of other regions. To capture this els, regions) which will provide richer visual information for segmentation, rather than start from contain a subset of segments that provides accurate spatial support of object occurrences. Based on these two hypotheses, below, we present a new formulation of image segmentation. Given an ensemble of segments, extracted from the image by a n umber of different low-level seg-tition the image area. Suppose all segments from the ensembl e are represented as nodes of a graph, where node weights capture the distinctiveness of correspo nding segments, and graph edges con-nect nodes whose corresponding segments overlap in the imag e. Then, the selection of maximally maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) formulation.
 The MWIS problem is to find the heaviest subset of mutually non -adjacent nodes of an attributed graph. It is a well-researched combinatorial optimization problem that arises in many applications. It is known to be NP-hard, and hard to approximate [11]. Numer ous heuristic approaches exist. the number of nodes in the graph. The message passing [14] rel axes MWIS into a linear program (LP), and solves it using loopy belief propagation with no gu arantees of convergence for general programming formulation of MWIS [16] provides an upper boun d of the sum of weights of all independent nodes in MWIS. However, this is done by reformul ating MWIS as a large LP of a new dynamics [17, 18] converts the original graph into its compl ement, and solves MWIS as a continuous relaxation of the maximum weight clique (MWC) problem. But i n some domains, including ours, important hard constraints captured by edges of the origina l graph may be lost in this conversion. In this paper, we present a new MWIS algorithm, which represe nts a fixed-point iteration, guaran-teed to converge to an optimum. It goes back and forth between the discrete and continuous domains. It visits a sequence of points { y ( t ) } domain. Each iteration consists of two steps. First, we use t he Taylor expansion to approximate y be shown to be a local maximizer of the original objective for a suitably chosen  X  . The algorithm always improves the objective, finally converging to a maxim um. For non-convex objective func-x Contributions: To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first for mulation of image segmentation as MWIS. We derive a new MWIS algorithm that has low complexity, and prove that it converges to a maximum. Selecting segments from an ensemb le so they cover the entire image and minimize a total energy has been used for supervised obje ct segmentation [19]. They estimate  X  X ood X  segments by using classifiers of a pre-selected numbe r of object classes. In contrast, our image. Our MWIS algorithm has lower complexity, and is argua bly easier to implement than the dual decomposition they use for energy minimization. Our se gmentation outperforms the state of the art on the benchmark Berkeley segmentation dataset, and our MWIS algorithm runs faster and yields on average more accurate solutions on benchmark datasets th an other existing MWIS algorithms. Overview: Our approach consists of the following steps (see Fig.1). Step 1: The image is segmented and gPb-OWT-UCM [7]. Since the right scale at which objects o ccur in the image is unknown, each in the image. A small overlap between two segments, relative to their area, may be ignored, for segment from the others. Step 3: We find the MWIS of this graph. Step 4: The segments selected in marked red in Fig.1). The final segmentation is obtained by us ing standard morphological operators Figure 1: Our main steps: (a) Input segments extracted at mul tiple scales by different segmenta-tion algorithms; (b) Constructing a graph of all segments, a nd finding its MWIS (marked green); (c) Segments selected by our MWIS algorithm (red areas indic ate overlaps and holes); (d) Final segmentation after region-boundary refinement (actual res ult using Meanshift and NCuts as input). the input low-level segmentation is strictly hierarchical , as gPb-OWT-UCM [7]. The same holds if algorithm will continue selecting non-overlapping segmen ts until the entire image is covered. Paper Organization: Sec. 2 formulates MWIS, and presents our MWIS algorithm and i ts theoret-ical analysis. Sec. 3 formulates image segmentation as MWIS , and describes how to construct the segmentation graph. Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 present our experiment al evaluation and conclusions. Consider a graph G = ( V, E,  X  ) , where V and E are the sets of nodes and undirected edges, with cardinalities | V | = n and | E | , and  X  : V  X  R + associates positive weights w means that i is in the subset, and x independent set if no two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge,  X  ( i, j )  X  E : x are interested in finding a maximum-weight independent set ( MWIS), denoted as x  X  . MWIS can be naturally posed as the following integer program (IP): The non-adjacency constraint in (1) can be equivalently for malized as P expression can be written as a quadratic constraint, x T A x =0 , where A =( A matrix, with A the following integer quadratic program (IQP): x  X  = argmax x w in (2) holds. Next, we present our new algorithm for solving M WIS. 2.1 The Algorithm to a continuous QP, e.g., by  X  i  X  V : x domain [17]. Also, when only  X  i  X  V : x message passing [14]. Usually, the solution found in the con tinuous domain is binarized to obtain paper, we present a new MWIS algorithm that iteratively seek s a solution directly in the discrete domain. A discrete solution is computed by maximizing the fir st-order Taylor series approximation to the method of [20], which, however, makes the restrictive assumptions that the matrix of the non-negative elements. These assumptions are not suitable for image segmentation. Graduated assignment [21] also iteratively maximizes a Taylor series expansion of a continuous QP around the guarantees convergence only to a local maximum, as most stat e-of-the-art MWIS algorithms [12, 13, 14, 17, 18]. Below, we describe the main steps of our MWIS algo rithm.
 Let f ( x ) = w T x  X  1 x ,  X  iteration that solves a sequence of integer programs which a re convex approximations of f , around algorithm increases f in every iteration until convergence.
 simpler than f ( y ) , which allows us to easily compute a discrete maximizer of h ( ) as  X  x i = 1 where i is the index of the minimum element of ( w  X   X  A y ( t ) ) .
 a closed-form solution: to represent the final solution of MWIS, x  X  =  X  x . Our MWIS algorithm is summarized in Alg. 1 2.2 Theoretical Analysis This section presents the proof that our MWIS algorithm conv erges to a maximum. We also show y Lemma 1 Suppose that the IQP objective function f is increasing at point y 1  X  [0 , 1] n , and de-y  X  [0 , 1] n , such that f is increasing at y , where  X  is an interpolation parameter,  X   X  [0 , 1] . y is not PSD, we obtain  X   X  c  X  = min(max( c In the following, we define the notion of maximum, and prove th at Alg. 1 converges to a maximum.  X  y  X  X  ( y  X  ) : g ( y  X  )  X  g ( y ) .
 Proposition 1 Alg. 1 increases f in every iteration, and converges to a maximum.
 Thus, f increases in this case. Else, y ( t +1) = y ( t ) +  X  (  X  x  X  y ( t ) ) , yielding Also, from Lemma 1,  X  is non-negative. Consequently, the second term in (6) is non -negative. Re-which we have already proved to be non-negative. Thus, f also increases in this second case. Since f  X  w T 1 , and f increases in every iteration, then f converges to a maximum.
 where each element A node i  X  V depends on the number of positive elements in i th row A of In our experiments, Alg. 1 converges in 5-10 iterations on gr aphs with about 300 nodes. We formulate image segmentation as the MWIS of a graph of imag e regions obtained from different segmentations. Below, we explain how to construct this grap h. Given a set of all segments, V , where V and E are the sets of nodes and undirected edges, and  X  : V  X  R + assigns positive weights w segments S matrix A = ( A  X  , such that A The weights w more likely included in the MWIS of G . Following the compositionality-based approaches of [8, 9 ], 2D patterns; and (ii) homogeneous regions with smooth varia tions of brightness. To define w we use the formalism of [8], where the easiness and difficulty of describing S and the histogram of occurrence of the codewords in S denotes the Kullback Leibler divergence, I is the input image, and  X  S are normalized by max the Laplacian of Gaussian filters. The pixel descriptors are then clustered using K-means (with K = 100 ). All pixels grouped within one cluster are labeled with a un ique codeword id of that cluster. Then, the histogram of their occurrence in every re gion S Given G , as described in this section, we use our MWIS algorithm to se lect  X  X eaningful X  segments, otherwise any uncovered image areas will be immediately fill ed out by available segments in V that In the case when the input segments do not form a strict hierar chy and intersections of the input segments have not been added to V , we eliminate holes (or  X  X oft X  overlaps) between the select ed from the benchmark Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSD) [23 ]. BSD images are challenging for also evaluate the generality and execution time of our MWIS a lgorithm on a synthetic graph from benchmark OR-Library [24], and the problem sets from [12].
 Our MWIS algorithm is evaluated for the following three type s of input segmentations. The first type is a hierarchy of segments produced by the gPb-OWT-UCM m ethod of [7]. gPb-OWT-UCM uses the perceptual significance of a region boundary, P obtain the hierarchy, we vary P union of NCut [1] and Meanshift [3] segments. Ncut uses one in put parameter  X  namely, the total number of regions, N , in the image. Meanshift uses three input parameters: featu re bandwidth b spatial bandwidth b b f = 5 . 5:0 . 5:8 . 5 serve to test whether our approach is capable of extracting  X  meaningful X  regions from a multiscale segmentation. The variant ([3]+[1])+Ours evaluates our hy pothesis that reasoning over an ensemble of distinct segmentations improves each individual one.
 Segmentation of BSD images is used for a comparison with repl icator dynamics approach of [17], which transforms the MWIS problem into the maximum weight cl ique problem, and then relaxes it into a continuous problem, denoted as MWC. In addition, we al so use data from other domains  X  the-art MWIS algorithms.
 Qualitative evaluation: Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the performance of our variant [7]+Ours on ex-ample images from BSD. Fig. 4 also shows the best segmentatio ns of [7] and [25], obtained by an exhaustive search for the optimal values of their input para meters. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the method of [7] misses to segment the grass under the tiger, and oversegments the starfish and the camel, which we correct. Our approach eliminates the need fo r hand-picking the optimal input pa-rameters in [7], and yields results that are good even in case s when objects have complex textures (e.g. tiger and starfish), or when the boundaries are blurred or jagged (e.g. camel). Quantitative evaluation: Table 1 presents segmentations of BSD images using our three variants: Index ( P RI ), and Variation of Information ( V I ) [26]. P RI between estimated and ground-truth segmentations, S and G , is defined as the sum of the number of pairs of pixels that have the same number of pairs of pixels. V I measures the distance between S and G in terms of their average conditional entropy. P RI should be large, and V I small. For all variants of our approach, we optimal value of their input parameter P Algorithm 1 : Our MWIS Algorithm segments generated by Meanshift, Ncuts, and [5], the perfor mances of [5]+Ours and ([3]+[1])+Ours come very close to those of [7]. This is unexpected, because M eanshift, Ncuts, and the method of [5] are known to produce poor performance in terms of P RI and V I values, relative to [7]. Also, note that ([3]+[1])+Ours outperforms the relaxation-base d method ([3]+[1])+MWC.
 300 nodes, obtained from 200 BSD images. As can be seen, for  X   X  2 , the penalty term  X  y T A y converges to 0 with some initial oscillations. Experimenta lly, the convergence rate is maximum when  X  = 2 . We use this value in all our experiments.
 Figure 2: Convergence rate vs. a specific choice of  X  , averaged over 200 BSD images:  X  &lt; 2 is marked red, and  X   X  2 is marked blue.
 MWIS performance: We also test our Alg. 1 on two sets of problems beyond image seg mentation. As input we use a graph constructed from data from the OR-Libr ary [24], and from the problem sets ten instances, called b2500-1 to b2500-10, of size 2500 and w ith density 10%. For the second set of problem (p3000 to p7000), we take into account graphs of si ze 4000, 5000, 6000 and 7000. Five graph instances per size are used. Tab. 2 shows the average di fference between the estimated and ground-truth solution, and computation time in seconds. Th e presented comparison with Iterative Tabu Search (ITS) [12] demonstrates that, on average, we ach ieve better performance, under much smaller running times. Figure 3: Segmentation of BSD images. (top) Original images . (bottom) Results using our variant occur simply because these regions are not present in the inp ut segmentations.

By extracting  X  X ean ingful X  segments from a segmentation hierarchy produced by [7] we correct the best, manually opti mized results of [7]. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formulate image segmentation as MWIS. Our empirical regardless of a particular MWIS algorithm used. We have pres ented a new fixed point algorithm that algorithm converges to a maximum. Our MWIS algorithm seeks a solution directly in the discrete observed that our algorithm runs faster and outperforms the other competing MWIS algorithms on benchmark datasets. Also, we have shown a comparison with th e state-of-the-art segmenter [7] on the benchmark Berkeley segmentation dataset. Our select ion of  X  X eaningful X  regions from a segmentation hierarchy produced by [7] outperforms the man ually optimized best results of [7], in terms of Probabilistic Rand Index and Variation of Informat ion.
