 Recently, information retrieval researchers have witnessed the increasing interest in query substitution for ad search. Most previous works substitute search queries via content based query similarities, and few of them take the temporal characteristics of queries into consideration. In this extended abstract, we propose a novel temporal similarity measurement for query substitution in ad search task. We firstly extract temporal features, such as burst and periodicity, from query frequency curves and then define the temporal query similarity by integrating these new features with the temporal query frequency distribution. Compared to the traditional temporal similarity measurements such as correlation coefficient, our proposed approach is more effective owing to the explicit extraction of high-level semantic query temporal features for similarity measure . The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity measure can make the ads more relevant to user search queries compared to ad search without temporal features. H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval-Information Search and Retrieval; Algorithms Ad Search, Query Substitution, Temporal Similarity. Sponsored search, which is one of the major online advertising channels, is showing its great market potentials. In classical sponsored search, advertisers bid for some specific keywords and have their ads displayed alongside Web search results. One simple strategy of search engine for ads display is to select ads whose bid keyword exactly matches the query. However, the exact match may result in limited performance because many relevant ads may be missed for input queries due to the mismatch between the bid keywords and queries though they are semantically related. To overcome this drawback, many studies propose to generate query substitutions for a given query and display the ads bid the substitutions next to the search results of the query. In general, these works obtain substitutions in terms of lexical similarity and content similarity, but few of them take the temporal factors into account. We observe that temporal distribution of query frequency can help to obtain some latent query semantics which cannot be found out by lexical or content similarity. For instance, query mother X  X  day is surely related with query 1-800-flowers.com because people who issue mother X  X  day are very likely to buy only utilize lexical similarity between two queries such as Cosine similarity of query vectors, or content similarity between them such as cosine similarity between their Web search results. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel temporal similarity measurement between queries and apply it to the ad search, i.e. sponsored search. The traditional temporal similarity such as correlation coefficient is computed directly over the whole period of search engine query log, thus may miss some temporal characteristics of queries. For instance, the temporal distribution of query mother X  X  day is locally similar with query 1-800-flowers.com in May since both of them have bursts in this time period. Thus, we propose to compute temporal similarity by integrating features which can capture this kind of local or periodical information. In this paper, we name it as the Micro-Similarity, or Mi-Sim in short. To calculate Mi-Sim, we introduce the conception of important periods in advance. Let the temporal distribution of query q be sequence of daily frequencies of query q in search engine query query time series. On the basis of temporal data, we try to obtain the proposed important periods. Important periods of query q is denoted by  X   X   X   X  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  , ... ,  X   X   X   X  , where subsequence of sequence  X  1,2,... ,  X   X  and  X   X   X   X   X   X  ). Then we can formulate the Mi-Sim between query as  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X   X  Mi-Sim. Finally, we combine Mi-Sim and the traditional similarity (in this paper we call it Macro-Similarity, Ma-Sim in short) to obtain the so called MM-Similarity (MM-Sim in short). We introduce how to acquire the important periods firstly. By intuition, the burst periods or periods near the wave crests (If have periodicities) of query temporal distribution could constitute the important periods . Thus, we need to identify burst and periodicity in temporal query. We adopt a simple but effective method to identify burst in temporal distribution. For a query temporal distribution 1,2,... ,  X   X  , the mean of  X   X  is computed by  X  X  X   X  standard derivation of  X   X  is estimated by ...  X   X   X   X  For a given  X   X  , we treat it as a burst when  X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X ... is a parameter, and define the corresponding number important time point . We utilize  X   X  to denote the set of important time points obtained through burst identification. To identify the periodicities of temporal distribut ion, we utilize the method proposed by Vlachos et al. in [3]. We fi rstly calculate the frequency power spectrum  X   X  ..  X  of temporal distribution  X   X  ; X   X  1,2, ... , X   X  . The method then proposes to identify outliers according to an exponential distribution of  X  X  X  ..  X  exponential distribution, the probability that powe r of one period  X   X   X  , i.e.  X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X  , can be given by  X   X  X  X  X  . The significant periods have powers that deviate from the power of the majority of the periods. Thus, the probability  X   X   X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X  important period will be a very low value. Obviousl y,  X  X n X  X  X  X / X  would be a threshold that distinguishes the import ant periodicity from the unimportant ones. Assume that we judge that the temporal distribution has a perio dicity whose frequency is ..  X  . Meanwhile, we define  X  -neighbor domain ( of time point  X  in Algorithm 1. Thereby, we denote the set of important time points as  X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  , where time points that are wave crests and is set as 2A/3 the Amplitude of Angular Frequency ..  X  . We obtain a combined set of important time points by C  X  . Then we achieve the important periods  X   X  by merging the elements in C  X  that are adjacent. For example, if U ={1,2,7,8,9,20,21,22,23}, the corresponding burst per iods are {1,2}, {7,8,9} and {20,21,22,23}. We represent the important periods by  X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X  , X   X   X ;  X   X  1,2. .  X  X  X  , where represents the set of time units between  X   X  and  X   X  . Chien et al. [2] proposed a simple but effective si milarity measure to seek related queries in terms of temporal semant ics. They define the similarity of two queries  X   X  and  X   X  , whose temporal distributions are represented by  X   X   X  X  X  ; X   X  1,2,... ,  X   X  1,2,... ,  X   X  , as the correlation coefficients of their temporal distribution. In this paper, we adopt the correlati on coefficients as Macro-Similarity, which is described as: where  X  X  X  X   X   X  and ... X  X  X   X   X  are the mean value and standard deviation of  X   X   X  X  X  ; X   X  1,2,... ,  X   X  respectively. It is the same to To compute the Micro-Similarity, we find out the ov erlapping period between each important period pair that are in respectively and obtain a new important period set represented by  X  , X   X  .The set can be described as: Then, we calculate the Micro-Similarity as: Finally, we could compute the combined similarity t hrough equation  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X 1  X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  . Here we set parameter to be  X  D/ X  , where D is the number of time points in  X   X   X  , X   X  . ___________________________________________________ __ The latest work about query substitution was propos ed by Radlinski et al. [1]. In [1], for a given query, we firstly find out k most related ads in terms of the cosine similarity between query Web search result and ads. Then the bid phrases of these ads are taken as a candidate pool of possible substitutions for the query. For every candidate substitution, a linear combinat ion of features measuring the match between the query and candidate substitution is computed. The highest scoring bid phrase is sele cted as the substitution for the query. In this work, we utiliz e the same framework of [1] and add the MM-Sim to the feature set measuring the match between query and candidate sub stitutions. We collect 500 diverse queries and a collection of ads with bid phrases as evaluation corpus. Figure 1 presents the fraction of top 3 ads returned for the 500 evaluation queries that are relevant to the original query, as a function of the coverage o f queries (substitutions) for which we generate ads. For inst ance, 20% coverage indicates that only the ads linked by subs titutions with top 20% highest relevant score to original queries are reserved for evaluation. Averagely, the algorithm involving MM-S im achieves 10.1% and 23.5% higher proportion of relevant ads t han the one involving correlation coefficient (Ma-Sim) and the algorithm proposed by Radlinski (R-QS) respectively. These re sults are very encouraging and also justify the value for further research.
