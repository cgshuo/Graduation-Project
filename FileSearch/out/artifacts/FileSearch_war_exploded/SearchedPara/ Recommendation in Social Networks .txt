 H.2.8 [ Database Applications ]: Data mining Recommender systems, social networks, social influence, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization. With the emergence of online social networks, academia and industry have explored ways to exploit the information in social networks to improve the quality of recommendations and to support new recommendation tasks. The underlying motivation is to capture the effects that govern the evolution of social networks, i.e. social influence, selection, correlational influence and transitivity, to enhance the typically very sparse rating matrix. Recommender systems exploiting a social network promise to outperform traditional recommenders in particular for cold-start (new) users who have not yet provided enough information about their preferences. After introducing the motivation and some of the practical applications, we di scuss social networks and the main factors affecting their evolution. We then review state-of-the-art methods for item recommendation in social networks, both memory-based approaches and model-based approaches, in recommendation, an important recommendation task that is unique to the context of social networks. We conclude the tutorial
