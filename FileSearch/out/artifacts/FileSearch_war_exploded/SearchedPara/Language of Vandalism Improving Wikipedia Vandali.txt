 Wikipedia, the  X  X ree encyclopedia X  (Wikipedia, 2011), ranks among the top 200 most visited web-sites worldwide (Alexa, 2011). This editable ency-clopedia has amassed over 15 million articles across hundreds of languages. The English language en-cyclopedia alone has over 3.5 million articles and receives over 1.25 million edits (and sometimes up-wards of 3 million) daily (Wikipedia, 2010). But allowing anonymous edits is a double-edged sword; nearly 7% (Potthast, 2010) of edits are vandalism, i.e. revisions to articles that undermine the quality and veracity of the content. As Wikipedia contin-ues to grow, it will become increasingly infeasible for Wikipedia users and administrators to manually police articles. This pressing issue has spawned re-cent research activities to understand and counteract vandalism (e.g., Geiger and Ribes (2010)). Much of previous work relies on hand-picked rules such as lexical cues (e.g., vulgar words) and metadata (e.g., anonymity, edit frequency) to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia (e.g., Potthast et al. (2008), West et al. (2010)). Although some recent work has started exploring the use of natural language processing, most work to date is based on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g., Wang and McKeown (2010), Chin et al. (2010), Adler et al. (2011)).
We explore more linguistically motivated ap-proaches to detect vandalism in this paper. Our hypothesis is that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share simi-lar linguistic behavior. Some obvious hallmarks of this style include usage of obscenities, misspellings, and slang usage, but we aim to automatically un-cover stylistic cues to effectively discriminate be-tween vandalizing and normal text. Experimental re-sults suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic con-text free grammar (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexico-syntactic pat-terns based on n-grams. Stylometric features attempt to recognize patterns of style in text. These techniques have been tra-ditionally applied to attribute authorship (Argamon et al. (2009), Stamatatos (2009)), opinion mining (Panicheva et al., 2010), and forensic linguistics (Turell, 2010). For our purposes, we hypothesize that different stylistic features appear in regular and vandalizing edits. For regular edits, honest editors will strive to follow the stylistic guidelines set forth by Wikipedia (e.g. objectivity, neutrality and factu-ality). For edits that vandalize articles, these users may converge on common ways of vandalizing arti-cles. 2.1 Language Models To differentiate between the styles of normal users and vandalizers, we employ language models to cap-ture the stylistic differences between authentic and vandalizing revisions. We train two trigram lan-guage model (LM) with Good-Turing discounting and Katz backoff for smoothing of vandalizing ed-its (based on the text difference between the vandal-izing and previous revision) and good edits (based on the text difference between the new and previous revision). 2.2 Probabilistic Context Free Grammar Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) capture deep syntactic regularities beyond shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. Raghavan et al. (2010) reported for the first time that PCFG models are effective in learning stylometric signature of authorship at deep syntactic levels. In this work, we explore the use of PCFG models for vandalism detection, by viewing the task as a genre detection problem, where a group of authors share similar linguistic behavior. We give a concise description of the use of PCFG models be-low, referring to Raghavan et al. (2010) for more de-tails.

Our system decides if an edit to an article is vandal-ism by training a classifier based on a set of features derived from many different aspects of the edit. For this task, we use an annotated corpus (Potthast et al., 2010) of Wikipedia edits where revisions are la-beled as either vandalizing or non-vandalizing. This section will describe in brief the features used by our classifier, a more exhaustive description of our non-linguistically motivated features can be found in Harpalani et al. (2010). 3.1 Features Based on Metadata Our classifier takes into account metadata generated by the revision. We generate features based on au-thor reputation by recording if the edit is submitted by an anonymous user or a registered user. If the au-thor is registered, we record how long he has been registered, how many times he has previously van-dalized Wikipedia, and how frequent he edits arti-cles. We also take into account the comment left by an author. We generate features based on the charac-teristics of the articles revision history. This includes how many times the article has been previously van-dalized, the last time it was edited, how many times it has been reverted and other related features. 3.2 Features Based on Lexical Cues Our classifier also employs a subset of features that rely on lexical cues. Simple strategies such as count-ing the number of vulgarities present in the revision are effective to capture obvious forms of vandalism. We measure the edit distance between the old and new revision, the number of repeated patterns, slang words, vulgarities and pronouns, the type of edit (in-sert, modification or delete) and other similar fea-tures. 3.3 Features Based on Sentiment Wikipedia editors strive to maintain a neutral and objective voice in articles. Vandals, however, in-sert subjective and polar statements into articles. We build two classifiers based on the work of Pang and Lee (2004) to measure the polarity and objectivity of article edits. We train the classifier on how many positive and negative sentences were inserted as well as the overall change in the sentiment score from the previous version to the new revision and the num-ber of inserted or deleted subjective sentences in the revision. 3.4 Features Based on Stylometric Measures We encode the output of the LM and PCFG in the following manner for training our classifier. We take the log-likelihood of the regular edit and van-dalizing edit LMs. For our PCFG, we take the dif-ference between the minimum log-likelihood score (i.e. the sentences with the minimum log-likelihood) of C vandal and C regular , the difference in the max-imum log-likelihood score, the difference in the mean log-likelihood score, the difference in the standard deviation of the mean log-likelihood score and the difference in the sum of the log-likelihood scores. 3.5 Choice of Classifier We use Weka X  X  (Hall et al., 2009) implementation of LogitBoost (Friedman et al., 2000) to perform the classification task. We use Decision Stumps (Ai and Langley, 1992) as the base learner and run Logit-Boost for 500 iterations. We also discretize the train-ing data using the Multi-Level Discretization tech-nique (Perner and Trautzsch, 1998). Data We use the 2010 PAN Wikipedia vandalism corpus Potthast et al.

This corpus comprises of 32452 edits on 28468 ar-ticles, with 2391 of the edits identified as vandal-ism by human annotators. The class distribution is highly skewed, as only 7% of edits corresponds to vandalism. Among the different types of vandalism (e.g. deletions, template changes), we focus only on those edits that inserted or modified text (17145 ed-its in total) since stylometric features are not relevant to deletes and template modifications. Note that in-sertions and modifications are the main source for vandalism.

We randomly separated 15000 edits for training of C vandal and C regular , and 17444 edits for testing, preserving the ratio of vandalism to non-vandalism revisions. We eliminated 7359 of the testing ed-its to remove revisions that were exclusively tem-plate modifications (e.g. inserting a link) and main-tain the observed ratio of vandalism for a total of 10085 edits. For each edit in the test set, we com-pute the probability of each modified sentence for C vandal and C regular and generate the statistics for the features described in 3.4. We compare the per-formance of the language models and stylometric features against a baseline classifier that is trained on metadata, lexical and sentiment features using 10 fold stratified cross validation on the test set.

 AUC rather than accuracy. 1 The baseline system, which includes a wide range of features that are shown to be highly effective in vandalism detection, achieves F-score 52.6%, and AUC 91.6%. The base-line features include all features introduced in Sec-tion 3.

Adding language model features to the baseline (denoted as +LM in Table 1) increases the F-score slightly (53.5%), while the AUC score is almost the same (91.7%). Adding PCFG based features to the baseline (denoted as +PCFG) brings the most substantial performance improvement: it increases recall substantially while also improving precision, achieving 57.9% F-score and 92.9% AUC. Combin-ing both PCFG and language model based features (denoted as +LM+PCFG) only results in a slight improvement in AUC.

 Feature Analysis Table 2 lists the information gain ranking of our features. Notice that several of our PCFG features are in the top ten most informa-tive features. Language model based features were ranked very low in the list, hence we do not include them in the list. This finding will be potentially ad-vantageous to many of the current anti-vandalism tools such as vulgarisms, which rely only on shal-low lexico-syntactic patterns.
 Examples To provide more insight to the task, Ta-ble 3 shows several instances where the addition of the PCFG derived features detected vandalism that the baseline approach could not. Notice that the first example contains a lot of conjunctions that would be hard to characterize using shallow lexico-syntactic features. The second and third examples also show sentence structure that are more informal and vandalism-like. The fourth example is one that is harder to catch. It looks almost like a benign edit, however, what makes it a vandalism is the phrase  X (Happy Birthday) X  inserted in the middle.

Table 4 shows examples where all of our systems could not detect the vandalism correctly. Notice that examples in Table 4 generally manifest more a for-mal voice than those in Table 3. Wang and McKeown (2010) present the first ap-proach that is linguistically motivated. Their ap-proach was based on shallow syntactic patterns, while ours explores the use of deep syntactic pat-terns, and performs a comparative evaluation across different stylometry analysis techniques. It is worth-while to note that the approach of Wang and McKe-own (2010) is not as practical and scalable as ours in that it requires crawling a substantial number (150) of webpages to detect each vandalism edit. From our pilot study based on 1600 edits (50% of which is vandalism), we found that the topic-specific lan-guage models built from web search do not produce stronger result than PCFG based features. We do not have a result directly comparable to theirs how-ever, as we could not crawl the necessary webpages required to match the size of corpus.

The standard approach to Wikipedia vandalism detection is to develop a feature based on either the content or metadata and train a classifier to recog-nize it. A comprehensive overview of what types of features have been employed for this task can be found in Potthast et al. (2010). WikiTrust, a repu-tation system for Wikipedia authors, focuses on de-termining the likely quality of a contribution (Adler and de Alfaro, 2007). This paper presents a vandalism detection system for Wikipedia that uses stylometric features to aide in classification. We show that deep syntactic patterns based on PCFGs more effectively identify vandal-ism than shallow lexico-syntactic patterns based on n-grams or contextual language models. PCFGs do not require the laborious process of performing web searches to build context language models. Rather, PCFGs are able to detect differences in language styles between vandalizing edits and normal edits to Wikipedia articles. Employing stylometric features increases the baseline classification rate.

We are currently working to improve this tech-nique through more effective training of our PCFG parser. We look to automate the expansion of the training set of vandalized revisions to include exam-ples from outside of Wikipedia that reflect similar language styles. We also are investigating how we can better utilize the output of our PCFG parsers for classification. We express our most sincere gratitude to Dr. Tamara Berg and Dr. Luis Ortiz for their valuable guid-ance and suggestions in applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to the task of vandalism detection. We also recognize the hard work of Megha Bassi and Thanadit Phumprao for assisting us in building our vandalism detection pipeline that enabled us to perform these experi-ments.
