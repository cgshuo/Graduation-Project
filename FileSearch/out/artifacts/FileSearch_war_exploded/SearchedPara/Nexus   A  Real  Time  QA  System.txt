 H.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Search Process Performance Question Answering, Informaion Retrieval
Factoid Question Answering has attracted much research interest in recent years. The performances of the state of the art factoid QA systems in terms of the correctness of answers seem to be approaching reasonabe level as shown by TREC QA exercises [2] to make Question Answering nearly viable for practical uses. However, one important issue that has attracted less attention is that of whether a QA system can be efficient enough to scale up to the intensive usages such as a web search engine might be subjected to. Unlike web search engines such as Google which can produce results on real time while handling tens of thousands of queries per second, a typical QA system requires several seconds or even minutes to produce the answer to a single question. This, we believe, is due to the fact that a typical QA system performs most of its work on-line after a question has been put. In this demonstration, we present our system, Nexus ,whichshifts a significant proportion of work off-line by pre-processing and constructing a specialized index for potential answers  X  currently, expressions bearing named entities such as people, organisations and locations. This substantially increases the system X  X  speed and efficiency.
Our method shifts most of the work off-line to the pre-processing and indexes the possible answers directly via a specially constructed term-term matrix. The method uses a text corpus of substantive size as its main source of knowl-edge. The method that constructs the answer index is de-scribed as follows:
