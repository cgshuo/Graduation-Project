 1. Introduction
The rapid development of computer and network technology has resulted in the transformation of the traditional schol-arly communication system, which has been in place for more than three centuries, by the Internet ( Zhao, 2005 ). Web-based information plays an increasingly important role in scientific communication and scholarly research ( Brown, 2007 ). Citation analysis is a unique method of observing the academic behavior of authors and researchers ( Vaughan &amp; Shaw, 2005 ) and has become one of the most widely used methods of bibliometrics ( Rubin, 2004 ). In this context, Web citations have been pro-posed as data sources for studying academic citations. 2. Web citation
Two types of Web citations are currently used. Zhao and Logan (2002) explored whether citation analysis using scientific papers found on the Web as data sources is a worthwhile means of studying online scientific communication.
Vaughan and Shaw (2003, 2005) were the first to conduct a large-scale investigation of this type. They defined Web citations as  X  X  X entions of an article published in a paper-based source in a source on the Web. X  X  Following Vaughan X  X  method, Van
Impe and Rousseau (2006) conducted a similar comparison of a number of Dutch and French humanities journals. Kousha and Thelwall (2006, 2007a) studied  X  X  X RL citations, X  X   X  X  X oogle Scholar citations, X  X  and  X  X  X oogle unique citations X  X  and defined the URL citations of  X  X  X  Web page to be the mentions of its URL in the text of other Web pages, whether hyperlinked or  X  not X  X  (2006). They also proposed that  X  X  X  Web/URL citation of an online journal article is a Web mention of its title, URL, or both X  X  ( Kousha &amp; Thelwall, 2007a ). However, the  X  X  X nique Web/URL citations X  X  were conveniently calculated by omitting the indented Google results to reduce duplicated results from the same site ( Kousha &amp; Thelwall, 2007b ). The definitions by Vaughan and Kousha overlap to some extent despite a slight variation ( Kousha &amp; Thelwall, 2007a ).

Paper-to-Web citations are also called  X  X  X eb citations X  X  ( Casserly &amp; Bird, 2003, 2008; Rumsey, 2002; Davis, 2001 ),  X  X  X eb 2002 ). These types of citations comprise Web information used as references for academic papers. In the present study, Web citations are defined as the mentions of the URLs of Web pages in the references of an academic paper.

A number of academic papers use a considerable number of Web citations. During the early years of the Internet, Zhang (1998) explored the effect of e-resources on formal scholarly communication. Dellavalle et al. (2003) examined the fre-quency, format, and activity of Web citations in three widely circulated, high impact US journals that are among the top 1% of all publications, as rated by the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The results showed that 30% of articles contained one or more Web citations. Overall, 2.6% of all citations were Web citations. The highest density of Web citations appeared in review articles, and the lowest was in letters. Oermann, Nordstrom, Ineson, and Wilmes (2008) examined 573 Web citations in articles published in nursing journals and found an average of 3.1 Web citations per article. Most of the Web citations are documents related to clinical practice. Bhat and Kumar (2008) showed that 81.49% of the articles in nine selected electronic journals published from 2000 to 2006 had Web citations, and out of 25,730 citations, 43.52% were Web citations.

URL decay or  X  X  X ink rot X  X  has been a growing concern in Web citation analysis. Harter and Kim (1996) performed one of the earliest studies addressing this issue when they examined 83 references to online sources from 74 e-journals and found that only 43 were accessible in 1995. More researchers have since studied the accessibility of Web citations ( Wu, 2009 ), covering tions in biomedical literature ( Aronsky &amp; et al., 2007 ). 3. Citation distribution
Scientific tradition demands that scholars reference relevant earlier research when writing their own manuscripts ( Nicolaisen, 2007 ). A number of scholars have studied citation distributions. As first observed by Price (1965) , the number of citations received by scientific papers appear to follow the power-law distribution. He also noted that well-cited papers continue to be referenced more frequently than less-cited papers and thus, coined the term  X  X  X umulative advantage X  X  to de-has been assumed to satisfy, in most cases, Bradford X  X  law of bibliometrics ( Gupta, 1991; Mubeen, 1996 ). Redner (1998) showed that highly cited papers tend to follow a Zipf power law with an exponent of approximately 0.5. This result leads to the conclusion that the degree of nodes in the citation graph for highly cited papers follows a power law with an exponent of 3. Using JCR, Garfield (1983) proposed his Law of Concentration, which states that relatively few journals are cited in most references. In the Science Citation Index (SCI) of 1969, only 25 journals (slightly over 1% of SCI coverage) were cited in 24% of all references, only 152 journals were cited in 50% of all references, and only roughly 2000 journals were cited in 85% of all references. However, these percentages do not comprise a statistical distribution, but are rather a method of stating that the information sciences are characterized by highly skewed distributions. Garfield (1980) said,  X  X  X his law, more highly cited or multidisciplinary journals. X  X 
Rousseau (1997) , using a data set from 343 URLs, found that a cited frequency of links fit the power-law distribution (Lot-ka X  X  law of bibliometrics). Huberman and Adamic (1999) subsequently showed power laws in the distributions of the total number of pages in sites covered by Alexa and Infoseek crawls. Faloutsos, Faloutsos, and Faloutsos (1999), Barab X si and
Albert (1999) and Kumar et al. (2001) also found the power-law distribution of Web structure. Broder and et al. (2000) stud-ied 200 million pages and 1500 million links, and proved amply that In-degree distributions and Out-degree distributions followed power law. Faba-Perez, Guerrero-Bote, and Moya-Anegon (2003) studied how well the distribution of inbound links received by Web pages fits either a power law (of the Lotka type) or a bibliometric distribution for printed publications (of the Bradford type). Thelwall and Wilkinson (2003) claimed that the graph structures of three national university systems are similar to a power-law distribution despite having some anomalies.

Equivalences exist among informetric laws, and this phenomenon has already been predicted and modeled on an earlier construct by Egghe (2005) . Bradford X  X , Zipf X  X , Lotka X  X , and Pareto X  X  laws were independently formulated to explain disparate phenomena. Although each  X  X  X aw X  X  applies to different specific phenomena, they all tend to demonstrate the argument that a few sources (journals, scientists, and so on) account for many reference items (articles, citations, and so on). The fact that they closely resemble one another seems more than mere coincidence ( Garfield, 1980 ). Therefore, the laws are essentially the same, but offer different perspectives (e.g., rank-frequency cumulative, rank-frequency noncumulative, size-frequency, and other forms). 4. Research questions
Numerous studies have been devoted to studying Web citations, with a good number focused on the persistence or avail-been made to fit a large collection of URLs extracted from scientific-article references to mathematical distributions. The present study takes off from this current state of scholarship to analyze the use of Web citations.

The present study aims to identify the distribution characteristics of Web resources cited in academic documents and to determine whether the distribution of Web citations is similar to traditional informetric laws.

Research goals will be addressed using the following research questions: What are the general characteristics of Web cita-tion distributions? What are the distributions of Web site types, Web page types, URL frequencies, URL depths, URL lengths, and year of article publication in Web citations? Do Web citation distributions fit a power law? 5. Methods
The current research is primarily based on the analysis of the URLs of Web citations. More specifically, the distribution of the number of Web sites ( y ) that are cited x times is studied. 5.1. Sample selection
In this section, the three data sets used are described. These samples were selected because of the following aspects: The documents for scholars undergoing their scientific research and scholarship. All three data sets were derived from scholarly journals and are from different periods, disciplines, countries, and numbers. The Web citations of Data Sets 1 X 3 were tively. The second aspect is the availability of the datasets. Web citations are not included in many databases (such as the
Web of Science), so obtaining large-scale data is troublesome. However, the Chinese Social Science Citation Index (CSSCI) has the Web citations in Data Sets 1  X  3 and can be freely downloaded from the Internet. We describe three data sets in Table 1 . 5.1.1. Data Set 1
Data from the CSSCI can be acquired from two perspectives: the citing and the cited. All citations of the electronic doc-ument type for 12 years (1998 X 2009) were downloaded and 203,346 electronic citations were obtained. These electronic citations included a number of other types, such as CDs. However, some electronic citations only stated the network resource and did not include the URL of the resources. For example, two electronic citations were marked as  X  X  X he Sina website X  X  and  X  X  X he People X  X  Daily (Online). X  X  After keying the downloaded records into Excel, considerable time was spent correcting the data for inappropriate spaces and erroneous characters (such as the backslash) by referencing URLs in CSSCI or in their full texts or abstracts. The Web citations were also corrected according to the general rule of URLs, and the Web page linked to the URLs were explored. Finally, nonstandard Web citations were manually excluded when they could not be corrected. 5.1.2. Data Set 2 The second data set was selected from Spinellis (2003) , whose research involved the verification of decay and failures of
URL references appearing in published materials from Communications of the ACM and IEEE Computer. To allow researchers to build on their work, Spinellis provides the complete set of URLs, their sources, and the programs at www.spinellis.gr/sw/ url-decay . 5.1.3. Data Set 3
Ducut, Liu, and Fontelo (2008) conducted an update study on URL decay in MEDLINE. Their study was based on a general database of URL addresses that were extracted from MEDLINE abstracts in 1994 X 2006. The data are freely accessible at www.biomedcentral.com/content/supplementary/1472-6947-8-23-S1.xls . 5.2. Web citation analysis
The typical URL format is Protocol://hostname[:port]/path/[;parameter][?query]#fragment . A host or Web site on the Internet is identified by a hostname, such as www.yahoo.com , which is also called a domain name (including top-level, second-level, and lower-level domains). A special topic is often presented in a host. Host names are mapped to IP addresses and are more convenient for users than digital IP addresses. A URL can be divided into multi-parts, namely, Web page, directory, hostname, and Web site levels. On the basis of the structure of the URL, Smith (1999) introduced the expression  X  X  X eb space, X  X  which
Thelwall (2005) refined using the alternative document model. Bjorneborn and Ingwersen (2004) explicitly modeled the layers of the Web. Based on the structure of the URL, Web citations can be aggregated from many levels. Generally, the domain names or hosts comprise part of the URL immediately succeeding  X  X  X ttp:// X  X  and preceding the next  X  X /. X  X  For example, the URL http://news.xinhuanet.com/zhengfu/2003-03/06/content-761881.htm would link to news.xinhuanet.com . URLs with the same hostnames were aggregated when fitting the power-law distribution. 5.3. Power law
The power-law function has often been converted into linear equations of power-law fitting ( Faba-Perez et al., 2003 ). In the present study, power law-based distributions can be represented by the logarithm of cited frequency versus that of the number of hostnames. However, this approach does not always fit very well in any field of power law ( Egghe, 2005 ). Hence, the data were also analyzed using other methods. Lotka X  X  law is one of the negative/inverse power distributions, which is an inverse exponential law indicating that an inverse relationship exists between the number of publications produced and the number of authors producing these publications. Lotka X  X  law can been expressed using the following equation: where y is the number of hosts cited x times, and the exponent n and the constant c are parameters to be estimated from a given set of Web citation data. The parameters n and c have been originally estimated using the least-squares method ( Pao, 1986 ). However, a number of studies have shown that the maximum-likelihood approach is better than the least-squares method ( Goldstein, Morris, &amp; Yen, 2004 ). Rousseau and Rousseau (2000) presented a computer program for fitting the power law distribution following Nicholls X  (1986) methodology, wherein a maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate parameters, as well as a Kolmogorov X  X mirnov test for goodness-of-fit. The critical value is at the 0.01 level of signifi-the null hypothesis that the data set conforms to, Lotka X  X  law can be accepted at a certain level of significance. If the max-imum deviation exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis must be rejected at a certain level of significance, and the ob-served distribution is concluded to be significantly different from the theoretical distribution ( Petek, 2008 ). This methodology was followed in the present paper. 6. Results and discussion
The distribution of Web citations by year of article publication is shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2 (in Appendices). Set 1 pre-sents the data from the Humanities and Social Science Index in China, Set 2 presents the data from the publications of two international computer science societies (Communications of the ACM and IEEE Computer), and Set 3 presents the data from the MEDLINE database. The three distribution curves approximate the  X  X  X  X  X  shape, although they stand for different periods, disciplines, and numbers (the left ordinate in Fig. 1 accounts for Set 1). The curves are initially linearly increasing, subse-quently showing exponential growth before finally settling at a slower growth rate. The three data sets are very consistent with the logistic-growth model in Fig. 1 . Two factors may account for this phenomenon. On one hand, the popularity and utility of the Internet have changed scientific exploration in many aspects, such that an increasing number of Web resources are used in academic research. On the other hand, limits exist both in the number of citations per article and articles per journal. Thus, Web citations cannot exhibit unlimited growth. However, the logistic-growth model is an ideal state because the growth of citations is affected by numerous social factors. The average number of Web citations per article in Set 1 is approximately 0.2, whereas that in Set 2 is 1.77. Compared with international researchers, Chinese scholars use relatively per article ( Rumsey, 2002 ). These results may be attributed to two factors, namely, the development and application of com-puter technology and the need for further improvement in China X  X  Internet, and the number of references per article in China being generally fewer than that in other countries.

Some abnormal data are also found in Sets 2 and 3. Table 2 shows that Set 2 covers articles from 1995 X 1999 ( Spinellis, 2003 ), but 2000 data are also found. The time span in Set 2 includes  X  X  X EDLINE records from 1994 to 2006 from the National ent study because their sources could not be accurately identified. The number of ftp -type Web citations is reduced every tions were excluded when the distribution of Web site types, Web page types, URL frequencies, URL depths, and URL lengths in Web citations was investigated. 6.1. Domain-type distribution of Web citations
Websites can be classified into nine categories according to their domain types. The most widely used domains are .com (company), .net (network), .org (organization), .edu (education), .gov (government), .ac (academia), and .int (international).
Other domains directly use IP and country names. New domains, such as .biz, .coop, .info, .aero, .pro, .museum, and .name, are also adopted ( Yang et al., 2010 ). The nine domains were selected based on their popularity.

The distribution of Web citations by domain sorted by descending order of frequency in Set 1 is shown in Fig. 2 . Web sites emphasize different domains, so their effects on users are diverse. The most frequently used domain name in Sets 1 and 2 is pers deal with government-related issues. .edu is the leading domain name (25%) in Set 2. The domain distribution in Set 3 is distinctive because the Others -type domain is the most commonly cited, accounting for 29%.
 Fig. 3 shows the percentage distribution of Web citations according to domain types by year of article publication in Set 1.
Generally, the proportion of each type of domain is stable, except for 1998 and 1999. The inconsistency in these two years may be attributed to the small number of Web citations during these periods. Both the proportion and absolute number of .gov types significantly increase. The increased use of the .gov domain may be due attributed to the rapid growth of govern-ment information resources on the Web, which have gained popularity in recent years through the e-government movement in China. The .edu domain is associated with university Web sites, which tend to release relatively authoritative and repu-table information. However, the percentage of .edu domain decreases in Set 1, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . 6.2. Web page-type distribution of Web citations Web citations mostly correspond to particular Web resources, which can be classified into several formats, such as HTML, PDF, Word (doc), and PPT, among others. However, some people may use the URLs of Web sites instead of the particular Web page that they are actually citing. In particular, many hypertext Web pages do not end with .html or .htm in URLs. Hence, the URLs can only reflect the formats of Web sites in general.

Fig. 4 provides the percentage of Web citations according to Web page types in the three data sets. Web site type is defined as a Web citation that includes only the domain name and does not reference specific files or user direction. Most of the Web citations in these data sets are of the html and Web site type in these data sets. However, large differences exist across the fewer in Set 3 (13%). Web site type accounts for 43% of all Web citations in Set 3, whereas it accounts for only 20% in Set 1A in a higher proportion of the Others type in the two data sets.
 Fig. 5 shows that the percentage of Web citations according to Web page types by year in Set 1 changes from year to year.
The html , Web site , and others types account for most of the Web citations in the early years, whereas Web citations have shown a more diverse composition in recent years. This finding may be attributed to the diversity of formats used for
Web information resources. For example, the proportion of html remains relatively stable, PDF and ASP are characterized by significant growth, and the others type shows a decline. 6.3. URL depth distribution of Web citations
The URL of Web citations is composed of multi-levels separated by  X  X /. X  X  Fig. 6 shows the distribution of Web citations by
However, the number of Web citations is found to be small when URL depth is greater than or equal to 6. The distribution is more uniform in Set 1 than in the other sets. Depth levels 0 (no path), 1, and 2 account for approximately 80% and 83% in Sets remaining depth levels account for approximately 0.7% and 2%, respectively. The highest proportion of Web citations is path depth 2 (40,842) in Set 1, and path depth 0 (1258 and 3334, respectively) in Sets 2 and 3. The number of URLs in the three data sets was also found to significantly decrease with increasing depth level, except for depth levels 0 and 1.
Fig. 7 shows that when further analyzed by individual year, the percentage of Web citations according to URL depth is 4, 5, and P 6 moderately increase.
 6.4. Length of URL characters and frequency of URL distribution of Web citations Fig. 8 shows that the distributions of the percentage of Web citations according to URL length are similar in Sets 2 and 3. and so on. Sets 2 and 3 have the highest proportion in the  X  X  P 20 X  X  horizontal coordinate, whereas Set 1 has the highest pro-is lower in Fig. 4 . The URL depth level of the largest percentage is 2 in Set 1, and 0 in Sets 2 and 3 ( Fig. 6 ).
Fig. 9 shows that the entire relationship between URL lengths and depth levels in the three data sets is one of linear cor-relation. This relationship clearly indicates that with the growth in the depth levels of URL paths, the average URL length decreases.

Fig. 10 provides the relationships among the URL frequencies, lengths, and depth levels in Set 1. The figure shows that with increasing URL frequencies in the horizontal coordinate, the average number of URL depth levels and lengths both de-crease. Particularly, when the URL frequencies are greater than or equal to 50, all the URL depth levels are 0 (no path). If a Web site wants to attract more users, it should, to some extent, have a simple site structure and should avoid using complex
URL levels and long URLs. 6.5. Power-law distribution of domain names in Web citations
Linear regression and the correlation coefficient were used to fit a plot to a line (the logarithm of cited frequency versus the logarithm of the number of hostnames). Table 3 shows the results of fitting the Web citation distributions model by lin-frequently cited. However, the adequate frequency to warrant exclusion and the reason why frequent citations should be excluded remain unclear. Moreover, the issue of whether frequent citations that are part of the power-law curve should be included should be addressed. The frequently cited sites are not omitted in the present study. Table 3 shows that when however, they are not highly significant, with a huge difference in the constants of the three data sets (2.349, 1.497, and 1.646, respectively).

The number of most frequently cited hosts is small, but these account for a large proportion of the number of Web cita-tions. For example, 22 (approximately 0.04%) highly cited hosts are found in Set 1, and these citations account for nearly 10% (18,275) of all Web citations. An extremely popular site, news.xinhuanet.com , the online news service of the Xinhua News
Agency, was cited 3017 times. The fact that the distribution comes close to a pure power law is normal, but cannot fit the law completely. Thelwall and Wilkinson (2003) discovered anomalies in the Web distributions of a pure power law. Pennock, Flake, Lawrence, Glover, and Giles (2002) also found partial nonlinearity in many power law graphs.
Table 4 shows the fit of the Web citation distribution model using Lotka X  X  law. In Set 1, when the high-frequency sites are included, the maximum deviation is 0.0111, which exceeds the critical value of 0.007 at the 0.01 significance level. Three primary factors may account for this result. First, the total number of hosts is excessive because the critical value at the is a comprehensive citation database for Chinese humanities and social science, whereas Lotka X  X  law is often employed and effective in specific and single-subject fields ( Pao, 1986 ). Third, Kretschmer and Rousseau (2001) empirically showed that
Lotka X  X  law breaks down when  X  X  X rticles with a large, i.e., more than hundred, number of authors are included in the bibli-ography. X  X  They believe that  X  X  X f studying articles with many authors means dealing with items (the articles) having multiple
Numerous studies on Lotka X  X  law use truncated data and exclude the part of the data that represents more prolific sources (the authors) because very few authors of high productivity are special. In his original study, Lotka (1926) suggested that highly productive authors be considered separately and cut off his two data sets at the first 17 points (1.3%) for physics and at 30 points (1.02%) for chemistry distribution. Thereafter, a number of researchers claimed that 1% of the total number of authors should be removed. However, the  X  X  X est X  X  cut point has been determined using the formula
Pao (1986) , where P y x is the total number of sources (the authors). When 129 hosts (0.24%) are omitted, the maximum tained when tribution cannot be rejected, suggesting that Web citation data fit Lotka X  X  law.

In Table 4 , the power law exponents (2.184, 2.2028, and 2.4933) in the three data sets seem to correspond with those obtained by Faba-Perez et al. (2003) and Broder et al. (2000) on ordinary Web sites, in which the exponent is 2.1. However, the three exponents are greater than 2.1 compared with an ideal power law distribution. The tail of Web citations distribu-tion is lower, implying high dispersal in low-frequency sites (the long tail).
 The tests show that Web citations are similar to traditional citations and that their distribution is regular to some extent.
Although numerous reasons exist for citing ( Rousseau, 1997 ), this activity is generally regarded as a kind of academic behav-tions with traditional bibliometric distribution is a reasonable finding. Web citation may play an important role in using and managing Web information resources, including the evaluation of academic Web sites, the discernment of academic behav-ior via the Web, and the selection of Web resources ( Yang et al., 2010 ). 7.

In the future, a long-term, large-scale study on the principles and the law of Web citation distributions is hoped to be conducted. On the basis of the URLs, Web citations are concluded to be aggregated from many levels. These laws can then be examined from each level. For example, a typical Web site consists of one or more servers (hosts), with each server under-taking some functions or comprising sub-Web sites. Web citations can subsequently be ranked by Web site level. In the cur-rent study, only the idea of Web citation applications was proposed. However, the practical application and testing of Web citations call for deeper study.
