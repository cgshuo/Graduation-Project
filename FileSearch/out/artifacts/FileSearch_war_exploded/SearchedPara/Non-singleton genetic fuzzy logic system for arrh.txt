 1. Introduction
Pattern classification encompasses a wide range of information processing problems that are of great practical significance, from the classification of handwritten characters, to fault detection in machinery and medical diagnosis. Often these are problems which many humans solve in a seemingly effortless fashion. In contrast, their solution using computers has, in many cases, proved to be immensely difficult. Despite the difficulties, pattern classification by computers is gaining more popularity nowadays. This is because computers are not affected by tiredness, hunger and cannot be distracted compared to human being. The primary intention of patternclassificationisto automaticallyassisthumansinanalysing the vast amount of available data and extracting useful knowledge from it. Although there are many choices of classifiers readily available in the literature, such as artificial neural network (ANN) ( Bishop, 1995 ), support vector machine (SVM) ( Burges, 1998 ), hidden Markov model (HMM) ( Rabiner, 1989) , and fuzzy logic system (FLS) ( Bezdek and Pal, 1992 ), all of them share a common basic structure and design steps. The typical components of a classifier and the classifier design flow are shown in Fig. 1 . The feature extraction step transforms raw data (observation space) intofeature vectors(feature space). Theresultingfeature space is of a much lower dimension than the observation space. The next step is a transformation of the feature space into a decision space, which is defined by a (finite) set of classes. A classifier, which is an algorithm, generates a partitioning of the feature space into a number of decision regions. After the classifier is designed and a desired level of performance is achieved, it can be used to classify new objects. This means that the classifier assigns every feature vector in the feature space to a class in the decision space. pattern classification. A good feature subset selected from a vast number of possibilities will lead to more accurate classifications, as well as better understanding and interpretation of the data ( Bereta and Burczyn  X  ski, 2007 ). Inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features generally adversely affect the performance of almost all common machine learning or pattern classification algorithms.
Besides classification accuracy, the relative ease with which the features may be extracted is another important factor to consider.
Computation costs may be lowered by performing pattern classi-fication using features that are easier to extract. However, these features are likely to contain more uncertainties which could lead to misclassifications. Furthermore, it is common to encounter noise corrupted signals that are caused by electrical interferences within thefeatureextractiondevicesorthemishandlingofthe equipment.
Medical diagnosis is an example of a pattern recognition problem where feature selection is a very delicate process since a human life is often at stake. A framework, such as fuzzy logic theory, that systematically represents the uncertainties present in the input signals may reduce the dependence of classification accuracy on the choice of feature vector.
 number of application areas. One of the main advantages of fuzzy logic is it enables qualitative domain knowledge about a classifica-tion task to be deployed in the algorithmic structure. Fuzzy approaches to pattern recognition have been pioneered by
Bellman et al. (1966) . In recent years, it has been successfully applied in medical domains. There are many inherent virtues of fuzzy system which are suitable for medical applications. Firstly, it can avoid hard threshold, thereby increasing the tolerance towards contradictions in the data. Secondly, a fuzzy classifier supports the implementation of rules based on the knowledge of a human expert. It is possible to integrate this valuable knowledge into the fuzzylogicsystemdueto thesystem X  X similarreasoningstyle tothe human being. Thirdly, biomedical features have statistical attri-butes that are non-stationary and mathematical descriptions of the non-stationarities are unknown ( Mendel and John, 2002 ).
The objective of this paper is to investigate if a non-singleton fuzzy logic classifier (NSFLC) can better cope with the uncertainties or fuzziness present in the extracted features. This work is motivated by the observation that there is often a trade-off between classification accuracy and the complexity of the algo-rithm for extracting features. A non-singleton fuzzy logic classifier, designed to capture the uncertainties in the extracted feature, will be especially useful when the fuzziness of the input data are inevitable. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, the non-singleton fuzzy classifier is defined and ana-lyzed. Section 3 presents the results of applying NSFLC to the practicalproblemofcardiacarrhythmiasclassification.Thissection includes the background information on arrhythmias, feature extraction, fuzzy logic implementation, GA evolution of the fuzzy classifier, experimental results and discussion. Section 4 concludes this paper. 2. Non-singleton fuzzy logic classifier (NSFLC)
Fig. 2 shows the general structure of a fuzzy rule-based classifier. As with any other classification system, a preprocessing unit filters the data, if necessary, and transforms the high dimen-sionalinputsintoa subsetofdesiredfeaturesinfeaturespace. Next, the fuzzifier transforms the crisp input values into a fuzzy set. The inferenceenginethencombinesthefuzzifiedinputwith X  X  X F X  X HEN X  X  rules using fuzzy t-norm to derive the firing strength for each rule.
Finally, the decision making unit will select the fuzzy rule with maximum degree of truth (i.e., highest firing strength) and assigns the data to the class associated to the rule. One advantage of fuzzy classifiers based on  X  X  X F X  X HEN X  X  rules is  X  X  X ransparency X  X  or  X  X  X nter-pretability X  X , i.e., the end user (expert) is able to verify the classification paradigm by judging the plausibility, consistency or completeness of the rule-base in fuzzy if X  X hen classifiers. 2.1. Fuzzification
The role of the fuzzifier in a fuzzy system is to map an element, x u , in the input vector x u  X  X  x u 1 , ... , x u m  X  T A X 1 into the fuzzy set ~ X u i . This process provides a natural framework for handlinguncertain input information.There isa variety ofmethods for performing fuzzification. The most common approach is singleton fuzzification ( Fig. 3 a), which maps a crisp input into the following membership function: By mapping the crisp signal into a fuzzy set that has only a single point in its support, the singleton fuzzifier does not model any vagueness in the input. As singleton fuzzification is employed in most existing fuzzy classification schemes, they do not make full use of the modelling capability of the fuzzifier. To better cope with noisy, imprecise or inaccurate input signals ( Wang, 1994; Jager, 1995 ), the classifier proposed in this paper comprises a non-singleton fuzzifier. By definition, a non-singleton fuzzifier maps a measurement x u i into a fuzzy number with an associated membership function such as the Gaussian function: where the variance s 2 ~ X input fuzzy set, ~ X u i .As m ~ X u i  X  x u i  X  X  1 and m as x i moves away from x u i ( Kaufman and Gupta, 1991 ), the non-singleton fuzzifier implies that the given input value x u likely value to be correct one from all the values in its immediate neighbourhood ( Mouzouris and Mendel, 1997 ). When signals are corrupted by noise, adjacent points may also be correct values, but to a lesser degree. A larger spread indicates that more uncertainties are inherent within the data. Fig. 3 b shows how the output of the non-singleton fuzzifier is combined with the antecedent set, using sup-star composition. The result of the fuzzy inference process is where  X  %  X  denotes t-norm operators such as minimum or product and x i denotes the value of x i at which the supremum of Eq. (2) occurs. m g can be interpreted as the degree of consistency of the input fuzzy set, ~ X u i with the antecedent fuzzy set, ~ input set is defined as in Eq. (1) and the antecedent set is defined as  X  x i  X  X  exp where the variance m ~ F

The  X  X re-filtering X  effect of NSFLC ( Mendel, 2001 ) is the key to handlinginputmeasurementuncertainty.Thiseffectistheresultof the sup-star composition within the NSFLC framework. The noise suppression capability may be demonstrated in the following example. Assume that x u i is an input corrupted by noise, that is, x u  X  x 0 u i  X  n i  X  6  X  where x 0 u i is the useful signal and n i is the noise. Substituting x
Eq. (4) with Eq. (6) yields x  X 
Eq. (7) shows that the noise is suppressed by the factor membership function also has this kind of noise suppressing capability. 2.2. Characteristics of the NSFLC
Having introduced non-singleton fuzzification and the opera-tions between the fuzzified input set and antecedent set, the steps for performing classification and the characteristics of the NSFLC will be described. Consider a NSLFC that has R rules of the following structure: where r  X  1, y , R , i  X  1, y , m , and j i  X  {1, y , p i fuzzy partitions in X i . The firing strength of the r th rule is f where  X  T  X  is the conjunction type aggregation operator or t-norm operator. The minimum and product are the two most widely used operations. Adopting the winner-takes-all approach, the overall decision is
Class Label  X  Class w ; w  X  argmax
The ability of the non-singleton fuzzifier in the NSFLC to handle vague input signals will be illustrated using a two-feature problem.
The antecedent sets of the NSFLC is shown in Fig. 4 and the fuzzy rule base is as follows: where C i represents the class i . Suppose two input feature vectors with the same crisp values ( x 1 , x 2 ) have differing level of uncer-tainties. Consequently, the two inputs are fuzzified into the following Gaussian fuzzy membership functions that have the same mean but different standard deviations:
Vector 1: Vector 2: m x 1  X  0 : 40 , s x 1  X  0 : 52 m x 1  X  0 : 40 , s x 1  X  0 : 19 m x 2  X  0 : 31 , s x 2  X  0 : 31 m x 2  X  0 : 31 , s x 2  X  0 : 28 for two cases. Regardless of whether fuzzy inference is implemen-ted using the product t-norm or the maximum t-norm, input vector 1 is assigned to C 1 while input vector 2 is assigned to C demonstrates that the additional information about the variations in the input signal enables the NSFLC to distinguish between data that have the same crisp input vector. The implication is the NSFLC has  X  X  X uzzy X  X  boundaries, as illustrated by the decision space plot in
Fig. 4 (a). In contrast, a singleton fuzzy classifier (SFLC) is only able to produce fixed boundaries as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The fuzzy boundary characteristic of a NSFLC would be very useful for problems where the various classes do not have clear boundaries. 3. Application to cardiac arrhythmias classification 3.1. Background information activity of the heart (cardiac) muscle as it is recorded from the body surface. Fig. 5 shows the various components of a typical ECG signal.
The P wave represents depolarization of the upper part of the heart, the atria, whereas the QRS complex represents ventricular depolar-ization and T wave represents ventricular repolarization. both life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, VF requires immediate defibrillation, whereas VT must be distin-guished from normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and VF to receive cardioversion, by delivering a shock of somewhat lower energy in synchronization with the heart beat. Critical cardiac incidents occur most often out of hospitals, therefore automatic external defibrillators(AED)wereintroducedforincreasingthesurvivalrate ( Kerber et al., 1997 ). Since the successful termination of VF and VT requires fast response and application of high-energy shocks in the heart region, the accuracy of the built-in algorithm for VF detection is of paramount importance. Therefore, the automated diagnosis must match the accuracy of specialists.

In the past, many algorithms based on time or frequency domain, or a combination of time and frequency techniques have been proposed for classifying cardiac arrhythmias. In general, time domain approaches have an advantage over frequency domain approaches because of their computational simplicity while the latter is more reliable in classifying VF and VT. The time domain features are usually known as the  X  X  X ualitative X  X  features. From the perspective of a medical practitioner, the  X  X  X ualitative X  X  features such as R X  X  interval (period) and amplitude of the QRS pulse are generally easier to understand rather than the frequency domain features. Unfortunately, the dynamics of the ECG signal is inher-ently noisy and therefore the extracted time domain features are uncertain. This is because the recorded ECG signal (especially surface ECG) is very sensitive to cable movement and muscle activity. In addition, the interference from electrical network can degrade the recording process. Although these artifacts can be reduced by filtering techniques, eliminating them is impossible. Compounding the problem, the feature extraction algorithm may be unreliable or imperfect. In the context of ECG QRS detection, the false detection of a peak is common when the noise amplitude approaches the R wave amplitude. Likewise, the probability of missing a peak is high when its level is relatively lower than the others. Both problems are common for VF and polymorphic VT signals. Due to the noisy ECG signals and the difficulties in extracting features, the problem of classifying NSR, VF and VT waveforms using time domain features is suitable for assessing the ability of the NSFLC for handling uncertainties. 3.2. Feature extraction The ECG data used in this study is obtained from MIT X  X IH Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia Database (VFDB) ( MIT/BIH Database Distribution, 2005 ). All signals are first preprocessed by a 0.05 X 40 Hz bandpass filter and a 60 Hz notch filter in order to suppress DC components, baseline drifts and possible electrical interference. The filtered ECG signal are transformed into the binary strings. The transformation algorithm used in this paper is a modified version of that in the paper ( Zhang et al., 1990 ). Unlike Zhang X  X  one-pass conversion, a two-pass conversion method is employed. The ECG signal will be transformed into partial binary string first instead of full binary string directly. This can reduce the false positive peak detection greatly by eliminating low amplitude signal. This step is closely followed by a full binary string conver-sion for determining a threshold that can maximize the differences between NSR class and VF/VT classes. The steps are listed as follows: 1. Select a finite length (i.e., 4 s) of ECG. Since the VFDB signals were digitized at 250 Hz, then there will be 1000 data points f x i j i  X  1 , 2 , ... , n ; n  X  1000 g within 4 s window length. 2. Mean-center ECG data where the mean data, x m is subtracted from every data point, i.e., { x i x m }. 3. Find out the negative peak, V n and positive peak V p . 4. Form a partial binary string: if the signal level falls in between the range of  X  0 o x i o 0 : 2 V p  X  or  X  0 : 2 V it is assigned  X  X 0 X  X . 5. Calculate the parameters N p and N n . N p denotes the number of data  X  x i 4 0  X  while N n  X  n N p . 6. Determine a proper threshold, T r to convert the partial binary string into a complete binary string: if N p o 0 : 15 n , then thresh-old is assigned as T r  X  0.7 V p , otherwise T r  X  0. This step is crucial to separate NSR signals from VF and VT signals. 7. Compare x i to T r to turn the partial binary string into a complete binary string, that is if x i r T r , then x i is assigned as  X  X 0 X  X  or otherwise  X  X 1 X  X .
 The graphs in Fig. 6 show the examples of three different types of
ECG signals with their corresponding binary sequences. Three features commonly used for ECG classification are extracted from the binary sequences: pulse width , pulse period and peak amplitude .
All parameters are averaged within the 4 s window and their standard deviations are calculated accordingly.
 The scatter plots of the extracted features are shown in Fig. 7 .
Analysis of the data shows that amplitude feature has less ambiguity, and therefore it is a better input candidate than the period feature. While amplitude information may result a clearer boundary ( Fig. 7 (b)), it is harder to extract as it is sensitive to baseline wanders. On the other hand, period information is easier to be extracted but the classification problem is more challenging because there are overlaps between the VF and VT classes as shown in Fig. 7 (a). To investigate the ability of the NSFLC to provide good classification performance using ambiguous data that is easier to extract, a comparative study using the four fuzzy classifiers is performed: 1. SFLC with pulse width and period as input features. 2. SFLC with pulse width and amplitude as input features. 3. NSFLC with pulse width and period as input features. 4. NSFLC with pulse width and amplitude as input features. 3.3. Structure of the fuzzy classifiers  X  X edium X , and  X  X arge X . Each antecedent fuzzy set is characterized by a Gaussian membership function. Gaussian membership function rather than triangular membership function were selected for two reasons. Firstly, the number of parameters to be evolved is smaller since a Gaussian membership function can be represented by two parameters(i.e., mean, m i and standard deviation, s i ) only,whereas a triangular membership function needs three parameters (i.e., left point, l i , center point, m i , and right point, r i ). As a result, the computation time can be reduced. Secondly, Gaussian membership function ensures the fuzzifier is always injective while the injec-tivity of triangular function fuzzifier is only assured when the sets
Voltage / mV 1199 1199.5 1200 1200.5 1201 Time / s intersect above a threshold. Injectivity is defined as the discrimina-tion of different values of the input variable, allowing an effective fuzzy processing ( Mitaim and Kosko, 2001 ). In the experiments,the
Gaussian membership function used for the non-singleton fuzzifier is symmetrical based on the assumption that the effect of noise is most likely to be equivalent on all points. (Describe the mean and standard deviation of the fuzzified input). The universe discourses of inputs are not normalized, but they are set to appropriate ranges according to the input values. Inferring from the data in Fig. 7 , the pulse period range is set to [100, 1000] ms, whereas the peak amplitude range is set to [0, 1.8] mV.

The Takagi X  X ugeno X  X ang (TSK) ( Kuncheva, 2000 ) classifier is utilised. This is also the structure being adopted by Li et al. (2005) . A set of nine fuzzy if X  X hen rules were constructed of the form:
IF x where j 1  X  j 2  X  {1,2,3} (small, medium, large), r  X  1, y ,9, and Class  X  {1, 2, 3, 4} (CT, NSR, VF, VT). The label CT implies that no decision can be reached for the interval and the patient should be referred forfurthertesting.Sincetherearenineoutputs,thelogicalproducts for each rule must be combined or inferred. The  X  X  X ax X  X in X  X  inference engine which takes the firing strengths of each rule and select the highest one is used as explained in Section 2. 3.4. Classifier training
This section discusses how the proposed fuzzy-based classifier isformulatedby using the GeneticAlgorithm(GA)approach,where the Gaussian membership functions and rule base are initially randomized, and being tuned simultaneously by GA. Shi et al. (1999) suggest that membership functions and rule base should be designed and evolved at the same time since both parameters are said to be co-dependent.

A GA starts off with a population of randomly generated chromosomes, and advances toward better chromosomes by applying genetic operators. The population undergoes evolution in a form of natural selection. During successive iterations, called generations, chromosomes in the population are rated for their adaptationas solutions,andonthebasisoftheseevaluations,anew populationofchromosomesisformedusing aselection mechanism and specific genetic operators (mutation and crossover). A fitness function is used to return a single numerical fitness of the individual in the population, which is supposed to be proportional to the utility or adaptation of the solution represented by that chromosome.

When designing a fuzzy system using a GA, the first important consideration is the representation strategy, that is how to encode the fuzzy system into the chromosome. In our design, there are two inputs and each of the input fuzzy variables ( x 1 and x 2 partitioned into three membership functions, therefore, resulting in 12 parameters. Assume the mean and standard deviation of the membership function is denoted by m j x i and s j x i , where i  X  1,2 and j  X  1,2,3. In addition, there are nine rules (3 3) in the rule-base, which resulting extra nine parameters, r n where n  X  1,2, 9 rules ) are needed to be tuned by GA. Each of the membership function parameters is encoded (genotype representation) into a 8-bit binary string, whereas each of the rule parameters is encoded into a 2-bit binary string. As a result, the total length of the binary string is 114 bits. The corresponding illustra tion of the chromosome structure is shown in Fig. 8 . However, all parameters must be decoded (phenotype representation) during fitness evaluation. The rule para-meters are decoded into integers range from 0 to 4. On the other hand, the membership function parameters are decoded into real numbers using linear mapping equation as shown below g where g p denotes the actual value of the q th parameter, A integer represented by a N-bit string gene, G q max and G user-defined upper and lower lim its of the gene, respectively.
The nextimportant considerationfollowing the representation is the choice of fitness function. A good fitness function can reflect the objective of the system. Unlike traditional gradient-based methods, GA X  X  can be used to evolve systems with any kind of fitness measurement functions including those that are nondifferentiable, discontinuous, etc. How to define the fitness evaluation function is totally problem dependent. Unlike for prediction and estimation problems which normally use mean-square error or absolute difference error related function, the number of correctly classified classes or misclassified classes are used for classification problems.
The proposed fitness function is as follows: fit  X  AC NSR  X  AC VF  X  AC VT 3  X  11  X  where AC denotes the percentage of correctly classified class.
After each of the chromosomes is evaluated and associated with a fitness, the current population undergoes the reproduction process to create the next generation of population. The  X  X  X ourna-ment with replacement X  X  selection scheme is used to determine the members of the new generation population. The purpose of selection mechanism is to focus the search process on the most promising regions of the search space. Variation operators (crossoverandmutation) playimportantroles inGA.They facilitate an efficientsearchand guide thesearch intonewregions. Crossover facilitates exploration, while mutation facilitates exploitation of the search space. The improvement in performance takes place over iterations in accord with some prescribed stopping criteria. 3.5. Results and discussions The performance of the genetically evolved NSFLC is tested on
VFDB database. The database consists of 22 half-hour surface ECG recordings of subjects who experienced episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and ventricular fibrilla-tion. The algorithm applies a signal window of 4 s. 60 records of
NSR, 60 records of VF and 60 records of VT were extracted as train data. Similarly, the same numbers of ECG data was extracted as test data. All data was extracted randomly according to the annotation of the database and they cover across multiple individuals.
In the experiment, single point crossover and bit-wise flipping mutation were adopted. For simplicity, the probabilities of cross-over and mutation are held constant for the entire run of the GA (200 iterations), which are 0.8 and 0.03, respectively.
Three performance measurements ( accuracy , sensitivity , and specificity ) are used to benchmark the classification systems.
Sensitivity is the probability that a test is positive, given that the person has the disease, whereas specificity is the probability that a testisnegative,giventhatthepersondoesnothavethedisease.The parameters are defined as follows: Sensitivity ; SE  X  TP TP  X  FN  X  12  X 
Specificity ; SP  X  TN TN  X  FP  X  13  X  where TP , TN , FP and FN are defined in Table 2 .

The results of the test are shown in Table 3 . Comparing the results for configurations 1 and 2, it may be concluded that using the amplitude as an input feature produced better accuracy than using the pulse period as a feature. By changing the input signal from period to amplitude, the singleton fuzzy classifier boosts the overall classification results (accuracy +6.66%, sensitivity +6.57%, and specificity +3.31%). Thus, the first hypothesis is proven to be true, that is, configuration 2 will outperform configuration 1.
Clearly, amplitude is a better alternative to pulse period as the classifier input. In fact, medical practitioners always observe amplitude information rather than period information when they want to determine the types of ventricular arrhythmias.
Period information could be unreliable because shorter pulse periodcouldberesultedfromexerciseactivityorpatient X  X emotion.
The structure of configuration 2 would be easier for medical practitioners to understand as it is more similar to the method they employ. Next, the results from configuration 3 show the superiority of using NSFLC. Both configurations 1 and 3 adopted pulse period as one of the inputs. Although results for the singleton input case shows that pulse period is inferior to amplitude as the input, NSFLC manages to handle most of the uncertainties and thus providing improvement over its singleton counterpart. The advan-tage of using NSFLC is even more apparent than using a more suitable sets of features. In addition, NSFLC still manages to enhance the classification capability when a better input is used (config. 4 vs. config. 2). Hence, the second hypothesis is also proven to be true. The results imply that singleton classifier has less degree of freedom or flexibility in classifying a more non-linearly separ-able set of data. Apart from that, a NSFLC provides the most advantages when features with more uncertainties are used as the input signal to a classifier. Small improvement may still be achieved when the input features have less uncertainties. In short,
NSFLC is proven to be a very useful tool in handling the uncertain-ties exist in pattern classification. The boxplot ( Fig. 9 ) shows the classification accuracies of using four different configurations for 10 runs. The boxplot reveals that configuration 1 yields the most inconsistent results throughout the iterations while others have comparable ranges of variances. In addition, the non-singleton structure also helps GA to converge to global maxima more frequent with the harder-to-classify feature in mind (configuration 1 vs. configuration 3).

Since other algorithms have been proposed for ventricular arrhythmia classification, it would be insightful to compare the obtained results to some existing algorithms. Table 4 shows that the proposed classification system is on a par with the existing algorithms. It should be noted that some of the algorithms used own recorded ECG database instead of public accessible ECG database. Even though Zhang and Thakor claim that they achieved very promising results with Complexity Measure and Sequential
Hypothesis algorithms in paper, ( Zhang et al., 1990; Thakor et al., 1990 ) respectively, some researchers like Ayesta et al. (2001) and
Chen et al. (1996) obtained much poorer results when they applied the aforementioned algorithms on the general ECG database. Chen claims that a database derived from defibrillator implantation studies is usually much more stable and rhythm specific in comparison to a general ECG database. Furthermore, MIT X  X IH database includes broader range of VT which includes both monomorphic and polymorphic types. Therefore, the classification result is very dependent on database selection. Among all tests using the MIT X  X IH(except for HurstIndex algorithmwith the same results), the proposed method achieved highest classification rates.
Next, the proposed algorithm uses the shortest window length (4.0 s) for feature extraction as compared to other algorithms as far as the performance is concerned. Algorithms in Zhang et al. (1990) , and Thakor et al. (1990) , Ayesta et al. (2001) , Chen et al. (1996) ,
Chowdhury and Ludeman (1994) , Ruiz et al. (2003) , Sun et al. (2005) have window lengths of 7.0, 8.0, 8.0, 20.0, 4.0, 4.8 and 5.5 s, respectively, to achieve their best results as shown in Table 4 .
Although Chowdhury and Ludeman (1994) has the same window length with the proposed method, the proposed method X  X  results are far superior. A shorter window length will allow for a shorter detection time, given that the computation time of the classifiers are equivalent. The proposed NSFLC only spends less than 0.05 ms to classify a set of extracted data, hence the computation time taken by the classifier is negligible as compared to the feature extractor. 4. Conclusion
A genetically evolved NSFLC for classifying ECG signals is presented. It was shown that NSFLC is capable of producing variable boundary which may be useful to overcome the fuzzy boundary between classes. Result shows that NSFLC consistently outper-formedits correspondingSFLCregardlessthetypesofinputfeatures, demonstrating that a NSFLC can better cope with fuzziness exists within the classifier framework. Good classification performance is achieved using a short window length (4.0 s) for feature extraction. This demonstrates the noise suppression capability of a NSFLC. References
