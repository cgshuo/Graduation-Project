In Chapter 18, A Feature Generation Algorithm with Applications to Biological Sequence Classification the authors present a general feature generation framework that integrates feature construction and feature selection in a flexible manner. The authors also show how this method can be used to build accurate sequence classifiers which have achieved improvements of up to 10.6%.

The authors explain that using the feature generation approach, they were able to identify the most useful set of features of each type, which have also shown a propensity to describe biologically significant functional elements.
The authors argue that the presented algorithm could be applied to more complex feature types and other sequence pre-diction tasks, such as translation starsite prediction, protein sequence classification problems, etc.
Chapter 19, An Ensemble Method for Identifying Robust Features for Biomarker Discovery starts by explaining what a bio-marker is and its usefulness for diagnostic or prognostic test.

In this chapter the authors present an ensemble framework for feature selection for building classifiers with wide data. In this framework features that are selected often, that result in accurate classifiers, and that are part of small feature sets are considered more robust and are favoured by the weighted voting function.

Using widely studied ovarian cancer datasets; the authors demonstrate that the features selected by their method give very high classification rates and reproducible results with new data.

In Chapter 20, Model Building and Feature Selection with Genomic Data the authors present the elastic net as being a novel shrinkage and selection method for producing a sparse model with good prediction accuracy.

The authors argue it enjoys great computational efficiency with the help of efficient path algorithms and that the algo-rithm is in many ways a more appropriate tool for variable selection with high-dimensional data than lasso. The chapter presents working applications of the method in regression and classification problems.

Overall the book presents state-of-the-art research by leading experts in a variety of fields within feature selection, in a readable way which would surely be of much use to most researchers.

Conquest in Cyberspace, M.C. Libicki. Cambridge University Press, New York (2007). 336 pp., $27.99, ISBN-13: 9780521692144  X  X  X onquest in Cyberspace X  is an attempt to examine the strategic implications of cyberspace. The author, Dr. Martin C.
Libicki, focuses on a  X  X  X ard power versus soft power X  argument as he tackles the very broad and technically complex area of net-centric operations. Throughout the book, the author contends that  X  X  X ard power X  or hostile actions in cyberspace are less effective and less permanent than soft power or persuasive actions.

This theme is the focal point of the book. Starting with a chapter on hostile action in cyberspace, Dr. Libicki discusses the effect of deception or noise in net-centric operations. Subsequent chapters examine the opportunities and challenges to col-laborate and form coalitions in cyberspace. The bulk of the book X  X  material is contained in the chapters that explore the costs and benefits of friendly conquests in cyberspace.

The introduction to  X  X  X onquest in Cyberspace X  indicates that Dr. Libicki sought to provide an exploration of  X  X  X he potential and limitations of information warfare. X  Having read that, I expected the book to discuss the strategic implications of cyber environment and especially to highlight the differences between the warfare in a virtual world vice a real world. In the end, however, the author comes short of both goals for several reasons.

The first, and I believe most important, shortcoming of this book is that it never discusses the possible strategic objectives of an information warfare campaign in cyberspace. There is no identification of who is contending for cyberspace and what their objectives might be. The author deals with the topic in a very abstract manner and never discusses the influences of organized crime, non-state terrorists, and state-sponsored intelligence agencies as adversaries or allies in cyberspace.
The overwhelming use of dated references is the second shortcoming with this book. With the exception of the appendix, most references pre-date 2002 and, therefore, do not discuss more recent developments. Cyber conflicts staged during the
Kosovo air war, information campaigns by Islamic jihadists, or any of the recent examples of politically-motivated cyber con-flict such as the denial of service attacks against Estonia are notably absent.

This indication is reinforced by the author X  X  constant use historical anecdotes, some dating from World War I. These vign-ettes show how Dr. Libicki attempts to map linear military goals and objectives to the asymmetric, global cyber environ-ment. Perhaps because of this approach, the book never attempts to look at any new modes of conducting a cyberspace campaign or any trends that might indicate growing threats.

While  X  X  X onquest in Cyberspace X  succeeds in making an argument for the application of soft power or friendly conquest, its lack of current material and new insights hinder its usefulness in understanding the strategic potential and limitations of information war in cyberspace. As a result, I would not recommend this book for strategic information systems or informa-tion operations planners.

Ethnography for Marketers: A Guide to Consumer Immersion, Hy Mariampolski, Sage Publications (2006). $43.95, ISBN: 0-7619-6947-0
The field of marketing research is of great importance to the development of companies. It is characterized by a concen-tration on the understanding of consumers X  behaviors and preference and aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies are adopted in this field.
This book, Ethnography for Marketers, is intended to be a handbook introducing the methodology of ethnography, a meth-od of qualitative research, to marketing practitioners, marketing researchers, students, behavior scientists, and other researchers who are interested in studying the interaction between consumers and products.

This book comprising 26 chapters is divided into two parts. The first part addresses the background, concepts and overall orientation of an ethnography study in marketing research. The second part addresses details of conducting an ethnography study on site visits and how to report the results of the study.

The first part of the book has 10 chapters covering two major themes, namely why ethnography is suitable for marketing research and how to manage an ethnography marketing project in general. The author explored issues such as the  X  X ower of ethnography X  in marketing research by identifying the unique advantages of ethnography over traditional qualitative and survey research practice. The authors did not pay much of attention or give much detailed information about ethnography, but rather they emphasized the fact that ethnography could help marketers gain deep insights into consumers X  behavior and preferences by taking into consideration the influences of culture, context and languages. The author enumerated a few examples of the new marketing ethnography, which make the advantages of ethnography in discovering consumers X  behav-ior more convincing. As a result, the readers formulated a concrete profile about the reasons why choosing ethnography, a time consuming and high cost methodology. The author also noticed that ethnography is not always the right tool. So before the author proceeded to introduce the details of conducting ethnography marketing study, he recommended that whether ethnography is appropriate or not for the project should be determined, and several criterions have been provided. However, the author failed to distinguish between ethnography and case study because the criterions the author advocated could be met by both ethnography and case study. The author gave an overview of the implementation of an ethnography project, from client brief, scheduling, participant recruiting, and orientation to logistics in the field.

The second part of the book consists of 16 chapters covering the themes of conducting site visits, data collection and anal-ysis and reporting. Site visit is the most important stage of an ethnography study since it is a stage where researchers spend most of the time (2 X 6 weeks). Compared to traditional  X  X iving with the tribe X  ethnography studies, issues encountered by ethnography marketers are similar. The issues include gaining access to the locations, respecting the right and privacy of participants, cultivating rapport with participants, observing fairly and dispassionately, etc. The author divided the process of site visit into five stages. They are the introductory stage, role-taking and rapport-building stage, general question stage, specific questions and activities stage and closing stage. Of these five stages, the author paid special attention to developing
