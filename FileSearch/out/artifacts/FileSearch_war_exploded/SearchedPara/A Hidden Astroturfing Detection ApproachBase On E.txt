 With the development of internet technologies create a emerging career Astro-turfing which becomes a hot research topic recent years. In most cases, the hired groups and individuals support arguments or claims for their employers favor while challenging critics and denying adverse claims [1]. In order to prevent these unfair or even illegal situations, studying the detection and identification of astroturfing is necessary. As we know that confrontation is very important in the context of astroturfing.  X  X onfrontation X  refers to the confrontation that as-troturfing against existing variety of water military identification and detection technologies. Avoiding public found its abnormal behaviors to achieve the pur-pose of controlling public opinions. If astroturfing is identified, the accounts used will be cancelled by sites. It will be very costly to re-register accounts as well as reduce its credibility. So astroturfing will be extremely focus on  X  X oncealment X  when they take actions. While,  X  X motion X  has closely relationship with  X  X on-cealment X  in the context of astroturfing. Astroturfing can add negative feedback to the review of high praised goods, or in contrast add positive feedback to the review of low praised goods. The way like this is the mainstream of astroturfing, while is easy to be found. However, if astroturfing give a good rating to high praised product and a negative review in text comment, in this way they can take control of public opinion in the prerequisite of making sure that can not be found easily. This behavior is different from the main way of astroturfing acting, but in order to be  X  X oncealment X , this does a trend of astroturfing. The behavior which contrary to emotional like this is a important clue in hidden astroturfing setection. Serval relevant works [10] [6] [11] in this area have some shortcomings, we can make a summary as follow: As many works in this field either focus on opinion mining or unfair ratings detection only, haven X  X  pay attention to the relationship between both side. This paper mainly focus on this inconsistent to identify the abnormal astroturfing behavior. tion. With the rapid development of e-commerce, more and more users begin to shopping online which increase the scale of user data set. For the data set like this, processing efficiency naturally become the focus of our attention. Therefore, how to deal with the big data set, and detect the abnormal astroturfing behavior quickly become the research topic of this paper.
 works have been done which include: on the processing of data using several basic features of astroturfing to do filtering of original users X  data recording, removing the redundant data to reduce the amount of data processed later, using the machine learning method SVM to take emotion classification which can reduce the processing time, and setting matching rules to do quickly matching between user comment emotion and rating.
 architecture in this paper. Section 4 will describe in detail the implementation of each functional module contained in the architecture proposed in this paper. Section 5 gives the experiment and evaluation of this paper. And the last section will be the conclusion of this paper. As review opinion is content feature of astroturfing, while rating belong to the category of behavior feature, so the method proposed in this paper is to use multiple feature to take the detection of astroturfing. This section briefly surveys some works in the related field, including works that use multiple features to do the detection of abnormal users, extract opinion from reviews, unfair ratings detection and review spam detection. Meanwhile introduce the unique work of this paper, and make comparison with others.
 multiple feature to do detection of astroturfing existing a lot of works. Jiang et al. take advantage of behavior-based method and content-based method to do the astroturfing detection [4]. Ghosh and Vismanat combine content-based method and structure-based method together to take the detection [3].
 of opinion mining, there are serval works to deal with the problem of extracting positive or negative opinions from product reviews [7] [9]. These works achieve opinion extraction of reviews, they can not make a detection of astroturfing through the emotion extracted.
 addressed the trustworthiness of reviews. Meanwhile Dellarocas et al. proposed and evaluated a set of mechanisms which can eliminate or significantly reduce the effects of unfair ratings [2].
 above consider the serious impact of dishonest ratings, and propose detection approach to deal with this problem. However do not give a directly detection to review spam activities.
 well studied. Nitin Jindal et al. give a first attempt in studying opinion spam in reviews, and first identify three types of spam [5]. However, this work haven X  X  pay attention to the relationship between reviews X  opinion and ratings. This paper focus on emotion-based astroturfing detection, propose a hidden as-troturfing detection method based on the clue that review opinion inconsistent with rating. Comparing with works discussed above, our method not only can detect review opinion, consider unfairness of users X  rating, but also can connect emotion with rating together as a clue to take detection of astroturfing. As shown in Figure 1 is the schematic representation of architecture. The pro-posed emotion-based astroturfing detection method architecture is mainly divid-ed into the following functional modules: data crawling module, pre-processing module, bag-of-word establish module,emotion mining and analysis module and matching module.
 al module contained in the architecture proposed in this paper, and show how to achieve the purpose that take hidden detection of astroturfing while improve the accuracy of emotion classification. 3.1 Data Preparation Taobao is the largest e-commerce platform in China, as the governance of Taobao in the field of e-commerce, in order to keep a invincible position under the severe business competition, companies use astroturfing to achieve their own purpose has become a well-known  X  X ecret X . Hence we choose this site as the data source for our experiment.
 purpose, we programming to crawl a data set from this site, which contain user and product attributes as follows: (a) users X  text comments; (b) star rating; (c) user ID; (d) product shop id; (e) comment time. 3.2 Pre-processing Operations We take several pre-processing steps to the original data set before we use it.  X  Removal of unpopular products: We just focus on the product that attract e- X  Removal of system default comment: The evaluation system of Taobao is  X  Filtering based on statistical analyze: We carry out a statistical analysis of 3.3 Bag-of-word Module Construction For the bag-of-word construction, we first need to extract user comments to create a data set D comment which used as database in this step. As there is no separation between words in Chinese naturally, so for the first step of this phase is to do sentences segmentation in D comment . The Chinese word segmentation system used in this paper is ICTCLAS (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical Analysis System), which own a high performance and accuracy. choose CHI [14] to do the selection. This method is used to measure the statistical correlation strength between the feature t j and the document category C j , and assume that the  X  2 distribution with first-order degrees of freedom id satisfied between t j and C j . The higher  X  2 a feature own the more information it contains, and the greater the feature correlation with this class. CHI is calculated as follow: longs to class C i ; B indicates the number of documents that contain the features t but not belongs to category C j ; C indicates the number of documents belong to class C j but not including feature t j ; D indicates the number of documents that do not belong to category C j and do not contain the feature t j . With this method, we can achieve better classification result by reducing more than 85% feature dimension.
 the bag-of-word model, which can transform each sentence in D comment into a vector for the following operation. Let { f 1 ,...,f m } generated above be the m feature vectors that appear in D comment , let n i ( s ) be the number of times that f appears in the sentence s contained in D comment . Then each sentence s can be represented as a vector 3.4 Emotion Mining and Analysis Emotion mining and analysis can be transformed to classification problem, so we can use machine learning method to solve this task. Meanwhile, the prerequisite for using this method is the preparation for training and testing set. generated manually into two parts: one for training, the other used as testing. classes: Positive(P), Negative(N). The reason why we choose to split it into two categories is that in [10] author proves when divided like this can achieve highest precision. Each class of emotion is described as follow: 1. Positive, if the sentence express a positive emotion in general. For example, 2. Negative, if the sentence express a negative emotion in general. For example, ing method in classification task which are Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Maximum Entropy. As the comparison Pang et al. do among these three approaches [7], SVM obtain the highest accuracy. Therefore, we choose SVM to implement the opinion mining.
 divide samples into two categories simply, but to search for the hyperplane that maximizes the margin. The solution can written as where  X  j can be obtained by solving a optimization problem, c j  X   X  1 , +1 rep-resented as the positive and negative samples, and s j is the support vector. we classify the experimental data with the trained classifier to predict their emotional categories. 3.5 Matching In order to take identification of astroturfing, we set rules to do the matching after opinion mining of users X  comments. To the purpose of matching user X  X  review and rating, rules proposed in this paper are as follow: paper we use this method to do the mapping between users X  comment emotion and corresponding scores, output the hidden astorturfing user ID in the end. 3.6 Summary Using functional modules described above, the algorithm HDM proposed in this paper can be summarized as follow.
 output L ID is the collection whose owner is astroturfing. In the first part, D remunpopular is the data set remove unpopular products, and D remdefault rep-resents the data set that remove all system default comments. In the second part of this algorithm, using segmentation system on D new get the word list L word , then using it transform sentence in D new to vector that get D which used later. sentence. In the last part, we set rules to do the matching between emotion and rating, output the incompatible user ID.
 while improve the accuracy of emotion classification. In this section, we introduce the experimental preparation phase at first. Fur-thermore, in the second part we identified hidden astroturfing in accordance with the new clue proposed in this paper that user comment emotion is inconsistent with the rating.
 respectively. 4.1 Experiment Setup The experiment setup consists of the following steps: 1. To crawl the data set, we use multiple severs which set up on cloud to do 2. In this paper, we choose traditional SVM as baseline methods to evaluate 3. The corpus is generated randomly according to the proportion of the number 4. In this paper, we use the ROC curve to evaluate the classification accuracy 4.2 Evaluation Result For this part, we introduce the result of this experiment in detail.

 cessing. In this paper, we generate ten analysis charts in total as follows. For each graph, we analyze the change in the number of product reviews over time, and can found that the number of comments is sparse or dense within a cer-tain time threshold. Therefore, we can filter the user comments according to the characteristic of astroturfing that within a short period of time the number of comments increasing rapidly, meanwhile only choose reviews which fall in the area that the number of reviews exceeds threshold we set under unit period of time.
 different threshold to the number of reviews and comment time for filtering purpose. In this way, we can get the result which is most consistent with each product on the basis of the actual situation. Meanwhile, the original crawling data set can ba filtered to reduce the number of data which processed later. Table 1 shows quantity comparison before and after pre-processing to the original data set, we can found that nearly 20% of the original data.
 paper, we examine the accuracy of text emotion classification, and make com-parison of AUC between HDM proposed in this paper and traditional SVM method.
 for HDM is 0.9248, and the AUC value for traditional SVM is 0.8820. This result shows that HDM proposed in this paper can achieve better accuracy than traditional SVM. In other words, the pre-processing module can delete redundant data effectively, and improve accuracy of emotion classification.

 been discovered which user review sentiment is inconsistent with their rating. As shown in Figure 4 is the interface of experimental output system, we can Processing Time , ROC Curve . In processing time , is the processing time required for this experiment in total. In ROC curve gives an accuracy evaluation of the text emotion classification. And in detection result , we give the astroturfing user records discovered by our method, which contain the following attributes: (a) Shop ID, (b) User ID, (c) Comment Time, (d) User Rating, (d) User Comment. As we can see that all these text comments are indeed negative review, while the user give a high rating. Obviously are the hidden astroturfing we want to detect.
 our study can deal with the original experiment data efficiently. Moreover, with the HDM method proposed in this paper which work by the combination of all modules, not only can improve the overall processing speed of the algorithm, but also can increase the accuracy of comment emotion classification. Achieving the purpose that take detection of hidden astroturfing whose comment emotion is inconsistent with rating based on emotion analysis.
 In this paper, we focus on the detection of hidden astroturfing based on emotion analysis, the aspects included in this research can be summarized as follows: one is to combine the mining of reviews X  emotion and their ratings together, focus on a new astroturfing characteristic that user comments emotion is inconsistent with ratings, and use this to do the detection of hidden astroturfing; the other one is the study of how to carry out this detection rapidly.
 lem which can improve the accuracy of emotion classification while ensuring the rapid detection. This is because in the pre-processing stage, we remove the sys-tem default comment and unpopular products comment, meanwhile do filtering with the basic features of astroturfing on the original users X  data recording. In this way, we can eliminate the redundant data, and make the training set used for machine learning later more effectively. Furthermore, we construct the cor-pus manually for emotion classification, therefore we can improve the accuracy of classification compared with the baseline method TDM used in this paper. For our future work, we will explore and study more hidden astroturfing behavior characteristics and propose mechanism to do detection.
