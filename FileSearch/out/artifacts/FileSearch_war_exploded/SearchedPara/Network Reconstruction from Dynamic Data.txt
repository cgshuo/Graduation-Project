 Over the past decade, many powerful data mining tech-niques have been developed to analyze temporal and sequen-tial data. The time is now fertile for addressing problems of larger scope under the purview of temporal data mining. The fourth SIGKDD workshop on temporal data mining focused on the question: What can we infer about the struc-ture of a complex dynamical system from observed temporal data? The goals of the workshop were to critically evaluate the need in this area by bringing together leading researchers from industry and academia, and to identify promising tech-nologies and methodologies for doing the same. We provide a brief summary of the workshop proceedings and ideas aris-ing out of the discussions.

 Keywords: temporal data mining, network reconstruction. Established in 2001, the SIGKDD workshop series on tem-poral data mining (TDM) is aimed at inferring patterns from large databases that contain either explicit or implicit temporal information. Over the past decade, many power-ful data mining techniques have been developed to analyze temporal and sequential data. The time is now fertile for addressing problems of larger scope under the purview of temporal data mining. The fourth SIGKDD workshop on temporal data mining hence focused on the question: What can we infer about the structure of a complex dynamical system from observed temporal data? This topic of recon-structing system dynamics from sequential data traces is an important one in many areas: In all these applications, the aim is to construct the underly-ing system model (reflecting connectivity, hierarchy, and/or strength of influences) from observed time-indexed discrete symbol sequences (and, sometimes, continuous-valued mea-surements). In many of the areas mentioned above, there are isolated pieces of work (see for example, [1], [2]) begin-ning to appear. A special area of interest to the organiz-ers is neuroscience, where this approach can help discover neural codes and facilitate the creation of brain-computer interfaces [3].
 The fourth SIGKDD (half-day) workshop on temporal data mining served as a forum to discuss network reconstruction as a concerted theme, critically evaluate the need in this area by bringing together leading researchers from industry and academia, and identify technologies and methodologies that worked (and didn X  X ) in specific application contexts. Invited speakers included Vijay Nair (University of Michigan), Bud Mishra (New York University), C. Lee Giles (Penn State University), and Vinod Sharma (Indian Institute of Science). In addition, the organizers contributed two papers as back-ground work. The workshop also featured the release of a challenge dataset from computational neuroscience that em-bodied multiple facets of network reconstruction. As evidenced by the invited talks, network reconstruction re-surfaces in multiple contexts: network tomography (Nair and Sharma), social networks (Giles), and bioinformatics (Mishra). There are interesting challenges in collecting and analyz-ing data from computer and communication networks for the purpose of assessing and monitoring quality of service characteristics. The talk by Nair X  X  X omputer and com-munications networks: assessing and monitoring quality of service X  X  X ave an overview of the field of network tomogra-phy, with particular mention of two classes of network to-mography problems and related research on network mon-itoring. The basic idea is to send test probes from source nodes to destination nodes, observe end-to-end latency and loss characteristics, and use this information to infer in-dividual link characteristics. In passive network tomogra-phy, we require  X  X uy-in X  from the network nodes, whereas in active network tomography, we use unicast or multicast schemes to estimate internal network characteristics. Most of the research in network tomography assumes that the log-ical topology is known but newer work focuses on restricted classes of topologies and solves identifiability problems in the chosen contexts. These and other ideas were covered in detail in Nair X  X  talk. Following this introduction, the talk by Sharma X  X  Estimating traffic intensities in a communica-tion network via active network tomography X  X  X urther de-veloped network tomography problems and analyzed opti-mal (in space and time) power transmission policies, and characterized many tradeoffs underlying inference in com-munication system design. The increasing amount of communication between individ-uals in e-formats (e.g. email, instant messaging and the web) has motivated computational research in social net-work analysis (SNA). Previous work in SNA has emphasized the social network (SN) topology measured by communica-tion frequencies while ignoring the semantic information in SNs. The talk by Giles X  X  X robabilistic models for discover-ing temporal semantic social networks X  X  X roposed two gen-erative Bayesian models for semantic community discovery in SNs, combining probabilistic modeling with community detection in SNs. To simulate the generative models, an EnFGibbs sampling algorithm was proposed to address the efficiency and performance problems of traditional methods. Experimental studies on Enron email corpus showed that this approach successfully detected the communities of indi-viduals and in addition provides semantic topic descriptions of these communities. The talk by Mishra X  X  X emembrance of experiments past: analyzing time course datasets to discover complex tempo-ral invariants X  X  X ocused on reconstructing networks that ex-plain gene expression signatures underlying temporal datasets. Current microarray data analysis techniques draw the biolo-gist X  X  attention to targeted sets of genes but do not otherwise present global and dynamic perspectives (e.g., invariants) in-ferred collectively over a dataset. Such perspectives are im-portant in order to obtain a process-level understanding of the underlying cellular machinery; especially how cells react, respond, and recover from environmental changes. Mishra described GOALIE (Gene-Ontology for Algorithmic Logic and Invariant Extractor), a novel computational approach and software system that uncovers formal temporal logic models of biological processes from time course microarray datasets. GOALIE  X  X edescribes X  data into the vocabulary of biological processes and then pieces together these re-descriptions into a Kripke-structure model, where possible worlds encode transcriptional states and are connected to future possible worlds. Such a model then supports various query, inference, and comparative assessment tasks, besides providing descriptive process-level summaries. The paper by Fernandez et al. X  X  X econstructing Partial Or-ders from Linear Extensions X  X  X osed network reconstruction as a problem of recovering partial order descriptions of se-quential traces (linear extensions). In addition to giving complexity bounds for specific classes of problems, the pa-per presented a general framework to pose and study various inference tasks, and algorithmic results for mining restricted classes of posets. The paper by Patnaik et al. X  X  X iscovering Network Patterns in Microelectrode Array Data X  X  X resented analysis techniques that can unearth interesting regularities involving combinations of neurons from multi-electrode ar-ray (MEA) data. MEA recording is a relatively new experi-mental technique in neurobiology for studying simultaneous activity of groups of neurons. Patnaik et al show, through simulations, that by combining discovery of different types of episodes with suitable temporal constraints, one can dis-cover the network structures and connectivity patterns of the neurons constituting the network. The synthetic dataset released at the workshop was intended to resemble spike sorted, simultaneously recorded, multi-neuronal data. Five different acyclic connectivity patterns were  X  X lanted X  in the dataset using a data generation model based on frequent episode discovery. Essentially, we begin with 26 neurons in the network, labeled A-Z. The neurons are first randomly interconnected with the weight of the con-nection uniformly distributed in [  X  1 , 1]. After that, one or more patterns are introduced by modifying the appropri-ate interconnection weights. Interestingly, the talk by Bud Mishra presented a successful mining of this dataset (based on the GOALIE approach) to reconstruct the planted pat-terns! We hope that this dataset will help seed further re-search in network reconstruction. Network reconstruction from dynamic data is a fertile data mining problem; there are many important application ar-eas besides those studied at the workshop, such as chemical reaction modeling and epidemiology. It is anticipated that the proceedings of this workshop will help seed further con-solidation of network reconstruction research and contribute to a core body of algorithms, software, and datasets.
