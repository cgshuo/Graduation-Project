 Previous anti-spamming algorithms based on link structure suffer from either the weakness of the page value metric or the vagueness of the seed selection. In this paper, we propose two page value metrics, AVRank and HVRank. These two  X  X alues X  of all the web pages can be well assessed by using the bidirectional links X  infor-mation. Moreover, with the help of bidirectional links, it becomes easier to enlarge the propagation coverage of seed sets. We further discuss the effectiveness of the combination of these two metrics, such as the quadratic mean of them. Our experimental results show that with such two metrics, our method can filter out spam sites and identify reputable ones more effectively than previous algorithms such as TrustRank.

Link spamming is the most nasty adversary among all the spam-ming artifices [5]. To combat the rampant link spamming tricks, many link-based anti-spamming techniques have been proposed so far. TrustRank [6] assumes that good web pages seldom point to bad ones. Therefore good pages can propagate their trust via their outgoing links. On the other hand, some approaches hold the phi-losophy that a page should be penalized for pointing to bad pages.

AV Rank ( p ) =  X  HV Rank ( p ) =  X  where ON ( q i ) is the outlink number of page q i and IN ( r i ) is the inlink number of page r i . The parameters  X  ( 0  X   X   X  1 ) and  X  ( 0  X   X   X  1 ) in the formulas denote the ratios of each part.
The AVRank and HVRank are regressed to the authority and hub scores in HITS when assigning  X  = 0 and  X  = 1. Therefore the HITS algorithm is a special case of ours. The proof of their com-putation convergence is given in [19].
It is well known that the PageRank has a good explanation through the  X  X andom surfer model X  [12]. However, this model cannot depict most of users X  browsing behavior nowadays. Instead of following hyperlinks, users often bounce back with  X  X ack button X  on browser and choose a new page randomly. Marcin Sydow uses this  X  X an-dom surfer with back step X  model [13] to improve the PageRank algorithm. It is called  X  X ack-and-forth X  model in our research. Our new metrics can well match the  X  X ack-and-forth X  model. According to formula (A.4) in Appendix A in [19]:
AVRank = [  X  M T + ( 1  X   X  )  X  M T  X  N T +
The first part  X  M T corresponds to random visit. It happens at the probability of  X  . The second part is ( 1  X   X  )  X  M T  X  N T . The product of matrix M T and N T is still a column-stochastic matrix and the element M T N T [ i page p i to p j by first backing to previous page from page p i and then clicking page p j . According to  X  X ack-and-forth X  surfer model, the probability of this kind of visit is ( 1  X   X  )  X  . The remaining parts can be explained in the same way with the  X  X ack-and-forth X  model.
As mentioned above, seed selection is of significant importance for these biased PageRank algorithms to combat web spamming. In this section, we will discuss how to select the seeds based on the web structure so as to maximize the seed propagation coverage.
The first problem we need to concern about a seed set is its prop-agation ability, i.e., what percentage of pages or sites can be cov-ered from a seed set. In fact, the propagation coverage of a seed set is determined by web graph structure to some extent. From previ-ous work [10] and our experiments, the web graph can be shown as that in Figure 1, which includes IN, OUT, SCC, Tendrils (including Tunnels) and ISLANDs. The WCC (weakly connected component) consists of all of the parts except ISLANDs.

In general, selecting reputable sites carefully as seeds to form a small seed set is a widely used method. As we know, most famous and reputable sites are in SCC. However, when we only choose those sites located in SCC as seeds, the seed set propagation cover-age is actually fated: SCC and OUT if propagating by outlinks, or SCC and IN if propagating by inlinks. Table 1 shows the compar-ison among different methods, which indicates bidirectional links really help. In practice, sites located in some main ISLANDs as well as those in SCC can be selected as seeds to maximize the prop-agation coverage.

Choosing the large seed set is timesaving. 9 and 14 large seed set which is named as L in the experiments.
 We use Kendall X  X - X  correlation to measure the similarity between AVRank/HVRank and PageRank when varying the values of  X  and  X  . At last we choose  X  =  X  = 0 only embodies symmetry, but also has a sound visit explanation.
We have four prevalent forms for the mean values of AVRank and HVRank: Table 2: Kendall X  X - X  correlation between different mean values and PageRank Kendall X  X - X  0.95 0.51 0.52 0.50 The Kendall X  X - X  correlation coefficient of each mean and Page-Rank are all considered. As shown in Table 2, the result of arith-metic mean is very close to PageRank, while the other three are almost at same level. When manually checking the top results, we find that the result of quadratic mean is better than the other three. Therefore quadratic mean is chosen as our combination method of AVRank and HVRank in the following experiments.
The propagation coverage of TrustRank and our method with the two seed sets is given in Table 3. Sn ( s ) denotes the number of sites that can be covered from seed set s . Compared with the propagation coverage using the small seed set X , the improvement of using L is not so remarkable. The reason is there are so many tiny islands in our data set, which inevitably limit the propagation of seeds.
Quadratic Mean 230857 (64.44%) 238015 (66.44%)
In order to compare the ability of anti-spamming, a set of sample sites with known types is needed. A sample of 1000 sites which can give enough information and still be manageable is settled. Using a method similar to that in TrustRank [6], a list of sites in descending order of their PageRank scores is generated and segmented into 20 buckets. Each of the buckets contains a different number of sites with scores summing up to 5 percent of the total PageRank score. We construct a sample set of 1000 sites by selecting 50 sites at ran-dom from each bucket. Then we perform a manual evaluation to determine their categories. Each site is classified into one of the following categories: reputable, spam, pure directory, and personal blog. A sample site who uses any spamming techniques is put in set can do the job well enough. In this scenario, it does not help when combining a bad seed set, especially a small one. However, we believe a large bad seed set of  X  X igh quality X  is undoubtedly useful for combating spam.
In this paper, we propose two new metrics, AVRank and HVRank, to measure a page X  X  value. By emploiting the bidirectional links, these two metrics can work more effectively. We also analyze the shortcoming of small seed sets and demonstrate that using a large seed set can achieve a better performance. In addition, choos-ing a large number of seeds automatically is actually easier than choosing a small number of seeds manually and carefully. The ex-perimental results show that our proposed method performs better than TrustRank, especially with the quadratic mean of AVRank and HVRank.
 Actually AVRank/HVRank can be used other than anti-spamming. For example, we find it is more reasonable when using these two metrics to rank the Wikipedia pages. We believe it can also be used in common page ranking after removing the irrelevant links. These problems are left as our future work. [1] L. Becchetti, C. Castillo, D. Donato, S.
