Expert finding is a rapidly developing Information Re-trieval task and a popular research domain. The opportunity of search for knowledgeable people in the scope of an orga-nization or world-wide is a feature which makes modern En-terprise search systems commercially successful and socially demanded. A number of efficient expert finding approaches was proposed recently. Despite that most of them are based on theoretically sound measures of expertness, they still use rather unrealistic and oversimplified principles. In our re-search we try to avoid these limitations and come up with models that go beyond the assumptions used in state-of-the-art expert finding methods.

The fundamental principle of existing approaches to ex-pert finding is to infer expertise by analyzing the co-occurr-ence of personal identifiers and query terms in the scope of top ranked documents. While, the degree of co-occurrence of a person with topical terms is a reasonable evidence of personal expertness, the assumption about their indepen-dent occurrence seems not so adequate. In our methods, we consider that the occurrence of terms in the document is not independent from the presence of a candidate expert and vice versa. In one model, we regard people as genera-tors of the expertise accumulated in the top retrieved doc-uments. We extract their topic-specific personal language models that are further matched to a query [1]. In another model we simply assume that the responsibility of a person for the content of a document depends on its position in a document with respect to positions of the query terms and then just aggregate scores of documents related to a person for measuring personal expertness [3].

Suppose we still assume the independence of persons and terms in a document when measuring their co-occurrence. In this case we would in fact model the manual search for expertise by representing it as the following probabilistic process. The user selects a document among the ones ap-pearing in the initial ranking, looks through the document, enlists all candidate experts mentioned in it and refers with the current information need to one of them. The proba-bility of selecting a document is its probabilistic relevance score since the user will most probably search for useful in-formation and contacts of knowledgeable people in one of the top documents recommended by a search engine. The described process can be interpreted as a one-step relevance probability propagation from documents to related candidate experts. However, the one-step probabilistic process is not quite a realistic model of a real-world user behavior. It is not likely that reading only one document and consulting only one person is enough to completely satisfy a personal information need in the enterprise. In our method, we also rely on the model of manual search for an expert, but in contrast to existing approaches, we do not assume that the user stops after the first step of moving from a selected doc-ument to the found candidate expert. We model multi-step relevance probability propagation from documents to candi-date experts by means of K-step, infinite [2] or absorbing random walks [4]. We also show how we may benefit from adding direct organizational links among candidate experts.
Both approaches and the current state of expert finding research raise questions which we are going to address in our future work. Particularly, several promising directions are to be followed to extend the proposed solutions. While the assumption of dependence among persons and terms suppos-edly approximates the reality better, there are more ways to make it less straightforward. For instance, we may also as-sume the dependence between persons in a document. When we represent the expert finding task as a problem of rank-ing on graphs, some improvements specific to graph-based models seem rather appropriate. For example, new entities (e.g. dates, images, events) can be introduced into graphs in order to find new indirect associations among candidates and documents and hence better model the relevance flow.
