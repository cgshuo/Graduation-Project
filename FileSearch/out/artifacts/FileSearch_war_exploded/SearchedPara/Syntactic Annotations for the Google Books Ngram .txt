 The Google Books Ngram Corpus (Michel et al., 2011) has enabled the quantitative analysis of lin-guistic and cultural trends as reflected in millions of books written over the past five centuries. The corpus consists of words and phrases (i.e., ngrams) and their usage frequency over time. The data is available for download, and can also be viewed through the interactive Google Books Ngram Viewer at http://books.google.com/ngrams .

The sheer quantity of and broad historical scope of the data has enabled a wide range of analyses (Michel et al., 2011; Ravallion, 2011). Of course, examining raw ngram frequencies is of limited util-ity when studying many aspects of linguistic change, particularly the ones related to syntax. For instance, most English verbs are regular (their past tense is formed by adding -ed), and the few exceptions, known as irregular verbs, tend to regularize over the centuries (Lieberman et al., 2007). Figure 1 illus-trates how burned gradually overtook burnt , becom-ing more frequent around 1880. Unfortunately, as a study of verb regularization, this analysis is skewed by a significant confound: both words can serve as either verbs (e.g., the house burnt ) or adjectives (e.g., the burnt toast ). Because many words have multiple syntactic interpretations, such confounds often limit the utility of raw ngram frequency data. In this work we provide a new edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus that contains over 8 million books, or 6% of all books ever published (cf. Section 3). Moreover, we include syntactic anal-ysis in order to facilitate a fine-grained analysis of the evolution of syntax. Ngrams are annotated with part-of-speech tags (e.g., in the phrase he burnt the toast , burnt is a verb; in the burnt toast , burnt is an adjective) and head-modifier dependencies (e.g., in the phrase the little black book , little modifies book ).
The annotated ngrams are far more useful for ex-amining the evolution of grammar and syntax. For our study of the regularization of the verb burn , the availability of syntactic annotations resolves the verb vs. adjective ambiguity in the original data, al-lowing us to only examine instances where burnt and burned appear as verbs. This more refined anal-ysis suggests a crossover date for the frequency of the verb forms that is several decades earlier than the overall (verbs and adjectives) crossover.
We use state-of-the-art statistical part-of-speech taggers and dependency parsers to produce syntac-tic annotations for eight languages in the Google Books collection. The annotations consist of 12 lan-guage universal part-of-speech tags and unlabeled head-modifier dependencies. Section 4 describes the models that we used and the format of the annota-tions in detail. We assess the expected annotation accuracies experimentally and discuss how we adapt the taggers and parsers to historical text in Section 5. The annotated ngrams are available as a new edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus; we provide some examples from the new corpus in Figure 3. Michel et al. (2011) described the construction of the first edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus and used it to quantitatively analyze a variety of top-ics ranging from language growth to public health. The related Ngram Viewer has become a popular tool for examining language trends by experts and non-experts alike.

In addition to studying frequency patterns in the data, researchers have also attempted to analyze the grammatical function of the ngrams (Davies, 2011). Such endeavors are hampered by the fact that the Ngram Corpus provides only aggregate statistics in the form of ngram counts and not the full sen-tences. Furthermore, only ngrams that pass certain occurrence thresholds are publicly available, making any further aggregation attempt futile: in heavy tail distributions like the ones common in natural lan-guages, the counts of rare events (that do not pass the frequency threshold) can have a large cumula-tive mass.

In contrast, because we have access to the full text, we can annotate ngrams to reflect the particu-lar grammatical functions they take in the sentences they were extracted from, and can also account for the contribution of rare ngrams to otherwise frequent grammatical functions. The Google Books Ngram Corpus has been avail-able at http://books.google.com/ngrams since 2010. This work presents new corpora that have been extracted from an even larger book collec-tion, adds a new language (Italian), and introduces syntactically annotated ngrams. The new corpora are available in addition to the already existing ones. 3.1 Books Data The new edition of the Ngram Corpus supports the eight languages shown in Table 1. The book vol-umes were selected from the larger collection of all books digitized at Google following exactly the pro-cedure described in Michel et al. (2011). The new edition contains data from 8,116,746 books, or over 6% of all books ever published. The English cor-pus alone comprises close to half a trillion words. This collection of books is much larger than any other digitized collection; its generation required a substantial effort involving obtaining and manually scanning millions of books. 3.2 Raw Ngrams We extract ngrams in a similar way to the first edi-tion of the corpus (Michel et al., 2011), but with some notable differences. Previously, tokenization was done on whitespace characters and all ngrams occurring on a given page were extracted, includ-ing ones that span sentence boundaries, but omitting ngrams that span page boundaries.

Instead, we perform tokenization and sentence boundary detection by applying a set of manually devised rules (except for Chinese, where a statistical system is used for segmentation). We capture sen-tences that span across page boundaries, and then extract ngrams only within sentences. As is typically done in language model estimation, we add sentence beginning ( START ) and end tokens ( END ) that are included in the ngram extraction. This allows us to distinguish ngrams that appear in sentence-medial positions from ngrams that occur at sentence bound-aries (e.g., START John ). 3.3 Differences to the First Edition The differences between this edition and the first edition of the Ngram Corpus are as follows: (i) the underlying book collection has grown substantially in the meantime; (ii) OCR technology and metadata extraction have improved, resulting in higher qual-ity digitalization; (iii) ngrams spanning sentence boundaries are omitted, and ngrams spanning page boundaries are included. As a result, this new edi-tion is not a superset of the first edition. In addition to extracting raw ngrams, we part-of-speech tag and parse the entire corpus and extract syntactically annotated ngrams (see Figure 2). We use manually annotated treebanks of modern text (often newswire) as training data for the POS tag-ger and parser models. We discuss our approach to adapting the models to historical text in Section 5. 4.1 Part-of-Speech Tagging Part-of-speech tagging is one of the most funda-mental disambiguation steps in any natural lan-guage processing system. Over the years, POS tag-ging accuracies have steadily improved, appearing to plateau at an accuracy level that approaches hu-man inter-annotator agreement (Manning, 2011). As we demonstrate in the next section, these numbers are misleading since they are computed on test data that is very close to the training domain. We there-fore need to specifically adapt our models to handle noisy and historical text.
 We perform POS tagging with a state-of-the-art 2 Conditional Random Field (CRF) based tagger (Laf-ferty et al., 2001) trained on manually annotated treebank data. We use the following fairly standard features in our tagger: current word, suffixes and prefixes of length 1, 2 and 3; additionally we use word cluster features (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008) for the current word, and transition features of the cluster of the current and previous word.

To provide a language-independent interface, we use the universal POS tagset described in detail in Petrov et al. (2012). This universal POS tagset de-fines the following twelve POS tags, which exist in similar form in most languages: N OUN (nouns), V P A merals), C ONJ (conjunctions), P RT (particles),  X . X  (punctuation marks) and X (a catch-all for other cat-egories such as abbreviations or foreign words).
Table 2 shows the two most common words for some POS tag categories. It is interesting to see that there is overlap between the most frequent content words across language boundaries. In general, func-tion words are more frequent than content words, resulting in somewhat less interesting examples for some POS tags. More typical examples might be big for adjectives, quickly for adverbs or read for verbs.
As suggested in Petrov et al. (2012), we train on the language-specific treebank POS tags, and then map the predicted tags to the universal tags. Table 3 shows POS tagging accuracies on the treebank eval-uation sets using the 12 universal POS tags. 4.2 Syntactic Parsing We use a dependency syntax representation, since it is intuitive to work with and can be predicted ef-fectively. Additionally, dependency parse tree cor-pora exist for several languages, making the repre-sentation desirable from a practical standpoint. De-pendency parse trees specify pairwise relationships between words in the same sentence. Directed arcs specify which words modify a given word (if any), or alternatively, which head word governs a given word (there can only be one). For example, in Fig-ure 2, hair is the head of the modifier short .
We use a deterministic transition-based depen-dency parsing model (Nivre, 2008) with an arc-eager transition strategy. A linear kernel SVM with the following features is used for prediction: the part-of-speech tags of the first four words on the buffer and of the top two words on the stack; the word identities of the first two words on the buffer and of the top word on the stack; the word identity of the syntactic head of the top word on the stack (if available). All non-lexical feature conjunctions are included. For treebanks with non-projective trees we use the pseudo-projective parsing technique to trans-form the treebank into projective structures (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005). To standardize and simplify the dependency relations across languages we use unla-beled directed dependency arcs. Table 3 shows un-labeled attachment scores on the treebank evaluation sets with automatically predicted POS tags. 4.3 Syntactic Ngrams As described above, we extract raw ngrams ( n  X  5 ) from the book text. Additionally, we provide ngrams annotated with POS tags and dependency relations.
The syntactic ngrams comprise words (e.g., burnt ), POS-annotated words (e.g. burnt VERB ), and POS tags (e.g., VERB ). All of these forms can be mixed freely in 1-, 2-and 3-grams (e.g., the ADJ toast NOUN ). To limit the combinatorial explosion, we restrict the forms that can be mixed in 4-and 5-grams. Words and POS tags cab be mixed freely (e.g., the house is ADJ ) and we also allow every word to be annotated (e.g., the DET house NOUN is VERB red ADJ ). However, we do not allow annotated words to be mixed with other forms (e.g., both the house NOUN is ADJ and the house NOUN is red are not allowed). Head-modifier dependencies between pairs of words can be expressed similarly (we do not record chains of dependencies). Both the head and the modifier can take any of the forms described above. We use an arrow that points from the head word to the modifier word (e.g., head = &gt; modifier or modifier &lt; = head ) to indicate a dependency relation. We use the desig-nated ROOT for the root of the parse tree (e.g.,
ROOT = &gt; has ).
Figure 2 shows an English sentence, its POS tags and dependency parse tree, and some concrete ex-amples of ngrams that are extracted. Note the flex-ibility and additional possibilities that the depen-dency relations provide. Using the raw ngrams it is not possible to accurately estimate how frequently hair is described as short , as there are often interven-ing words between the head and the modifier. Be-cause dependency relations are independent of word order, we are able to calculate the frequency of both hair= &gt; black and hair= &gt; short.

Similarly, there are many ways to express that somebody is reading a book. The first plot in Figure 3 shows multiple related queries. The 3-gram read DET book aggregates several more spe-cific 3-grams like read a book , read the book , etc. The dependency representation read= &gt; book is even more general, enforcing the requirement that the two words obey a specific syntactic configuration, but ig-noring the number of words that appear in between. The results on the treebank evaluation sets need to be taken with caution, since performance often suf-fers when generalized to other domains. To get a better estimate of the POS tagging and parsing accuracies we conducted a detailed study for En-glish. We chose English since it is the largest lan-guage in our corpus and because labeled treebank data for multiple domains is available. In addition to the WSJ (newswire) treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), we use: the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979), which provides a balanced sample of text from the early 1960s; the QuestionBank (Judge et al., 2006), which consists entirely of questions; and the PPCMBE corpus (Kroch et al., 2010), which contains modern British English from 1700 to 1914 and is perhaps most close to our application domain.
Since the English treebanks are in constituency format, we used the StanfordConverter (de Marn-effe et al., 2006) to convert the parse trees to de-pendencies and ignored the arc labels. The depen-dency conversion was unfortunately not possible for the PPCMBE corpus since it uses a different set of constituency labels. The tagset of PPCMBE is also unique and cannot be mapped deterministically to the universal tagset. For example the string  X  X ne X  has its own POS tag in PPCMBE, but is ambigu-ous in general  X  it can be used either as a number (NUM), noun (NOUN) or pronoun (PRON). We did our best to convert the tags as closely as possible, leaving tags that cannot be mapped untouched. Con-sequently, our evaluation results underestimate the accuracy of our tagger since it might correctly dis-ambiguate certain words that are not disambiguated in the PPCMBE evaluation data.

Table 4 shows the accuracies on the different do-mains for our baseline and adapted models. The baseline model is trained only on newswire text and hence performs best on the newswire evaluation set. Our final model is adapted in two ways. First, we add the the Brown corpus and QuestionBank to the training data. Second, and more importantly, we es-timate word cluster features on the books data and use them as features in the POS tagger.

The word cluster features group words determin-istically into clusters that have similar distributional properties. When the model encounters a word that was never seen during training, the clusters allow the model to relate it to other, potentially known words. This approach improves the accuracy on rare words, and also makes our models robust to scanning er-rors. For example, in older books the medial-s ( R ) is often incorrectly recognized as an  X  X  X  by the OCR software (e.g.,  X  X eft X  instead of  X  X est X ). Such sys-tematic scanning errors will produce spurious words that have very similar co-occurrence patterns as the correct spelling of the word. In fact, a manual exam-ination reveals that words with systematic scanning errors tend to be in the same cluster as their correctly spelled versions. The cluster feature thus provides a strong signal for determining the correct POS tag.
While the final annotations are by no means per-fect, we expect that in aggregate they are accurate enough to be useful when analyzing broad trends in the evolution of grammar. We described a new edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus that provides syntacti-cally annotated ngrams for eight languages. The data is available for download and view-able through an interactive web application at http://books.google.com/ngrams . We discussed the statistical models used to produce the syntactic annotations and how they were adapted to handle historical text more robustly, resulting in sig-nificantly improved annotation quality. Analyzing the resulting data is beyond the scope of this paper, but we show some example plots in Figure 3.
