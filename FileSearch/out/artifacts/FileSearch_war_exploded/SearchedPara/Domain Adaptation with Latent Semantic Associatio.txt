 Named entities (NE) are phrases that contain names of persons, organizations, locations, etc. NER is an important task in information extraction and natu-ral language processing (NLP) applications. Super-vised learning methods can effectively solve NER problem by learning a model from manually labeled data (Borthwick, 1999; Sang and Meulder, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Florian et al., 2003). However, em-pirical study shows that NE types have different dis-tribution across domains (Guo et al., 2006). Trained NER classifiers in the source domain usually lose accuracy in a new target domain when the data dis-tribution is different between both domains.
Domain adaptation is a challenge for NER and other NLP applications. In the domain transfer, the reason for accuracy loss is that each NE type often has various specific term representations and context clues in the different domains. For ex-ample, {  X  X conomist X ,  X  X inger X ,  X  X ancer X ,  X  X thlete X ,  X  X layer X ,  X  X hilosopher X , ... } are used as context clues for NER. However, the distribution of these representations are varied with domains. We expect to do better domain adaptation for NER by exploit-ing latent semantic association among words from different domains. Some approaches have been pro-posed to group words into  X  X opics X  to capture im-portant relationships between words, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990), probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) (Hof-mann, 1999), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). These models have been success-fully employed in topic modeling, dimensionality reduction for text categorization (Blei et al., 2003), ad hoc IR (Wei and Croft., 2006), and so on.
In this paper, we present a domain adaptation method with latent semantic association. We focus on capturing the hidden semantic association among words in the domain adaptation. We introduce the LaSA model to overcome the distribution difference between the source domain and the target domain. LaSA model is constructed from the unlabeled cor-pus at first. It learns latent semantic association among words from their related context snippets. In the domain transfer, words in the corpus are as-sociated with a low-dimension concept space using LaSA model, then the original NER model is tuned using these generated semantic association features. The intuition behind our method is that words in one concept set will have similar semantic features or latent semantic association, and share syntactic and semantic context in the corpus. They can be consid-ered as behaving in the same way for discriminative learning in the source and target domains. The pro-posed method associates words from different do-mains on a semantic level rather than by lexical oc-currence. It can better bridge the domain distribu-tion gap without any labeled target domain samples. Experimental results on English and Chinese corpus show that LaSA-based adaptation significantly en-hances NER performance across domains.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-tion 2 briefly describes the related works. Section 3 presents a domain adaptation method based on latent semantic association. Section 4 illustrates how to learn LaSA model from the unlabeled corpus. Sec-tion 5 shows experimental results on large-scale En-glish and Chinese corpus across domains, respec-tively. The conclusion is given in Section 6. Some domain adaptation techniques have been em-ployed in NLP in recent years. Some of them focus on quantifying the generalizability of cer-tain features across domains. Roark and Bacchiani (2003) use maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to combine training data from the source and target domains. Chelba and Acero (2004) use the param-eters of the source domain maximum entropy clas-sifier as the means of a Gaussian prior when train-ing a new model on the target data. Daume III and Marcu (2006) use an empirical Bayes model to esti-mate a latent variable model grouping instances into domain-specific or common across both domains. Daume III (2007) further augments the feature space on the instances of both domains. Jiang and Zhai (2006) exploit the domain structure contained in the training examples to avoid over-fitting the training domains. Arnold et al. (2008) exploit feature hier-archy for transfer learning in NER. Instance weight-ing (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and active learning (Chan and Ng, 2007) are also employed in domain adap-tation. Most of these approaches need the labeled target domain samples for the model estimation in the domain transfer. Obviously, they require much efforts for labeling the target domain samples.
Some approaches exploit the common structure of related problems. Ando et al. (2005) learn pred-icative structures from multiple tasks and unlabeled data. Blitzer et al. (2006, 2007) employ structural corresponding learning (SCL) to infer a good fea-ture representation from unlabeled source and target data sets in the domain transfer. We present LaSA model to overcome the data gap across domains by capturing latent semantic association among words from unlabeled source and target data.

In addition, Miller et al. (2004) and Freitag (2004) employ distributional and hierarchical clus-tering methods to improve the performance of NER within a single domain. Li and McCallum (2005) present a semi-supervised sequence modeling with syntactic topic models. In this paper, we focus on capturing hidden semantic association among words in the domain adaptation. The challenge in domain adaptation is how to cap-ture latent semantic association from the source and target domain data. We present a LaSA-based do-main adaptation method in this section.

NER can be considered as a classification prob-lem. Let X be a feature space to represent the ob-served word instances, and let Y be the set of class labels. Let p lying distributions for the source and the target do-mains, respectively. In order to minimize the efforts required in the domain transfer, we often expect to use p
However, data distribution are often varied with the domains. For example, in the economics-to-entertainment domain transfer, although many NE triggers (e.g.  X  X ompany X  and  X  X r. X ) are used in both domains, some are totally new, like  X  X ancer X ,  X  X inger X . Moreover, many useful words (e.g.  X  X conomist X ) in the economics NER are useless in the entertainment domain. The above examples show that features could change behavior across do-mains. Some useful predictive features from one do-main are not predictive or do not appear in another domain. Although some triggers (e.g.  X  X inger X ,  X  X conomist X ) are completely distinct for each do-main, they often appear in the similar syntactic and semantic context. For example, triggers of per-son entity often appear as the subject of  X  X isited X ,  X  X aid X , etc, or are modified by  X  X xcellent X ,  X  X opu-lar X ,  X  X amous X  etc. Such latent semantic association among words provides useful hints for overcoming the data distribution gap of both domains.

Hence, we present a LaSA model  X  ture latent semantic association among words in the domain adaptation.  X  beled source and target domain data. Each instance is characterized by its co-occurred context distribu-tion in the learning. Semantic association feature in  X  from data. In the domain adaptation, we transfer the problem of semantic association mapping to a pos-terior inference task using LaSA model. Latent se-mantic concept association set of a word instance x (denoted by SA ( x ) ) is generated by  X  in the same concept set are considered as behaving in the same way for discriminative learning in both domains. Even though word instances do not ap-pear in a training corpus (or appear rarely) but are in similar context, they still might have relatively high probability in the same semantic concept set. Obvi-ously, SA ( x ) can better bridge the gap between the two distributions p model can enhance the estimate of the source do-main distribution p the target domain distribution p In the domain adaptation, LaSA model is employed to find the latent semantic association structures of  X  X ords X  in a text corpus. We will illustrate how to build LaSA model from words and their context snippets in this section. LaSA model actually can be considered as a general probabilistic topic model. It can be learned on the unlabeled corpus using the popular hidden topic models such as LDA or pLSI. 4.1 Virtual Context Document The distribution of content words (e.g. nouns, adjec-tives) is usually varied with domains. Hence, in the domain adaptation, we focus on capturing the latent semantic association among content words. In or-der to learn latent relationships among words from the unlabeled corpus, each content word is charac-terized by a virtual context document as follows.
Given a content word x ment of x text units around x number of the sentences which contain x pus. vd where, F ( x s k x
Given the context window size { -t, t } (i.e. pre-vious t words and next t words around x F
For example, given x lar new singer attended the new year party X  . Let the context window size be { -3,3 } . F ( singer ) = { singer , A L ( new ) , A R ( attend ( ed )) , C L ( this C tic feature distribution of x construct the feature vector of x served context features in vd { f 1 , ..., f j , ..., f m } around x ber of features in vd by Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1990) between x where, P ( f f ity of f bility of x 4.2 Learning LaSA Model Topic models are statistical models of text that posit a hidden space of topics in which the corpus is em-bedded (Blei et al., 2003). LDA (Blei et al., 2003) is a probabilistic model that can be used to model and discover underlying topic structures of documents. LDA assumes that there are K  X  X opics X , multinomial distributions over words, which describes a collec-tion. Each document exhibits multiple topics, and each word in each document is associated with one of them. LDA imposes a Dirichlet distribution on the topic mixture weights corresponding to the doc-uments in the corpus. The topics derived by LDA seem to possess semantic coherence. Those words with similar semantics are likely to occur in the same topic. Since the number of LDA model parameters depends only on the number of topic mixtures and vocabulary size, LDA is less prone to over-fitting and is capable of estimating the probability of un-observed test documents. LDA is already success-fully applied to enhance document representations in text classification (Blei et al., 2003), information retrieval (Wei and Croft., 2006).
 In the following, we illustrate how to construct LDA-style LaSA model  X  text documents. Algorithm 1 describes LaSA model training method in detail, where, Function AddT o ( data, Set ) denotes that data is added to Set . Given a large-scale unlabeled data set D u which consists of the source and target domain data, virtual context document for each candidate content word is extracted from D each feature in a virtual context document is calcu-lated using its Mutual Information ( see Equation 1 in Section 4.1) instead of the counts when running Algorithm 1 : LaSA Model Training LDA. LaSA model  X  generated on the virtual context document set V D using the algorithm presented by Blei et al (2003).
LaSA model learns the posterior distribution to decompose words and their corresponding virtual context documents into topics. Table 1 lists top 10 nouns from a random selection of 5 topics computed on the unlabeled economics and entertainment do-main data. As shown, words in the same topic are representative nouns. They actually are grouped into broad concept sets. For example, set 1, 3 and 4 correspond to nominal person, nominal organization and location, respectively. With a large-scale unla-beled corpus, we will have enough words assigned to each topic concept to better approximate the un-derlying semantic association distribution.

In LDA-style LaSA model, the topic mixture is drawn from a conjugate Dirichlet prior that re-mains the same for all the virtual context docu-ments. Hence, given a word x may perform posterior inference to determine the conditional distribution of the hidden topic feature variables associated with x ciation set of x using Algorithm 2. Here, Multinomial(  X  refers to sample from the posterior distribution over topics given a virtual document vd adaptation, we do semantic association inference on the source domain training data using LaSA model at first, then the original source domain NER model is tuned on the source domain training data set by incorporating these generated semantic association features.

Algorithm 2 : Generate Latent Semantic As-sociation Set of Word x LaSA Model
LaSA model better models latent semantic asso-ciation distribution in the source and the target do-mains. By grouping words into concepts, we effec-tively overcome the data distribution difference of both domains. Thus, we may reduce the number of parameters required to model the target domain data, and improve the quality of the estimated pa-rameters in the domain transfer. LaSA model ex-tends the traditional bag-of-words topic models to context-dependence concept association model. It has potential use for concept grouping. We evaluate LaSA-based domain adaptation method on both English and Chinese corpus in this section. In the experiments, we focus on recognizing person (PER), location (LOC) and organization (ORG) in the given four domains, including economics (Eco), entertainment (Ent), politics (Pol) and sports (Spo). 5.1 Experimental setting In the NER domain adaptation, nouns and adjectives make a significant impact on the performance. Thus, we focus on capturing latent semantic association for high-frequency nouns and adjectives (i.e. occur-rence count  X  50 ) in the unlabeled corpus. LaSA models for nouns and adjectives are learned from the unlabeled corpus using Algorithm 1 (see section 4.2), respectively. Our empirical study shows that better adaptation is obtained with a 50-topic LaSA model. Therefore, we set the number of topics N as 50, and define the context view window size as { -3,3 } (i.e. previous 3 words and next 3 words) in the LaSA model learning. LaSA features for other irre-spective words (e.g. token unit  X  X he X ) are assigned with a default topic value N +1.

All the basic NER models are trained on the domain-specific training data using RRM classifier (Guo et al., 2005). RRM is a generalization Winnow learning algorithm (Zhang et al., 2002). We set the context view window size as { -2,2 } in NER. Given a word instance x , we employ local linguistic features (e.g. word unit, part of speech) of x and its context units ( i.e. previous 2 words and next 2 words ) in NER. All Chinese texts in the experiments are auto-matically segmented into words using HMM.

In LaSA-based domain adaptation, the semantic association features of each unit in the observation window { -2,2 } are generated by LaSA model at first, then the basic source domain NER model is tuned on the original source domain training data set by incor-porating the semantic association features. For ex-ample, given the sentence  X  X his popular new singer attended the new year party X  , Figure 1 illustrates various features and views at the current word w  X  singer  X  in LaSA-based adaptation. In the viewing window at the word  X  singer  X  (see Figure 1), each word unit around  X  singer  X  is codi-fied with a set of primitive features (e.g. P OS , SA , T ag ), together with its relative position to  X  singer  X  . Here,  X  SA  X  denotes semantic association feature set which is generated by LaSA model.  X  T ag  X  denotes NE tags labeled in the data set.

Given the input vector constructed with the above features, RRM method is then applied to train linear weight vectors, one for each possible class-label. In the decoding stage, the class with the maximum con-fidence is then selected for each token unit.
In our evaluation, only NEs with correct bound-aries and correct class labels are considered as the correct recognition. We use the standard Precision (P), Recall (R), and F-measure ( F = 2 P R sure the performance of NER models. 5.2 Data We built large-scale English and Chinese anno-tated corpus. English corpus are generated from wikipedia while Chinese corpus are selected from Chinese newspapers. Moreover, test data do not overlap with training data and unlabeled data. 5.2.1 Generate English Annotated Corpus Wikipedia provides a variety of data resources for NER and other NLP research (Richman and Schone, 2008). We generate all the annotated English corpus from wikipedia. With the limitation of efforts, only PER NEs in the corpus are automatically tagged us-ing an English person gazetteer. We automatically extract an English Person gazetteer from wikipedia at first. Then we select the articles from wikipedia and tag them using this gazetteer.

In order to build the English Person gazetteer from wikipdedia, we manually selected several key phrases, including  X  X irths X ,  X  X eaths X ,  X  X urname X ,  X  X iven names X  and  X  X uman names X  at first. For each article title of interest, we extracted the cate-gories to which that entry was assigned. The en-try is considered as a person name if its related explicit category links contain any one of the key phrases, such as  X  X ategory: human names X . We to-tally extracted 25,219 person name candidates from 204,882 wikipedia articles. And we expanded this gazetteer by adding the other available common person names. Finally, we obtained a large-scale gazetteer of 51,253 person names.

All the articles selected from wikipedia are further tagged using the above large-scale gazetteer. Since human annotated set were not available, we held out more than 100,000 words of text from the automat-ically tagged corpus to as a test set in each domain. Table 2 shows the data distribution of the training and test data sets.

We also randomly select 17M unlabeled English data (see Table 3) from Wikipedia. These unlabeled data are used to build the English LaSA model. 5.2.2 Chinese Data
We built a large-scale high-quality Chinese NE annotated corpus. All the data are news articles from several Chinese newspapers in 2001 and 2002. All the NEs (i.e. PER, LOC and ORG ) in the corpus are manually tagged. Cross-validation checking is em-ployed to ensure the quality of the annotated corpus.
All the domain-specific training and test data are selected from this annotated corpus according to the domain categories (see Table 4). 8.46M unlabeled Chinese data (see Table 5) are randomly selected from this corpus to build the Chinese LaSA model. 5.3 Experimental Results All the experiments are conducted on the above large-scale English and Chinese corpus. The overall performance enhancement of NER by LaSA-based domain adaptation is evaluated at first. Since the distribution of each NE type is different across do-mains, we also analyze the performance enhance-ment on each entity type by LaSA-based adaptation. 5.3.1 Performance Enhancement of NER by
Table 6 and 7 show the experimental results for all pairs of domain adaptation on both English and Chinese corpus, respectively. In the experiment, the basic source domain NER model M from the specific domain training data set D (see Table 2 and 4 in Section 5.2). Here, dom  X  { Eco, Ent, P ol, Spo } . F in dom denotes the top-line F-measure of M When M main, its F-measure in this basic transfer is consid-ered as baseline (denoted by F notes F-measure of M main with LaSA-based domain adaptation.  X  ( F ) = enhancement by LaSA-based domain adaptation.
Experimental results on English and Chinese cor-pus indicate that the performance of M cantly degrades in each basic domain transfer with-out using LaSA model (see Table 6 and 7). For ex-ample, in the  X  X co  X  Ent X  transfer on Chinese cor-pus (see Table 7), F in of M measure of M cent points in this basic transfer. Significant perfor-mance degrading of M transfer. It shows that the data distribution of both domains is very different in each possible transfer. Experimental results on English corpus show that LaSA-based adaptation effectively enhances the per-formance in each domain transfer (see Table 6). For example, in the  X  X ol  X  Eco X  transfer, F 63.62% while F with F hances F-measure by 7.04%. We perform t-tests on F-measure of all the comparison experiments on En-glish corpus. The p-value is 2.44E-06, which shows that the improvement is statistically significant.
Table 6 also gives the accuracy loss due to transfer in each domain adaptation on English corpus. The accuracy loss is defined as loss = 1  X  F the relative reduction in error is defined as  X  ( loss ) = | the relative reduction in error is above 9.93% with LaSA-based transfer in each test on English cor-pus. LaSA model significantly decreases the ac-curacy loss by 29.38% in average. Especially for  X  X po  X  Pol X  transfer,  X  ( loss ) achieves 63.98% with LaSA-based adaptation. All the above results show that LaSA-based adaptation significantly reduces the accuracy loss in the domain transfer for English NER without any labeled target domain samples.
Experimental results on Chinese corpus also show that LaSA-based adaptation effectively increases the accuracy in all the tests (see Table 7). For example, in the  X  X co  X  Ent X  transfer, compared with F LaSA-based adaptation significantly increases F-measure by 9.88%. We also perform t-tests on F-measure of 12 comparison experiments on Chinese corpus. The p-value is 1.99E-06, which shows that the enhancement is statistically significant. More-over, the relative reduction in error is above 10% with LaSA-based method in each test. LaSA model decreases the accuracy loss by 16.43% in average. Especially for the  X  X co  X  Ent X  transfer (see Table 7),  X  ( loss ) achieves 26.29% with LaSA-based method. All the above experimental results on English and Chinese corpus show that LaSA-based domain adap-tation significantly decreases the accuracy loss in the transfer without any labeled target domain data. Al-though automatically tagging introduced some er-rors in English source training data, the relative re-duction in errors in English NER adaptation seems comparable to that one in Chinese NER adaptation. 5.3.2 Accuracy Enhancement for Each NE
Our statistic data (Guo et al., 2006) show that the distribution of NE types varies with domains. Each NE type has different domain features. Thus, the performance stability of each NE type recognition is very important in the domain transfer.

Figure 2 gives F-measure of each NE type recog-nition achieved by LaSA-based adaptation on En-glish and Chinese corpus. Experimental results show that LaSA-based adaptation effectively in-creases the accuracy of each NE type recognition in the most of the domain transfer tests. We perform t-tests on F-measure of the comparison experiments on each NE type, respectively. All the p-value is less than 0.01, which shows that the improvement on each NE type recognition is statistically signifi-cant. Especially, the p-value of English and Chinese PER is 2.44E-06 and 9.43E-05, respectively, which shows that the improvement on PER recognition is very significant. For example, in the  X  X co  X  Pol X  transfer on Chinese corpus, compared with F LaSA-based adaptation enhances F-measure of PER recognition by 9.53 percent points. Performance en-hancement for ORG recognition is less than that one for PER and LOC recognition using LaSA model since ORG NEs usually contain much more domain-specific information than PER and LOC.

The major reason for error reduction is that exter-nal context and internal units are better semantically associated using LaSA model. For example, LaSA model better groups various titles from different do-mains (see Table 1 in Section 4.2). Various industry terms in ORG NEs are also grouped into the seman-tic sets. These semantic associations provide useful hints for detecting the boundary of NEs in the new target domain. All the above results show that LaSA model better compensates for the feature distribution difference of each NE type across domains. We present a domain adaptation method with LaSA model in this paper. LaSA model captures latent se-mantic association among words from the unlabeled corpus. It better groups words into a set of concepts according to the related context snippets. LaSA-based domain adaptation method projects words to a low-dimension concept feature space in the trans-fer. It effectively overcomes the data distribution gap across domains without using any labeled target do-main data. Experimental results on English and Chi-nese corpus show that LaSA-based domain adapta-tion significantly enhances the performance of NER across domains. Especially, LaSA model effectively increases the accuracy of each NE type recogni-tion in the domain transfer. Moreover, LaSA-based domain adaptation method works well across lan-guages. To further reduce the accuracy loss, we will explore informative sampling to capture fine-grained data difference in the domain transfer.
