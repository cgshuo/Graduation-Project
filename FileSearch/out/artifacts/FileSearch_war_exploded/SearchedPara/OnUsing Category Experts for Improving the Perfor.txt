 A variety of recommendation methods have been proposed to sat-isfy the performance and accuracy; however, it is fairly difficult to satisfy both of them because there is a trade-off between them. In this paper, we introduce the notion of category experts and propose the recommendation method by exploiting the ratings of category experts instead of those of the users similar to a target user. We also extend the method that uses both the category preference of a target user and his/her similarity to category experts. We show that our method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of performance and accuracy through extensive experiments with real-world data.

Recommender systems automatically recommend to each cus-tomer products that he/she would like to have among a huge num-ber of the products in online shopping malls. There have been a large number of research efforts in this topic [1][2]. Recommender systems can be evaluated by performance, accuracy, diversity, and explainability [1]. In particular, because a recommendation result is to be provided online, the performance is important. Also, it is crucial to provide an accurate result because customers should be satisfied with the recommended items.

Recommender systems use the ratings assigned by the target user and other users to items in order to predict the ratings of items to which the target user haven X  X  assigned any rating yet. The fi-nal item recommendation is performed with this result [2]. There are different types of recommender systems such as the user-based recommendation [3], the item-based recommendation [4], and the clustering-based recommendation [5]. The user-based one has the disadvantage of recommendation taking a long time because it com-putes similarities between the target user and other users at ev-ery time of recommendation. The item-based and clustering-based ones overcome this problem by the pre-computation of similarities between items or users. However, they have the disadvantage of not being able to reflect the recent user preferences on items.
In this paper, we propose a new recommendation method that provides both good accuracy and performance. In order to satisfy this goal, the proposed method, instead of finding similar users, finds category experts who have high expertise in specific cate-gories. Then, we exploit the ratings given by the experts to predict how the target user will provide ratings for each of the items.
The category experts are selected independently of the target users. So, applying the ratings of the experts identically to all target users would decrease the accuracy. Thus, in this paper, we predict the rating by taking the characteristics of the target user (i.e., sim-ilarity to each of category experts and his/her interest about each category) into account.

Our method provides high processing performance because cate-gory experts are defined independently from the target user. There-fore, when recommending to each target user, we can predict rat-ings with much less computations by identifying expert groups in advance, and use them identically for each recommendation. In ad-dition, in real life, people have a tendency to look for advice from experts of specific fields, rather than getting recommendations from ordinary users of similar preferences. Therefore, as it reflects such user behaviour, the recommendations obtained from experts can provide accurate results. To verify the superiority of the proposed method, we evaluate the performance and accuracy of our method and the existing ones through extensive experiments with Movie-Lens data.
The widely used approach in current recommender systems is the collaborative filtering . There are two approaches in collabo-rative filtering: memory-based recommendation and model-based recommendation.
There are several memory-based recommendation methods such as the user-based recommendation [3] and the item-based recom-mendation [4]. The user-based recommendation looks for k users who have the most similar preferences with the target user and pre-dicts the rating of a target item based on the ratings assigned by the k users. This method has the advantage of providing accurate rec-ommendation because it can include all the latest ratings assigned to items by each user. However, the user-based recommendation has a performance problem because the computation of the similar-ities between the target user and all other users spends tremendous time and is performed online whenever there is a recommendation request.

The item-based recommendation overcomes the performance pro-blem of the user-based recommendation [4]. This method pre-calculates the similarities of all the items. When the rating of a target item is predicted, the items most similar to the target item are considered for collectively considering their ratings assigned by the target user. This method calculates the similarities between items using the measure such as the Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient and cosine similarity.

Because the item-based recommendation computes similarities of all the items in advance, it saves a lot of time in recommendation compared with the user-based recommendation. However, the ac-curacy may decrease because the old pre-calculated similarities are used in recommendation until the new ones are calculated, which implies it misses the recent ratings of each user.

The model-based recommendation includes recommendation me-thods that use the clustering model [5], Bayesian network model [6], and latent semantic model [7]. Among them, the clustering-based recommendation works in a similar way as the user-based recommendation. This method identifies groups of similar users through clustering before the recommendation request. The rating on an item for the target user is predicted by referencing to the rat-ings on the item given by those users who belong to the group (i.e., cluster) same as the target user. This method pre-creates and uses a clustering model until the next model is created, which makes it have the similar advantages and disadvantages as the item-based recommendation.

In summary, the previous collaborative filtering suffers from the problems of degraded performance or not being able to reflect re-cent item preferences depending on the way they choose the users similar to the target user.
In order to solve the problems of the existing collaborative fil-tering, we propose a novel method that uses the notion of category experts instead of similar users.

A category expert is a user who is considered to well understand the overall items in a specific category. In this paper, the decision of whether or not a user well understands the item is based on whether or not the user has made evaluation on the item. The reasoning behind this is, in order to make evaluation on an item, the user needs to know well about the item. Therefore, a user who has made evaluation on many items in a specific category can be considered as knowledgeable about the category, thereby being defined as a category expert .

In this paper, we denote the recommendation method that uses category experts as CatExpert . CatExpert predicts the rating that the target user would assign to the target item by collecting the rat-ings that the category experts assigned to the item. In this method, the rating that would be assigned by a target user u to a target item i denoted as P u;i , is computed by equation (1) below. r u;c is the average of ratings assigned by user u to all of the items in category c . E c is the expert group of category c , and is organized of the top k users who had made the most evaluation on the items in category c . r v;i is the rating that expert v included in the group assigned to item i . C is a set of categories that include item i , and j
C j is the number of those categories. Factor C is necessary for some domains where an item may be included in several categories.
CatExpert will very weakly reflect the personal taste of the tar-get user on the predicted ratings. This is due to the fact that it predicts ratings for each target user by using the same category ex-perts and his/her ratings in the same way. However, users tend to agree to the opinions from those who have similar personal tastes. Therefore, users eagerly accept the opinions of category experts who have similar tastes as themselves, and rarely accept the opin-ions from category experts who have different tastes. In this paper, we propose CatExpert+Sim by reflecting this tendency of users to CatExpert . In CatExpert+Sim , P u;i is calculated by equation (2). S u;v represents the similarity between target user u and category expert v that is calculated by the Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient.
Both CatExpert and CatExpert+Sim will equally consider the opinions of each category X  X  experts even when an item belongs to several categories. However, users could have different amounts of interest in each category and would more positively accept the opinions of the category experts in a specific if he/she is more inter-ested in the category. Therefore, we propose CatExpert+Sim+Pref that predicts the rating for an item that belongs to multiple cate-gories by collectively considering the category experts X  opinions in proportion to the amount of interest that the target user has in the category. In this method, the predicted rating, P u;i , for item i that target user u has not evaluated is computed by equation (3). P f u;c is the amount of interest that user u has in category c . It is defined by how frequently user u has assigned ratings to the items in the category.

The proposed method can save a lot of time in prediction com-pared with the user-based recommendation. The user-based recom-mendation needs to calculate the similarity between the target user and all users in every recommendation, and the computation of the cosine similarity or the correlation coefficient require a lot of time. On the other hand, in the proposed methods, it is possible to use the same set of category experts to predict all of the target user X  X  ratings for the items included in the same category. Therefore, our methods can easily maintain the latest category experts and by em-ploying incremental update whenever new data is available.
The proposed methods are executed much faster than the user-based recommendation methods and also could provide recommen-dations satisfactory for users.
In order to demonstrate the performance and accuracy of our pro-posed method using category experts, we conducted a set of com-prehensive experiments. We used the MovieLens data set [8] which has 100,000 ratings that range from 1 to 5 points for 1,682 movies by 943 users and every user had rated at least 20 movies. Also, there are 19 kinds of movie genres (i.e., categories in one case), and every movie belongs to at least one genre.

In the first experiment, we analysed the accuracy of CatExpert +Sim+Pref with different numbers of category experts. The accu-racy was measured by dividing the MovieLens data set into 5 sets and by using 5-cross-validation. In order to evaluate the accuracy, we used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) . MAE is a measure that calculates the average of the er-rors which are the difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings, while RMSE is a measure that puts an emphasis on big errors.

Figure 1 shows the results of the accuracy with different numbers of category experts for the proposed method. The x -axis shows the number of category experts used in the recommendation, and the y -axis shows MAE or RMSE. As in Figure 1, when the number of category experts is 60, CatExpert+Sim+Pref showed the lowest MAE and RMSE values. When the number of category experts is less than 60, the accuracy improves as the number of category experts increase, but when it exceeds 60, there is almost no change in the accuracy. Figur e 1: MAE and RMSE for Proposed Methods with Differ-ent Parameter Values.

In the second experiment, we examined whether the accuracy of the proposed method is higher than existing recommendation methods. We used two memory-based methods of the user-based recommendation and item-based recommendation, and also used a typical model-based method of k -Means clustering-based recom-mendation.

In the experiments, we had to find the best values of parame-ters: the number of users ( k u ) similar to the target user for the user-based recommendation, the number of similar items ( k item-based recommendation, and the number of clusters ( k k -Means clustering-based recommendation. Figure 2 shows the re-sults of the accuracy with these recommendation methods. The x -axis represents the value of parameters, and the y -axis repre-sents MAE or RMSE. Also, the light-colored dotted line represents RMSE of CatExpert+Sim+Pref , and the dark-colored dotted line represents MAE of CatExpert+Sim+Pref , which are shown here for the comparison purposes.

Figure 2.a shows that, when we set the number of similar users to 60, the user-based recommendation has the highest accuracy with MAE as 0.743 and RMSE as 0.862. As shown in Figure 2.b, when we set the number of similar items as 100, the item-based recom-mendation has the best accuracy with MAE as 0.860 and RMSE as 0.928. In Figure 2.c, when the number of clusters is set as 5, the k -Means clustering-based recommendation shows the highest accuracy with MAE and RMSE values as 0.780 and 0.883, respec-tively. Also, MAE and RMSE of three recommendation methods are higher than those of CatExpert+Sim+Pref .

In order to compare the previous methods with the proposed method, we list the cases providing the lowest MAE and RMSE values for each method in Table 1. The CatExpert+Sim+Pref shows higher accuracy than all of the previous methods.

In the third experiment, we investigated how much the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of the execution time. We used a PC that runs the 64 bit Windows Server 2008 oper-ating system with a 12GB RAM and an Intel Core-i7 processor that has a clock speed of 2.67GHz. In this experiment, we compared our proposed method with the existing user-based recommenda-tion, item-based recommendation, and k -Means clustering-based recommendation.

The proposed method shows some differences in the execution time with different numbers of category experts. In the same way, the execution time differs depending on the values of each param-eter with the existing three methods. Therefore, we first com-pared the changing patterns in execution time according to differ-ent parameter values in each method. We measured the time used for predicting the ratings for a total of 100,000 items via 5-cross-validation. In Tables 2 and 3, the bold-face number is the execution time for the parameter that showed the best accuracy.

Table 2 shows the execution time of the proposed method. It shows that the more category experts there are, the longer the exe-cution time is. This is because it has to consider more experts for each category in recommendation.

T able 3.a shows the results of the execution time for the user-based recommendation. In this method, the more similar users there are, the longer the execution time is, but the difference is not that significant. Table 3.b shows the results of the execution time for the item-based recommendation. This recommendation method requires more execution time as the number of similar items in-creases. Table 3.c shows the results of the execution time for the k -Means clustering-based recommendation. In this method, the ex-ecution time decreases as the number of clusters increases.
Table 4 shows the execution time of each method when it has the highest accuracy. The proposed method needs execution time much less than the user-based recommendation. This is because it requires less time to look for category experts than to look for sim-ilar users. The user-based recommendation needs the longest time, because it calculates the similarities between the target user and all other users. The item-based and k -Means clustering-based recom-mendation require less execution time than CatExpert+Sim+Pref .
In this section, through extensive experiments, we compared the proposed method with existing methods in terms of the accuracy and execution time. The proposed method shows much shorter ex-ecution times than the user-based recommendation method. Also, CatExpert+Sim+Pref provides even better performance in terms of the accuracy. Among the existing methods, the item-based rec-ommendation and k -Means clustering-based recommendation re-quire less execution time than CatExpert+Sim+Pref which needs to calculate the similarities, but provide lower accuracy than the proposed method.
The recommender system is primarily evaluated by its capability to recommend such products that can satisfy the users. In addition, since it provides services online, its performance is also an impor-tant issue. The previous collaborative filtering methods have some problems in terms of performance or accuracy. In this paper, we in-troduced a solution called CatExpert+Sim+Pref which uses cate-gory experts in the recommender system in order to overcome those problems. By experimenting using the MovieLens data, we first confirmed that the proposed CatExpert+Sim+Pref was more accu-rate than previous recommendation methods, especially showing significantly higher accuracy than the k -Means clustering-based recommendation. Also, we showed that CatExpert+Sim+Pref per-forms much faster than the previous user-based recommendation.
