 We demonstrate the Alexa Web Mining Platform, a data mining and web service publication platform designed to enable analysis of Alexa X  X  massive web data store. The sys-tem provides researchers and developers high speed access to our web crawl, crawl metadata, long term storage, and data publication utilities. We demonstrate the system X  X  ca-pabilities and user interface.
 H.3.0 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: General Algorithms, Design Web Mining, Information Retrieval, Web Intelligence, User Interfaces
The sizes of the largest web crawls, generally created by commercial ventures such as Google, Yahoo, and Alexa, con-tinue to increase, and the resources required to develop, maintain, and access data stores on this scale restrict most research and development efforts to much smaller data sets. Web mining and content management models [1] have been proposed, and efforts such as Stanford X  X  WebBase [2] and IBM X  X  WebFountain [3] have sought to bridge the resource gap and provide access to industry-scale data stores, but no effort to date has provided a comprehensive and cost-effective solution. This platform was designed to overcome the resource obstacles on behalf of the user and to provide an intuitive interface in order to enable research and web service publication by a large audience.
The system is composed of the web content repository (Web Store), a large computational cluster, long term vir-tual storage repository (the User Store), and online portal. The portal exposes methods for resource reservation, process management and monitoring, web service publication, and account management. The computational cluster enables highly distributed processing, allowing users to quickly tra-verse large document collections. A powerful search inter-face provides a mechanism for identifying documents within the Web Store, and a simple data retrieval API allows users to extract these documents for processing. Users may also leverage this API to access self-managed collections in the User Store.

This platform is ideally suited to research involving web content analysis and the development of new large-scale IR techniques. Alexa X  X  web crawl and crawl metadata are avail-able for programmatic traversal and analysis. The platform also provides search index generation and publication utili-ties. The Web Store is updated regularly with fresh content, and the User Store provides a long term storage solution for user data.

Data transfer within the system is enabled by a series of web service components. By adopting this approach, the system allows users to readily publish results which can then be accessed by future applications. This allows for extremely modular data access and provides for efficient collaboration and data exchange between researchers.

We demonstrate the following system components: 1. Portal  X  User interface highlighting data access and 2. Applications  X  Data mining examples illustrating data 3. Web Services  X  Examples illustrating data generated
The demonstration will also provide researchers the op-portunity to register feature requests and contribute useful feedback. [1] Ong, K-L., Ng, W-K., &amp; Lim, E-P. A Web Mining [2] http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/ ~ testbed/doc2/ [3] http://www.almaden.ibm.com/webfountain/
