 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ] Algorithms, Experimentation, Measurement This is the workshop report for WOMRAD 2010, the Workshop on Music Recommendation and Discovery held on 26th September 2010 in conjunction with ACM RecSys in Barcelona Spain.

In the last decade, digital music has transformed the land-scape of music experience and distribution. Personal music collections can exceed thousands of tracks, while the Internet has made it simpler than ever to find and access music. In this scenario, music recommendation systems have become increasingly important for listeners to discover and navigate music. Music-centric recommenders such as Last.fm and Pandora have enjoyed commercial and critical success. But how well do these systems work? How good are the recom-mendations? How far into the  X  X ong tail X  can they go before surrendering to bad quality works? The approach of rec-ommending songs as if they were books is limiting; better results can be achieved by taking into account the peculiar-ities of music and the music recommendation process. A successful music recommender should combine insights from user preferences (classical collaborative filtering) with the content (audio analysis, tags, lyrics, etc..) while integrat-ing the social interactions along with the psychological and emotional aspects connected to music consumption. At the Workshop members of the Recommender System, Music In-formation Retrieval, User Modeling, Music Cognition, and Music Psychology communities were able to meet, exchange ideas and collaborate.
