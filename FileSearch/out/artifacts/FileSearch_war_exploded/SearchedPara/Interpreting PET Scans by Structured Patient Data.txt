One of the goals of medical research in the area of de-mentia is to correlate images of the brain with other vari-ables, for instance, demographic information or outcomes of clinical tests. The usual approach is to select a subset of patients based on such variables and analyze the images associated with those patients. In this paper, we apply data mining techniques to take the opposite approach: We start with the images and explain the differences and common-alities in terms of the other variables. In the first step, we cluster PET scans of patients to form groups sharing similar features in brain metabolism. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time ever that clustering is applied to whole PET scans. In the second step, we explain the clusters by relating them to non-image variables. To do so, we em-ploy RSD, an algorithm for relational subgroup discovery, with the cluster membership of patients as target variable. Our results enable interesting interpretations of differences in brain metabolism in terms of demographic and clinical variables. The approach was implemented and tested on an exceptionally large pre-existing data collection of pa-tients with different types of dementia. It comprises 10 GB of image data from 454 PET scans, and 42 variables from psychological and demographical data organized in 11 re-lations of a relational database. We believe that explaining medical images in terms of other variables (patient records, demographic information, etc.) is a challenging new and rewarding area for data mining research.
Every year 200,000 people are diagnosed with some type of dementia in Germany, 40% of which with Alzheimer X  X  disease. Due to the  X  X ging society X , this figure is expected to increase continuously over the next decades. Although some forms of dementia like Alzheimer X  X  disease are well-known and characterized for one hundred years now, the underlying mechanisms are still not sufficiently understood. Therefore, there is great interest in expanding our knowl-edge of various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer X  X  disease.

Generally speaking, the symptoms of Alzheimer X  X  dis-ease are caused by the deposition of pathological proteins in the form of intracellular tangles and extracellular plaques. This deposition is followed by neuron death and deficits in neurotransmitter systems. Furthermore, deficits in glucose metabolism occur, which can be assessed in-vivo by [18]F-FDG Positron-Emission-Tomography (FDG-PET) to detect regional functional pathology.

Given the results from such neuroimaging studies, one of the major goals of medical research is to correlate them with other non-image based variables (e.g., demographic in-formation or clinical data). The usual approach is to se-lect a subset of patients fulfilling specific predefined criteria (e.g., the level of cognitive impairment) and to compare the images associated with those patients to data from healthy controls in a group analysis. However, it is clear that such an approach can never be guaranteed to be complete: If the first step misses an important subset, it is not possible to recover from this omission in subsequent steps. mining and interpretation of results on the right.
Therefore, we propose to apply data mining techniques to take the opposite approach: to start with the images and explain the differences and commonalities in terms of non-image variables. In this way, the results of the analysis are less dependent on the choices made in the selection of patients. In fact, the goal is to obtain a complete list of descriptions of subgroups of patients, which are unusual with respect to the PET images. The approach was imple-mented and tested on data derived from an exceptionally large pre-existing data collection of patients with different types of dementia, collected at our university hospital. In the first step, we clustered FDG-PET scans of patients to form groups sharing similar features in brain metabolism. In the second step, we explained the clusters by relating them to clinical and other non-image variables. To do so, we employed RSD [8, 14], an algorithm for relational sub-group discovery, with the cluster membership of patients as the target variable. After extracting relevant information from 200 GB of data (removing duplicates, intermediate re-sults, and incompletely processed images), we obtained a dataset comprising 10 GB of image data from 454 PETs, and 42 variables from clinical and demographical data or-ganized in 11 relations of a relational database. Large image clusters identified metabolic patterns corresponding well to typical findings in major types of dementia. Furthermore, the approach allowed the detection of differences in cogni-tive performance in presence of comparable brain pathol-ogy, thus potentially helping to identify factors supporting compensation (e.g., age, gender, education).

In summary, the contributions of the paper are as fol-lows: First, we present a new application area and task for data mining in a highly relevant area of medical research. Second, we present the first clustering of whole PET scans. Third, we propose, motivated by medical considerations, a new type of correlation analysis based on a loose coupling of clustering and subgroup discovery. Fourth, the procedure itself is novel in the medical area, as the approach is diame-tral to current practice in the analysis of PET images and deemed highly relevant by medical experts in the field.
This paper is organized as follows: We start with a de-scription of the data set including the preprocessing steps (Section 2). In Section 3 we subsequently explain our work-flow and how we applied the clustering and subgroup dis-covery algorithms to the data set. Section 4 presents our results and their interpretation by medical experts, and Sec-tion 5 discusses the results from a higher perspective. The paper closes with a review of related work (Section 6) and the overall conclusion.
The data was provided by the psychiatry and nuclear medicine departments of Klinikum rechts der Isar of Tech-nische Universit  X  at M  X  unchen. It consists of demographic information, clinical data, including neuropsychological test results, and PET scans showing the patient X  X  cerebral metabolism. We had access to clinical and demographic data of 4,037 patient visits and 454 PET scans that have been collected between 1995 and 2006.
To increase the quality of the data, we revised the exist-ing psychological data of the 1,100 visits of patients having a corresponding PET or liquor (cerebrospinal fluid) exami-nation (test for certain protein levels). Our revision included the correction of typing errors and the completion of elec-tronically available test results. For some patients with PET, a revision was not possible due to missing patient records. 257 PETs belong to patients with revised psychological and demographic values. The overall effort for revising the data was approximately four person months.
PET (positron emission tomography) is a non-invasive medical imaging procedure that has been used for diagnos-tics of dementia since the early eighties. It displays a three-dimensional map of the glucose metabolisms of the body and is based on the decay of radioactive markers, which are injected into the patient. A scanner records the cell activa-tion, and a computer calculates the three-dimensional image of the metabolism. The recorded PETs in this study indicate the metabolism of the brain, i.e., the transformation of glu-cose. This reflects the activity of neural cells. The brain of patients suffering from dementia contains regions, where the metabolism is clearly lowered. In Alzheimer X  X  disease, the pattern of hypometabolism starts at the hippocampus and spreads over the entire cortex as the disease progresses, sparing few areas such as the motor and primary visual cor-tices.

Before physicians can actually use the PET scans, the images have to be processed by a sequence of transforma-tion steps. The image preprocessing pipeline of our study is illustrated in the upper left-hand part of Figure 1. Due to measurement irregularities and the motion of patients dur-ing the recording of the images, each image has to be ro-tated and translated, such that they all fit into the same tem-plate. This is achieved by SPM5 1 . Subsequently, the im-ages are forwarded to (X)MedCon 2 , which transforms the data into raw ASCII files representing the intensity of each voxel as a real value. The last step is the normalization by dividing each voxel value by the mean voxel value of the image. At the end of the preprocessing, each file consists of 69 matrices of 79 rows and 96 columns, summing up to 523,296 voxels. Each of the 69 layers reflects a hori-zontal cut through the brain, presenting a two dimensional image of the layer with voxels displaying the intensity of metabolism of the corresponding region.

In order to visualize a group of scans, we computed a mean image using SPM5. In a mean image, each voxel contains the mean voxel value at that position. The mean image has the advantage of showing the overall properties of a group. Note that each mean image shown in this paper displays only one layer of the three-dimensional mean im-age. We always choose the same layer (layer 32) to facilitate a comparison of the images. However, for the evaluation of clusters, we take into account all 69 layers.
 Figure 2 shows the mean image of 20 healthy controls. The  X  X orth X  displays the frontal region of the brain from an top-down view. The lighter the spots, the more active is the underlying tissue. Both sides of the brain are symmetric in their metabolism. The lateral regions have an elevated metabolism, while the center has lower metabolism. This is due to the fact that the brain cells are residing in the outer areas of the brain, whereas the brain center mostly consists of dendrites.
We had access to demographic data of 4,037 patient vis-its (751 with revised data). The data covers gender, age, years of education, type of graduation and profession.
The clinical data for each patient consists of both psy-chological test results and information about which of the other tests (e.g., MRI, CT, SPECT and EEG) were com-pleted during a hospital visit. Additionally, the diagnosis for each visit is provided in the form of ICD-10 codes [16].
The assessment instruments are the standard tests to di-agnose dementia: Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer X  X  Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Bat-tery ( CERAD test ), Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ), and the clock drawing test . These tests are optionally done at each patient visit at the physician X  X  discretion.
The CERAD test consists of eight subtests which evalu-ate the patient X  X  cognitive abilities in the areas of semantic memory, word finding, visual cognition, orientation, con-centration, direct retentiveness, visuo-construction and de-layed retentiveness. These eight subtests are called: ver-bal fluency (achievable score: 0 - X  ), Boston Naming Test ( BNT ) (0 -15), Mini-Mental-State Examination ( MMSE ) (0 -30), word list learning (0 -30), constructional praxis (0 -11), word list recall (0 -10), word list recognition (0 -20) and constructional praxis recall (0 -11). The healthier a per-son, the more points are expected. It is possible to calculate a score (0 -100) over all CERAD subtests [2]. This score was also integrated in our study.

The CDR consists of seven scores, which describe the capability of patients to handle their daily life. It delivers scores for memory, orientation, judgment, community, ac-tivities, personal care and a global score. Possible values for the scores are 0, 0.5, 1, 2 or 3, where 0 is the best result.
For the clock drawing test, the patient has to draw a clock which shows ten past eleven. The patient is graded in a range from one to six, depending on how well the clock is drawn, and if it shows the correct time. A score of one reflects the perfect clock.
The data mining part of our approach is illustrated on the right-hand side of Figure 1. In the first step, we ap-ply k -Medoids clustering to the image data. The clusters of the best clusterings according to clustering quality and ex-pert evaluation are further interpreted by the corresponding non-image data. For the interpretation of image clusters, we employ RSD (relational subgroup discovery) [8, 14], an algorithm for finding interesting subgroups in data. In sub-group discovery, the goal is to find subgroup descriptions (typically conjunctions of attribute values as in rule learn-ing) for which the distribution of examples with respect to a specified target variable is  X  X nusual X  compared to the over-all target distribution. In our case, clinical and demographic variables form the subgroup descriptions, and the cluster membership is chosen as the target variable. Before ap-plying RSD, we still remove images with incomplete cor-responding non-image data as well as all clusters below a certain size.

In the following, we give a short description of the clus-tering and subgroup discovery algorithms and explain how we applied them to our data.
We chose the k -Medoids algorithm [7] with variance-weighted features to cluster PET scans. Alternative cluster-ing approaches and their results will be discussed in Section 5. As mentioned above, the images have to be normalized and standardized before clustering. The resulting ASCII files (with over 500,000 real-valued entries) were taken as input for k -Medoids. To obtain meaningful and significant clusters using k -Medoids, it is necessary to weight the fea-tures according to their variance. This is feasible due the huge differences in the variance of the intensity in different brain regions. These differences are caused, among others, by activation patterns specific for certain types of dementia

PET scans. and for healthy controls. Moreover, it is clear that not all parts of a PET scan reflect the state of brain tissue: For in-stance, in the PET image, the brain is surrounded by a dark area which is the same for all scans (cf. Figure 2). Figure 3 shows the variance distribution of the voxels in the 32nd layer over all PET scans. As regions of low variance are not very informative for the clustering, we chose to weight each voxel at position ( i, j, k ) by the standard deviation over all PET scans s ijk . Therefore, we obtain the following distance measure based on the Euclidian distance measure with the variables weighted by their standard deviation: dist ( A, B ) =
Since the optimal number k of clusters is not known in advance, we need a quality measure to compare clusterings with different k . One of the few quality measures for clus-terings independent of k is the silhouette coefficient ( SC ) [7]. For a single cluster C of a clustering C it is defined as: where a ( x, C ) is the distance of object x to the medoid of the cluster C it belongs to and b ( x, C ) the distance of object x to second nearest medoid. For an entire clustering C k we used the mean of SC C ( C k ) over all C which is referred to as SC ( C k ) in the following.

It always holds  X  1  X  SC  X  1 . A high SC does not necessarily reflect the best clustering, since SC ( C k ) = 1 for all C k with k = 1 or k = | X | . Generally, SC ( C k ) increases with k  X  X  X | , because SC C ( C k ) = 1 for all clusters C that consist of one example only.
On our data, clustering with more than 30 clusters re-sults in too small clusters despite their high SC s. Cluster-ing with k &lt; 10 is not informative as well, because it tends to find results consisting of two or three very large clusters and single outliers forming their own clusters. In this case, the resulting SC ( C ) is high because outliers forming their own clusters have an SC of 1 , which increases the overall SC . Therefore, the number of appropriate k was expected to be between 10 and 30.

As the results of k -Medoids depend both on the initial choice of medoids and the input order of objects, it was tested 5000 times for each k  X  2 , . . . , 100 , and the clus-tering C  X  k with the maximum SC was chosen. The initial computation of the distance matrix needed two hours, and the 5000 runs took two hours for all k on a 1GB RAM (1.6 GHz) machine.

For the obtained SC distribtution, local maxima exist at k = 10, 12, and 16. We hence chose to further examine these three clusterings using subgroup discovery on the cor-responding clinical and demographic data. Since our anal-ysis showed very similar results for clustering with k = 12 and k = 10 , we omit the presentation of the results for k = 12 , and focus on only those for k = 10 and k = 16 in Section 4.

To determine the significance of a clustering with param-eter k , an additional randomization test was performed. All original scans were shuffled to obtain 454 new images in a way that each voxel occurred again in one of the new scans, while keeping its location. So, the variance for each voxel stays the same. Subsequently, a clustering for parameter k was performed 100 times similarly to the original cluster-ing. The resulting SC s were used to create a sorted list. For a given clustering C k with original data, the p -value can easily be determined by the rank of the corresponding sil-houette coefficient SC ( C k ) in this list. The final validation of the clustering is done by presenting the mean images to an expert, who interpreted them and explained details.
Subgroup Discovery (SD) is a method for finding sub-groups in a dataset that are sufficiently large and statistically unusual given their distribution on an attribute of interest. In this work, we used the subgroup discovery algorithm RSD and its publicly available Prolog implementation 3 [13].
The RSD algorithm is a modification of the CN2 rule learner [4] to find subgroups in a relational dataset. The dif-ficulty of applying a common rule learner to this task is that its covering algorithm is not designed for finding subgroups. It does not take into account examples as soon as they are covered by a rule. This implies that rules discovered in a later iteration are built on a smaller and thus biased sub-set of examples. Therefore, only the first few rules found by a rule learner are appropriate for subgroup discovery, i.e., they have a sufficiently large coverage. To overcome this problem, RSD assigns the weight 1 i +1 to each exam-ple, where i is the number of rules (subgroup descriptions) covering the example. Initially, the weight of each exam-ple is set to one. Whenever a rule is found, the weight is decreased for each covered example. To find large and in-teresting rules even in later iterations, RSD uses the modi-fied weighted relative accuracy ( mW RAcc ) heuristic. For a subgroup with description Cond and target variable Class , it is defined as: where N is the number of examples, n ( Class ) is the number of examples in Class , N 0 is the sum of weights of all examples, n 0 ( Cond ) is the sum of weights of examples covered by the subgroup, and n 0 ( Class.Cond ) is the sum of weights of examples that are covered by the subgroup and actually fall into the class. mW RACC tends to find rules for examples that are least frequently covered by previously discovered rules. Furthermore, mW RACC ensures a bal-ance between generality and relative accuracy. This results in shorter rules which are thus easier to comprehend com-pared to the outcome of a rule induction algorithm.
The parameters of RSD were set as follows: For getting the maximal number of interesting subgroups for each class, the output was increased to 20 subgroups for each class. The beam width was set to 15, and the maximal number of literals in each rule was set to 4. For the clustering results with k = 16 , the running time of RSD on a Pentium 4 (2,8 GHz) with 1 GB RAM was approximately 8 hours.
 To determine the significance of a subgroup ( Class  X  Cond i ) , the likelihood ratio [6] is used: 2  X 
It shows how significantly different the class distribu-tion in a subgroup is from the prior class distribution. The significance can be used to estimate the p -value, which in-dicates the statistical significance of the rule. It is calcu-lated from the  X  2 -distribution with k  X  1 degrees of freedom ( k =number of clusters). As usual, a subgroup is considered significant, if its p -value is below 0.05. Interesting rules were identified by checking their p -value and by expert val-idation.
This section focuses on the clusterings C  X  10 and C  X  16 we present the medical interpretation of the mean images of the obtained clusters. In Section 4.2 and 4.3, we discuss the characteristics of clinical values and subgroup results from RSD with the clusters from the clusterings with k = 16 as the target variable. Moreover, we relate the subgroup descriptions to medical expert knowledge.
Both clusterings (with k = 10 and k = 16) were signif-icant with a p -value less than 0 . 01 as determined by the randomization test. Generally, the clusters vary widely in their size and also encompass singleton clusters, i.e., out-liers. More specifically, the distribution of cluster sizes for clustering C  X  10 is (187, 2, 5, 2, 4, 1, 5, 1, 207, 40), meaning that the first cluster consists of 187 PETs, the second of 2, and so forth. In the following, we refer to the first cluster in this list as Cluster 0, and the i -th as Cluster i  X  1 . Analo-gously, the distribution of cluster sizes for clustering C (2, 42, 1, 8, 105, 104, 28, 40, 8, 1, 3, 61, 1, 1 , 48, 1). Thus, both clusterings found outliers and other very small clusters. In fact, one image that was sorted into its own cluster was rotated upside down. It was therefore most different from all other scans. The other singletons scans were strongly deformed, for which SPM5 is unable to compensate. For instance, some patients kept their chin too close to the chest during the recording.

For all clusters containing at least five PETs, we calcu-lated their mean images (five for clustering with k = 10 , and nine for clustering with k = 16 ). In both clusterings we found clusters grouping patients with frontotemporal de-mentia (Cluster 9 in Figure 4 and Cluster 7 in Figure 7), nearly healthy patients (Cluster 0 in Figure 4 and Cluster 4 in Figure 7) and global hypometabolism (Cluster 3 in Fig-ure 7 and Cluster 2 of C  X  10 not illustrated). Clustering with k = 16 performed better, because it managed to differentiate more precisely the group of left lateral deficiency (Cluster 8 in Figure 7) and a typical Alzheimer X  X  cluster (Cluster 11 of size 61 in Figure 7). Both were not separated by the cluster-ing with k = 10. Even though the remaining clusters cannot be interpreted clearly from a medical point of view, they can be distinguished visually. This can be seen by the differ-ences in metabolism in the occipital and centering regions, which are lighter in Cluster 5 than in Cluster 6 (Figure 7). Cluster 1 shows highly affected patients.

In summary, the clusterings were judged as meaningful by domain experts. To further explain the differences in the cognitive areas, we combined the images with clinical data. In the next section, we present a simple correlation analysis and relate the clusters to single non-image variables. This
Figure 4. Mean images of the three largest clusters of the clustering with k = 10 . serves as a baseline for the more complex approach based on subgroup discovery.
Due to lack of space, we omit a detailed presentation of the clinical values of C  X  10 and only focus on the more interesting clustering of C  X  16 . Looking at the distributions of diagnoses of C  X  16 , some clusters have a high proportion of patients with Alzheimer X  X  disease, while others contain only patients with a cognitive disorder (Figure 5 clusters 4 and 11). This indicates that k -Medoids clustering is capable of grouping similar images together. This is also supported by the MMSE values of the clusters (Figure 6). Cluster 4 has the highest MMSE score and a low variance, indicat-ing that its patients are  X  X ealthy X . In contrast, the MMSE of Cluster 14 is not bad (around 25), but the high variance indicates that there exist some patients that suffer from a more severe disease. The same is true for clusters 8, 11 and 1. This is an interesting finding, because it states that pa-tients with a similar brain metabolism may have different cognitive abilities. Cluster 8 comprises patients which have a left lateral metabolic deficiency, so the low MMSE score can be explained well. Again, the high variation states that some people might not be impaired too much from this hy-pometabolism.

As age is correlated with the progress of dementia, we also investigated the distribution of age among the clusters. The difference between Cluster 14 and Cluster 4 is approxi-mately 20 years. The average age of Cluster 14 is around 80 while Cluster 4 has younger people of age 60, which goes hand in hand with the distribution of ICD10 codes that de-fine Cluster 4 as a  X  X ealthy X  cluster. Cluster 3 also has a very high average age and a low variance characterizing old morbid people with an advanced hypometabolism.

Concerning the gender distribution of each cluster, Clus-ter 4 and 14 have a higher fraction of women, while Cluster 11 holds more men. This is quite interesting, because it suggests that there might be some differences in the devel-opment of dementia between the genders. Another expla-
Figure 5. Distribution of ICD10 codes for clus-ters of C  X  16
Figure 6. Distribution of the MMSE score for clusters of C  X  16 nation may be a different behavior as to when a physician is consulted.

This first overview of attributes in the clusters shows their general characteristics. However, simple correlation analysis is not able to detect dependencies among the at-tributes. Clearly, the correlation of multiple attributes can only be analyzed by more complex methods like subgroup discovery. It allows us to explore the interaction of at-tributes within a cluster. For instance, Cluster 14 has a high variance in MMSE scores and an unbalanced gender distri-bution, but so far we cannot see if men have a better MMSE score than women, or if there is no significant difference be-tween the genders. Identifying subgroups helps to combine interesting characteristics and allows to take into account several variables at once.
Our application of subgroup mining requires reliable psychological data and sufficiently large clusters. Thus, we first discard those examples without revised psychological data. Next, we eliminate all clusters with less than 5 exam-ples after the first filtering step. Thus we only kept seven clusters for the further analysis of C  X  16 : Clusters 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 14, containing (22, 69, 58, 17, 13, 37, 29) images (initially (42, 105, 104, 28, 40, 61, 48)). Figure 7 shows those clusters and those having more than five images be-fore the filtering steps (Cluster 3 and Cluster 8).
In this clustering we find a cluster (Cluster 4) that re-sembles the mean image of the healthy controls. Since no hypometabolism is visible, medical experts interpreted it as representing a group of almost healthy patients. Table 1 shows a subset of the interesting subgroups discovered for Cluster 4. Groups of young patients (A22) and groups of patients with very good test results (A21, A23) were dis-covered. So, the clustering identified a  X  X ealthy X  group that was supported by both subgroup discovery and experts.
Cluster 7 describes patients that have a huge deficit in the frontotemporal metabolism. This leads to the conclu-sion that they are not affected by Alzheimer X  X  disease, but by some other form of dementia. Furthermore, experts as-sumed no significant reduction of CERAD constructional praxis , while CERAD verbal fluency is highly impaired as well as scores in CDR . Significant subgroups that show the impairement were found for clustering with k = 16 and k = 10 (not shown).

The mean image of Cluster 11 is the prototype of a pa-tient with Alzheimer X  X  disease, which is confirmed by the subgroups displayed in Table 2. 78.4% of the patients in this cluster have the disease, which is visible in the mean image through the reduction of metabolism in the temporoparietal cortex. In fact, this is not the only cluster with a high ratio of patients with Alzheimer X  X  disease. In Cluster 6, 70% of the patients suffer from the disease. This was confirmed by subgroups containing an Alzheimer X  X  diagnosis. Contrary to Cluster 11, in Cluster 6 also the frontal metabolism is reduced. This is reflected in worse (higher) results of CDR.
Regarding the subgroups found for Cluster 14 (Table 3) it seems that this cluster describes elderly women (A124, A129, A133) with low test results and therefore a similar state of dementia. Surprisingly, there is a group of men with high MMSE scores (A126). Although this subgroup is not significant, it is highly interesting. It indicates that men with the same metabolic patterns as women have a less impaired cognitive ability. Further investigations (Table 4) showed that men and women are in the same age group, but men do have slightly better overall results in the most impor-tant psychological tests. Although female and male patients fall into the same cluster (based on brain metabolism), they apparently differ in their cognitive abilities. This finding may possibly be explained by the hypothesis of cognitive reserve, which postulates that some individuals can some-how offset the symptoms of neurodegeneration. Although Table 1. Interesting subgroups in Cluster 4 of subgroup sg having a PET in cluster cl . In the patients with a PET in cluster cl that are also covered by the subgroup description of sg . the neurobiological substrate is still unknown, the higher neuron count in men might be associated with higher re-serve. To show the same symptoms of dementia as women, men have to suffer from a larger loss of cells. Another factor discussed in dementia research [11] is the education level, which is also higher among the men in this cluster, com-pared to the women. Here we now see an example of the power of subgroups. The method allows not only to de-scribe sets of instances, but also to bring up groups with unusual and therefore interesting features, which cannot be found by simple correlation studies.

Altogether, we can conclude that the clustering with k = 16 produces more meaningful clusters than the clus-tering with k = 10 . Even though all subgroups displayed are statistically significant (see the p -values), C  X  16 ates more accurately. For example, it detects an  X  X lzheimer cluster X  (Cluster 11), whereas the distribution of patients with Alzheimer X  X  disease in C  X  10 is (39, 48, 5). Therefore, none of the clusters in C  X  10 shows a preference of being a definite  X  X lzheimer cluster X .
As they reflect, in some sense, the  X  X round truth X  of the state of a brain, we chose PET images as the starting point of our analysis. The differences between different states are then explained by non-image variables. The presented ap-proach uses k -Medoids and RSD to achieve those tasks, but we also considered and tested other methods for clustering

Figure 7. Mean images of the nine largest clusters of the clustering with k = 16 . In the second row on the right is the mean image of the control group C (healthy patients). and correlation analysis. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we also tested the subspace clustering method PreDeCon [1], but could not identify appropriate parameter settings to obtain significant results. As a further test, we clustered the images with hierarchical agglomerative clus-tering (complete linkage). This method also found the out-liers mentioned above and sorted the  X  X ealthy X  patients into one cluster. However, although the two clustering methods produced largely similar results, they differed in the par-tition of unspecific clusters, which may explained by the  X  X yopia X  of the hierarchical clustering scheme. To estab-lish a baseline for the subgroup discovery, we performed a simple correlation analysis based on individual variables. Our experiments confirmed that this is clearly not sufficient, as many of the more complex subgroups cannot be detected in this way.

From a medical point of view, we showed that it is possi-ble to obtain meaningful clusters of PET scan images. Med-ical experts could identify different patterns of disease, and confirmed that the resulting findings (clusters, outliers and subgroups) have medical novelty and significance. As men-tioned above, the new approach of reversing the direction of the analysis, i.e., starting with the PET scan images, is considered new in this area.
Data mining in the context of dementia and Alzheimer X  X  disease can be roughly categorized into three categories: First, machine learning approaches for the improvement of differential diagnosis. Second, data mining techniques ap-plied to brain imaging data. Third, transcriptomics and pro-teomics analysis of dementia and Alzheimer X  X  disease.
One of the earliest work from the first category deals with the prediction of the type of dementia (Alzheimer X  X  disease, vascular dementia, or other) from a small set of de-mographic variables and the total scores from clinical tests [9]. The latter variables included measures of category flu-ency, letter fluency, delayed free recall and recognition, sim-ple and complex attention span, visual-constructional abil-ities, and object naming. Similarly, Corani et al. [5] pre-dicted different types of dementia (Alzheimer X  X  disease, de-mentia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson X  X  disease with demen-tia and vascular dementia) from cognitive profiles based on the Cognitive Drug Research (CoDR) system. CoDR con-sists of a series of computerized tests (tasks), which assess some cognitive faculties of the patient, such as memory, at-tention, and reaction times. The results from those tests to-gether constitute the cognitive profile of a patient.
Megalooikonomou et al. [10] give a survey of data min-ing techniques applied to brain imaging data. The goal is to discover interesting associations and patterns between brain images and other clinical data. Clustering is applied to find groups of inter-related voxels, not to find groups of images. To the best of our knowledge, clustering methods have not been applied to whole PET scans before.

The third category includes a study of gene expression changes in patients with Alzheimer X  X  disease [15] and a study aiming for the discovery of Alzheimer-relevant pro-teins [3].

The work presented in this paper differs from previous work in its combined analysis of PET images and clinical variables. Similar to work in the first category, the results are mainly useful for diagnostic purposes. Although bio-logical information in the form of transcriptomics or pro-teomics data is not yet used in our approach, it is easy to incorporate it in the subgroup descriptions or even as the target for subgroup discovery.
In the paper, we introduced a new and challenging prob-lem for data mining research: correlating large databases of PET scans with structured patient data. The goal of the work was not to develop completely new methods, but to show that current data mining methods like RSD are able to solve this large (initially 200 GB) and complex (image data and 11 relations) problem and produce valid and relevant re-sults. The task itself is critical to gain a better understanding of various forms of dementia. The presented approach aims for more completeness than previous methods. To do so, we first identified clusters of PET scans sharing similar fea-tures in brain metabolism. In the second step, we explained the differences and commonalities among those clusters in terms of clinical and demographic variables. To validate the results, we computed p -values of the clusterings and inter-preted the clusters and subgroup descriptions in the light of domain knowledge. To the best of knowledge, this type of analysis has not been done before. One of the subproblems, the clustering of whole PET scans (not voxels), also has not been addressed in the literature before.
In future work, we are planning to further improve the quality of the clusterings by taking into account more ad-vanced features (e.g., brain regions) and by developing more advanced methods specifically for high-dimensional PET images. Moreover, standard algorithms for subgroup discovery suffer from similar problems as algorithms for pattern mining and association rule mining. For instance, it is necessary to filter interdependent results, as the refine-ment (specialization) of an  X  X nteresting X  subgroup is likely to produce another  X  X nteresting X  subgroup. Another limit-ing factor of the subgroup discovery approach is the incom-pleteness of the psychological data. Finally, the integration of gene expression and proteomic data could aid in the for-mation of mechanistic hypotheses.

Another possible approach would be to apply methods from constraint-based clustering (e.g., by Sese et al. [12]), such that only clusters constrained by descriptions of non-image variables are considered. While this would be in-teresting as well, we are explicitly aiming for  X  X nbiased X  clusters to enable the discovery of new patterns and associ-ations.

In summary, we believe that explaining medical images in terms of other variables (patient records, demographic information, etc.) is a challenging new and rewarding task for data mining research.
