 efficiency, but also a matter of effectiveness. To use the technologies effectively, we still need a solid under-standing of the characteristics and principles of information access systems. Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo (2005) is not only a good textbook for database and information retrieval classes, but also a good reference for all novices and experienced audience who want to understand how library science is still meaningful in this information age, and to design databases for textual information objects.

The modern society is dominated by information and, as such, the information systems are an essential asset for the success of most business. This book, written by three great specialists in the area of informa-tion technologies, encloses a series of topics on the application of information systems in various aspects of business processes. There are a lot of books about Information Systems and alike but only a limited number of texts that can be used in introductory courses. This text belongs to the introductory type and is a valu-able resource for undergraduate and lower level graduate students in a wide range of courses. All the three authors have a lot of experience in this area and thus are a guaranty of text X  X  quality. The main topics cov-ered by this book are: Information Systems, Digital Economy, Ethics, Privacy, and Information Security,
Data and Knowledge Management, Network Computing, Electronic Commerce, Wireless, Mobile Comput-ing, and Organizational Information Systems. It covers those topics not only from a teaching perspective but also with strong case studies from different industries that can easily be applied in various practical situations.

The book is divided into 10 chapters and two additional small guides, one about computer hardware and the other concerning systems and application software. The first chapter covers the basics of information tech-nology and information systems, provides the structure of the text and explains the aims and target applica-tions of the book. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with importance of information in business and ethics and privacy issues, respectively. In modern societies information is growing in an exponential form meaning that we have to find a form of controlling such data flood. Chapter 4 discusses data management solutions to that problem.
However, the student reading this chapter will have a poor understanding of data management issues due to the fact that the matter is too much condensed, and important topics such as relational databases and data warehousing systems are only briefly resumed.

In the next two chapters, the authors discusses communications, networks, including internet, and e-busi-ness and e-commerce. This last chapter is very well focused and provides the student with a solid background in those issues. Chapter 7 explores the wireless communications impact on information systems.

Chapters 8 X 10 provides a lot of material about the role of information systems in modern organizations, decision support tools and the development or acquiring of new computer applications.

Finally, the last part of the book comprehends two technology guides, the first one about hardware and the second provides a look to software. These two components are the foundation of any information system and the text, although somehow short in those two matters; nevertheless provide to the student the essential basics on those two topics.

There are two very interesting aspects in this text: one is the so called online supplements , which includes the instructor and student companion sites, test bank, on-line quizzes and PowerPoint presentations. The second feature that I particularly liked is the set of cases studies; the cases are organized around a concrete subject and shows how information technology and information systems can be used to help businesses improve and sur-vive. Taking in consideration all these aspects this book is a wonderful teaching resource for an lower level graduate or undergraduate course.

Potter is a well written and structured book; the chapters are edited carefully and can be easily read. Due to its introductory level some topics are relatively poor developed but the target audience is undoubtedly in presence of a good work. Students who used this book will rapidly understand the most important topics of information systems, and their relation to the business world. This book provides a good start for student and professionals interested in acquiring basic know-how about information systems.

Various social, economic, political, and technological factors continue to impact on the ways that organi-zations are staffed, structured, and financed. How to effectively manage in such a world of driving forces and uncertain changes, presents a series of unrelenting challenges for all mangers including those in library and information services.
 The Guide to Library and Information Agency Management co-authored by Charles Curran and Lewis
Miller, two professors of Library and Information Science, is both a field guide and textbook that is aimed at a broad range of library and information mangers, from the inexperienced to the experienced. As outlined by the authors, the emphasis is on the term field since guides of that nature, have four identifiable functions: to
