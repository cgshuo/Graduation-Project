 In this paper we present experiments with an au-tomatic system for semantic role labeling (SRL) that is designed to model aspects of human lan-guage acquisition. This simplified SRL system is inspired by the syntactic bootstrapping theory, and by an account of syntactic bootstrapping known as  X  X tructure-mapping X  (Fisher, 1996; Gillette et al., 1999; Lidz et al., 2003). Syntactic bootstrap-ping theory proposes that young children use their very partial knowledge of syntax to guide sen-tence comprehension. The structure-mapping ac-count makes three key assumptions: First, sen-tence comprehension is grounded by the acquisi-tion of an initial set of concrete nouns. Nouns are arguably less dependent on prior linguistic knowl-edge for their acquisition than are verbs; thus chil-dren are assumed to be able to identify the refer-ents of some nouns via cross-situational observa-tion (Gillette et al., 1999). Second, these nouns, once identified, yield a skeletal sentence structure. Children treat each noun as a candidate argument, and thus interpret the number of nouns in the sen-tence as a cue to its semantic predicate-argument structure (Fisher, 1996). Third, children represent sentences in an abstract format that permits gener-alization to new verbs (Gertner et al., 2006).
The structure-mapping account of early syn-tactic bootstrapping makes strong predictions, in-cluding predictions of tell-tale errors. In the sen-tence  X  X llen and John laughed X , an intransitive verb appears with two nouns. If young chil-dren rely on representations of sentences as sim-ple as an ordered set of nouns, then they should have trouble distinguishing such sentences from transitive sentences. Experimental evidence sug-gests that they do: 21-month-olds mistakenly in-terpreted word order in sentences such as  X  X he girl and the boy kradded X  as conveying agent-patient roles (Gertner and Fisher, 2006).

Previous computational experiments with a system for automatic semantic role labeling (BabySRL: (Connor et al., 2008)) showed that it is possible to learn to assign basic semantic roles based on the shallow sentence representa-tions proposed by the structure-mapping view. Furthermore, these simple structural features were robust to drastic reductions in the integrity of the semantic-role feedback (Connor et al., 2009). These experiments showed that representations of sentence structure as simple as  X  X irst of two nouns X  are useful, but the experiments relied on perfect knowledge of arguments and predicates as a start to classification.

Perfect built-in parsing finesses two problems facing the human learner. The first problem in-volves classifying words by part-of-speech. Pro-posed solutions to this problem in the NLP and human language acquisition literatures focus on distributional learning as a key data source (e.g., (Mintz, 2003; Johnson, 2007)). Importantly, infants are good at learning distributional pat-terns (Gomez and Gerken, 1999; Saffran et al., 1996). Here we use a fairly standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to generate clusters of words that occur in similar distributional contexts in a corpus of input sentences.

The second problem facing the learner is more contentious: Having identified clusters of distributionally-similar words, how do children figure out what role these clusters of words should play in a sentence interpretation system? Some clusters contain nouns, which are candidate ar-guments; others contain verbs, which take argu-ments. How is the child to know which are which? In order to use the output of the HMM tagger to process sentences for input to an SRL model, we must find a way to automatically label the clusters.
Our strategies for automatic argument and pred-icate identification, spelled out below, reflect core claims of the structure-mapping theory: (1) The meanings of some concrete nouns can be learned without prior linguistic knowledge; these concrete nouns are assumed based on their meanings to be possible arguments; (2) verbs are identified, not primarily by learning their meanings via observa-tion, but rather by learning about their syntactic argument-taking behavior in sentences.

By using the HMM part-of-speech tagger in this way, we can ask how the simple structural fea-tures that we propose children start with stand up to reductions in parsing accuracy. In doing so, we move to a parser derived from a particular theoret-ical account of how the human learner might clas-sify words, and link them into a system for sen-tence comprehension. We model language learning as a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task (Carreras and M ` arquez, 2004). This allows us to ask whether a learner, equipped with particular theoretically-motivated representations of the input, can learn to under-stand sentences at the level of who did what to whom. The architecture of our system is similar to a previous approach to modeling early language acquisition (Connor et al., 2009), which is itself based on the standard architecture of a full SRL system (e.g. (Punyakanok et al., 2008)).

This basic approach follows a multi-stage pipeline, with each stage feeding in to the next. The stages are: (1) Parsing the sentence, (2) Iden-tifying potential predicates and arguments based on the parse, (3) Classifying role labels for each potential argument relative to a predicate, (4) Ap-plying constraints to find the best labeling of ar-guments for a sentence. In this work we attempt to limit the knowledge available at each stage to the automatic output of the previous stage, con-strained by knowledge that we argue is available to children in the early stages of language learn-ing.

In the parsing stage we use an unsupervised parser based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), modeling a simple  X  X redict the next word X  parser. Next the argument identification stage identifies HMM states that correspond to possible argu-ments and predicates. The candidate arguments and predicates identified in each input sentence are passed to an SRL classifier that uses simple ab-stract features based on the number and order of arguments to learn to assign semantic roles.
As input to our learner we use samples of natural child directed speech (CDS) from the CHILDES corpora (MacWhinney, 2000). During initial unsupervised parsing we experiment with incorporating knowledge through a combination of statistical priors favoring a skewed distribution of words into classes, and an initial hard cluster-ing of the vocabulary into function and content words. The argument identifier uses a small set of frequent nouns to seed argument states, relying on the assumptions that some concrete nouns can be learned as a prerequisite to sentence interpreta-tion, and are interpreted as candidate arguments.
The SRL classifier starts with noisy largely un-supervised argument identification, and receives feedback based on annotation in the PropBank style; in training, each word identified as an argu-ment receives the true role label of the phrase that word is part of. This represents the assumption that learning to interpret sentences is naturally su-pervised by the fit of the learner X  X  predicted mean-ing with the referential context. The provision of perfect  X  X old-standard X  feedback over-estimates the real child X  X  access to this supervision, but al-lows us to investigate the consequences of noisy argument identification for SRL performance. We show that even with imperfect parsing, a learner can identify useful abstract patterns for sentence interpretation. Our ultimate goal is to  X  X lose the loop X  of this system, by using learning in the SRL system to improve the initial unsupervised parse and argument identification.

The training data were samples of parental speech to three children (Adam, Eve, and Sarah; (Brown, 1973)), available via CHILDES. The SRL training corpus consists of parental utter-ances in samples Adam 01-20 (child age 2;3 -3;1), Eve 01-18 (1;6 -2;2), and Sarah 01-83 (2;3 -3;11). All verb-containing utterances without symbols indicating disfluencies were automatically parsed with the Charniak parser (Charniak, 1997), anno-tated using an existing SRL system (Punyakanok et al., 2008) and then errors were hand-corrected. The final annotated sample contains about 16,730 propositions, with 32,205 arguments. As a first step of processing, we feed the learner large amounts of unlabeled text and expect it to learn some structure over this data that will facil-itate future processing. The source of this text is child directed speech collected from various projects in the CHILDES repository 1 . We re-moved sentences with fewer than three words or markers of disfluency. In the end we used 160 thousand sentences from this set, totaling over 1 million tokens and 10 thousand unique words.
The goal of the parsing stage is to give the learner a representation permitting it to generalize over word forms. The exact parse we are after is a distributional and context-sensitive clustering of words based on sequential processing. We chose an HMM based parser for this since, in essence the HMM yields an unsupervised POS classifier, but without names for states. An HMM trained with expectation maximization (EM) is analogous to a simple process of predicting the next word in a stream and correcting connections accordingly for each sentence.
With HMM we can also easily incorporate ad-ditional knowledge during parameter estimation. The first (and simplest) parser we used was an HMM trained using EM with 80 hidden states. The number of hidden states was made relatively large to increase the likelihood of clusters corre-sponding to a single part of speech, while preserv-ing some degree of generalization.

Johnson (2007) observed that EM tends to cre-ate word clusters of uniform size, which does not reflect the way words cluster into parts of speech in natural languages. The addition of pri-ors biasing the system toward a skewed alloca-tion of words to classes can help. The second parser was an 80 state HMM trained with Varia-tional Bayes EM (VB) incorporating Dirichlet pri-ors (Beal, 2003). 2
In the third and fourth parsers we experi-ment with enriching the HMM POS-tagger with other psycholinguistically plausible knowledge. Words of different grammatical categories dif-fer in their phonological as well as in their dis-tributional properties (e.g., (Kelly, 1992; Mon-aghan et al., 2005; Shi et al., 1998)); combining phonological and distributional information im-proves the clustering of words into grammatical categories. The phonological difference between content and function words is particularly strik-ing (Shi et al., 1998). Even newborns can cate-gorically distinguish content and function words, based on the phonological difference between the two classes (Shi et al., 1999). Human learners may treat content and function words as distinct classes from the start.

To implement this division into function and content words 3 , we start with a list of function word POS tags 4 and then find words that appear predominantly with these POS tags, using tagged WSJ data (Marcus et al., 1993). We allocated a fixed number of states for these function words, and left the rest of the states for the rest of the words. This amounts to initializing the emission matrix for the HMM with a block structure; words from one class cannot be emitted by states al-located to the other class. This trick has been used before in speech recognition work (Rabiner, 1989), and requires far fewer resources than the full tagging dictionary that is often used to intel-ligently initialize an unsupervised POS classifier (e.g. (Brill, 1997; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Ravi and Knight, 2009)).

Because the function and content word preclus-tering preceded parameter estimation, it can be combined with either EM or VB learning. Al-though this initial split forces sparsity on the emis-sion matrix and allows more uniform sized clus-ters, Dirichlet priors may still help, if word clus-ters within the function or content word subsets vary in size and frequency. The third parser was an 80 state HMM trained with EM estimation, with 30 states pre-allocated to function words; the fourth parser was the same except that it was trained with VB EM. 3.1 Parser Evaluation
We first evaluate these parsers (the first stage of our SRL system) on unsupervised POS tag-ging. Figure 1 shows the performance of the four systems using Variation of Information to mea-sure match between gold states and unsupervised parsers as we vary the amount of text they receive. Each point on the graph represents the average re-sult over 10 runs of the HMM with different sam-ples of the unlabeled CDS. Another common mea-sure for unsupervised POS (when there are more states than tags) is a many to one greedy mapping of states to tags. It is known that EM gives a better many to one score than VB trained HMM (John-son, 2007), and likewise we see that here: with all data EM gives 0.75 matching, VB gives 0.74, while both EM+Funct and VB+Funct reach 0.80. Adding the function/content word split to the HMM structure improves both EM and VB esti-mation in terms of both tag matching accuracy and information. However, these measures look at the parser only in isolation. What is more important to us is how useful the provided word clusters are for future semantic processing. In the next sections we use the outputs of our four parsers to identify arguments and predicates. The unsupervised parser provides a state label for each word in each sentence; the goal of the ar-gument identification stage is to use these states to label words as potential arguments, predicates or neither. As described in the introduction, core premises of the structure-mapping account offer routes whereby we could label some HMM states as argument or predicate states.

The structure-mapping account holds that sen-tence comprehension is grounded in the learning of an initial set of nouns. Children are assumed to identify the referents of some concrete nouns via cross-situational learning (Gillette et al., 1999; Smith and Yu, 2008). Children then assume, by virtue of the meanings of these nouns, that they are candidate arguments. This is a simple form of se-mantic bootstrapping, requiring the use of built-in links between semantics and syntax to identify the grammatical type of known words (Pinker, 1984). We use a small set of known nouns to transform unlabeled word clusters into candidate arguments for the SRL: HMM states that are dominated by known names for animate or inanimate objects are assumed to be argument states.

Given text parsed by the HMM parser and a list of known nouns, the argument identifier pro-ceeds in multiple steps as illustrated in figure 2. The first stage identifies as argument states those states that appear at least half the time in the train-ing data with known nouns. This use of a seed list and distributional clustering is similar to Proto-type Driven Learning (Haghighi and Klein, 2006), except we are only providing information on one specific class.
As a list of known nouns we collected all those nouns that appear three times or more in the child directed speech training data and judged to be ei-ther animate or inanimate nouns. The full set of 365 nouns covers over 93% of noun occurences in our data. In upcoming sections we experiment with varying the number of seed nouns used from this set, selecting the most frequent set of nouns. Reflecting the spoken nature of the child directed speech, the most frequent nouns are pronouns, but beyond the top 10 we see nouns naming peo-ple ( X  X addy X ,  X  X rsula X ) and object nouns ( X  X hair X ,  X  X unch X ).

What about verbs? A typical SRL model iden-tifies candidate arguments and tries to assign roles to them relative to each verb in the sentence. In principle one might suppose that children learn the meanings of verbs via cross-situational ob-servation just as they learn the meanings of con-crete nouns. But identifying the meanings of verbs is much more troublesome. Verbs X  mean-ings are abstract, therefore harder to identify based on scene information alone (Gillette et al., 1999). As a result, early vocabularies are dominated by nouns (Gentner, 2006). On the structure-mapping account, learners identify verbs, and begin to de-termine their meanings, based on sentence struc-ture cues. Verbs take noun arguments; thus, learn-ers could learn which words are verbs by detect-ing each verb X  X  syntactic argument-taking behav-ior. Experimental evidence provides some support for this procedure: 2-year-olds keep track of the syntactic structures in which a new verb appears, even without a concurrent scene that provides cues to the verb X  X  semantic content (Yuan and Fisher, 2009).

We implement this behavior by identifying as predicate states the HMM states that appear com-monly with a particular number of previously identified arguments. First, we collect statistics over the entire HMM training corpus regarding how many arguments are identified per sentence, and which states that are not identified as argu-ment states appear with each number of argu-ments. Next, for each parsed sentence that serves as SRL input, the algorithm chooses as the most likely predicate the word whose state is most likely to appear with the number of arguments found in the current input sentence. Note that this algo-rithm assumes exactly one predicate per sentence. Implicitly, the argument count likelihood divides predicate states up into transitive and intransitive predicates based on appearances in the simple sen-tences of CDS. 4.1 Argument Identification Evaluation Figure 3 shows argument and predicate identifi-cation accuracy for each of the four parsers when provided with different numbers of known nouns. The known word list is very skewed with its most frequent members dominating the total noun oc-currences in the data. The ten most frequent words 5 account for 60% of the total noun occur-rences. We achieve the different occurrence cov-erage numbers of figure 3 by using the most fre-quent N words from the list that give the specific coverage 6 . Pronouns refer to people or objects, but are abstract in that they can refer to any person or object. The inclusion of pronouns in our list of known nouns represents the assumption that tod-dlers have already identified pronouns as referen-tial terms. Even 19-month-olds assign appropri-ately different interpretations to novel verbs pre-sented in simple transitive versus intransitive sen-tences with pronoun arguments ( X  X e X  X  kradding him! X  vs.  X  X e X  X  kradding! X ; (Yuan et al., 2007)). In ongoing work we experiment with other meth-ods of identifying seed nouns.

Two groups of curves appear in figure 3: the upper group shows the primary argument iden-tification accuracy and the bottom group shows the predicate identification accuracy. We evaluate compared to gold tagged data with true argument and predicate boundaries. The primary argument (A0-4) identification accuracy is the F1 value, with precision calculated as the proportion of identified arguments that appear as part of a true argument, and recall as the proportion of true arguments that have some state identified as an argument. F1 is calculated similarly for predicate identification, as one state per sentence is identified as the predicate.
As shown in figure 3, argument identification F1 is higher than predicate identification (which is to be expected, given that predicate identification de-pends on accurate arguments), and as we add more seed nouns the argument identification improves. Surprisingly, despite the clear differences in un-supervised POS performance seen in figure 1, the different parsers do not yield very different argu-ment and predicate identification. As we will see in the next section, however, when the arguments identified in this step are used to train SRL clas-sifier, distinctions between parsers reappear, sug-gesting that argument identification F1 masks sys-tematic patterns in the errors. Finally, we used the results of the previous pars-ing and argument-identification stages in training a simplified SRL classifier (BabySRL), equipped with sets of features derived from the structure-mapping account. For argument classification we used a linear classifier trained with a regularized perceptron update rule (Grove and Roth, 2001). In the results reported below the BabySRL did not use sentence-level inference for the final clas-sification, every identified argument is classified independently; thus multiple nouns can have the same role. In what follows, we compare the per-formance of the BabySRL across the four parsers. We evaluated SRL performance by testing the BabySRL with constructed sentences like those used for the experiments with children described in the Introduction. All test sentences contained a novel verb, to test the model X  X  ability to general-ize.

We examine the performance of four versions of the BabySRL, varying in the features used to represent sentences. All four versions include lexical features consisting of the target argument and predicate (as identified in the previous steps). The baseline model has only these lexical features (Lexical). Following Connor et al. (2008; 2009), the key feature type we propose is noun pattern features (NounPat). Noun pattern features indi-cate how many nouns there are in the sentence and which noun the target is. For example, in  X  X ou dropped it! X ,  X  X ou X  has a feature active indicating that it is the first of two nouns, while  X  X t X  has a fea-ture active indicating that it is the second of two nouns. We compared the behavior of noun pat-tern features to another simple representation of word order, position relative to the verb (VerbPos). In the same example sentence,  X  X ou X  has a feature active indicating that it is pre-verbal; for  X  X t X  a fea-ture is active indicating that it is post-verbal. A fourth version of the BabySRL (Combined) used both NounPat and VerbPos features.

We structured our tests of the BabySRL to test the predictions of the structure-mapping account. (1) NounPat features will improve the SRL X  X  abil-ity to interpret simple transitive test sentences containing two nouns and a novel verb, relative to a lexical baseline. Like 21-month-old chil-dren (Gertner et al., 2006), the SRL should inter-pret the first noun as an agent and the second as a patient. (2) Because NounPat features represent word order solely in terms of a sequence of nouns, an SRL equipped with these features will make the errors predicted by the structure-mapping account and documented in children (Gertner and Fisher, 2006). (3) NounPat features permit the SRL to assign different roles to the subjects of transitive and intransitive sentences that differ in their num-ber of nouns. This effect follows from the nature of the NounPat features: These features partition the training data based on the number of nouns, and therefore learn separately the likely roles of the  X 1st of 1 noun X  and the  X 1st of 2 nouns X . These patterns contrast with the behavior of the VerbPos features: When the BabySRL was trained with perfect parsing, VerbPos promoted agent-patient interpretations of transitive test sentences, and did so even more successfully than Noun-Pat features did, reflecting the usefulness of po-sition relative to the verb in understanding English sentences. In addition, VerbPos features elimi-nated the errors with two-noun intransitive sen-tences. Given test sentences such as  X  X ou and Mommy krad X , VerbPos features represented both nouns as pre-verbal, and therefore identified both as likely agents. However, VerbPos features did not help the SRL assign different roles to the subjects of simple transitive and intransitive sen-tences:  X  X ommy X  in  X  X ommy krads you X  and  X  X ommy krads X  are both represented simply as pre-verbal.

To test the system X  X  predictions on transitive and intransitive two noun sentences, we constructed two test sentence templates:  X  X  krads B X  and  X  X  and B krad X , where A and B were replaced with familiar animate nouns. The animate nouns were selected from all three children X  X  data in the train-ing set and paired together in the templates such that all pairs are represented.

Figure 4 shows SRL performance on test sen-tences containing a novel verb and two animate nouns. Each plot shows the proportion of test sen-tences that were assigned an agent-patient (A0-A1) role sequence; this sequence is correct for transitive sentences but is an error for two-noun intransitive sentences. Each group of bars shows the performance of the BabySRL trained using one of the four parsers, equipped with each of our four feature sets. The top and bottom panels in Figure 4 differ in the number of nouns provided to seed the argument identification stage. The top row shows performance with 10 seed nouns (the 10 most fre-quent nouns, mostly animate pronouns), and the bottom row shows performance with 365 concrete (animate or inanimate) nouns treated as known. Relative to the lexical baseline, NounPat features fared well: they promoted the assignment of A0-A1 interpretations to transitive sentences, across all parser versions and both sets of known nouns. Both VB estimation and the content-function word split increased the ability of NounPat features to learn that the first of two nouns was an agent, and the second a patient. The NounPat features also promote the predicted error with two-noun intran-sitive sentences (Figures 4(b), 4(d)). Despite the relatively low accuracy of predicate identification noted in section 4.1, the VerbPos features did suc-ceed in promoting an A0A1 interpretation for tran-sitive sentences containing novel verbs relative to the lexical baseline. In every case the performance of the Combined model that includes both Noun-Pat and VerbPos features exceeds the performance of either NounPat or VerbPos alone, suggesting both contribute to correct predictions for transitive sentences. However, the performance of VerbPos features did not improve with parsing accuracy as did the performance of the NounPat features. Most strikingly, the VerbPos features did not eliminate the predicted error with two-noun intransitive sen-tences, as shown in panels 4(b) and 4(d). The Combined model predicted an A0A1 sequence for these sentences, showing no reduction in this error due to the participation of VerbPos features.
Table 1 shows SRL performance on the same transitive test sentences ( X  X  krads B X ), compared to simple one-noun intransitive sentences ( X  X  krads X ). To permit a direct comparison, the table reports the proportion of transitive test sentences for which the first noun was assigned an agent (A0) interpretation, and the proportion of intran-sitive test sentences with the agent (A0) role as-signed to the single noun in the sentence. Here we report only the results from the best-performing parser (trained with VB EM, and content/function word pre-clustering), compared to the same clas-sifiers trained with gold standard argument iden-tification. When trained on arguments identified via the unsupervised POS tagger, noun pattern features promoted agent interpretations of tran-sitive subjects, but not for intransitive subjects. This differentiation between transitive and intran-sitive sentences was clearer when more known nouns were provided. Verb position features, in contrast, promote agent interpretations of subjects weakly with unsupervised argument identification, but equally for transitive and intransitive.
Noun pattern features were robust to increases in parsing noise. The behavior of verb position features suggests that variations in the identifiabil-ity of different parts of speech can affect the use-fulness of alternative representations of sentence structure. Representations that reflect the posi-tion of the verb may be powerful guides for un-derstanding simple English sentences, but repre-sentations reflecting only the number and order of nouns can dominate early in acquisition, depend-ing on the integrity of parsing decisions. The key innovation in the present work is the combination of unsupervised part-of-speech tag-ging and argument identification to permit learn-ing in a simplified SRL system. Children do not have the luxury of treating part-of-speech tagging and semantic role labeling as separable tasks. In-stead, they must learn to understand sentences starting from scratch, learning the meanings of some words, and using those words and their pat-terns of arrangement into sentences to bootstrap their way into more mature knowledge.

We have created a first step toward modeling this incremental process. We combined unsuper-vised parsing with minimal supervision to begin to identify arguments and predicates. An SRL clas-sifier used simple representations built from these identified arguments to extract useful abstract pat-terns for classifying semantic roles. Our results suggest that multiple simple representations of sentence structure could co-exist in the child X  X  sys-tem for sentence comprehension; representations that will ultimately turn out to be powerful guides to role identification may be less powerful early in acquisition because of the noise introduced by the unsupervised parsing.

The next step is to  X  X lose the loop X , using higher level semantic feedback to improve the earlier ar-gument identification and parsing stages. Per-haps with the help of semantic feedback the sys-tem can automatically improve predicate identifi-cation, which in turn allows it to correct the ob-served intransitive sentence error. This approach will move us closer to the goal of using initial sim-ple structural patterns and natural observation of the world (semantic feedback) to bootstrap more and more sophisticated representations of linguis-tic structure.
