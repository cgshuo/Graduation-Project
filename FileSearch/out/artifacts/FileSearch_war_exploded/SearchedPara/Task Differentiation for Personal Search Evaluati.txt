 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: [Information Search and Retrieval] Personal Search Task, Search Features, Evaluation. The aim of this thesis is to make the evaluation of personal search systems more feasible. Research in this area is hampered in part due to the lack of comparability and diverse coverage of varied tasks across different users. Addressing these issues requires more knowledge on the landscape of personal search tasks, and differentiating the tasks of different individuals. The proposed approach in this research relies on identifying the differences between search tasks in terms of their effect on user and system performance. Although personal tasks are varied and considering their common underlying features . As a preliminary study, an experiment was conducte d to measure user perceptions of such differences across pairs of typical search tasks, grouped by an underlying feature. Participants rated the differences between each pair of tasks answering the question  X  X o what extent do you think that the difference between these two tasks will affect the way you search for the information described in the tasks? X  . Responses were indicated using a 5-level ordinal scale with the categories  X  X ot at all X ,  X  X lightly X ,  X  X oderately X ,  X  X ery X , and  X  X xtremely X  , which were mapped to the integer values 1-5. A range of features were found to influence user perceptions of task differences. To compare the effect of features against each other, a set of obvious paired tasks are used to identify bound distribution of responses for the obvious similar paired tasks is significantly different from a pair ed task under examination, it can be concluded that the underlying feature setting of that paired task is significantly effective in indicating task differences . The same analysis can be applied for task similarities . Based on this analysis, although some features appeared to be at the medium level of effect, there were other features with discriminative power in task differentiation (for example, remembering the sender of message , F 21 in Figure 1, can make distinctive differences, while access recency of week vs. month , F 2 similar effects and lead to comparability). We aim to investigate the effect of features on user and system performance. These explorations can help us to establish a reference model of the discriminative power of task features, which can be further extended for identifying task similarities and differences. This will alleviate the lack of comparability and facilitate diverse coverage of varied personal tasks for evaluation experiments.
