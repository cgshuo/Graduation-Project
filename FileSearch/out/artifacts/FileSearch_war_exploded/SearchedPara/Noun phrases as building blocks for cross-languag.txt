 1. Introduction
Over the last 7years there has been a great improvement in the techniques to retrieve relevant documents in languages different from the query language. State-of-the-art systems routinely perform above 75% of the equivalent monolingual retrieval, and occasionally match monolingual performance ( Gey, Kando, &amp; Peters, 2002 ).
 journalist that needs to know the local opinion in Japan about a certain event. Let us suppose that the jour-nalist can use a system able to accept queries in Spanish and find documents in Japanese. Let us assume that he is willing to pay for a high-quality manual translation of the documents which are of primary interest to his research. From an initial query in Spanish, the system retrieves a ranked list of documents written in
Japanese. How can the user distinguish which ones are really relevant before paying for manual transla-tions? How can he decide whether to stop searching or refine the query? How can he use the information in the retrieved documents to refine the query? assumptions that (a) commercial Machine Translation (MT) systems can be used to translate the docu-ments into the user  X  s native language; and that (b) cross-language document selection and query refinement can be done using such translations.
 evance judgment (see Section 6), the assumptions above are still far from being verified experimentally, and there are in fact reasons to question them: first, machine translations are far from perfect, and usu-ally hard to read. Second, it is not evident how the information provided by machine translations can be used to modify and improve the query until the information need is satisfied. Third, machine trans-lation is costly (compared to document retrieval) and may introduce significant delays in a search session.

Cross-language phrase-based summaries, which form the core of our approach, are built for:  X  Generating cross-language surrogates much faster than with standard machine translation software.  X  Allowing faster relevance judgments.  X  Facilitating user feedback by direct selection of relevant phrases.

One of the critical issues of interactive information retrieval (IR) systems is evaluation. We have incrementally evaluated the two main components of our approach (document selection and query for-mulation support) in the framework of iCLEF ( Oard &amp; Gonzalo, 2002; Gonzalo &amp; Oard, 2003 ). iCLEF is a shared evaluation activity focused on the interactive aspects of cross-language Information Retrieval. Our participation in iCLEF 2001 compared phrase-based indicative summaries to machine translations provided by Systran Professional 3.0 in a cross-language document selection task. In iCLEF 2002, we compared our phrase-based query formulation strategy with an assisted query trans-lation approach.

The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe and evaluate the algorithm to align small noun phrases using bilingual dictionaries and evidence from comparable corpora. Section 3 introduces the cross-language summarization system. Section 4 describes our cross-language search assistant. Section 5 summarizes the iCLEF experiments where our approach was evaluated, adding a detailed statistical ana-lysis of the results. Finally, Section 6 discusses related work and Section 7 presents the main conclusions of this work. 2. Cross-language phrase alignment using comparable corpora
Our approach to cross-language Search Assistance relies on a simple algorithm to align noun phrases between two languages. It only requires lemmatizers in both languages, a bilingual dictionary and compa-rable corpora. It is worth noticing that, unlike parallel corpora, comparable corpora are relatively easy to obtain. In this section we describe the algorithm and evaluate its results for English M Spanish alignment. 2.1. Algorithm
This algorithm uses noun phrases extracted from two comparable corpora, and produces a bilingual dic-noun phrase decreases rapidly with its length: the amount of aligned phrases with four content words is already negligible. Hence we only use this algorithm to align noun phrases with two or three lemmas.
The idea is simply to check, given a noun phrase in the source language, which phrases in the target lan-guage contain exactly one translation for every term in the source phrase. Out of all candidates, the phrase gives sets of noun phrases equivalent under translation . The algorithm implementing this idea is: (1) We start with a noun phrase p in the source language, where p contains lemmas t 1 , ... , t n . (2) For each term t i we look up all its translations using a bilingual dictionary: (4) The set of candidate translations is calculated as (5) We define the canonical alignment of p as the noun phrase c 2 Pool ( p ) with the maximal frequency in (6) From c we obtain Pool ( c ) in the source language. We have that p 2 Pool ( c ) and we assume that phrases in boldface are the canonical (most frequent) translations in both languages. The remaining phrases can be used for automatic query expansion (see Section 4). Note that the disambiguation imposed by the co-occurrence restrictions successfully identifies synonyms such as { accord , pact , agreement }or{ acuerdo , convenio , compromiso }, discarding incorrect translations such as commitment (a possible translation of com-in Fig. 2 . 2.2. Evaluation: Spanish X  X nglish alignment We have applied the alignment algorithm between English and Spanish, using the CLEF ( Peters, 2003 ) Spanish and English document collections as comparable corpora. The Spanish collection consists of the Agencia EFE newswire stories from 1994; it contains 283,598 different lemmas and 27,316,656 noun phrases were extracted using the WTB phrase extraction software ( Pen  X as et al., 2001 ). The English collection com-prises LA Times news, also from 1994; it contains 198,454 different lemmas and 9,856,731 noun phrases.
Table 1 shows the coverage of the algorithm for this language pair. We have checked the quality of the translations at two frequency points: the top 500 most frequent phrases (for each language), and an addi-tional snapshot of 500 phrases of frequencies between 15 and 20. We have manually classified every trans-lation as correct , useful (reflects the meaning, but has some morphological variant) or incorrect (misleading translation). Tables 2 and 3 show the precision for phrases of size 2 and 3, respectively; a useful phrase is a good translation by randomly picking any of the candidate target language phrases in the Pool set. 3. Cross-language indicative summaries duce a pseudo-summary of every document in the user language. This process is done in three steps: (1) Document summarization : Maximal noun phrases (noun phrases that are not contained into any other (2) Selection of aligned noun phrases : All aligned noun phrases contained in the maximal noun phrases are (3) Maximal noun phrases translation : Maximal noun phrases are translated using a greedy algorithm that to the traditional concept of informative summary, but our hypothesis is that it may be useful as an indic-ative summary, i.e., as information that permits a relevance judgment on the document, given any query.
There are reasons to believe that such phrase-based summaries might be useful for cross-language docu-ment selection:  X  A standard summary of the document may omit aspects of the document that are crucial for some par- X  A query-oriented summary has to be built on the fly, slowing the presentation to the user (especially for a  X  The noun phrases in a document summary can be used for accurate relevance feedback. 3.1.

For every maximal phrase, the algorithm proceeds as follows: (1) A candidate sub-phrase set C is initialized with all aligned noun phrases with two or three lemmas con-(2) While C is not empty: (3) Once C is finally empty, there can be some lemmas from the maximal noun phrase which are not yet ety of diseases X  X .

The absence of these non-content words makes the translation ungrammat-a faithful translation of the content of the original expression. 4. NOODLE: a Foreign-Language Search Assistant above to assist cross-language searches for monolingual users. A fundamental assumption of our system is that users do not want to check possible translations of their query terms. In order to get accurate trans-lations, the system supports query formulation by phrases, which are then automatically translated using the alignment information. Phrase-based summaries, which are again displayed only in the user  X  s native lan-guage, are used for relevance judgment and for phrase-based query refinement. This is how the system works in detail: 4.1. Query processing phrases. 1 Noun phrases with two or three lemmas are searched in the alignment dictionary, using both the original lemmas and synonym terms obtained from EuroWordNet ( Vossen, 1998 ).
 4.2. Initial query formulation ate for his user needs. This is done in the user  X  s native language. 4.3. Query translation ical translation into the document language is chosen as translation.
In addition, there is also a blind query expansion with the second most frequent phrase if (and only if) its frequency is, at least, 80% of the frequency of the canonical translation. For instance,  X  X  X cuerdo de libre comercio X  X  might be translated as  X  X  X ree trade agreement X  X  (canonical) and  X  X  X ree trade accord X  X  (alternative). 4.4. Document selection
Instead of the original documents, the system displays the phrase-based summary as an indication of a document content. When browsing a document surrogate, the user may select it and/or use its contents for query refinement.

The system highlights portions of the summary according to two different criteria: phrases that contain a query term are highlighted in a bright colour, and phrases that are aligned (hence their translation is more reliable) are displayed in boldface. 4.5. Query refinement
All aligned translations in a document summary are directly clickable for relevance feedback. Once a relevant phrase is clicked, the system adds its canonical translation (via the alignment dictionary) to the query and performs a new search. An example of feedback by phrases is shown in Fig. 4 . 5. Evaluation
We have performed two different experiments in order to test empirically the two fundamental assump-tions of our system: (1) Phrase-based pseudo-summaries may serve cross-language document selection purposes faster than full (2) Assisted query formulation by phrases, plus automatic phrase translation, is preferable to assisted
Both experiments have been carried out, in two consecutive years, as part of iCLEF 2001 ( Oard &amp; Gonz-alo, 2002 ) and iCLEF 2002 ( Gonzalo &amp; Oard, 2003 ). iCLEF is a shared evaluation activity focused on the interactive aspects of cross-Language Information Retrieval. Our participation in iCLEF 2001 compared phrase-based indicative summaries to machine translations provided by Systran Professional 3.0 in a cross-language document selection task. In iCLEF 2002, we compared our phrase-based query formulation strategy with an assisted query translation approach. 5.1. iCLEF experiment design
Essentially, the iCLEF experiment design consists of two systems to be compared (usually a reference and a contrastive system), a fixed set of topics (with the usual title/description/narrative structure of TREC and CLEF), a set of searchers, a definition of the searching task, and a prescription of which system/topic/ searcher combinations must be used in the searching task, and in which order. The combinations follow a latin-square design that alternates topics, searchers and systems in order to eliminate correlation effects. During the task, searchers fill in different questionnaires about their searching experience, the task being performed, and about the perceived differences between systems.
 than to pay for a manual translation of an irrelevant document). 5.2. iCLEF 2001: cross-language document selection foreign-language documents, obtained by a cross-language search engine, and were instructed to judge on the relevance of the documents in the list. The organization of iCLEF provided Systran Professional 3.0 translations of English documents into Spanish, and French documents into English, as reference transla-tions for the experiments.

Our experiment compared the standard Systran translations with the phrase-based translations pro-duced by our system. We used Spanish as search language, English as document language, the four official iCLEF topics, and eight Spanish speakers without English skills. A total of 32 searching sessions (of 30min each) were conducted, one per topic/user combination.

The official results of the experiment can be seen in Table 4 . The overall precision of the cross-language judgments with phrase-based summaries is similar to Systran-based judgments (0.47 versus 0.48), but recall is 52% higher (0.34 versus 0.22), confirming that judgments are made faster with summaries than with full translations. The official F a =0.8 measure is only 25% better for phrases, because it is biased for precision rather than recall. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of recall ( R ) measures across the data.
A non-trivial issue is how to measure statistical significance on our data. We have chosen linear mixed-models are similar to linear models, but permit to distinguish between the system effect that we seek to de-tect (a fixed effect of the model) and the combined searcher/topic/system effect that we wish to suppress ( random effects in the model).

Alternative linear mixed-effects models were compared using ANOVA to examine the variance of ex-plained versus error effects. The adequacy of every attempted model was tested with several standard plots: residuals versus fitted responses from the model, comparison of theoretical quantiles of a normal distribu-the nlme linear mixed-effects models library. The specific model that best fits our data is System and Topic.

An ANOVA on the model gives p = 0.14 for the probability of getting the difference in recall between both systems by chance. Therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis under a standard p &lt; 0.05 test. However, the trend seems clear, so we expect that our inability to see statistical significance results comes from the small amount of available data and from two searchers that exhibited unusual behavior. Searcher 5 apparently did not understand the task, since almost no relevant documents were marked in any of the four search sessions. From questionnaire responses, it appears that searcher 5 was actually attempting to judge translation quality rather than relevance. The second potentially problematic searcher was searcher 1, who was the only searcher to perform the task remotely. In both cases, the average performance is sub-stantially lower than for the other users (see Fig. 5 ).

Most UNED searchers reported little experience with search engines. Most reported a preference for phrase translation, arguing that the information was more concise and thus decisions could be made faster, although several searchers also remarked that phrase translation demanded more interpretation from the user. The MT system was perceived as giving more detailed information, although the density of that infor-mation sometimes made the relevance judgment process difficult. These impressions are consistent with the quantitative results that we obtained, and they tend to confirm our hypothesis about the utility of noun phrase translation as a basis for assessing topical relevance.
 bination of quantitative evidence and searcher impressions indicates that summarized translations, and in evance, even when full machine translation is available. In addition, the computational cost of producing noun phrase translations is significantly lower than that of full MT; our current implementation is at least one order of magnitude faster than Systran translation. 5.3. iCLEF 2002: query formulation and refinement tem based on assisted query translation, and NOODLE as a contrastive system. Two hypotheses were tested:  X  Examining translations in an (unknown) foreign language is a high-load cognitive task, and therefore it  X  Selecting relevant phrases for a topic should be easier and faster than selecting translations, and phrases can be translated without human intervention more accurately than individual terms.

Again, we used eight native Spanish speakers without English skills, the four official iCLEF topics and the iCLEF prescribed methodology for searching sessions and for combining searchers, topics and systems in searches. A total of 32 search sessions were performed.

This is the design of the reference system used in the experiment:  X  Initial query formulation : The system translates all content words in the iCLEF topic (title and descrip-tion plus narrative) using a bilingual dictionary, and displays possible English translations to the user.
When the user points to an English term, the system displays inverse translations into Spanish. This information can be used by the searcher to decide which translations to keep and which translations to discard before performing the first search. Fig. 6 illustrates this initial step.  X  Cross-language search : The system performs a monolingual search of the LA Times collection with the
English terms selected by the user.  X  Ranked document list : The ranked list of documents displays the (translated) title of the document and a colour code to indicate whether each document has already been marked as relevant , not relevant or unsure . Fig. 7 A shows a retrieved ranked list.  X  Document selection : The system displays the same cross-language summary as our NOODLE system, because we only want to measure the effects of query formulation and refinement.  X  Query refinement by selection : When a Spanish term in a document translation corresponds to an original
English term already in the query, the user can point to the Spanish term (highlighted); then the system points to the English query term, allowing for de-selection or selection of the English term (or some of its companion translations) or the original Spanish term (then all translations are disabled). Fig. 7 B illus-trates this process.  X  Additional query refinement : Additionally, the user can also enter a single term at any time along the search. Again, the system displays its possible translations into the target language, along with their inverse translations, and permits individual selection and de-selection of translations.
 This system is compared to NOODLE (as described in Section 4). The official results can be seen in Table 5 , and some additional data in Table 6 . A graphical distribution of data per system and per user can be seen in Fig. 8 . All quantitative evidence supports our hypotheses: (1) The NOODLE system is better overall: the official F a =0.8 measure is 65% better for NOODLE (2) The initial query formulation time is 85% shorter with the NOODLE system. Selecting phrases in the (3) The initial precision for the original query formulation is 51% better with the NOODLE system, i.e., (4) The number of query refinements for the NOODLE system doubles the number of refinements
Again, we have used linear mixed-effects models for the statistical analysis of the data. In this occasion, the model that best fits the data according to standard normality tests is where F a =0.8 , as outcome variable, depends on two coupled fixed effects of Query and System, and the User is a random effect coupled with the Query. Essentially, it differs from the iCLEF 2001 model in the role played by the queries: in the cross-language document selection, the only fixed effect was the System; now Query interacts with System as fixed effect. The data is probably reflecting that cross-language docu-ment selection is less dependent on the topic, while a full search task as measured in iCLEF 2002 is strongly dependent on the topic.

The prediction of this model has a 0.995 correlation with the data, once the outliers for topic 3 (no user found relevant documents) and user 2 (who scored 0 for all topics except one) are removed from the data.
The application of ANOVA on the model gives p = 0.039 for the difference in F a =0.8 between both sys-be taken with precaution, because it is the outcome of just three topics.
 The questionnaires filled in by searchers corroborate the empirical data. All users stated that the NOO-DLE system was easier to learn, easier to use and better overall. They appreciated both the ability of selecting phrases rather than individual terms, and most of them added that it was much better not to see English terms at any moment. A general claim was that the dictionary had too many translations for each term.
 with the assisted translation system, users were reluctant to pick up translations for words having many tem: errors caused by incorrect alignment information are transparent to the user. 6. Related work dressed: users were asked to identify the topic of a foreign language text, presenting word-by-word English translations of Japanese directory entries and asking users to group directories by subject. The result was better than an automatic classification, but worse than a similar task done with manual translations instead of word-by-word pseudo-translations. In the MULINEX ( Erbach, Neumann, &amp; Uszkoreit, 1997 ) project, a cross-language IR system provided automatic translations of document summaries; the utility of such information was tested via questionnaires; unsurprisingly, the utility of translations seemed inversely pro-portional to self-reported reading skills in the document language. In ( Ogden et al., 1999b ), Ogden and Davis found that a single searcher without German reading skills could achieve an average of 99% precision and 86% recall on the top 10 Systran translations of German documents retrieved by an automatic system over 22 topics, when compared to judgments provided by TREC relevance assessors. This result suggested that machine translation can be adequate for a document selection task. Word-by-word translations have gested that word by word translations might also be sufficient for the selection task, but it was a between-subjects experiment and therefore a direct comparison was not meaningful. Wang and Oard study was done as part of the iCLEF 2001 campaign, and the results of the within-subjects study revealed that word-by-word translations were substantially worse than Systran translations for an English X  X rench selection task. Finally, the iCLEF experiment described in ( Karlgren &amp; Hansen, 2003 ) shows that, even for searchers with self-reported high skills in a foreign document language, the selection task is more difficult and time con-suming than native language assessments. Another iCLEF experiment is ( Bathie &amp; Sanderson, 2002 ), where the results of monolingual assessments and cross-language judgments on machine-translated documents turned out to be similar, although they are measured on different collections and therefore are not strictly comparable.
 Cross-language query formulation approaches have been mainly focused on assisted translation. MUL-INEX ( Erbach et al., 1997 ) and KEIZAI ( Ogden et al., 1999a ) interfaces help the users select individual translations for the query terms using reverse dictionaries. In He, Wang, Oard, and Nossal (2003) ,an iCLEF experiment compared automatic query translation with assisted query translation via inverse dic-tionaries and examples extracted from parallel corpora; the second strategy worked better, showing that user assistance can improve cross-language searches. The NOODLE approach, in comparison, interacts with the user to obtain a phrase-based query, and then performs an automatic translation. In agreement with our experiments, the iCLEF experiment reported in ( Petrelli, Beaulieu, Sanderson, Demetriou, &amp; Her-ring, 2003 ) found that users do not care about the query translation process, unless the search results are completely unsatisfactory. 7. Conclusions
We have described and evaluated a Foreign-Language Search Assistant based on noun phrase informa-tion extracted from comparable corpora. The system provides original and effective solutions for all essen-tial aspects of the interactive search task: query formulation, translation and refinement, and cross-language document selection. The main features of the system are:  X  A cross-language summarization algorithm based on translations for noun phrases in the document.
Such summaries:  X  An approach to query formulation and refinement in the native language of the user, where the user approach was compared to two reference systems: (1) Our phrase-based summaries perform 25% better than Systran Machine Translations. Users are able to judge documents faster at similar precision rates.
