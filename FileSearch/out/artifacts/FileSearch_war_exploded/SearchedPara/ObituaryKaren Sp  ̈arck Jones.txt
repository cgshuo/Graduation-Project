Karen Sp  X  arck Jones died peacefully on 4 April 2007 after a number of months battling cancer. Karen was President of the Association for Computation Linguistics in 1994 during a difficult period, and saw through a transitional phase in which a solid basis for the long-term health of the association was established.
 two separate fields, computational linguistics (CL) and information retrieval (IR), as well as in computing and artificial intelligence more broadly. In IR, her greatest contri-bution was probably her invention (1972) of the concept of inverse document frequency (IDF), in which the importance of terms is weighted according to the proportion of documents in the corpus in which they occur; the intuition being that terms which occur in many documents are poor index terms. This is the partial basis of all weighting schemes adopted by widely used Internet search engines, and will undoubtedly be a lasting contribution to the field.
 practical use. Her long involvement with IR arose (as someone who subsisted for an inordinately long time on soft money) by the need to find a new line of research in the aftermath of the ALPAC Report and the subsequent difficulties in getting machine translation work funded. However, she was always well qualified to work in IR, a topic addressed in her very early publications (see, for example, Masterman, Needham, and Sp  X  arck Jones 1958), although in a rather different context to her later work. to CL or natural language processing are harder to pin down. They include contribu-tions to summarization, natural language interfaces to structured databases, dialogue, semantics, and more. In the long term perhaps her greatest contribution will come to be seen to be her Ph.D. thesis (1964), which was far ahead of its time. It brought together statistical or machine learning approaches with the use of an existing resource ( Roget X  X  Thesaurus  X  X unched onto cards!) and still can be read with profit today (see Wilks and
Tait 2005). It can be viewed as the forerunner of a whole range of more recent attempts to derive semantic information on an empirical basis.
 tions with the US TREC initiatives and the more recent DUC summary evaluations are well known, as is her earlier association with DARPA TIDES, but her desire to work on well-founded experimental bases runs through from her earliest days, initially through involvement with Cyril Cleverdon and the Cranfield project, and then later in the work reported, for example, in Sp  X  arck Jones and van Rijsbergen (1976) and Sp  X  arck Jones and
Galliers (1996). Perhaps this derived from her being a long associate of Wittgenstein X  X  student Margaret Masterman (a connection Karen acknowledged in her acceptance speech for the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005) and consequently from the focus of Wittgenstein X  X  philosophy on language use.
 wegian parents and was very much a child of Second World War Britain. She initially read History at Cambridge, but graduated in Philosophy (Moral Sciences). Following a brief spell as a schoolteacher she joined the Cambridge Language Research Unit in 1957 under Masterman and so began a very lengthy period on soft money. The University of
Cambridge finally recognized her standing by awarding her a Readership in 1994 and a personal chair in 1999.

Finally she was awarded the ACM Women X  X  Group Athena Award, which sadly she did not live to receive formally, although she bravely recorded an acceptance lecture a few weeks prior to her death.

She acknowledged the support of her parents and then her late husband (and long-time academic collaborator) Roger Needham in her obtaining a good education and developing a career.

She and her late husband Roger were keen sailors, owning, and maintaining themselves for many years, an 1872 Itchen Ferry Cutter. They also built their first house with their own hands. Karen could sketch well, made works of art from everyday objects, and had an enormous knowledge of natural history and church architecture. She was candid and passionate and could be enormously generous in her support. She will be greatly missed.
