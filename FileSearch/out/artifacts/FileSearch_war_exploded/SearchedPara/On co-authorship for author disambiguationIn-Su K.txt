 1. Introduction
As a tremendous amount of person-related information is available on the web or other electronic media, people want to find persons of interest frequently using the names as queries (Guha &amp; Garg, 2004 ). However, there exists many-to-many mapping relationships between persons and their names. A person may have multiple names, and different persons may share the same name. For example, a person named David S. Johnson can write his name as David S. Johnson , David Johnson , D. S. Johnson ,or D. Johnson , etc., and there may exist two or more different persons named David S. Johnson . When a single person is viewed as an object having a unique meaning, different names signifying the same person can be considered as synonyms, and the same names indicating different persons homonyms. 1
The above many-to-many mapping between persons and their names may severely deteriorate the effectiveness of the person search. When a person name is submitted to a web people search system (Wan, Gao, Li, &amp; Ding, 2005 ) that finds per-sons in web pages, the web pages that have synonymous names of the input query may not be retrieved, lowering the recall of the person search, and the retrieved pages may contain numerous homonymous names of the input query, decreasing the precision of the search system. Moreover, synonymous and/or homonymous person names may hinder the correct represen-tation of person-related social networks such as coauthor and citation networks.

Thus, identifying synonymous person names and resolving homonymous ones are crucial to any person-related search or representation systems. Thus far, much research has been conducted to attack the identification of synonymous person names
Gu, Baxter, Vickers, &amp; Rainsford, 2003; Winkler, 2006). Matching of synonymous names employs similarity measures which mainly rely on name-internal features such as overlapping characters or tokens (first, middle, last name) of the two names to be compared. On the other hand, disambiguation of homonymous names has relatively recently received a growing attention with the advent of the semantic web and social networks. It is highly dependent on name-external features: domain-indepen-postal addresses, and/or domain-specific contextual features such as coauthors and paper titles in case of bibliographic data.
This study addresses the resolution of homonymous author names appearing in citation data. As disambiguation features, previous works have employed coauthors, titles of articles, titles of publications, and years of publications that constitute basic citation data. Titles of articles may epitomize research areas of their authors, thus under the assumption that name-sakes do not heavily share their research areas, title similarity between articles may be employed in resolving homonymous author names. The same also applies to the case of titles of books. In addition to the above citation-internal features, some available, additional features such as e-mail addresses, affiliation, and keywords can be extracted and applied to the author name disambiguation.

We believe that of the above features, co-authorship is the most reliable and decisive from the viewpoint of discriminat-ing the identities of authors, since it implies real-world acquaintances among authors. For instance, when one citation con-the two citations are not different persons. Other citation features are not as much person-related as co-authorship.
This study concentrates on investigating the sole effect of co-authorship information on the resolution of homonymous author names in bibliographic data. In particular, we start with a hypothesis stating that the identity of an author is char-acterized by his/her coauthors. Next, a web-based technique of gathering coauthors is proposed to supplement implicit coauthors not found in known citations. Then, our hypothesis is investigated using large-scale test data from the following viewpoints: Is it helpful to enrich coauthors with web-assisted collaborators in disambiguating namesakes? Is a person identified more accurately by more coauthors? How probable is it that co-authorship succeeds in disambiguating authors? Is it beneficial to use coauthors of coauthors in resolving authors?
The scope of co-authorship that this study handles is limited to academic co-authorship. In addition, the evaluation of co-summarizes related works. Section 3 describes the usage of co-authorship for author name disambiguation. Next, a web-as-sisted method of expanding coauthors is proposed in Section 4. Then, evaluations and concluding remarks are given in Sec-tions 4 and 5 . 2. Related works 2.1. Overview
Research on the processing of person names can be divided into personal name matching and personal name disambig-uation. The former handles the identification of synonymous person names, while the latter involves the discrimination of homonymous ones. One may argue that person name disambiguation inherently includes the problem of personal name matching, since there may exist many namesakes who have a variety of name variants. This study, however, assumes that personal name matching precedes personal name disambiguation so that we can separate the two problems.

Synonymous names are normally found by computing similarities between two candidate person names, using mainly internal features from the person name string itself such as commonness/rareness of name tokens (first/middle/last name), overlapping ratio of name characters, and pronunciation affinity. Similarity measures employed for synonymous name matching include edit-distance, soundex, Jaro (1989) , cosine, etc. Given a huge number of person names, the time of pair-wise comparisons required to find synonymous names could be costly. To reduce the time, many have proposed a variety of blocking methods which limit the set of candidate names to be compared. Readers may refer to many other literatures (Elmagarmid et al., 2007; Gu et al., 2003; Winkler, 2006) that provide an excellent survey of synonymous name matching.
Unlike synonymous name matching, homonymous name resolution relies mainly on name-external features. Web people disambiguation ( Guha &amp; Garg, 2004; Mann &amp; Yarowsky, 2003; Wan et al., 2005 ), which groups person names in web pages into real individuals, depends largely on domain-independent biographic features such as birth date/place, e-mail/postal ad-dress, affiliations, job title, phone numbers as well as collocational term features, and neighboring person names in web pages. Author name disambiguation, which is the focus of this study, resolves authors appearing in the domain of bibliog-publication, topics of articles, etc.
 2.2. Author name disambiguation
Author disambiguation divides the namesakes appearing in citation data into their real individuals. This problem is nor-mally attacked by clustering approaches based on pair-wise author similarities. Pair-wise author similarities, the degree to which two author instances appearing on two different articles refer to the same person, rely commonly on coauthors, paper 2007; Kanani et al., 2007; McRae-Spencer &amp; Shadbolt, 2006; Tan, Kan, &amp; Lee, 2006; Yang, Jiang, Lee, &amp; Ho, 2006 ).
When a typical citation record is viewed as being comprised of authors, a paper title, and publication information (e.g., title of journals or proceedings, year of publication, volume/issue, pages, etc.), the above features can be categorized into From the viewpoint that the identity of a person can be strongly determined by his/her social relationships, however, the 2004; Torvik et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006 ) have also observed its good disambiguation capability.
 Among citation-external features, emails/affiliations and self-citations have a high potential for author disambiguation. Email addresses may play the role of personal identifiers. Affiliations may provide biographic physical locations to which individuals belong. The use of self-citations is supported by the assumption that researchers tend to cite their own earlier work ( McRae-Spencer &amp; Shadbolt, 2006 ). These features, however, are not readily available since they should be extracted from full-text papers. Project membership information is also difficult to obtain although it supplies another type of re-searcher X  X  social context. Thus, of the external features, the most accessible and reliable ones are Web evidences. The usage 2007), or by comparing two URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) that link to web pages containing each citation record (McRae-Spencer &amp; Shadbolt, 2006; Tan et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2006 ).
 Pair-wise author similarities may be calculated by either supervised or unsupervised methods using the above features. From the training data, supervised methods learn the binary classifier that determines whether two author appearances are co-referent or not, using machine learning techniques such as SVM (Huang et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2006 ), maximum entropy confidence scores yielded by the classifiers are used as pair-wise author similarities for later clustering. Unsupervised ap-proaches normally define a learning-free similarity function between two authors. Some of them ( Aswani et al., 2006; ues. Torvik et al. (2005) instead presented a model for estimating the probability that a pair of author names refer to the same individual, from automatically generated reference sets consisting of pairs of articles authored by the same versus dif-ferent persons. Whereas supervised methods would have difficulties in manually compiling training data in terms of its quantity and balance, unsupervised ones need to develop a method to integrate each feature similarity.

After obtaining pair-wise author similarities, the author disambiguation module clusters authors by viewing author sim-ilarities as edge weights between author nodes. Previously employed clustering techniques mainly include agglomerative 2007; Kanani et al., 2007 ), and DBSCAN method ( Huang et al., 2006 ).

Instead of pair-wise author similarities, one group of researchers (Han et al., 2003, 2004; Han, Xu et al., 2005; Han, Zha et al., 2005 ) had attempted to create author-specific models by either supervised or unsupervised techniques. They con-structed one author-specific model for each individual, assuming that the number of real persons corresponding to name-sakes is known in advance. Although their method can be applied and evaluated over a prepared test set since the number of different authors is known from the test set, it would be nontrivial to generalize such author-centric approach to the resolution of unknown real authors. 3. Co-authorship
In general, coauthors who are listed in the same paper know each other. This acquaintance among coauthors may provide clues on disambiguating homonymous author names. For example, suppose that we want to discriminate appearances of  X  A. Cohen  X  as authors in the five citations C1 through C5. C1: A. Cohen , S. Draper, E. Martinian, G. Wornell (2006). Stealing bits from a quantized ...
 C2: A. Cohen , S. Draper, E. Martinian, G. Wornell (2002). Source requantization: successive ...
 C3: A. Cohen , J. Siegel, P. Rozin (2003). Faith versus practice: different bases for ...
 C4: A. Cohen , A. Malka, P. Rozin, L. Cherfas (2006). Religion and unforgivable offenses ...
 C5: A. Cohen , I. Tannenbaum (2001). Lesbian and bisexual women X  X  judgments of ...

Then, co-authorship of  X  A. Cohen  X  would suggest that (C1, C2), (C3, C4), and (C5) have been authored respectively by three different persons named  X  A. Cohen  X , from the fact that (C1, C2) and (C3, C4) respectively share the same coauthor.
The disambiguation capability among co-appearing authors may be related to the distributional hypothesis in linguistics stating that words occurring in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris, 1954 ). In the same vein, Firth (1957) stated that a word is known by the company it keeps. For example, when we see the authors  X  A. Cohen, I. Tannenbaum  X  baum  X  X sunique,andthereisonlyonepersonnamed X  A.Cohen  X  X homthe X  I.Tannenbaum  X  X nows.Ingeneral(cin Fig.1 ),however, theremaybeseveralpersonsnamed X  I.Tannenbaum  X ,andeachpersonnamed X  I.Tannenbaum  X  X ayknowmanydifferentpersons level of such ambiguity is affected by how common each of the two names is, since when the name  X  I. Tannenbaum  X  is rare, (c)wouldbe simplifiedto(b)-likecases, andwhenthename X  A. Cohen  X  X salso rare,(c)wouldbe furtherreducedto (a)-likecases.
Inotherwords, thecommonality wouldweakenmutualdiscriminationpower amongco-mentionedauthors,whichwe callthe curse of common person names. Thus, some earlier works adopted commonality/rarity of author names ( Culotta et al., 2007; Han, Xu et al., 2005; Han, Zha et al., 2005; Kanani and McCallum, 2007; Kanani et al., 2007 ) to resolve author names.
To attack the curse of common person names in resolving author names, on the other hand, the aforementioned distri-butional hypothesis in linguistics may be anew employed in the form of the number of overlapping coauthors ( Culotta et al., 2007; Kanani &amp; McCallum, 2007; Kanani et al., 2007; Torvik et al., 2005), under the assumption that the more coauthors in common two author instances have, the more probable the two authors refer to the same individual. For instance, in the above  X  A. Cohen  X  example, grouping (C1, C2) would be more accurate than grouping (C3, C4), since  X  A. Cohen  X  X  in C1 and C2 share more acquaintances than those in C3 and C4.

Another problem in applying co-authorship to author name disambiguation is the scarcity of co-authors. For instance, although the  X  A. Cohen  X  who authored papers C3 and C4 is the same person as the one in C5, co-authorship information known from C1 through C5 does not give any clue. However, if we newly know that the  X  I. Tannenbaum  X  is one of collabo-interpretation on coauthors that include implicit collaborators not found in known citation records would help us to under-stand the influence of co-authorship on disambiguating namesakes.
 On the other hand, the identity of an author may be determined by coauthors of his/her coauthors.

 C7: G. Segev, A. Smith , H. Silverman (2006). Information loss analysis for ...

Consider the above four artificial citations. It is difficult to view the authors named  X  A. Smith  X  in C6 and C7 as the same individual since they do not share coauthors. The fact that each of their (at least two or more) coauthors shares other coau-casts us a question of whether coauthors of coauthors are useful to disambiguating authors or not.

To explore the distributional hypothesis of linguistics from the perspective of disambiguating author names, this study sets out the following coauthor disambiguation hypothesis.
 Coauthor disambiguation hypothesis : The identity of an author is characterized by his/her coauthors.

In the above hypothesis, coauthors of an author are meant to include all collaborators whom the author has written articles in 4. Web-based acquisition of coauthors
When we collect coauthors of a person named  X  T. Mitchell  X , we need to specify a particular  X  T. Mitchell  X  among numerous C10: R. Niculescu, T. Mitchell , R. Rao, K. Patrick (2006). Bayesian network learning with parameter constraints. Journal of person whose coauthors are to be gathered is followed by the name of a known coauthor. Such representation however still  X  T.

 contain both author names. Within the highly ranked retrieved documents, we locate sequences of author names each of which matches original author names h  X  T. Mitchell  X ,  X  R. Niculescu  X  i . From each of such sequences, new author names are gleaned as coauthors of the original author-pair. The above procedure is generalized into Algorithm 1 .

Loop step 4 of Algorithm 1 may require fine-tuning, since retrieved web pages may not be about publications, like alumni pages. For more accurate extraction, thus, advanced techniques would be needed to create a publication-page classifier or a citation-record extractor. This study does not explore such techniques, but uses a simple regular expression matching to dis-cover sequences of person names.
 Algorithm 1 Web-based acquisition of coauthors Input: Initialize: Loop: 2 For each c i 2 C new 3 Search the Web for documents containing both last names of a and c i 4 Extract a set W of coauthors of a and c i from top-n retrieved documents 5 W new = W new [ ( W C ) 6 End For 7 Exit Loop if W new = ; 9 C = C [ W new Output:
There are two ways of expanding coauthors of  X  T. Mitchell  X  in the above citation through Algorithm 1 . The first expansion second is to iteratively execute the first expansion method for coauthors except for  X  T. Mitchell  X , and merge the expanded coauthors augmented by the first and second expansion methods are respectively called author-centric implicit coauthors ( aIC ), and coauthor-centric implicit coauthors ( cIC ). cIC represents coauthors of coauthors.

To specify more precisely the  X  T. Mitchell  X  in C10, two or more (or all) coauthors could be used as restrictions like possibility of acquiring new coauthors not found in known citations. 5. Evaluation setup 5.1. Test set
As a test set to assess namesake resolution, we created a gold standard for a total of 8675 IT-related conference papers which were published in Korean during 1999 X 2006. Korean does not suffer from name-variant problems. In other words, a person X  X  name is written in Korean in a single form, that is, a surname followed by a given name without delimiters or mid-dle names. Owing to this feature, Korean author disambiguation system may skip matching of synonymous names. To manually discriminate the same-name authors into real individuals, two persons for three months have fastidiously con-pers as well as by looking up publication lists of author homepages on the Web.
 Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the test set. Originally, there were 28,042 author appearances within 8675 papers. Then, after English names or single-occurrence author names were excluded, the test set has 23,177 author occurrences and 5332 same-name author groups which were manually disambiguated to obtain 9133 real individuals. The average num-ber of authors per paper was 3.23, and average author ambiguity 1.71.

From (a) of Fig. 2 , it is known that about 60% of a total of 5332 same-name person groups have two or three author occur-rences, and same-name person groups that have more than 10 occurrences were less than 6%. In addition, (b) of Fig. 2 indi-cates that 60% of a total of 5332 same-name person groups are unambiguous, and most (80%) of ambiguous persons has two or three namesakes. (c) of Fig. 2 explains that most papers (79.2%) in our test set were collaborated by two to four persons. Fig. 3 shows the token-type distribution for same-name person groups found in the test set. Up to 10 person tokens as the size of a same-name person group, person groups exhibit various numbers of person types, and beyond 10 person tokens, the number of person types within a person group does not attain to the size of the person group. These factors imply that larger same-name person groups do not always cause higher ambiguities. Expectedly, lower ambiguity person groups distribute over more diverse sizes, while showing rare occurrences of high-ambiguity person names. 5.2. Features, clustering method are obtained using Algorithm 1 by submitting a pair of author A and one of EC of A as a query to web search engines. Coauthor-centric IC s( cIC )aregathered through Algorithm1 bycreatinga pairofarbitrarytwo EC -typecoauthorsofauthor A asawebquery.
We created an author disambiguation system that divides the same-name author occurrences in citation data into differ-ent clusters, each of which are expected to correspond to a real individual. This is equal to grouping papers having the same-name author appearances. Our author disambiguation system performs single-link agglomerative clustering (Jain, Murty, &amp; Flynn, 1999; Sneath &amp; Sokal, 1973) as shown in Algorithm 2 . It takes a list of same-name author occurrences in which each name is represented by a set of his/her coauthor names. Clustering starts by making each of author appearances a singleton cluster. Next, the clustering algorithm iterates to merge the most similar two clusters of which similarity equals to or ex-( a ing is used since our test set in Korean does not suffer from the synonymous author name problem. Note that a new cluster generated by merging is represented as a union of the two smaller clusters to be combined. A cluster-merging threshold h means that author clusters are merged only if they have an author-pair sharing at least h coauthor(s).

As baselines to be compared with coauthor-based author resolution, two methods of clustering namesakes are used: sin-gleton-clustering and single-clustering. Singleton-clustering (ST) views that each occurrence of the same name belongs to different persons, and single-clustering (SC) considers that every occurrence of the same name belongs to one and only one person. Thus, ST partitions each of the same-name author instances into a separate cluster, while SC groups all of the same-name author instances into a single cluster.
 Algorithm 2 Agglomerative Clustering for Same-name Author Occurrences Input: Initialize: Loop: 1D O 2 For each cluster-pair ( c i , c j ), calculate CSim ( c i , c j ) 3 CSim ( c i , c j ) = max( ASim ( a x , a y )), " a x 2 c i , " a y 2 c j 4 ASim ( a x , a y )= j a x \ a y j 5 Find the most similar cluster-pair ( c u , c v ) 6( c u , c v ) = argmax CSim ( c i , c j ) 7I F CSim ( c u , c v ) P h THEN 8 c u _ v = c u [ c v ; merge c u and c v into a new larger cluster c u _ v 9 ENDIF 10 WHILE ( CSim ( c u , c v ) P h ) Output: 5.3. Evaluation metrics
Since resolving namesakes is a clustering problem, it is required to calculate the degree of agreement between a set of system-output partitions and a set of true partitions. In general, the agreement between two partitions is measured for a pair of entities within partitions. The basic unit for which pair-wise agreement is assessed is a pair of entities (authors in our case) which belongs to one of the four cells in Table 2 . Let M be the set of machine-generated clusters, and G the set disagreements.

When Table 2 is considered as a confusion matrix for a two-class prediction problem, the standard  X  X recision X ,  X  X ecall X , F1 measure, and  X  X ccuracy X  are defined as follows.
 Precision = a /( a + b ) Recall = a /( a + c ) F 1=2 Precision Recall / (Precision + Recall)
Accuracy = ( a + d )/( a + b + c + d ) standard partitions. F1 is the harmonic mean of  X  X recision X  and  X  X ecall X .  X  X ccuracy X  calculates the fraction of agreements among all pairs of entities between machine-generated and true partitions. For the evaluation of the author disambiguation, and a few others (Aswani et al., 2006 ) have utilized the  X  X ccuracy X . The difference between  X  X ccuracy X  and F1 occurs from whether the count of pairs of authors correctly placed in different clusters is considered or not. McCallum, Nigam,and Ungar (2000) argued that  X  X ccuracy X  would be less informative than F1 since it may overestimate the clustering performance due to the overwhelming number of pairs of entities that are correctly assigned to different partitions. Adopting the argument of McCallum, this study uses F1 .

As additional measures, we use two types of clustering errors: over-clustering and under-clustering. They are obtained from the matching matrix of Table 2 , where b and c respectively indicate the counts of pairs of entities that are over-clus-tered and under-clustered. In other words, Over-clustering and Under-clustering errors are computed as follows: Over-clustering error = b /( a + b + c + d )
Under-clustering error = c /( a + b + c + d ) 6. Evaluation results and discussion
Table 3 shows the statistics of coauthor features. On average, 2.85 explicit coauthors were found in the test set, and 19.75 aICs and 17.65 cICs were augmented by the web-based coauthor expansion algorithm which was executed with top 20 doc-uments retrieved through the Google search engine. In order to block the inclusion of erroneous coauthors from irrelevant web pages, the algorithm was actually stopped after at most 50 new coauthors were gathered for each pair of author names. We have evaluated the performance of the web-based coauthor expansion procedure for 100 random pairs of author names. Its recall, precision, and F 1 were 86.55, 83.52, and 85.01, respectively.

Table 4 compares clustering performances over combinations of different coauthor features using the number of overlap-ping coauthors set to 1. EC means that a name occurrence a i in Algorithm 2 is represented by a set of only EC-type coauthors type coauthors of a i . The other combinations of different coauthor features can be similarly interpreted.
EC (explicit coauthor feature) contributed to resolve author identities, significantly improving two baselines. EC com-bined with aIC (author-centric implicit coauthor feature) achieved the best performance. cIC corresponding to coauthors of coauthors was also helpful when it was combined with EC. These explain that author identities can be more clearly dis-criminated by revealing their implicit coauthors through a web-assisted method, supporting a coauthor disambiguation hypothesis. Mixing EC + aIC with cIC slightly decreased the performance, showing that aIC and cIC are not complementary.
EC and aIC represent direct acquaintances among persons since they are direct coauthors of an author to be disambigua-ted, while cIC indicates indirect acquaintances since they are coauthors of coauthors of an author to be resolved. Table 4 shows that indirect acquaintances are beneficial to the determination of author identities, but their resolution power is weaker than that of direct acquaintances. Precisely, cIC in this study is a first-order indirect acquaintance. When cIC is ex-tended to include coauthors of coauthors of coauthors (of an author to be disambiguated), cIC becomes a second-order indi-rect acquaintance. A higher-order indirect acquaintance is likely to disambiguate authors much weakly than smaller-order ones. The higher-order cases are not further dealt with in this study.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of the number of sharing coauthors on author disambiguation for different combinations of coau-thor features. A sharp decline of EC-based clustering, which was caused by the small number of explicit coauthors (see Table all, the use of more overlapping coauthors as a cluster-merging condition monotonically decreases the clustering perfor-mance. The reason for this can be explained by Fig. 5 which shows the effect of the number of overlapping coauthors on two types of clustering errors. Expectedly, as the system requests more sharing coauthors to confirm whether two author instances refer to the same individual, it reduces the risk of mistakingly assigning same identity to different author occur-rences and simultaneously increases the risk of not merging author appearances referring to the same person. Fig. 5 indicates that the request for more sharing collaborators to merge authors aggravates the latter under-clustering in larger degrees than it alleviates the former over-clustering. Thus, total errors are not reduced even the count of overlapping coauthors in-showing that more acquaintances are either superfluous or not available.

Employing the count of sharing coauthors as a decision on the person identity does not consider author-specific numbers of coauthors. Some authors may write papers with numerous collaborators, and others may publish articles with a few coworkers. Hence, it would be more reasonable to use the ratio of coauthors in common in order to merge two same-name CSimR ( c i , c j ) = max( ASimR ( a x , a y )), " a x 2 c i , " a y 2 c j ASimR ( a x , a y )= j a x \ a y j / min( j a x j , j a y j ) EC + aIC features. As shown in Fig. 6 , as the number of overlapping coauthors increases, the ratio of common coauthors keeps the overall clustering performance relatively more stable, compared to the use of the count of sharing coauthors. However, the use of more sharing coauthors by the coauthor ratio as well could not bring about a higher performance, due to its low applicability in spite of its more accurate disambiguation.
 Fig. 7 shows the performance of disambiguating authors over the varying sizes of same-name person groups, using EC or EC + aIC features and comparing them with two baselines ST and SC. Fig. 7 was prepared to answer the question of whether coauthor features are helpful to the resolution of authors over varying numbers of same-name author instances. For the var-ious sizes of same-name person groups, EC + aIC-based performances are kept stable up to group size 14, exceeding EC-based set, person groups from group size 2 X 14 cover 85.9% of a total of 5332 same-name person groups, and 97.2% of a total of 23,177 author occurrences. This implies that applying EC + aIC coauthor features to author disambiguation are not sensi-tively influenced by the various sizes of the same-name person groups. Beyond the size 14 of person groups, the performance fluctuates. However, it may be hazardous to generalize the result, since the average count of same-size person groups is less than 6 beyond group size 14, and is about 3 after group size 20.

In summary, for most same-name person groups, implicit collaborators hidden from known citation records successfully contributed to resolving author identities, independently of their size. Moreover, co-authorship features collectively resolve more than 85% of ambiguities. This largely supports the coauthor disambiguation hypothesis. On the other hand, however, this means that co-authorship alone is not sufficient as an author-disambiguation feature, and raises the need for the adop-tion of additional features. As another strong biographic feature, emails or affiliations could become good candidates. How-papers and/or publications which could suggest author-specific research areas. Author occurrences showing highly similar research areas can be merged even though they do not have any coauthors in common. Strong irrelevance of research topics between the same-name authors can be used to prevent them from being grouped even if they share coauthors, only if names of sharing coauthors are not rare. 7. Conclusions
This study attempted to investigate the influence of co-authorship on author name disambiguation. To deal with the scar-city of explicit coauthors appearing in known citation records, a web-rendered technique of gleaning implicit coauthors not listed in known citations was proposed. Under the assumption that a pair of person names mutually determines the iden-tities of each other, a string of two author names in known citations was submitted to a web search engine to gather their unrevealed coauthors from retrieved web pages. The precision of the coauthor-expansion technique, however, can be re-duced due to the possibility that even a pair of two person names that have authored the same articles may indicate different pairs of real individuals. Probably, such a problem can be attacked by utilizing commonality/rarity of author names.
Findings from experiments largely supported a coauthor disambiguation hypothesis. More than 85% of author ambigui-ties were resolved by co-authorship. In addition, the performance of author disambiguation relying on co-authorship alone remained roughly stable without large fluctuations for most ranges of sizes. The use of more coauthors in common helps to uncover the identity of authors more accurately, but not for five or more sharing coauthors, due to their low applicability and/or superfluous-ness. Indirect acquaintances represented by coauthors of coauthors (of an author to be resolved) also contributed to the resolution of author names, but its disambiguation capability was less than that of direct acquaintances which correspond to explicit/implicit coauthors of an author to be resolved.
The use of Korean person names in coauthor-expansion and evaluations may limit the generalization of our findings to suffer from the matching problem of synonymous person names. We plan to adapt the coauthor-expansion technique for English author names, and repeat the experiments for previous author resolution test sets in English to confirm our results. In addition, this study needs to be extended to include the analysis of relationships among co-authorship and other author-resolving factors such as titles of papers/publications, emails/affiliations, etc.
