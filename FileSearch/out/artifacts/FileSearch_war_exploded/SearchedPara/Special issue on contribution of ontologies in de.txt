After he passed away, Prof Peter Chen contributed to the fi processes. Therefore, these systems often contain most of the company product and process knowledge. Unfortunately, this external ones often require some kind of reverse engineering processes for making data semantic explicit. Nowadays, ontologies are used for making explicit the meaning of information in several research and application domains.
Initiated in Arti fi cial Intelligence, ontologies are now used in a large spectrum of emerged. New methods have been proposed to embed within database of both ontologies and data, de domains, like product modeling, ontologies were published as standards. These ontologies are actually used to de exchange consortiums for sharing information in various application domains. Due to these recent developments, most commercial database systems offer solution to both manage ontologies and data (e.g., Oracle, IBM Sor).
The aim of this special issue of the Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering Journal is twofold. The new research and technological developments that use ontologies all over the life cycle of information systems.
There was a great response to the call for papers; we received 128 abstracts, and fi integration, ontology-driven information systems, ontology-enhanced information systems, reasoning, semantic data ware-and to combine them to design a complete system.
