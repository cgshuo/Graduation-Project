 1. Introduction
This paper explores novel ways of applying interaction histories in the information retrieval domain: the use of search histories to support information seeking and use. Information seeking requires a cognitive activ-ity that builds on human memory stores and processes; it requires attention, learning, recalling, and recogniz-ing information. These memory functions are crucial in allowing the user to bridge across the various phases of information seeking: planning, executing plans, gathering results, and finally synthesizing the results. In this study, we used observations, interviews, and participatory design sessions to examine the memory and history-keeping (memory aid) processes of users in the legal domain (attorneys and law librarians). We studied how searchers keep histories, what type of information they record and in what format, and how they use search histories. We identified many user tasks ( Fig. 1 ) that could profit from search histories. Based on the results we developed design guidelines for the search history function and information retrieval interfaces in general.

We found that information seekers in the legal domain often use externally recorded search histories to sup-port their searching. Understanding this behavior requires a basic understanding of the legal domain. The US legal system is precedent-based; laws are interpreted in courtrooms by judges and these interpretations are recorded and shared in case law databases, such as Westlaw, and they are used as the basis for arguments in subsequent litigation. Current and valid interpretations published in court opinions represent the law for attor-(e.g. family law) follow new developments in that area and often search for related topics. Their searches are also often complex, reflecting the complex nature of legal issues, and follow topics and sub-topics as they emerge from the material found. Thus, the legal domain is different from many other information domains, and many of our results should be transferred to another domain only based on an understanding of the char-acteristics of the domain and a sense of how strongly the findings are linked to a given domain characteristic.
Fig. 1 presents the user tasks that can be supported by search histories. Memory support (1) is the most basic function of search histories. Activity traces are recorded and provided to the user, removing from the user the burden of remembering all activities and items. All other search history uses build on memory sup-port. In order to find information in computerized systems, searchers must be able to manage interface mech-anisms and to use the search system (2). Finding (3), managing (4), and using (5) information build on memory support and search system use, but also introduce new history-based interface functions. Users search important function that should, and can, be supported by search histories. Even though this step is outside of the limited focus of current information retrieval systems, it supports real user tasks that flow from finding to using information. Finally, the even larger context of information seeking involves collaboration with others (7), a situation in which search history functions in information systems can help with sharing information and process histories between team members. Search histories provide a means of collecting information to be shared and providing context which is crucial for reinterpretation. For detailed results see Komlodi (2002a) .

Komlodi (2002b) .

Background and related research Interaction histories in computer applications have been studied in many domains: video editing ( Chiueh, Many of these applications provide limited history interaction capabilities, usually including: A timeline or other display of events.
 Undo and redo mechanisms.
 Macro-by-example capabilities.
 Selection from histories through favorites (manual) or contextual (automatic) menus.
 Analysis of history records for predicting future behavior.

Information retrieval (IR) systems and Web browsers most often apply timelines, undo/redo mechanisms, and selection from histories of visited pages or bookmarked favorites. The following sections review these his-tory tools in information systems. 2.1. Search histories
Interaction histories are records of user-system communications, often captured automatically by the system and sometimes manually edited, complemented, or annotated by the user. Search histories are a type of inter-action history which specifically record a user X  X  information-seeking steps. Search histories typically contain
Fig. 2 illustrates a search history manually recorded by an attorney while searching for the topic of  X  X  X en-efits for same-sex couples in Montgomery County, Maryland X  X . These notes were written on a notepad while searching to help the attorney plan and keep track of actions; they contain fragments of the queries and results: query phrases, key terms, titles, and dates. Words and phrases in these notes were often used as terms in future queries.

Similar search histories are often created by searchers through note-taking. Spink and Goodrum (1996) found that searchers take many notes while looking for information and those manual annotations are impor-tant to support searching for and using information. Current IR systems provide low levels of automatic recording of history information but often do not allow user notes. Although the automated history is more comprehensive, the manual notes add subjective comments on the process and content. The most complete systems provide support for both via search history annotation tools.

Various search history tools exist in current systems; we will use the classification in Table 1 as a framework for our review of existing tools. Search history systems can be organized along two dimensions: (1) According to their intended user group (1a for individual vs. 1b for collaborative use). Search histories in (2) According to the methods of processing/using the history data (2a by the searcher vs. 2b by the system). 2.2. Direct individual search histories 2.2.1. Online database histories (individual history used by user)
Even the earliest information retrieval systems provided some kind of history mechanism which was usually the display of  X  X uery-result set X  pairs. Back (1976) integrated search review features in his TIRES management information retrieval system, based on the findings of four previous studies and systems. Katter and McCarn (1971) described a system with a history command to trace the structure of search statements. Timbie and
Coombs (1969) and Marcus et al. (1971) both reported strong positive feedback on the usefulness of search history functions. In more recent developments, Hearst (1999) concludes that observations suggest the need for information retrieval and visualization systems to inform users about the steps taken in the past, choices available, short-term and long-term strategies, and the ability of the user to annotate choices and information.
She points out that these functions are not well-supported in current systems. 2.2.2. Web histories (individual history used by user)
Web browser history tools X  X he back/forward buttons, history lists, and bookmarks X  X re the best-known and most researched examples of current information-seeking history functionality ( Cockburn &amp; Jones, 1997;
Tauscher &amp; Greenberg, 1997 ). These histories record a limited amount of information from user interactions with the Web browser, allowing the user to review his or her history and revisit prior Web pages. Web browser history mechanisms, the back button, the favorites list, and the history frame, are influential because of the sheer number of users that encounter and use them.

Of the three Web history tools, the back button is the simplest and most often used (40% of all navigational actions, Tauscher &amp; Greenberg, 1997 ). The Back mechanism builds a stack model of actions, which means that many pages visited by the user are not in browsers X   X  X  X ack pages X  X  list, creating an unpredictable sequence of pages for users ( Cockburn &amp; Jones, 1997; Tauscher &amp; Greenberg, 1997 ).

The use of the other two tools is more labor-intensive than that of the back button. The history list is imple-mented in two forms. To reach the shorter history list, users must open a pull-down menu from the back but-ton and then select from the list of items to backtrack. The longer history list is available in a separate frame that can be opened from the menu bar. Users can reorder the items in this list and collapse/open the record by days and weeks. To use bookmarks/favorites, users must record a Web page for later use; they also have the option of annotating these Web pages and organizing them into folders. The management of bookmarks/ favorites has remained problematic.

To increase the usability of the history tools, Cockburn and Greenberg (1999) and Kaasten and Greenberg (2001) suggested a system integrating all three Web history tools by building a time-ordered history list with thumbnail representations of Web pages. This list included all Web pages visited and did not truncate the list as the Back button does. Favorites were represented by dog-earing selected pages in the thumbnail history view. In a preliminary usability evaluation of the integrated tool, users were enthusiastic and performed effi-ciently with the tool. Increasing usage rates and continued efforts to improve history tools show evidence of the need for a better understanding of how these histories can support information seeking. 2.3. Personalization systems (individual history used by the system)
Personalization systems use various methods to adjust to a particular user and personalize services and the help identify future user needs and to create dynamic user profiles. These dynamic profiles are often applied in addition to more static methods of characterizing users, such as questions posed to users at account setup or the collection of demographic characteristics and preferences.

For a review of Web personalization services, see Eirinaki and Vazirgiannis (2003) . Solutions for search in
Farnham, &amp; Cheng, 2003 ), or combining contextual and individual history information to create personalized vant to our focus, it involves the use of much the same history data. 2.4. Collaborative search histories (shared history used by user)
Interaction history information is often shared with others. Twidale and Nichols (1998) described the Ariadne system developed to support collaboration among users by visualizing search session histories. These visual his-tory representations are shared among users to provide help and instruction. The system displays query-result both the temporal sequence of actions and the semantic relationships between actions (e.g. choices from menus).
The upper portion of the screen is divided into three color-coded sections. The first section contains thumbnails documents. This visual display is available separately from searching, in the playback phase. Several important functions presented in this tool also appeared as a need for user interfaces in our data collection: The temporal display superimposed on the system structure (query, result lists, individual documents). User editing of the search history by  X  X olding up X  and hiding certain sections of it.
 User annotation of the search history.

Another example proposed by Wexelbat and Maes (1997) creates graphical representations of Web brows-ing histories, Footprints, to be shared among users. In this system the shared histories are directly exposed to users. The authors expect that by looking at the patterns of many users X  activities we can see useful routes emerge. This web visualization also overlays the users X  browsing paths on the Website structure. 2.5. Collaborative filtering (shared history used by system)
Collaborative filtering systems ( Konstan &amp; Riedl, 2003 ) create recommendations for users based on the evaluation of information search and selection by communities of users. An analysis of aggregate interaction history records enables these systems to create recommendations for users who have similar information-seek-ing patterns. The aggregate records in these systems represent a different use of recorded histories from our important in our data collection. 2.6. Preserving, reusing, and integrating information found
The tools and functions reviewed so far were all aimed at managing some form of system-recorded history information, with the only exception of user-selected bookmarks. The following two studies examine how humans save and manage search results and how systems can support these activities. Support for these activ-information-seeking process. Current system support for this activity is weak. Information retrieval systems provide document collection tools for conscious gathering of information, but the functionality is usually limited to selecting records to save and to using annotation and organization tools.

While most of the systems described so far suggest new technical solutions for automatic history keeping, user studies found that searchers often do not avail themselves of the built-in tools for keeping and reusing information but devise their own methods. Jones, Bruce, and Dumais (2001) observed and interviewed infor-mation specialists, researchers, and managers to study their information-keeping and reusing techniques in the
Web environment. The results of their study suggested that people did not use built-in methods. Web browser history and favorites features were hardly used, while other methods such as printing, saving, and emailing were used often. After analyzing and tools and methods participants used, the authors suggested a list of important requirements for information-keeping tools: portability (how easy it is to transport saved documents between computers and physical spaces), ease of access from different locations (how easy it is to access saved documents stored in one place from a different place or computer), persistence (how long the saved information will last and be accessible), preservation (preservation of information in its current form), currency (ability to update/refresh saved information), context (ability to save as much of the context of the information as possible), reminding (the ability of the system to use the saved information to remind the user of the information), ease of integration with old information, ease of sharing of saved information, ease of maintenance of the collection.
 To address these requirements, the  X  X  X tuff I X  X e Seen X  X  (SIS) system has been proposed ( Dumais et al., 2003 ).
The SIS system provides access to all information encountered by a user regardless of the application or context (Web, email, appointment, document, and so on). The integrated store can be accessed through contextual attributes such as time, author, and previews. A study of use with over 200 participants showed that users liked the speed and unification of access and searched for previously seen information by date and people X  X  names most frequently. Participants agreed that unified access to previously seen documents is an essential function. 3. Methodology
We chose a qualitative methodology to explore searcher behavior because it is most appropriate for collect-ing rich detail and gaining a thorough understanding of the motivations behind the behavior which can inform design. The study comprised of three main phases: (1) Phase 1: data collection through observations of and interviews with attorneys and law librarians; (2) Phase 2: iterative participatory interface design and evaluation sessions with attorneys and law (3) Phase 3: interface development and formal evaluation.

Our study began with a preliminary investigation of the topic area: a literature review on search history functions and studies of memory use in information seeking, interviews with expert searchers, and an analysis of usability testing videos of a search history system. This preliminary investigation showed that search history support is important for searchers and that current tools do not fully address user needs. Based on these find-ings, we developed an initial search history framework covering: 1. scope of history, 2. context of history, 3. search history data, 4. search history and result management, 5. search history use, and 6. design features.
 We then developed a study plan consisting of the three phases using an iterative methodology (see Fig. 4 ).
Each phase includes data collection on user behavior, search history framework development, and design of interface components. The results from Phases 1 and 2 are reported in this paper.

In Phase 1, eight attorneys were observed while searching and then interviewed by the first author. Firstly, the participants were asked to search Westlaw (the Web interface) for a topic of their choice and to think aloud while they were doing so. The search problem had to be topic-driven and involve several linked ques-tions as the literature review and the preliminary data collection showed that search histories were especially useful for these tasks. During the search, the participants were voice recorded and the interviewer took notes of their behavior. After the search, they were interviewed about the search session and about their memory and history use in general. The interview guide was developed based on the results of the preliminary data collection and contained questions about searcher behavior involving memory and history use and user inter-face design needs for search history tools. During the interview process the interviewer also obtained copies of external memory aids created by the participants.

Another eight interviews with expert legal information specialists were generously made available for this study by Halvorson (2000) . In these interviews, experts described their legal information-seeking practices, often reporting history keeping behaviors. The experts were law librarians who used many different systems.
Despite the differences in the systems used, interesting similarities emerged between their history keeping and that of the attorneys interviewed by the first author.

Phase 2 consisted of participatory design sessions with attorneys and law librarians. These participants were newly recruited for this phase in order to confirm the findings from Phase 1 with a new group of legal profes-sionals. The participants in these sessions viewed the interface designs that resulted from Phase 1, modified them, and then designed new interfaces incorporating their own ideas. The main outcomes from these sessions were user-grounded interface designs. In addition, the transcripts from these sessions were analyzed to further inform the search history framework, as participants regularly discussed their own search history use while designing new interfaces. In this phase we reached saturation in our data collection, we saw similar history-keeping patterns as in the first phase and the participants confirmed the requirements generated earlier.
The observation notes and transcripts of all interviews, think-aloud, and participatory design sessions were coded and analyzed using the standard Grounded Theory techniques ( Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998 ). The data were analyzed to identify: patterns of user behavior and preferences, roles for search histories, and requirements for search history systems.

Although the attorneys participating in the study worked at several different firms, the general context of their work was similar. The law firms studied are all large, multi-office, multi-regional law firms with estab-lishments in the Washington, DC area. They employ hundreds of attorneys and have offices all over the
US and in some cases the world. Attorneys usually work in large teams comprised of both junior and senior attorneys. The teams litigate large cases often spanning months and years. Attorneys share tasks and knowl-edge amongst each other and collaborate in litigating cases. The attorneys interviewed and observed were early in their careers (up to the seventh year of practice); at this stage they still perform many information-seeking tasks in their work. More senior attorneys often delegate these tasks to junior attorneys, and thus were not studied. All the participants used the Westlaw legal information system for their searching tasks. 4. Results: the use of search histories in information seeking
In this section we describe user behaviors that involve the use of search histories. Some of these behaviors were supported by system search history functions in our data collection. Others were not, but could poten-tially be. All of these behaviors are represented by high-level headings in Fig. 1 and their relationships to the headings are noted below. The behaviors described are: 1. Search system use: navigating the search application and the hypertext information store. 2. Find information/search: planning the search and tracking progress. 3. Find information/search: building and executing search strategies, and 4. Management of search results. 5. Information use: relevance judgments. 4.1. Search system use: navigating the Web search system and the hypertext information store
Search system use refers to basic interactions with the system: starting and closing applications, finding sys-tem functions, using system functions, and transferring information between applications. Searchers in our study had many problems with these interactions in the Web-based Westlaw application. They were often dis-oriented; they could not locate search system functions, and could not  X  X efind X  previously seen documents.
They did not use search histories to support navigation, but our observations showed that history-based tools could offer natural solutions to these problems.

A significant difficulty arose when our participants tried to navigate the Web application. Web application user interfaces use the same direct access to functions as software application user interfaces. As an example,
Westlaw had a dropdown menu with various functions very similar to that found in Microsoft Word. However, our participants very seldom used this menu; in most cases they navigated back and forth using the back button in a linear fashion similar to Web navigation. As an example, searchers tried to  X  X  X o back X  X  to the search screen to direct access the same screen. Thus, even though they were familiar with the direct-access metaphor of soft-ware application user interfaces, they referred to the linear Web browsing metaphor when using the Westlaw interface.

This behavior was partly due to confusion over navigation metaphors and partly due to users X  need to query form). While search histories cannot help with the first cause of this problem, direct access to previous steps will help with the second one and shorten navigation time significantly.

A second problem emerged with hypertext navigation and disorientation. The legal literature has many citations among its documents; these are often implemented through hypertext links, as in the Westlaw system.
This engendered complex navigation, often leading to disorientation and getting lost. Even simple search his-tories, such as breadcrumbs, can help this problem by providing a map of the user X  X  navigation and easy access to previously visited space thus reducing disorientation. 4.2. Find information/search 4.2.1. Planning the search and tracking progress
Planning is an important step in complex information-seeking tasks; it helps the searcher consider many alternatives and it guides the execution. Our participants often took notes to plan actions and monitored their progress against these. Planning the search involved two key tasks: (1) clarifying the information needs and (2) determining a course of action, including finding the proper keywords to express the need.
Our participants often carried these out in parallel. The first task, clarifying the information, need was often supported by  X  X eeler X  queries. Legal searchers in the study often sent feeler queries to a database to explore a topic and find out what the definitions of terms are, how the area is structured, and what related issues they need to search on. They took the information gained from these initial searches and updated their plans with keywords that were ideas for new queries, thus carrying out the second task of planning, determining the proper course of action.
 As a result, the plans most often included information for queries: keywords and limits (date, field name).
These keywords structured the search process for the users, who usually followed these plans in their search-ing. The next quote highlights the important role keywords played in handwritten plans: Paul: Keywords, very important, all along, because those are the guiding, organizing principle.
Interviewer: Notes? Paul: You saw my notes.
 Interviewer: Yes, it X  X  usually not continuous text, it X  X  keywords, reminders.

Paul: Yes, I usually go into searches with keywords. That X  X  the one thing I try to think of because searches are all keyword, or mostly keyword-organized. Phrases, or concepts, sometimes citations, but it X  X  really the keywords or the subject matters (that) will narrow down to get the closest thing of what I X  X  looking for.

During searching, these plans were regularly updated. Searchers found documents that had important new keywords or identified judges (authors) who wrote on a certain topic. They added these data (keywords, author names) to their plans.

As users made progress in their searching, they checked off queries on their planning notes and these plans eventually became search history records. In the following example, the searcher describes how she uses her notes to keep track of her search by recording topics and keywords: Halvorson: How much planning do you do before logging on to QuickLaw?
Best: I do a fair amount. I always make a list of keywords, synonyms and alternate words, and think about which words should be truncated. I think about what databases to search and make a note of them. Then, as I do the search, I refine it and check off what I X  X e searched. Depending on how complex the search is and how many alternate terms it includes, my search plan is more like a diagram, with several columns of alter-nate terms separated by the appropriate connectors. 4.2.2. Find information/search: search steps and techniques/search strategies
Once searchers begin their interactions with the IR system, they engage in various search strategies to find documents that are useful for their information needs. Search histories proved to be useful for a number of these search strategies. The following sections describe those search strategies used by the legal searchers that search histories can support. 4.2.2.1. Supporting search steps: reuse same query. As part of building and executing their search strategy, par-ticipants often reran the same query for any of the following reasons: (1) The searcher wanted to see a set of documents he had worked with before; (2) The same topic needed to be searched in a different database; (3) The search results needed to be updated (discussed in Section 4.2.2.5 ); (4) The searcher wanted to share the query with others; (5) The searcher wanted to recreate the context of an interrupted task.

Several participants described retrieving a previously seen document set through rerunning the original query rather than using the existing history tools or a saved result set. They described this solution as easier than using a history tool. This problem can be addressed by making access to previous document sets easier from a history (thus having the opportunity to preserve more of the context: annotations and other person-alization features) and updating the result list from the database if necessary.

Participants also reran the same query to look for the same information in multiple databases. Westlaw thing needed, attorneys often described running the same query in several of these databases and presenting the results separately, as illustrated in the following quote: I: Write your query down? Do you write anything else down?
Frank: Usually what I do is I write down the query that was most successful, I might not write down all of them, but I would write down the one that was most successful, the one that got me to the information that
I needed, so if I have to do the same query in a different database, I got it right there ... I would make sure that I write down, maybe at the top of the paper here [the printout of the result list] what I had searched in order to retrieve this. Exactly as I entered it.

Rerunning queries and searches was also used as a tool for collaboration, to share the results and the pro-cess with others. One participant described replaying or displaying a set of steps to help explain why some-thing was done as a method to train others. In a different organization, experts published queries for less experienced searchers to use. This type of search history represents a collective memory of good techniques used in the domain of the organization X  X  work. The queries shared dealt with typical tasks in the work of the organization.

Above we identified several typical tasks when searchers needed to rerun previous queries without modify-explained taking notes of queries in order to avoid repeating them: I: What would you write down?
Frank: I would write down exactly what I had searched and in what database I had searched, so that I didn X  X  repeat myself, so that I didn X  X  do the same thing twice. 4.2.2.2. Supporting search steps: modify query/reformulate query. In addition to reusing the same query, search-ers often modified previous queries and reused new versions. Many query modifications were especially typical of attorneys. Most attorneys had less expertise in searching than law librarians and they often used end-user search strategies. They proceeded through many trials while formulating a satisfactory query. The first query they ran helped them get ideas on how to proceed, then they improved the original query based on the results.
In the following instance the searcher starts with a complex query and in a later query uses only part of the query expression:
Stephen: I think I would look more, I would go back to my first search with the textbooks and the sepa-ration of church and state, establishment clause, that was one thing I found, separation of church and state wasn X  X  a good way to search, establishment clause was much better. And look for law review articles, very recent law reviews on establishment clause and maybe public school to see if there is anything like that. I would keep looking at these school, public school cases, there were 140 cases and I X  X e always been some-body that trudges through things, so I would just keep trudging through things.
 A special case of query modification was combining previous queries, a frequent function in search systems.
Search interfaces usually provide a list of previous queries with the option of setting up AND and OR rela-tionships between them and rerunning them in the combined form. Combining previous queries was especially important for our searchers in building-block search strategies, when they searched separately on various terms and afterwards combined the queries.

Searchers were also interested in comparing results sets. They wanted to find out what the overlaps and differences were between two document sets. While they could get the same information through a complex Boolean query, most of our users preferred the simpler solution of combining the result sets.

Participants often wanted to search within a result set. For example, if they carried out a search on  X  X  X opy-collection. egy takes advantage of the highly inter-cited and interlinked nature of legal literature, which has been described earlier. When a searcher found a particularly relevant case, law review article, or a relevant anno-tated code, she often used it as a starting point to follow all the links to further information. Many searchers Westlaw, these connections were represented by hypertext links, making citation chaining more convenient.
However, as with most hypertext navigation in complex information spaces, disorientation became a problem for users who applied this technique. 4.2.2.4. Observing repeated occurrences of cases. Another strategy observed in the study was looking for cases that the searcher had seen before. Cases that had been seen before may be interesting for a variety of reasons; cases. Another reason can be that if a case had been seen on several occasions, it was likely an often-cited and important case. In the following example, the searcher described recognizing a case that he had seen before. Having seen it before contributes importance to that case: I: When you say you X  X e looking for cases that you recognize, why is that? to use that, if it X  X  been followed quite a bit. 4.2.2.5. Updating searches and citation checking. Another technique our participants reported in the interviews was updating the original result set and checking the status/validity of the court opinions contained in cases.
While this is often achieved through rerunning earlier queries (Section 4.2.2.1 ), its importance for the legal out over a long time period and new documents can emerge that will impact the litigation. The goal of updat-ing searches is to keep the attorney aware of new developments that occurred in the area of a legal issue. The these are crucial for successful litigation and are ethical responsibilities of the attorney.
Updating the search results is most often carried out by someone other than the original searcher. The attorney may carry out the original searching and then delegate updating to the legal assistant. Sharing the search history for updating purposes (such as running the same or modified query as described in Sections 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 ) and then reporting the results to the supervisor is an important part of this process. As described in the following quote: Karen: If it was more than a week, you still have to go into a search and make sure it was current.
The second technique described by our participants, citation checking, is part of general practice in legal information seeking and its goal is to make sure the law is still valid ( Kunz, Schmedemann, Downs, &amp; Bate-son, 1996 ). All cases considered for use must be checked periodically for validity as court opinions about them may reaffirm or overturn previous decisions, thus endangering their use for the task of the searcher. An elec-tronic version of Shephard, a legal citation index used for citation checking, is included in Westlaw for this purpose. The quote below tells a story about the importance of citation checking:
Michael: One thing I didn X  X  do before I printed it is Shepardize it, which I typically do, yeah, I always, because you never want to get into a situation when you print out a case, then you find later on that it was overruled. I had that happen once when I wrote an entire brief and built it around one case and I had Shepardized it, or at least I thought I had done it, and about six hours before I filed the brief, the para-legal who was doing the final cite check on this found that this case has been overruled. Actually it has been vacated on other ground, so I could still use it for the point I wanted to sue for, but I thought I was going to get a heart attack. 4.3. Management of search results and search history
The participants in our study used a wide variety of methods to save search results and histories. They cop-ied text, printed screens, and took handwritten notes. After saving search results and search histories, they often reopened, reran, edited, annotated, or deleted these records. Reopening and rerunning is why most participants save records. Editing, annotating, and deleting may sound like too much overhead, but the legal participants in the study still carried out these tasks either to make the records appropriate to share with oth-ers or to make them more useful for their own work. In one example, the following participant describes delet-ing parts of his search history:
Daniel: I mean I make so many false starts and stops, if I could weed out the ones that [I don X  X  need], then that would be helpful, but if I saw all the garbage that I went through to get to that I wouldn X  X  be interested in that. 4.4. Information use: relevance judgments
The ultimate user goal in the information-seeking process is to locate and use information to solve a prob-lem. The transition from finding information to using it includes several steps: (1) making relevance judgments about the document; (2) saving the document; (3) relating the document to the task it is relevant for. The first of these steps will be discussed in detail here.

Relevance judgments are based on reading and interpreting the results and relating them to the searcher X  X  own knowledge and problem at hand. Participants in our study often described these decisions while making them. The results that were deemed relevant enough were saved for future analysis or use. When saving the selected document, the participants very often recorded their decision along with the document saved. They either annotated a document itself through handwritten notes on printouts or sticky notes or they kept a sep-arate note (on paper or electronically) where they recorded a pointer to the document and a note on its rel-evance. These notes usually included a short reminder of why the searcher thought a certain case was relevant, for what task he was going to use it, or with whom he would share it. The following two participants described the importance of recording why the searcher thought something was relevant and to record whether the doc-ument saved was for or against their argument:
Kathy: A lot of times you can see, as a junior associate, you go to the partner and they X  X l say why did you pull this case? And you X  X l have to explain what caused you to think that this was relevant. And it X  X  difficult to do that if you looked at a hundred cases without a road map.

Stephen: And acceptance relevance judgments, we would want to look at all of the cases, even ones that might go against you, just to be able to distinguish them.

Interviewer: So you would want somehow note that, that this is positive, this is negative, but I X  X  still interested.

Stephen: Yes, because if you want to look at the ... , usually the other side is going write its own brief and you want to look at the cases they cited and tried to why they are not applicable so you want to look at everything, even the ones against you. 4.4.1. Changing relevance judgments
Many of our participants described delayed and changing relevance judgments. Relevance has been shown
Belkin, 2000; Mizzaro, 1997 ). Delayed relevance judgments happen in cases when a searcher views a docu-ment, deems it relevant or irrelevant at the time of viewing, but later reverses his or her judgment. The change in the relevance judgment can be due to many factors. For example, information learned at a later point can increase the relevance of the previous documents in hindsight. In this case, the searcher needs to be able to revisit the items previously judged. This happened in many of our search sessions.

The opposite of this happens when a document that looked relevant in the beginning of the search and was saved turns out to be irrelevant by the end of the session. One of the participants described her practice of marking changes in relevance decisions and explaining the reasons for them:  X  X  X hought relevant/not relevant X  X , this is why I thought it was relevant, this is why it X  X  not relevant. Then I have a pile of printed out relevant and highlighted, which areas were key. And then two separate piles with the search history connected to both.

Partial relevance refers to judging documents relevant but not fully committing to them ( Spink &amp; Greis-thing that might be relevant and mark it to return to it later for a more in-depth investigation. Searchers need a reminder to revisit these documents. In the following example, one participant made a mental reminder of the cases she wanted to look at later:
Emily: All right, so I X  X  going back to the latter part of the search where I saw a bunch of cases that were from my court and I X  X l just pull them up quickly and I X  X l see if there X  X  anything there. I tried to start where I think I X  X  going to get the most immediate gratification and if I find something in that particular court that would be very helpful. 5. Search history user interface recommendations
Translating results of user studies to user interface designs is rather an art than a science. Tracking these design rationales is extremely important in both explaining and evolving design ideas. However, a direct one-to-one translation of behavioral findings to user interface designs is not always possible. The behavioral findings inspire the designs in one of several ways. They can point to limitations and problems with current interfaces, show needs that are not supported by systems and are addressed by workarounds, or include spe-cific suggestions from users for new tools.
 In order to create a connection between our behavioral findings and design recommendations, we created
Table 2 . In Section 4 we described user tasks that can be supported by search histories and described how these can be supported. Table 2 shows which design recommendation supports which user task. 5.1. Search history display
Based on our results we recommend presenting a continuously growing search history record on the search screen, with a user option to minimize this window. As shown in Table 2 , search history displays can support many information-seeking related user tasks. We identified several guidelines for the design of on-screen search history displays; we will discuss these next.

Our observations suggest a task-oriented rather than an application-oriented history display . Searchers use computers to find information and solve problems, not to use a certain application. Organizing history records by user tasks, and not by the application used, will help users bridge across applications to accomplish these tasks and not be limited by the boundaries of applications. Many of the manually-created history records had this advantage over computer histories: searchers could copy and integrate information from different appli-cations into a Word file and created continuity across applications and steps. History tools should extend across the various steps and the associated applications as well.

Histories need to preserve the context of each of the items included . Showing a the title of a document to a searcher may bring some memories back about why and how it was found; however, human memory is lim-ited, and even with triggers like that we may find it hard to remember what we were doing and why. To help the searcher remember, more of the context should be provided in the search history. This need surfaced in the way our participants recorded search histories, used them in current tools, and critiqued existing tools. Con-text can be preserved through: 1. capturing as many of the steps as possible, 2. presenting the history in a meaningful structured form showing with the temporal and semantic relation-ships between steps, and 3. allowing searchers to attach personal annotations to the history.
 We will discuss the last two of these in more detail.

Structured displays , where the history is overlaid on a high-level schematic representation of the system structure, were always preferred by our participants. These displays allowed for a better understanding of the history. In these displays, a schematic representation of the system (usually comprising of query screen, detailed query screen, result list, individual document, related document) was used to structure the history dis-play and show semantic relationships between items. As an example, the Ariadne system in Fig. 3 structures uments in the bottom strip. Then each history item is represented in its corresponding area, which makes understanding the items and their relationships easier.

In addition, relationships within items in the same category can be shown. Semantic relationships can be especially useful. For example, if a legal decision confirms an earlier decision, that case will be very valuable only common element between two cases is the judge, it can be marginally relevant for the attorney, but not crucial. Showing these relationships help users to more quickly understand the structure of the document space.

Ease of access is another important factor in the usability of search history displays. The effort associated with accessing current history tools often outweighs that of recreating previous searches, and thus search his-tories are underused. This problem can be mitigated by presenting the history on the search screen as a default and allowing the user to close the window when it is not needed. 5.2. Integrating search history information into other search system displays
In addition to direct search history displays, historical information can be integrated into other search sys-tem displays, such as query formulation and results display screens. When a query is entered, similar previous queries can be displayed in a drop-down list such as in Web browser text entry boxes. Similar queries can also be highlighted in the search history.

Incorporating history records into result displays can enrich their meaning. New or repeating results can be highlighted in result lists. Result documents that appear in multiple queries can be identified. Query keywords can be highlighted in documents not just from the most recent, but several additional queries. 5.3. Tools for planning integrated with history
Planning was an integral part of searching in our study and should be linked and integrated with the rest of the searching process in online searching tools as well. Searchers carry out planning before and during search-ing. Both of these plans should be recorded in the search history. Having the plans right on the search screen will help searchers remember and execute them.

Next the planned steps can be matched against the actual steps of the searching process and searchers can nario, a particularly relevant document can become a hub from which the searcher follows links to other doc-uments. The citations in this document can serve as a plan representation and the original document should be saved and marked in an easily-accessible place, a landmark to which the searcher can return and from where she can follow new links. 5.4. Accessing steps from search history display
Histories provide easy access to previous steps the searcher may want to reuse. Accessing information from the search history and re-executing previous steps, however, these functions raise several questions. We will review rerunning queries, modifying them, and returning to previously seen documents.

Legal researchers often return to previous queries to rerun them as they are or to modify them. When rerunning a query in the same form, the searcher should be able to decide whether he wants to see the old result set or rerun the query in the database which may contain new relevant documents. When rerunning the query, new result documents can be highlighted in the result set.

When reformulating queries, system support should include easy access to previous queries, easy editing, combining queries, and the ability to keep track of different versions and their relationships to one another.
As the many reformulations may result in a high number of similar queries, it is hard for searchers to distinguish and remember what queries they have run already, and this often leads to repeating queries or confusion. Showing differences between the wording and structure of queries is also important to help searchers distinguish them. For example, showing a query tree highlighting differences from level to level may help.

Legal searchers also often return to previous documents. One reason for this is citation checking, described in Section 4.2.2.1 . Citation checking should be easy to do or even automatic, based on previous search and information use history. The user should be able to select cases for future citation checking and receive notification if the status of the cases changed. The searcher can be prompted to run the updates, and to manage saved searches or the system can automatically detect and report changes to the user. The requirement to update emphasizes the importance of recording dates and times for search history and results records. In order to compare dates and times, the original date and time and the context should be recorded.

The updated results of both searches and citation checking should be incorporated into the records of the previous results if those are permanently preserved. In the following example, the participant describes updat-ing his topic-oriented files:
Karen: If there is something that comes up, big change of rule, used to be able to do this, can X  X  do this any-more, I go back to the old file, put a sheet of paper in there and say, in October 1996 the National Securities
Market Improvement Act was adopted. And it affected suitability, state regulation of insurance products and leave the file as it was and then you start a new file. And then you also file separates, because then you need to go back and see. And every time an issue comes up that was affected by that you have to go back to the file to see how it was changed.

This example suggests that history systems may have to consider both persistence within a case over time as well as linkages across cases, teams of users, and possibly firms. This is a daunting challenge that large-scale document management systems must address. 5.5. Managing search results
Participants often expressed a need to manipulate result sets. The most popular functions were: (1) searching within the set; (2) comparing result sets and (3) combining multiple result sets.

These needs, and especially (2) and (3), were often mentioned by the searchers but were seldom supported by current search systems. When comparing result sets, searchers wanted to see overlaps between sets (Bool-ean AND) and new items that only appeared in one set (Boolean NOT). Combining result sets (Boolean OR) also often appeared as a need. All these can be achieved through the use of Boolean operators; however, end users are not comfortable with those and prefer graphical representation and direct manipulation of result sets. 5.6. Tools for managing and editing search histories
The searcher should have full control over the content of the search history. In order to achieve this, he the recording allows the searchers to control what gets recorded at the time of the actions. Editing and deleting allow post-hoc control over what is preserved for long-term. Both during and after searching, reordering and searching search histories should be an option as this helps searchers interpret the history and find sections to opened, replayed, manipulated, annotated, and shared.
 Annotations are especially important because they help preserve context and personalize search histories.
A list of events examined two weeks after their completion may be hard to decipher without personal notes and interpretations attached. The attorneys and law librarians in our study annotated search histories via attaching sticky notes to printouts and marking them with highlighters. These annotations helped them inter-pret the history in the next step of their task.

Annotations can take the form of textual comments or graphical marks. Text comments capture reasons for saving something, interpretations, or pointers on how to use it. Graphical marks can help with emphasis and drawing attention, whether to support navigation during the session or reinterpretation of the history after the session.

While these functions seem like significant overhead for the use of search histories, our study participants expressed the need and concern for being able to manage history information. Participants in our study often edited their histories and wanted to go back and delete sections of the history. These actions serve the purposes of housekeeping; they help with task management, preserve privacy, and make search histories truly useful. 5.7. Saving search results for use: relevance judgment tool
When deciding to save a document, searchers make a decision about the relevance of a document. Rele-vance judgments are not simply binary yes-or-no decisions. Some cases and documents are more relevant than or task that is of interest beyond the case at hand. Some cases are good for the attorney X  X  cause, while others are against it, but should still be collected and studied. Some cases are relevant because they consider the same legal issue, while others are important because the defendant was involved in them. Saving elements of this decision along with the documents helps searchers when using the document for their task.
Saving simple relevance judgments can be achieved through using annotations; however, relevance is a complex enough decision that it can warrant a separate tool. Searchers should be able to record different com-ponents of relevance with minimum effort. When entering a relevance judgment, a pop-up window with a rel-evance template can appear. The template can include such information as what task the document is relevant for, why, and how it will be used, possibly with pull-down menus showing customized pre-established catego-ries. Showing why a case or document was relevant at the time of the decision makes the user X  X  task of inter-preting and integrating documents at a later time easier by reminding her of the previous interpretation. The template can also include a scale that would allow the searcher to capture the degree of relevance. Another aspect to include can be the user task for which the document should be used. As the user makes relevance decisions, the document (or section of a document or group of documents) can be linked right then and there to the task for which they will be used, as in Lin X  X  (2001, 2002) work. This system allows customized indexing of documents found and it provides functionality to assign documents to various user-defined interests or task categories. The relevance tool should also allow changing the relevance judgments by searchers.
Clearly, the implications of changing and partial relevance are problematic for document management sys-tems. One extreme view is to simply save everything and facilitate lots of annotation, reuse, and review (e.g.
Gemmell, Lueder, &amp; Bell, 2003 ). Decreasing costs of storage makes this strongly viable technically, but the more difficult challenge then becomes creating management and indexing strategies to help people to efficiently deal with their massive histories. 6. Conclusions
Searchers rely heavily on their memory and external memory aids when searching for information, as shown by our results. Despite the important support memory aids provide, few researchers have explored the nature of their use in searching. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of memory and external memory aids in searching and to identify user interface design guidelines for information retrieval systems. We found many behaviors related to information seeking that take advantage of memory aids. While these are clearly needed, information retrieval systems currently provide limited memory aid support. Improvements in this area are necessary to help increase the efficiency of online searching.

As discussed earlier, our most important recommendation was the inclusion of a structured and editable search history display in the search screen. Other recommendations included integrating search history infor-mation in other search system displays such as result lists, creating tools for planning, managing search his-tories and results, and saving relevance judgments.

A prototype system has been implemented incorporating the most important of these recommendations ( Kaur, Komlodi, Win, &amp; Komlodi, 2005a, 2005b ). The results of the evaluation show that participants found the tools very useful for their information seeking. They were highly satisfied with structured, direct-access search history display present on the search screen. The results of our original user study and the follow-up evaluation strongly suggest that following these guidelines will result in better searches and higher searcher satisfaction in knowledge-intensive settings.
