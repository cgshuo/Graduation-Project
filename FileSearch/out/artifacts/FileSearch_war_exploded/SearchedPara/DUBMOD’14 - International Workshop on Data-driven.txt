 opinions, discuss their interests, publicize businesses, recommend products, and, explicitly or im plicitly, reveal personal information. Many research projects and commercial products have used this information to drive a variety of services, such as recommending local news stories [2] , detecting events [3] , determining group sentiment of products and brands [1], and smart crowd-sourcing [8] . The ma jority of this work, however, has focused on aggregating data acr oss many users. In contrast, our focus is to create deep models of individual users from social media, including the content users publish and the behavior that they exhibit. This has been an active area of research recently and a number of papers on this topic have appeared in related conferences and workshops [4, 5, 6]. Various analytic techniques have been applied to infer users X  home location [7], gender [4, 6], age [4], regional origin [4] , ethnicity [5], political orientation [4, 5], and personality [9]. Although there is abundant work in this area, there are m any technical challenges remaining to be addressed. Our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in this topic to share their experiences and discuss remaini ng challenges. While acquiring a deep understanding of users brings great benefits to businesses and individual users themselves, such an understanding may also reveal information that users would prefer to keep private. Such concerns are particularly important because individuals do not have complete control over the information they share about themselves; friends of a us er ma y inadvertently divulge private information about that us er in their own posts. This workshop builds upon the success of our previously held workshops in conjunction with ACM IUI 2012, ACM CIKM 2012 and ACM CIKM 2013 and focuses more on data-centric analysis and mining aspects of user and user behavior understanding from social media. In particular, we plan to solicit work on topics in one or more of the following areas: Analytics  X  Interactive visual analy tics for understanding derived user  X  Integrated content and social network mining and analy sis to  X  Mining of heterogeneous data s ources to derive user insights  X  Discovery of trustworthy information and information  X  Establish and grow a community that consists of researchers  X  Initiate collaboration (e.g., creating and sharing public We hope to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas, such as user modeling, social media analysis, natural language processing, da ta mining, machine learning, privacy and security, to discuss these issues and share results. We will hold a half-day workshop program on Nov, 3, 2014. The program begins with a welcome note. After that there will be a madness session during which participants introduce themselves and their work in 5 m inutes. Par ticipants will be encouraged to make slides for the madness session, but this will not be required. Each paper session will conclude with a discussion led by a pre-chosen workshop participant. Thes e discussions will tie together common themes of the presenta tions and hopefully lead to insightful discussions about further research directions. The program will end with a open discussion where participants will discuss the current state of the art, focus areas, and opportunities for future research.
