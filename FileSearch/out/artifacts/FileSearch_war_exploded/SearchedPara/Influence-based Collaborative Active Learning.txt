 In order to learn a user X  X  prefe rences in collaborative recom-mender systems it is crucial to select the most informative items for a user to rate. For example, rating a popular item will provide little discriminative information about user X  X  preferences since most users like popular items. Existing approaches select the most informative items based primar-ily on items X  uncertainty , but tend to ignore an important metric of coverage  X  the number of items for which we are able to accurately estimate preferences. Selecting an item based only on uncertainty will reduce the uncertainty of the selected item, but will not necessarily reduce the uncertainty of other items  X  which is the ultimate goal. Therefore, in order to reduce the uncertainty over all items, we propose to select items that are not only uncertain but are also in-fluential . Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

When the number of items is very large, it may not be possible for a user to examine all of the choices in order to find the most suitable one. Recommender systems allow us to cope with this problem by suggesting items (e.g. movies, books, or web sites) that a user is likely to be interested in. Items are presented by a recommender system mainly for two reasons: exploitative  X  X resentinganitemthatauser will probably like and buy; explorative  X  X resentinganitem in order to better learn user X  X  preferences. In this paper we concentrate on the latter (explorative) issue of learning user X  X  preferences.

Collaborative filtering is a commonly used approach that allows us to approximate a user X  X  preferences [11, 5, 1]. It is based on the assumption that if a group of users shares common interests, then it is probable that an item that one user likes will also be favored by the rest of the group X  X  users. Therefore if we can find users that are similar to the target user we will be able to predict the user X  X  preferences based on the preferences of similar users. A user must express preferences for at least a few items before it is possible to find other similar users. However, most users are willing to express their preferences only for a small number of items. Therefore it is crucial to select the most informative items for learning the preferences of a new [4, 9, 13, 2] or existing user [12, 14, 8].

Existing approaches obtain information about user X  X  pref-erences often by asking a user to rate the most uncertain items, where uncertainty is usually estimated by entropy [4, 9, 13] or variance [2, 4]. However, existing methods tend to ignore an important metric of coverage (the number of items for which we are able to accurately estimate prefer-ences) [3]. Ignoring coverage and selecting items based only on uncertainty could result in reducing uncertainty in a local manner. For example, picking an outlier item (e.g. a movie  X  X ating habits of ducks X ) will reduce the uncertainty of only a few other items. In order to reduce uncertainty in a global manner, we propose to reduce uncertainty with respect to coverage. To achieve this goal, we select items to be rated that are not only uncertain, but are also influential (mea-sured by the changes in the approximated ratings of other unrated items).
In recommender systems user X  X  preferences are often esti-mated based on the user X  X  ratings and the ratings of other users. It is possible to ask a user to rate items. However, the user is often not willing to rate items unless it results in the significant improvement in the accuracy of predictions. Therefore it is crucial to select the most informative items in order to be able to accurately determine the user X  X  pref-erences. In the following paragraphs we will formulate this problem in a more formal way.

In this paper we consider memory-based collaborative fil-tering algorithms [11, 7, 1], i.e. the user X  X  preferences are approximated based on the preferences expressed by other users. Let X be the set of all items and X ( r ) c (  X  X )bethe set of items that have been rated by the target user c ,where r stands for rated. Let us denote the rating of the item x (  X  X ( r ) c ) by the user c as y c,x . The set of items that have not been rated by the user c is expressed as X ( u ) c ,where u stands for for unrated. Note that X ( r ) c X ( u ) c = X and X c X ( u ) c = X . The approximated value of the unknown rating  X  y c,x is commonly [1] expressed as: where  X  C denotes the set of users that are the most simi-lar to the given user c and who have rated item x ; k is a normalizing constant k =( c  X   X  C | sim ( c, c ) | )  X  1 ;and sim is a similarity function usually defined by Pearson correlation as: sim ( c, c )= x  X  X where X ( r ) cc is the set of items that have been rated by both
Eqs.(1) and (2) imply that the choice of X ( r ) c (used for finding similar users) affects the accuracy of approximated ratings. In practice, a user is willing to rank only a small number of items. Therefore it is important to optimize the items to be ranked so that for all of the items x  X  X ( u ) well approximates the true rating y c,x . This is the problem we address in this paper.
In existing collaborative active learning methods [4, 9] an informative item is selected according to the uncertainty re-duction in a local manner. That is an item with the highest uncertainty is selected and its rating is obtained. Obtaining the rating of the most uncertain item reduces the uncer-tainty of the rated item. However, it will not necessarily reduce the uncertainty of other items  X  which is the ulti-mate goal. Thus, items to be rated should be selected with respect to the global reduction in uncertainty. In order to achieve this we introduce the influence criterion which mea-sures the effect that rating an item has on the approximated values of other unrated items.

To illustrate this, let us consider a simplified example shown in Figure 1. This figure shows items that are pro-jected onto two dimensional space. A rated item is repre-sented as a black circle, while an unrated item is represented as a white circle. The distance between items represents their relation (the smaller is the distance the stronger is the Figure 1: Illustration of the importance of the influ-ence criterion described in Sections 3, 4. relation). The items that have strong relation between each other could be considered to belong to the same cluster. When an item becomes rated it reduces the uncertainty of other related items. Suppose the uncertainty value is equal for the items in clusters 2 and 3. Since the number of related items is larger in cluster 2, each item in cluster 2 influences moreitemsthaneachiteminclu ster 3. Therefore, selecting an item to rate based not only on the uncertainty criterion but also on the influence criterion reduces uncertainty in a global manner.

Following the above idea, we propose to select an item to rate based on both the uncertainty and the influence crite-rions. We combine the uncertainty criterion U ( x )andthe influence criterion I ( x )as:
Item X  X  rating uncertainty U ( x ) could be estimated by uti-lizing the existing methods through the use of variance [4, 2]. Variance of the rating value y of item x could be calculated as: where Y x is the set of ratings of item x given by the users that have rated item x , | Y x | is the number of elements in Y and y x is the mean value of elements in Y x .
 The influence information I ( x ) is not available in advance. In the following section we propose an influence estimation approach.
When the rating of an item is obtained it affects approxi-mated ratings of other unrated items (Eqs.(1) and (2)). We propose to estimate the influence of an item by changing its rating and observing the changes in the approximated rat-ings of other unrated items as illustrated in Figure 2. In the following paragraphs we will formulate this approach in a more formal way.

We want to estimate the influence that rating a candidate item x (  X  X ( u ) c ) will have on the approximated ratings of other unrated items in X ( u ) c \ x . Let us denote the training set of user c as a set of rated items and their corresponding Figure 2: Influence estimation as described in Sec-tion 4. that adding a varying hypothetical rating  X  y c, x +  X  of item x to the training set T c has on the approximated output values of other unrated items in X ( u ) c \ x .Let T c, X  augmented training set obtained by adding ( x,  X  y c, x +  X  )to T : Then the influence criterion is defined as: ing set T c ;andinthecaseof X  y ( T c, X  ) c,x given training set T
In practice, it is computationally expensive to use all pos-sible values of  X  . In preliminary experiments we used  X  { X  1 , 1 } ,  X   X  X  X  1 } and obtained similar results. 1 For this reason, we decided to use  X   X  X  X  1 } in numerical experiments (Section 5).
When  X  y c, x +  X  is out of range, we project the value into the range. Figure 3: Mean absolute error (MAE) achieved after obtaining a user X  X  preferences for the given number of items (in the current implementation MAE is un-defined when only one item has been rated). Items to be rated are selected by corresponding methods. Details of experimental setup are given in Section 5.
We evaluated proposed and existing methods (random, popularity [4], variance [4], entropy [4] and a hybrid popularity-entropy method [9] ) in an offline experiment utilizing the MovieLens dataset 2 . We randomly selected 100 users that have each rated at least 100 items. For each user we with-held all of the user X  X  items and by applying corresponding methods sequentially selected 10 items for which the pref-erences would be expressed. At each step we obtained the user X  X  preference function by applying memory-based Pear-son correlation to selected rated items (Eqs.(1) and (2)), and calculated mean absolute error by using the rest of the user X  X  items (Figure 3).

At each step an item to be rated x is selected by the cor-responding methods as follows. In the random approach, an item is selected randomly following the uniform distribu-tion. In the popularity approach, the most popular item is selected i.e. argmax x Pop ( x ), where popularity is measured by the number of expressed ratings for a given movie by all of the users i.e. Pop ( x )= | Y x | [4]. In the variance ap-proach, the item with the largest rating variance (calculated by Eq.(4)) is selected [4]. In the entropy approach, the item with the highest entropy is selected i.e. argmax x H ( y x where the entropy of an item is estimated using the relative frequency of all possible ratings r i.e. H ( y x )=  X  r P ( y r | ity that item x is rated r , given the set Y x of all expressed ratings of item x . Finally, in the hybrid popularity-entropy available at http://movielens.umn.edu/ approach, an item that is popular and has a high entropy is selected as argmax x H ( y x )log Pop ( x )[9].

Experimental results (Figure 3) demonstrate that the speed of convergence of the proposed method is faster than that of existing approaches, especially in the early stages. However, as the number of items increases, the accuracy of all of the methods flattens out. It is crucial to be able to approximate user X  X  preferences given only a few rated items. Therefore the proposed approach appears to be a promising candidate.
Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that users share common interests, i.e. users X  preferences are re-lated. However, existing methods [4, 9] do not take advan-tage of the relations between items and as a result reduce un-certainty in a local manner (Section 3). On the other hand, by utilizing the strength of the relations between items (es-timated by the proposed influence criterion) the proposed method reduces uncertainty in a global manner. This allows to improve not only the uncertainty but also the coverage .
Increased coverage could also allow a recommender system to suggest an unfamiliar item to a user that may prompt a user to be interested in the novel category [3, 6]. It has been shown in [10], that also from the user X  X  perspective, influence is an important factor that affects recommendations from a recommender system (i.e. ratings of an influential user significantly affect the predicted recommendations of other users).

The proposed approach could be applied to any collab-orative recommendation methods that utilizes user X  X  rated items for estimating the rating of unrated item. In this paper, we concentrate on the explorative value of the infor-mation that rating an item would provide. Therefore we assume that it is possible to suggest an unfamiliar item for the user to evaluate (e.g. asking a user to watch and rate an unfamiliar movie). However, when it is necessary for a user to provide immediate feedback about an item, the probabil-ity that the user has already formed a preference could be incorporated by applying existing methods e.g. [13]. The computational complexity of influence estimation is O ( n 2 )(where n is the number of unrated items). In future works we are planning to further reduce the computational complexity of influence estimation by e.g. incrementally up-dating itemwise influence instead of recalculating it at each step. In addition, we are planning to investigate the theo-retical properties of the proposed method. [1] G. Adomavicius and A. Tuzhilin. Toward the next [2] D. A. Cohn, Z. Ghahramani, and M. I. Jordan.
