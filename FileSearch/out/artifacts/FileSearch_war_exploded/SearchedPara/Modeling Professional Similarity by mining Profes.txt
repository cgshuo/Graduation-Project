 For decades large corporations as well as labor placement services have maintained extensive yet static resume databanks. Online professional networks like LinkedIn have taken these resume data-banks to a dynamic, constantly updated and massive scale profes-sional profile dataset spanning career records from hundreds of in-dustries, millions of companies and hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Using this professional profile dataset, this paper at-tempts to model profiles of individuals as a sequence of positions held by them as a time-series of nodes, each of which represents one particular position or job experience in the individual X  X  career trajectory. These career trajectory models can be employed in vari-ous utility applications including career trajectory planning for stu-dents in schools &amp; universities using knowledge inferred from real world career outcomes. They can also be employed for decoding sequences to uncover paths leading to certain professional mile-stones from a user X  X  current professional status.

We deploy the proposed technique to ascertain professional sim-ilarity between two individuals by developing a similarity mea-sure SimCareers (Similar Career Paths). The measure employs se-quence alignment between two career trajectories to quantify pro-fessional similarity between career paths. To the best of our knowl-edge, SimCareers is the first framework to model professional sim-ilarity between two people taking account their career trajectory information. We posit, that using the temporal and structural fea-tures of a career trajectory for modeling profile similarity is a far more superior approach than using similarity measures on semi-structured attribute representation of a profile for this application. We validate our hypothesis by extensive quantitative evaluations on a gold dataset of similar profiles generated from recruiting ac-tivity logs from actual recruiters using LinkedIn. In addition, we show significant improvements in engagement by running an A/B test on a real-world application called Similar Profiles on LinkedIn, world X  X  largest online professional network. This work was done when Ye Xu interned in LinkedIn.
 H.2.8 [ Database Applications ]: Data Mining Social Networks, Similarity, User Profiles, Career Paths
Online professional networks are coming of age and are becom-ing an important tool for maintaining one X  X  professional profile of record and discovering new career opportunities. LinkedIn main-tains the professional profile for over 238 million members. With such a large number of profiles, quality profile discovery at scale becomes a challenging problem.
 Recruiting is a massive use case exercised by premium users of LinkedIn. Similar Profiles Recommender System helps recruiters and hiring managers discover other similar quality talent by piv-oting of a model user profile. It models each member profile, as illustrated in Fig.2, by extracting a labeled bags of canonicalized keywords from profile fields such as summary, skills, companies worked at, schools attended, job titles etc. Given the bags of key-words representation for user profiles, Similar Profiles measures the similarity between pairs of LinkedIn members by matching keywords across field pairings, and then comes up with a normal-ized similarity score. While relatively powerful, this approach does not leverage a critical aspect, which is fundamental to assessing professional similarity -the temporal information encoded in se-ries of positions held by the individuals through their careers.
Let us take Fig.1 as a motivating example 1 to highlight the im-portance of using Career Trajectory information for finding similar people. Here, we present the top several members who are most similar to a particular user as returned by Similar Profiles . When we peruse through the returned list, we find that both Member 1 (ranked 1 st ) and Member 7 (ranked 7 th ) are similar to the model profile in terms of overall semantic keyword similarity. However, if we examine the appeared time of matched keywords in both pro-files, we observe that the matched keywords (e.g.,  X  X ata analysis X ) between model profile and Member 7 (ranked 7 th ) both appear in their most recent position, while the matched keywords (e.g.,  X  X ata Mining X ) between model profile and Member 1 (ranked 1 st ) appear in past positions. From a recruiting standpoint, it is opined that re-cent experience is more applicable to profile similarity in addition to length of the experience with particular skillsets. Hence, it is intuitive to seek that the model profile is more similar to Mem-ber 7 (ranked 7 th ) than Member 1 (ranked 1 st ) in terms of career trajectory. Since the current Similar Profiles Recommender System
For the purpose of privacy protection, we anonymize the name and profile pictures of returned results. similar in terms of career trajectory. ignores temporal information, we miss this subtle yet important sig-nal.
 To address this problem, we propose the SimCareers (Similar Career Paths) framework, a new approach to modeling LinkedIn member profiles by leveraging the concept of career trajectory. The SimCareers treats every individual member profile as a sequence of nodes, each of which records all information of the position, such as company, title, industry, time duration, and keyword summary. Then, based on the profile modeling method, the similarity between two member profiles is calculated by aligning the two sequences of nodes. At the node level, similarity is ascertained by using a gen-eralized linear model but other approaches could be easily substi-tuted.

The aforementioned approach is an effective way to model pro-fessional profiles, under which a comprehensive view of member X  X  professional information is exhibited in a time-series manner. Its most immediate application is to help improve Similar Profiles Rec-ommender System . This framework can be extended to help profes-sionals do career planning. For example, by comparing career paths between young professionals and the early stage profiles from those of more successful senior individuals, we can give people a look-ahead of possible future career trajectories based on where they currently are. This can help them decide which school to choose, area of specialization to pursue and skills to acquire in order to achieve the desired outcome.
 In summary, the key contributions of this paper are as follow: (1) To the best of our knowledge, SimCareers is the first framework that models professional profiles as time-series of career positions for any online professional network or resume databank. (2) We propose a similarity measure as a sequence alignment exercised over professional user profiles to ascertain professional similarity between two professionals from a recruiting standpoint. (3) We reveal and validate the important insight that career trajectory in-formation is of paramount importance in modeling similarity over professional profiles. The validation is facilitated by running real-world Similar Profiles application experiments on the world X  X  largest professional network -LinkedIn.
Similar Profiles Recommender System is used in LinkedIn for profile modeling and quality candidate discovery. In addition to serving as an independent product, it also powers People You May Want to Hire which is a personalized candidate discovery engine for recruiters that takes into account all of the context with regards to recruiting activity [21].

Formally speaking, the Similar Profiles Recommender Problem can be defined as follows: Given all LinkedIn members u  X  X  , where each member u is asso-ciated with a member profile f u , and a source member s , the Simi-lar Profiles Recommender System outputs a list of k target members t ,t 2 ,...,t k who have top-k highest similarity scores to the source member, and the list of members is ranked by the similarity value in a descending order.
 Similar Profiles algorithm works as follows: (An illustration is given in Fig. 2.) It models member profiles by extracting keywords from each field in member X  X  LinkedIn profile. A few example fields are summary, skills, current position summary, past position sum-mary, companies worked at, schools attended, etc. These fields are placed on the member X  X  profile on LinkedIn where members have manually entered free form text. The extracted keywords form lists of bags of keywords. We use cosine-similarity to find similar-ity scores for field-pairs corresponding to the two member profiles in consideration. An overall similarity score is calculated using a weighted linear combination of these scores to get the final Similar Profiles similarity measure between the two members. This mea-sure is symmetric and is normalized using a logit function, so that it can be interpreted as a probability of being similar. Here, weights reflect the relative importance of field pairs that are matched. These weights are learned by fitting a logistic regression model on train-ing data obtained from active recruiter usage of Similar Profiles product.
 Figure 2: The procedure of Similar Profiles . First, keywords are extracted for every field from LinkedIn profile page for each member. Then, given two bags of keywords, we match key-words at the field level. Finally, we come up with a similarity score.
In what follows, we give the description of Similar Career Paths framework, which models LinkedIn member profiles as career se-quences. We use sequence alignment to measure overall profile similarity. For every node in the sequence, we use keyword based matching to evaluate node-level similarity.
For each LinkedIn member, we maintain a profile webpage 2 records his/her professional information, e.g., title, company, se-niority, overall summary, experience, skills and expertise, educa-tion, courses, languages, additional personal information, connec-tions, groups etc. An example is shown in Fig.3. Given the profile http://www.linkedin.com/profile/ Figure 3: An example of LinkedIn member profile page: it con-tains professional information of the member such as job tittle, seniority, company, location, education, summary, experience etc. All these information will be extracted to learn the similar-ity metric between two members. pages from two LinkedIn members, we aim to measure the similar-ity between them. In other words, all the information with regards to member profile can be used to calculate the similarity score be-tween them.
In what follows, we describe how we model LinkedIn member profiles. Like many other online social networks [7, 11, 4], Similar Profiles , models member profiles purely by keywords matching. It ignores the temporal order of keywords and thus fails to capture the career trajectory information, which is extremely important in a professional network.
 To solve this problem, we introduce the concept of timeline. In SimCareers , each member profile is treated as a time sequence of nodes. In this modeling scheme, firstly, we provide a clear view for each member X  X  career trajectory. Secondly, we explain how we di-vide the whole bag of keywords in the original Similar Profiles into finer granularity. Finally, we also describe how the temporal factor is taken into account in the similarity computation. Intuitively, the matched keywords at the closest timestamp implies that the pro-files are more similar with respect to more recent work experience. Hence, it should lead to higher overall similarity. More concretely, we employ the following schemes to model the node corresponding to a job position.

Sequence of Positions: In this scheme, each node represents one particular position of the member X  X  professional experience, e.g., position summary, company, title, seniority, industry, job function, and time durations of the position. An example is given in Fig.4. Sequence of Compositions: In this scheme, we still model each LinkedIn member X  X  profile using a sequence of node. For each node, in addition to using position information mentioned before, we also incorporate transition information associated with the given Figure 4: Sequence of positions modeling method: each node in the sequence contains information about the position, such as position summary, company, title, seniority, and time dura-tions. Figure 5: Sequence of compositions modeling method: each node in the sequence is the composition of position information and transition related information. Incorporating transition in-formation enhances the representation of each node. Note that the first composition node is associated with the earliest posi-tion. It has no previous positions, thus this node does not have any transition related features. position and the previous one. In other words, the position informa-tion, along with transition related information, together composes a node. Transition information, (i.e., whether title changes in this transition, whether company changes, how the seniority changes, and the time of years used in this transition) enhances the represen-tation of the Sequence of Compositions modeling scheme by further disclosing information of the changing trend between previous and the given position. An example is given in Fig. 5.
In this work, we design a similarity metric based on the se-quence of nodes modeling scheme. Generally speaking, given two sequences of nodes (profiles), we conduct sequence alignment to calculate the similarity between them. Sequence alignment [22] originated in bioinformatics domain. It can identify the similarity between two sequences of DNA, RNA or protein by finding an op-timal way to arrange the node-level alignment from two sequences respectively. In our profile similarity learning scenario, we need to match and align career nodes from two career sequences (i.e., mem-ber profiles) according to the similarity between them. Thus, this is naturally associated with the classic sequence alignment prob-lem. When it comes to the specific alignment between each pair of node, we propose a node-level similarity metric. We discuss the node-level Similarity metric in more detail in Section 3.3.2.
We aim to evaluate the similarity between two career paths  X  two sequences of nodes. Each node here is a representation of one par-ticular work experience. For overall similarity score, we want all the work experience in the career sequence to contribute. In order to compute overall similarity between two career sequences, we decompose the score into the sum of the similarity between several pairs of aligned nodes from each of the two sequences respectively [8]. We now need a scheme to find an optimal alignment between pairs of nodes from the two career paths. This naturally relates to the classic sequence alignment problem.

In sequence alignment algorithm [16], the sequence level sim-ilarity is measured by calculating the sum of the optimal align-ment of node pairs. We conduct the sequence alignment in a lo-cal manner [8]. The two sequences are aligned incrementally. The sequence alignment scheme can be formulated as a dynamic pro-gramming procedure. Suppose, we have two career sequences P [ X 1 , X 2 ,, X m ] and P 2 = [ Y 1 , Y 2 ,, Y n ] . ( X i and Y tion/composition nodes from two career sequences respectively.) Let us further imagine that we have come to the step of aligning subsequences P 1 [1 : i  X  1] and subsequence P 2 [1 : j  X  1] . (In other words, shorter subsequences have been aligned previously.) The subsequences P 1 [1 : i ] and P 2 [1 : j ] can be aligned in three ways according to the following cases: It is worth noting that the position-level similarity function that we employ is symmetric. Hence, S node ( X_i, Y_j) is the same as S node (Y_j, X_i) . More formally, given the above two career se-quences P 1 and P 2 , the similarity between two career sequences can be solved using the following scheme: max Therein, S seq is the similarity function at the career sequence level, S node is the similarity function at the position/composition node level, and  X  is the gap penalty parameter. We will discuss S and  X  in later sections.
The SimCareers framework aligns two career sequences by in-crementally aligning two position/composition nodes or skipping the node in either of the two sequences. In order to compute S we need to first define S node . We propose to learn a similarity model at the node level by using Logistic Regression model [3]. In what follows, we will discuss the node-level similarity model in detail.
Data and Labels. We first extract position/composition node data features from LinkedIn member profile. We gather training data from active recruiter usage of the Similar Profiles Recom-mender System . Recruiters use this recommender system to dis-cover more profiles similar to the query 3 . Similar Profiles Recom-mender System that is powered by SimProfiles algorithm, as dis-cussed in Section 2, can guarantee the returned candidate profiles are similar to the query profile. Once recruiters find desired can-didates, the most common way for them to reach out to candidates is via InMail . InMail is a paid product provided by LinkedIn that allows recruiters to reach out to members outside their existing net-work. In the absence of ground truth data for position similarity, we employ the following heuristic to gather quality training data for position similarity model.
 We only consider profile-pairs that were discovered via Similar Profiles Recommender System and then contacted by recruiters. In other words, we only look at inMails sent as a result of Similar Pro-files Recommender search. We regard the current position of such profile pairs, the original profile looked at and the subsequent one contacted, as similar. The assumption used here in collecting data is that if a recruiter contacts this newly discovered profile imme-diately after discovering the original one then presumably at-least the current position of these profiles is similar. Empirically speak-ing, most recruiters in LinkedIn behaves in this manner. With this scheme, we sample about 300 , 000 candidate profile pairs with a non-empty current position from data collected over all LinkedIn Recruiter accounts within 3 months (from March 2013 to May 2013). Note that the intuition of introducing recruiter contact here is that current Similar Profiles Recommender System is not per-fectly accurate and could return some dissimilar pairs. Thus by examining recruiter contact, we can refine the quality and purity of data.Such scheme, along with the amount of data processed, can guarantee the quality of the collected data.

As a further refinement for model training, we only consider those profile-pairs as positives where more than 3 recruiters con-tact the profiles discovered via Similar Profiles Recommender Sys-
Here, the query member profile is often the ideal candidate they have found or already hired. tem . The intuition is that if enough recruiters contact the newly discovered profile then this profile pair is more likely to be simi-lar. Amongst the rest of the recommended profiles, all the ones that were ranked higher but were not reached out to be any recruiter are regarded as negative profile-pairs for the purpose of model train-ing for node-level similarity. After employing this additional con-straint, we get about 80 , 000 profile-pairs as positive labels for posi-tion similarity model training and 220 , 000 negative labels. During the model training, we use all 80 , 000 positive position pairs and randomly sample 80 , 000 negative position pairs from the 220 , 000 candidate negative labels.

Features. Based on the discussion in Section 3.2, we have two schemes to model member profiles in Similar Career : (1) sequence of positions; and (2) sequence of compositions. For each of the two methods, we consider different feature sets to train the correspond-ing node level similarity model.

For the sequence of positions modeling scheme, we extract the following features from each pair of positions:
It deserves mentioning that we normalize each feature value and make them between 0 and 1 .

For the sequence of composition nodes modeling scheme, we treat the node as a composition of position and its associated transi-tion. Therefore, in addition to the above mentioned position related features, we also consider a few transition related features, namely, features from the transition associated with the position and its im-mediately previous position. The following additional features are extracted for each pair of composition nodes:
Similar to position node features, we also normalize the feature values.

Model: A variety of classification methods can be used to train the similarity model given the data and labels. Note that, we aim to propose a general framework to train the node level similarity model, and our setup is not limited in any way to any particular training algorithm. Without loss of generality, in this work, we em-ploy Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm [3] for model training. In logistic regression model, the logit of the probability of relevance of the outcome is modeled as a linear function of feature values. The model is trained via maximum likelihood estimation. Due to its ef-fectiveness, logistic regression is widely used in many application domains such as recommender systems [2, 15] and advertisement prediction [19, 5]. Logistic regression predicts the outcome of a value between 0 and 1 according to the feature values. In our sce-nario, the similarity value is bounded between 0 and 1 . Therefore, logistic regression is ideally suitable to train the node level simi-larity model. Furthermore, since existing keyword based Similar Profiles also employs logistic regression so this mechanism pro-vides an easy way to combine these 2 scores. We discuss a need to do so in section 3 . 5 .
In this section, we discuss the parameters used in the SimCareer framework.
In the process of aligning career sequences, the dissimilar po-sition/composition nodes are allowed to be skipped. However, for the purpose of career path completeness, contiguous alignments are more desirable. Therefore, to encourage contiguity in career se-quence alignment, we introduce the idea of gap penalty, as shown in Eq.1. The sequence alignment is computed in an incremental manner. As we encounter node pair X i and Y j , if the node level similarity between X i and Y j is high enough as determined by the Dynamic Programming algorithm shown in Eq.1, we continue to align them. However, if X i is dissimilar to node Y j in sequence P , we allow the possibility of skipping the alignment of the node with a penalty called Gap Penalty because it impairs the contiguity in sequence alignment.

In this setting, value of the gap penalty parameter  X  needs to be determined. If the value of  X  is too small, many nodes can be skipped during alignment and the contiguity will be impaired. On the other hand, if it is too large, no skip could happen during align-ment. As disclosed in [22], in absence of any prior knowledge, grid search is a reasonable way to determine the Gap Penalty parameter  X  . We apply 10  X  fold cross validation to determine the optimal gap penalty value. It deserves mentioning that the node level similarity score in our framework is bounded between 0 and 1 . Therefore, it is relatively convenient to guess candidate values for  X  since it should have the same order of magnitude. In section 4 . 1 . 3 , we will show that the performance of the proposed SimCareers is not sensitive to the  X  value.
SimCareers aims to detect the similarity between two career paths under the scenario of professional social networks. In discovering professional candidates, more recent experiences are more highly valued than old experiences. Furthermore, longer period of job ex-periences are more convincing than shorter ones. Therefore, the duration and the recency of positions are worth considering when we calculate the similarity between career sequences.

As discussed in section 3.3.2, we try to incorporate duration information as a feature when training the node level similarity model. However, note that the training data used to calculate po-sition similarity is for latest positions only. This implies that all these job experiences are ongoing, and we cannot reliably predict when these current job positions will terminate for each member. Therefore, with our scheme of gathering training data it is inaccu-rate to apply the duration of current positions as a feature to train the node level similarity model. By the same argument, the recency for current positions are always 0 (i.e., 0 years from today) in our training data. Due to lack of an automated way to generate large amounts of training data, we propose to incorporate these signals as boosts to the node-level similarity for both sequence of positions and sequence of compositions method.

As mentioned above, we incentivize alignment on more recent positions and longer duration nodes. More specifically, while com-puting similarity between two career sequences, we impose differ-ent weights on aligned position/composition nodes according to the recency and duration of the aligned node pair. Thus, the modified sequence alignment can be formulated as follows: max Therein, w ( i,j ) is the weight for aligned node pair X i tuitively, longer duration and more recent nodes should have larger weight so that they can impose stronger influence on the final se-quence level similarity score. Additionally, if the difference be-tween two nodes in terms of recency and duration is smaller, we assume that the two nodes are more similar. Thus, in our scheme this weight incorporates four terms: (i) The duration difference be-tween two nodes; (ii)The recency difference between two nodes; (iii) The duration sum of two nodes; (iv) The recency sum of two nodes.

In this work, we apply the Half-life in exponential decay [13] as the weight. Half-life exponential decay is widely used to de-scribe a quantity undergoing exponential decay with the following formulation: Therein,  X  is the mean lifetime parameter. Using Eq.2, the weight w ( i,j ) in sequence alignment formulation can be written as follow: Therein, d i is the duration of node X i and r i is the recency of node X i . Note that we encourage small difference of duration and recency, small value of recency but large value of duration. The mean lifetime parameters  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X  3 and  X  4 are determined by using 10  X  fold cross validation.

By assigning higher weights to recent or longer duration posi-tions, their importance in discovering the similarity between pro-fessional sequences are highlighted.
Various LinkedIn members have different lengths for their career sequences. A very small fraction of LinkedIn members have a large sequence length due to their long career. Note that when recruiters are discovering profiles for hiring, member X  X  more recent positions are given more importance. With this in mind, we limit the number of past positions that we consider for overall profile similarity in the SimCareers framework. In other words, if a member has more than L position/composition nodes in his/her career sequence, we only consider the latest L nodes for analysis.

Choosing a proper L value is important. If it is too small, im-portant position nodes are missed. On the other hand, a large L value makes SimCareers consider unimportant position nodes, and also may lead to inaccurate results. Instead of using cross valida-tion, we analyze the sequence length distribution over all LinkedIn members and pick the value for L . A significant proportion of our members have at-most 9 positions, so we choose L = 9 .
In our final scoring, we incorporate the existing Similar Profiles score into the proposed SimCareers framework. In what follows, we explain the motivation of considering this keyword based score.
On our member X  X  LinkedIn profiles, it is common for members to have comprehensive and detailed descriptions in their overall sum-mary field. However, when it comes to the position-level summary section there is huge variability in the amount of content our mem-bers provide, from hundreds of keywords to nothing at all. Fur-thermore, overall summary provides important information about member X  X  skills and speciality as it stands today. In Similar Profiles Recommender System , this is one of the most important features. Hence, incorporating keyword based similarity score is desirable.
After generating member similarity score using two separate sig-nals, i.e., the approach discussed above and the Similar Profiles score, the next step is to create a unified scheme that incorporates the two signals.

Ensemble learning [25] that uses multiple models to obtain bet-ter predictive performance naturally fits our scenario. Because of its powerful generalization ability, ensemble learning has been used in many applications [17]. Based on how to combine the results from each weak classifier, ensemble methods can be divided into a few categories: bagging, boosting, stacking, and cascading [25]. In this paper, we apply Bagging scheme to incorporate Similar Pro-files score into the proposed SimCareers due to its simplity and efficiency. Specifically speaking, we apply the weighted combi-nation of SimilarProfiles score and sequence alignment score us-ing the method discussed in section 3.3. Note that Similar Profiles score is normalized between 0 and 1 . However, the sequence align-ment score is not because most people have career sequences of with more than 1 position. Thus, we normalize the sequence align-ment score by dividing by the total number of sequence length of source person. Fig.6 shows the probability density function (PDF) of normalized sequence alignment score and Similar Profiles score over LinkedIn member dataset from March 2013 to May 2013 (i.e., the current position data we use for training node level similarity model). It implies that after normalization, sequence alignment score have similar distribution to Similar Profiles score, and thus validates that applying this ensemble approach in SimCareers is reasonable. Figure 6: The Probability Density Function (PDF) of sequence alignment score and Similar Profiles score over LinkedIn member dataset within three months. Note that LinkedIn Member data is from Similar Profiles Recommender System .
 Figure 7: The NDCG scores of each method: the two SimCa-reers framework achieves much better NDCG scores than Sim-ilar Profiles . In what follows, we discuss the evaluations for the proposed SimCareers framework. In the first evaluation approach, we ap-ply an offline measure of Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [10]. This measure is widely used to gauge the effective-ness of web search engines or recommender systems. Then, we also test the effectiveness of SimCareers by performing online AB tests and measuring the impact on our business metrics.
The offline evaluation scheme offers a reasonable and easily re-peatable mechanism for verifying performance and tuning model parameters. As a classic metric for search engine and recommender system, NDCG is used to measure the accuracy of the proposed SimCareer framework.
Dataset: We get the testing data from Similar Profiles Recom-mender System on LinkedIn. As discussed in section 3, once a recruiter account uses this recommender system to discover candi-dates based on a source profile, the source profile and the returned 100 recommended candidates are recorded. Note that here we only look at the candidates returned from Similar Profiles Recommender System . The results are shown to recruiters in descending order of Similar Profiles score. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we use SimCareers to evaluate the similarity between each of the 100 pairs (i.e., source profile and each of the 100 returned results) and obtain a reranked list. Note that when cal-culating NDCG metric, the ground truth order of the 100 profiles is needed. Here, we employ InMail sending and receiving to infer this ground truth.

Similar to the scheme discussed in section 3, if after seeing Sim-ilar Profiles results for a source profile the recruiter contacts one or more of these recommended results, then we regard the source profile and the profiles that were contacted as Similar . As a fur-ther refinement, we only consider those cases as positives where at least 3 recruiters contacted the recommended profile. Meanwhile, within the top 100 results, the recommended profiles which were ranked higher, were seen by the recruiter and were not contacted are regarded as Not Similar for the purpose of collecting labeled dataset. All other recommended profiles are ignored from the la-beled dataset.

In this experiment, we use data collected over all LinkedIn Re-cruiter accounts within one month (June 2013) for testing. We de-note the base Similar Profiles score by sp and sequence alignment scores derived by SimCareers by sc . As discussed in section 3.5.2, we do a linear combination of sp and sc score via parameter  X  i.e. unified relevance score = sp +  X  * sc . We report offline numbers for  X  = 1 . 0 .

Metric: We use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [10], a classic metric used for evaluating search and recommender systems. The NDCG score is calculated using the following for-mulation: Here, Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) is defined as follows, Therein, rel ( i ) is the relevance score of position i . In our scenario, if the i th returned profile is similar in terms of inMail validation, rel ( i ) = 1 . Otherwise, rel ( i ) = 0 . IDCG in Eq.4 is calculated using the same equation as DCG based on the ground truth ranking list.

Similar Profiles Recommender System is used by recruiters for discovering quality candidates given a source profile. Intuitively, doing well on the top results is better than doing well on the bot-tom results. Thus, the quality of top returned results is more impor-tant. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SimCareers we compute Figure 8: The NDCG scores of SimCareers-Comp under differ-ent  X  values: (Other parameters are fixed here.) The results demonstrate that the proposed SimCareers framework is not sensitive to gap penalty parameter  X  . Figure 9: The NDCG scores of SimCareers-Comp under differ-ent  X  values: each time we vary one parameter while fixing the rest.
 NDCG top 5 , NDCG top 10 , and NDCG top 25 . (i.e., let N = 5 , 10 , and 25 respectively in Eq.5.) in addition to overall NDCG (i.e., let N = 100 in Eq.5).

Baseline: We use the ranking results from Similar Profiles as the baseline to evaluate SimCareers . Moreover, we compute the NDCG score using purely the sequence alignment method ( Seq-Alignment ), i.e., without resorting to the ensemble approach men-tioned in Section 3.5.2. To validate the importance of using transi-tion related information when modeling career sequence similarity, we calculate the NDCG score for sequence of positions modeling method ( SimCareers-Pos ) and sequence of compositions modeling method ( SimCareers-Comp ) respectively.
Fig.7 shows the results of NDCG top 5 , NDCG top 10 , NDCG top 25 , and overall NDCG score for SimCareers-Pos , SimCareers-Comp , Seq-Alignment and Similar Profiles . These numbers vali-date our intuition that capturing temporal information of career tra-jectory is crucial in computing profile similarity for hiring. More specifically, pairwise t-tests at 95% significance level indicate that the SimCareers framework is significantly better than Similar Pro-files under all the four NDCG scores. Meanwhile, the two SimCa-reers framework achieves high NDCG scores than Seq-Alignment , demonstrating the effectiveness of the ensemble approach. By com-paring the curves of Seq-Alignment and two SimCareers methods, we can reach the conclusion that incorporating keyword based sim-ilarity score is effective and desirable. It deserves mentioning that compared with overall NDCG, the difference between SimCareers and Similar Profiles under NDCG top 5 and NDCG top 10 is larger. It means in the more realistic setting where top recommended pro-files will end up getting contacted more often, the proposed SimCa-reers will perform even better. Note that under all the four metrics, SimCareers-Comp obtains higher NDCG scores than SimCareers-Pos . Incorporating transition related information into the position node provides a more comprehensive description and captures the dynamic changes of the work experience nodes, thus leading to higher quality Similar Profiles .
To further demonstrate that SimCareers is not sensitive to the parameters we define in the model, i.e., the gap penalty  X  and mean lifetime parameter  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X  3 , and  X  4 , we report the overall NDCG score of SimCareers-Comp under different parameter set-tings. Each time we vary one parameter, and fix the rest. The NDCG scores under different  X  values are shown in Fig.8, and the results under different mean lifetime parameter values are shown in Fig.9. The two figures indicate that the SimCareers framework is not sensitive to these parameters. It is worth noting that the dataset used for parameter estimation is a mutually disjoint dataset from the training dataset. This dataset spans March 2013 to May 2013 and serves as a validation dataset to tune these additional parame-ters. The difference in dataset accounts for the difference in abso-lute value of overall NDCG in Fig. 7.
We performed online AB tests[12] for a few variants of SimCa-reers model on independent segments of LinkedIn member popula-tions. When combined with offline NDCG score for the similarity model, A/B Test provides for a deeper understanding of user be-havior. We focus on the following metric for the online evaluation:
Since combining Similar Profiles score and sequence alignment score significantly increases the performance for NDCG metric, we perform four A/B Tests using different parameter configurations when combining the two scores (i.e., the parameter deciding the proportion between Similar Profiles score and sequence alignment score used in the bagging scheme). We ran the AB test for one month. Results of Profile Views and InMails are summarized in Ta-ble 1. We denote the base Similar Profiles score by sp and sequence alignment scores derived by SimCareers by sc . As discussed in section 3.5.2, we do a linear combination of sp and sc score via parameter  X  i.e. unified relevance score = sp +  X  * sc . Table 1: The results of A/B Tests under different parameter configurations: the number in the table indicates the percent-age increase (+) or decrease (-) in metrics using SimCareers compared with the baseline  X  Similar Profiles .
Table.1 demonstrates the impact of A/B test results on our busi-ness metrics namely, Profile Views and InMails . These results fur-ther validate our hypothesis that capturing temporal information of career trajectory is crucial in computing profile similarity for hiring. More specifically, the  X  value indicates the weight of the SimCareers score in the final unified relevance score. The results indicate that when the  X  value is small, the difference between Sim-Careers score and SimProfiles score is negligible. It is because sp score dominates the SimCareers results with a small  X  value. How-ever, as we give more weight to the SimCareers score, we get a larger increase in both Profile Views and InMails sent. It is because that sequence alignment methodology captures the career trajectory information and thus can better measure the similarity between two profiles.
In this paper, we design a framework to model the similarity over a professional network. Although there are many studies on model-ing similarity on social networks, none of them have taken temporal information into account in their models.

Similarity modeling over social networks is a hot topic, espe-cially for online social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. A few traditional metric can be used to model similar-ity based on the network structure information, such as common neighbor (CN) [14] and Adamic-Adar (AA) [1]. Note that these methods are only based on network structure. Recently, a few al-gorithms have been proposed to model similarity using user profile information on social networks. The most relevant one along this line was done by Centinatas et al. [4]. This work aimed to model similarity for professional networks by extracting keywords from member profiles, and then treating keywords as features to train a discriminative model. This work, as well, only considers keyword based similarity. There are also a few similarity modeling meth-ods [7, 11] that are proposed for other online social networks. All these profile based algorithms only use keywords extracted from user profiles and fail to consider temporal information of keywords.
Our paper also relates to sequence and time series data similarity [16, 6]. During past few years, due to its effectiveness, time se-ries data similarity modeling have been widely applied in a many application domains. For instance, sequence alignment is used for detecting similarity between DNA, RNA or protein sequences [16]. In speech recognition, a few algorithms such as Dynamic Time Warping [20], have been proposed to measure similarity between audio sequences. Reyes et al. [18] applied time series data similar-ity in gesture recognition and achieved nice accuracy. He [9] used sequence alignment to learn features for natural language process-ing. Yamano et al. [24] employed sequence alignment algorithm to analyze financial data. Although time series similarity is well-established problem in various fields, in this paper it is the first trial to apply sequence alignment to a field where each sequence is used to model the professional career in professional social networks. Moreover, different from many state-of-the-art methods, not only first-order features (i.e., position features) but also second-order features (i.e., transition features) are extracted from nodes of each sequence when training the node level similarity.
In this paper, we propose an approach SimCareers , to model member similarity over professional networks. In SimCareers , the member profile is modeled as a sequence of work experiences, while the career sequence similarity is evaluated using sequence alignment. To the best of our knowledge, SimCareers is the first similarity learning framework over online social networks that con-siders the career trajectory information. We use both offline and on-line experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of SimCareers .
We believe SimCareers can be further refined in a variety of ways. Firstly, we intend to strengthen node-level similarity mea-sure by incorporating per position geo information. In our exist-ing profile dataset, we only have geo information with regards to member X  X  current position. In the baseline keyword-based Similar Profiles system, geo is one of the important signals so we believe having per-position geo information would greatly improve SimCa-reers . Secondly, while aligning sequences in addition to skipping and matching the nodes we intend to allow the possibility of merg-ing two similar nodes into one. A large number of career transi-tions are either lateral moves where the member changes company but does similar work at the same/similar role. Or they are promo-tions where the broad responsibility remains the same with a minor change in title. In both the scenarios, the core role &amp; responsibility of the individual remains roughly the same. The hypothesis is that such a merge will help make the similarity measure more robust w.r.t. differences in how people fill their LinkedIn profile. Last but not least, while we are using the features listed in Section 3.3.2 to model the career positions, techniques such as feature selection [23] or feature interaction could be employed to explore better so-lutions at the feature level.

Furthermore, we wish to leverage SimCareers to help profes-sionals do career planning. More concretely, by comparing career paths between young professionals and the early stage profiles from those of more successful senior individuals, we can give people a preview of possible career trajectories based on where they are cur-rently. Furthermore, we can help young professionals decide which schools to choose, area of specialization to pursue and skills to ac-quire based on their desired success criterion as reified by an exist-ing LinkedIn profile that these professionals wish to have as a role model.
