 Social media is producing massive amounts of data on an un-precedented scale. Here people share their experiences and opinions on various topics, including personal health issues, symptoms, treatments, side-effects, and so on. This makes publicly available social media data an invaluable resource for mining interesting and actionable healthcare insights. In this paper, we describe a novel real-time flu and can-cer surveillance system that uses spatial, temporal, and text mining on Twitter data. The real-time analysis results are reported visually in terms of US disease surveillance maps, distribution and timelines of disease types, symptoms, and treatments, in addition to overall disease activity timelines on our project website. Our surveillance system can be very useful not only for early prediction of seasonal disease out-breaks such as flu, but also for monitoring distribution of cancer patients with different cancer types and symptoms in each state and the popularity of treatments used. The resulting insights are expected to help facilitate faster re-sponse to and preparation for epidemics and also be very useful for both patients and doctors to make more informed decisions.

The Internet is usually the first place people turn for health information. People search for a specific disease, symptoms, and appropriate medical treatments, and often make decisions whether they should go see a doctor based different colors for easy comparison of US regional flu epidemic. built a novel real-time disease surveillance system that uses twitter data to track US influenza and cancer activities. Twitter [3] is a popular micro-blogging service where users can post short messages. Twitter X  X  popularity as a medium for real-time information dissemination has been constantly increasing since its launch in 2006. The proposed system continuously downloads flu and cancer related twitter data using Twitter streaming API [4] and applies spatial, tem-poral, and text models on this data to discover national flu and cancer activities and popularity of disease-related terms. The output of the three models is summarized as pie charts, time-series graphs, and US disease activity maps on our project website [1][2] in real time. This demonstra-tion is built upon and extends our previous work [10]. In this work, the text analysis on most frequently occurring terms is added. We further extended our real-time disease surveillance system to track cancer activities in addition to flu.
Figure 1 shows the architecture of our real-time flu and cancer surveillance system. Our dataset consists of all re-cent tweets that mention the keywords  X  X lu X  or  X  X ancer X . We have collected over 6 million flu-related tweets generated by more than 3.3 million unique users in past 5.5 months since or  X  X ancer X  and have a valid US state info (e.g.,  X  X vanston, IL X ,  X  X omewhere in NY X ) in their home location field. We exclude tweets generated from outside the US (i.e., tweets from foreign location) and those with invalid location infor-mation (e.g.,  X  X ravelling X ,  X  X herever the wind blows me X ). In our current flu dataset, there are 458,828 users with valid US state information, and in current cancer dataset, there are 193,797 users with valid US state information. The US Flu Activity Map is shown in Figure 2. The tweet volume mentioning  X  X lu X  generated in each state is normalized by the population of the state.
The goal of temporal analysis is to track the volume changes of tweets mentioning the disease and related terms over time.
As shown in Figure 2, Daily Flu Activity chart shows the tweet volume changes of flu-related tweets over three months period from January through March 2013. The data for flu/cancer timeline is created by counting the number of tweets mentioning  X  X lu X  or  X  X ancer X  generated daily. Our as-sumption is that people talk more about  X  X lu X  when they themselves or people around them (family or friends) have flu symptoms and there are more frequent news feeds when the epidemic is wide spread. Achrekar et al. [9] reported that the volume of flu-related tweets is highly correlated with the number of reported ILI cases by the CDC. In the flu timeline, the number of flu related tweets start increas-ing on January 6 and reaches its peak on January 12, which coincides with the date when The Huffington Post reported the death of four children from the outbreak of AH3N2 in-fluenza [7]. This shows how our temporal analysis effectively reflects the wide spread of the epidemics.
We not only track the overall flu and cancer activities, but also monitor disease types, symptoms, and treatments over time. Figure 3 shows daily tweet volume changes for various flu symptoms. From the timeline chart, we can easily tell cough, fatigue, weight loss, etc, and the keyword list for cancer treatments is a list of surgery, radiation, chemother-apy, Emend, Xeloda, etc. We also have similar keyword lists for  X  X lu X . For  X  X lu X , we have 9 flu types, 15 symptoms, and 31 treatments. For  X  X ancer X , we have 58 cancer types, 21 symptoms, and 63 treatments. Figure 4, 5, and 6 show the distribution of tweets mentioning a keyword in cancer types, symptoms, and treatments keyword lists.
We are interested in investigating which words frequently co-occur with a disease name. After tokenizing tweet texts and removing all stop words, we count the number of occur-rence of each unique word. Our current flu dataset (6,097,406 tweets) consists of 83,896,915 words and 4,001,445 unique words. Figure 7 shows the top 20 most frequent words in our entire flu dataset.
We built a real-time disease surveillance system that uses twitter data to automatically track flu and cancer activities. The experiments show that our disease detection system can map US regional influenza and cancer activity levels near real-time, discover and compare popularity of terms related to flu/cancer types, symptoms, and treatments.
