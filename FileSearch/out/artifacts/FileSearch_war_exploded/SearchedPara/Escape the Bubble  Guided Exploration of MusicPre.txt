 In order to predict user behaviour recommender systems generate views of the world according to expressed and known user preferences resulting in  X  X ilter bubbles X . This kind of bubbles generally help users to easily identify objects they like. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to escape their personalized world and change their perspec-tives especially in domains such as music. In this work we present a methodology and related system that allows users to initiate explorations of music genres by taking a gradual path towards the desired genre while viewing the prefer-ences of other users. The proposed methodology is based on identifying  X  X atent genres X  and using user preference graphs for detecting optimal paths towards a selected target latent genre. In this process we generate suggestions of artists a user should listen to, aiming towards serendipitous and novel encounters. We have implemented our approach in a music recommendation system and evaluated it with encouraging results.

Recommender systems provide a widely adopted solution to the problem of information overload by helping people to decide where to travel, what to watch, read or listen to by predicting their preferences. Current research in on-line rec-ommender systems focuses mainly on helping users finding emphasizes more on exploration rather than on the accuracy of th e recommended items.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-tion 2 presents the proposed methodology and Section 3 de-scribes our evaluation and related results. In Section 4 we review related work on music exploration. We conclude in Section 5 with final remarks and our plan for future research.
We aim at providing users a method that can assist them to explore music preferences of others. Figure 1 provides an overview of the proposed methodology. We rely on available content which is comprised of users, who listen and annotate artists using tags. Tags provide a user-defined classification of artists characterizing the genre of the artists X  music. As shown in Figure 1 we distinguish between two phases. The pre-processing phase involves the identification of  X  X a-tent music genres X  in the dataset by following a topic mod-elling approach. In real time exploration users select the target latent genre towards which they want to initiate an exploration. This is the intent or purpose of the user and it can be considered as a means to manually establish the con-text of the exploration. A  X  X estination user X  who is a best match for the selected target latent genre is identified and a search for a path towards that destination user is initiated in the user preferences graph. Using the selected path a pre-defined number of items -artists in our case -are selected per path node in order to form a sequence of suggestions that are finally presented to the user.
The first phase includes a pre-processing of users and items in order to identify latent genres in the available dataset. These genres will provide users a means to understand the preference bubbles which exist in the user-item space. To identify genres, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [3].

LDA has been proposed as an extension of pLSA that includes prior distributions on the generation of topics and words from a collection of documents. Topic mixture weights are not individually calculated for each document, but are treated as a k-parameter hidden random variable, where k is the number of topics. LDA is a generative method, based on the assumption that a such a model can sufficiently de-scribe a document corpus and can be discovered. The model uses latent topic variables and probabilistic sampling tech-niques to generate the documents: documents are produced by sampling topics from a distribution of topics over doc-uments and sampling words from a distribution of words over each topic. To fully describe the model these distribu-tions need to be identified. To this end, LDA is trained and distributions converge before the model can be used in ap-plications. In our approach users represent the documents of the LDA model and the tags of the artists listened by users represent the words.
In order to solve the artist recommendation and music discovery problem, we follow a graph search approach. We consider the user to user similarity matrix S u as a graph G = ( V, E, W ) where: each vertex v i represents a user u i ; each edge e i j represents a connection between two different users u i , u j ; the weight w i j = sim ( u i , u j ) of an edge is than 4 distinct tags. After applying the aforementioned fil-ters the dataset resulted to 1790 users, 9880 artists, 2305 tags and 167270 tag assignments by users to artists.
For the purpose of evaluating our approach we imple-mented a web application which allows the exploration of latent music genres in the Last.fm dataset. The web applica-tion uses the LDA model which is trained at a pre-processing phase using all the available information of the dataset. We set the number of topics to 30. This number was selected af-ter several rounds of training with varying LDA parameters and was found to produce topics that make sense and at the same time generate a view of the information structure in the dataset.
 ten words of each topic -latent genre is provided. Note that in our case the words are the tags of the Last.fm dataset. Users can browse the latent genres and the associated tags, and define a  X  X ersona X  (i.e. their preferences or the prefer-ences of an imaginary user) by selecting one or more latent genre with the best match. Furthermore users may set a desired proportion of the latent genres associated with the persona (e.g. 60% of topic 1 and 40% of topic 5). Having this information we can match the specified persona to an actual user of the Last.fm dataset. This is the source user in our setting. The same screen offers an option to select target latent genres for exploration. In the second screen users view the assembled sequence of artists. Three artists per node in the identified path are selected.
The evaluation involved 25 participants. We explained the concept and the functionalities of our application to each participant and we asked them to explore the music space of the Last.fm dataset by performing at least 3 different queries. As a baseline we provided users with a second list of the most similar artists to target latent genre, i.e. the artists whose target topic probability was high.

Users were asked to listen to a demo song that accompa-nied each unknown artist they found. At this early stage evaluation we wanted to measure the perceived novelty and serendipitous encounters and overall satisfaction and enjoy-ment associated our approach compared to the baseline. We asked participants a set of questions, including:  X  X as the transition from the source genres to the target genre satisfy-ing? X   X  X id you find new artists you didn X  X  know compared to the baseline list? X  (for novelty);  X  X id you find artists you wouldn X  X  have found easily on your own and which you would like to listen to from now on? X  (for serendipity);  X  X id you find the exploration from a source latent genre to a tar-get latent genre more interesting compared to just listening to popular artists? X .  X  X ould you use a similar application in the future? X . Furthermore we asked to qualitatively assess the displayed latent genres and provide other comments.
The qualitative discussion revealed that the majority of latent genres provided by the trained LDA model presented a good overview of the dataset information space e.g. one of 1 Our a pplication is available at the following url: http:// zeus.epd.ece.ntua.gr/FilterBubbleWeb/topicBrowser. jsp of tracks with a case base reasoning process, by analysing info rmation from a repository of existing human compiled playlists. Hariri et al. [8] generate context aware playlists. Similarly to our approach LDA is employed to infer latent topics for songs. Existing human-compiled playlists are then mapped to sequences of topics and frequent sequential pat-terns are discovered among these topics. Subsequently, the context is determined from a sequence of songs in a user X  X  current interaction and it is used to re-rank the output of traditional recommendation algorithms according to the dis-covered topic sequential patterns. These approaches focus mainly on satisfying known user preferences and do not fo-cus on novelty or serendipity.

Levy and Bosteels [9] implement a recommender system that considers personal tastes while at the same time rec-ommending novel artists from the long-tail using item-based collaborative filtering based on collections of tags. Zhang et al. [13] try to inject serendipity, novelty and diversity in music recommendations by combining different algorithms. First they use a basic item based recommender that models artists features using LDA. Then they infer artists X  diversity with the use of a listener diversity metric. Last they identify users X  preference bubbles with the use of artist preference graphs. The different recommendation lists are interpolated to form the final recommendations. These approaches fo-cus on novel recommendations but lack the notion of guided exploration.

Flexer et al. [7] propose a method to produce a playlist given the first and the last songs as well as its length, pro-viding a smooth transition between songs. The approach is based on audio similarity and genre labelling and through the transition it allows users to discover new songs in a mu-sic collection. In [12] an affinity propagation clustering tech-nique is used in order to classify artists in music categories and then find a representative artist for each category. Sug-gested applications of this information include music men-torship, i.e. suggestions of novel music categories not known to the user and artists X  lists generation for exploration. Al-though these approaches support a guided transition to tar-get artists, they do not offer an overview of latent genres hidden in music preferences and do not assist users in for-mulating their exploration intent.
We presented an approach and related experimental ap-plication that allows users to escape their filter bubble and explore the preferences of others by leveraging recommen-dation technologies. Our aim is to offer a method that pro-vides a structured and meaningful exploration of the world and assist users in identifying novel content and serendipi-tous encounters. The use of such a method may not be part of the users X  everyday information seeking activities but it can support users in exploration activities when they feel saturated with existing systems that provide somewhat pre-dictable suggestions based on detailed profiles. Our evalua-tion was based on measuring the perceived novelty of results, serendipitous encounter and overall satisfaction associated our methodology. The preliminary results were encouraging and show that there is potential for improvements and fu-ture research. Starting from the method itself, we are going to experiment with alternative settings related to its build-ing blocks. First, a number of graph search algorithms have been proposed and each may provide a modified path leading
