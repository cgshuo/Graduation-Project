 We organize and present the 5 th version of the International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval and Reasoning (Web-KR 2014) as a continuous effort to discuss and provide possible theories and techniques to deal with the barriers for knowledge processing at Web scale. This workshop was held in conjunction with the 2014 ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2014) on November 3rd, 2014 in Shanghai, China. Compared to previous workshops under the same title, accepted papers of this workshop cover even wider topics in the field. The contributions focus on semantic knowledge ex traction, representation, knowledge clustering, inconsiste ncy checking, entity relatedness and linking, query suggestions, et c. Many new approaches are proposed to investigate these topi cs in the context of Web-scale resources. This summary introduces the major contributions of accepted papers in the Web-KR 2014 workshop. I.2.4 [ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ]: Knowledge Representation Formalisms and Methods; I.2.11 [ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence; H.3.3 [ INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Experimentation. Knowledge Representation, Know ledge Retrieval, Semantic Search, Web reasoning, Scalability. 
As a field of study, knowledge representation, retrieval and reasoning plays a key role since the beginning of Artificial Intelligence [1]. It raises many new challenges and opportunities when the Web becomes the largest knowledge source. In order to discuss current and future challenges and provide possible integration and utilization keeps a practically hot topic, and the effort in [8] presents a convertor from JSON to OWL. Recognizing that managing We b-scale knowledge resources remains an important and hard topic, the effort in [9] tries to utilize Wikipedia clusters to cluster and label Web documents. The effectiveness of this effort will continue to grow as Wikipedia clusters get better. In consistency checking is extremely necessary when the knowledge structure is built from various knowledge resources. One important pr oblem is to deal with loops in taxonomies. In [10], the author s propose to solve this problem by MAP inference and rules of Thumb. Several efforts were made from the application perspective. The effort in [11] investigates knowledge extraction techniques for organizing knowledge triples on natural disaster events obtained from Twitter. The effort in [12] can be considered as an application of entity recommendation considering both the relatedness factor and the time factor. The work in [13] investigates automatic learning of the mapping rules for user sentiment understanding based on Tw eets. Social search remains attractive in many Web related conferences and workshops, and [14] provides a framework for social search considering both the graph structure and the temporal information. continuous support on the Web-KR workshops over the five years. For the Web-KR 2014 workshop, the PC members are Christophe Gu X ret (The Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Netherlands), Haofen Wang (Eas t China University of Science and Technology, China), Guangyou Zhou (Huazhong Normal University, China), Ioan Toma (Uni versity of Innsbruck, Austria), Gong Cheng (Nanjing University, China), Jun Fang (Norwestern Polytechnical University, China), Edy Portmann (University of Bern, Switzerland), Wei Hu (Nan jing University, China), Zhichun Wang (Beijing Normal University, China), and Dongsheng Wang (Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). We would also like to thank the ACM CIKM 2014 conference organizers for providing an excellent venue, with researchers and practitioners from various backgrounds, ranging fro m Information Retrieval, Databases, and Machine Learning to Knowledge Management, to discuss research topics and efforts related to knowledge representation, retrieval and reasoning at Web scale.
