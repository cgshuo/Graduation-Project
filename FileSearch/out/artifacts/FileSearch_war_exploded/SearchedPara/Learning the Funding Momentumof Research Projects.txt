 Research grants are critical to the deve lopment of science and the economy. Every year billions of dollars are invested in diverse scientific research topics, yet there is far from sufficient funding to support all researchers and their projects. Funding of research projects is highly selective. For example, in the past roughly only 20% of submitted projects have been funded by NIH. As a result, to maximize their chances of being funded, researchers often feel pressured to submit grant projects on topics that have  X  X ncreasing momentum X   X  where  X  X omentum X  is defined as the rate of change of a certain measure such as popularity, impact or significance. It would be helpful if one could model this pressure quantitatively. 1.1 Basic Models of Topic Popularity In [6], indicators such as popularity, impact, and significance can serve as impor-tant measures of a research topic. Popularity can be measured by the number of publications relevant to the topic, reflecting the volume of attention devoted to it. Impact is usually defined in terms of the number of citations to publica-tions involving the topic, which intuitively measures influence. Significance can be defined as the number of citations per article or the number of highly-cited articles involving a topic, giving a measure of overall visibility.
In this work, we focus on using a momentum indicator to study successful funding awards over the past few decades from NIH on specific biomedical re-search topics. We want to identify how th e momentum of research topics changes over time, using it as an indicator of success in gaining awards. Can we model the momentum of a research topic, or of funding success? We believe the answer is yes: changes in topic momentum in awards have followed measurable trends.
Topic modeling is not new, and there has been considerable work in modeling the popularity of a topic in a way that reflects increasing momentum. Popu-larity of a topic is often measured using frequency of occurrence, and trends in frequency are used as measures of trends in popularity. However, this leads to relatively naive analysis, such as simple changes in trends involving increase, de-crease, etc. Another weakness of this analysis is that it focuses on the direction of changes, and not on more specific features of change. For example, it cannot answer questions like: How  X  X apidly X  is the popularity of a topic increasing?
We can answer questions like this by adapting more powerful trend models, such as models of  X  X ursts X  (intervals of elevated occurrence [10]). The popularity in burst periods usually increases  X  X apidly X  and therefore the occurrence of a burst indicates a significant change. More detailed discussion is given later. 1.2 Modeling Funding Momentum We are interested in applying trend models to study trends in research funding. For example the NIH collects extensive information on its funding awards in RePORTER [2], a database tracking biomedical topics for successful (funded) proposals since 1986; each award includes a set of topic keywords from a prede-fined set ( X  X erms X ). We can use this historical data to model trends in research interests over the past 25 years. Thus, in successful awards, we can study not only trends for single topics, but also trends for projects (sets of topics). In this paper, we first propose a definition of momentum for research topics. According to our definition, the momentum of a topic is a measure of its burst strength over time, computing derivatives of moving averages as a model of its momentum. To calculate momentum, we adapt technical analysis methods used for analyzing stocks. Our experimental results show that our method is able to model momentum for a research topic, by training classifiers on historical data. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop quantitative models for occurrence of research topics in successf ul grant awards. Other indicators such as impact and significance can be easily integrated into this model to evaluate different aspects of momentum.

With a model for the momentum of individual research topics, we study fund-ing momentum of research projects. As just mentioned, each project involves a set of research topics. We can therefore model the funding momentum of a research project in terms of the funding momentum of each research topic it contains. This gives what we believe is the first quantitative definition of fund-ing momentum of a research project.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we summarize previous work on analyzing grant databases, and explore the relevance of stock market momentum models to development of  X  X esearch topic portfolios X   X  such as identifying burst periods and momentum trends. In Section 3, we define a model of funding momentum for research topics and projects. We propose a framework to predict funding momentum in Section 4. We report experimental results and comparisons in Section 5, a nd conclude the paper in Section 6. There has been a great deal of work in the analysis of grant portfolios, such as in the MySciPI project [1] and the NIH RePORTER system [2]. However, these works have focused on development of databases to store information about awards. For example, MySciPI [1] provides a database of projects that can be queried by keywords or by research topics. When given a research topic, extensive information about all proj ects related to the topic ca n be extracted. However, beyond the extraction of project information, only basic statistics (such as the number of hits of the topic in the database, etc.) are shown. The ability to mine information in these databases has been lacking.

We try to analyze this information based on the indicators such as popular-ity, impact and significance. We can easily calculate these indicators over a time window for certain research topics. We are interested in the problem of identi-fication and prediction of periods in which the indicators have a strong upward momentum movement, or  X  X urst X . Lots of work have been done to identify bursts of a topic over certain time series. Kleinberg [14] and Leskovec et al. [11] use an automaton to model bursts, in which each state represents the arrival rate of occurrences of a topic. Shasha and co-workers [19] defined bursts based on hierarchies of fixed-length time windows. He and Parker [10] model bursts with a  X  X opic dynamics X  model, where bursts are intervals of positive change in mo-mentum. Then they apply trend analysis indicators such as EMA and MACD histogram, which are well-developed momentum computation methods used in evaluating stocks, to identify burst periods. They show that their topic dynamics model is successful in identifying bursts for individual topics, while Kleinberg X  X  model is more appropriate to identify bursts from a set of topics. He and Parker also point out that the topic dynamics model may permit adaptation of the multitude of technical analysis methods used in analyzing market trends.
Of course, an enormous amount of work has gone into prediction of stock prices and of market trends (such as upward or downward movement, turning points, etc.), and a multitude of models has been proposed. For example, Al-Qaheri et al. [5] recently developed roug h sets to develop rules for predicting stock prices. Classical methods involvin g neural networks (Lawrence [15], Gryc [8], Nikooa et al. [17], Sadd [18]) in forecasting stock prices. Hassan and Nath [9] applied Hidden Markov Models to for ecast prices. Genetic Algorithms have also been applied [13] [16]. Recently Agraw al et al. [4] developed adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to analyze stock momentum. Bao and Yang [7] build an intelligent stock trading system using confirmation of turning points and probabilistic reasoning. This paper shows how this wealth of mining experience might be adapted in analyzing grant funding histories. 3.1 Technical Analysis Indicators of Momentum Key symbols in the paper are summarized in Table 1. To define the momentum of research topics and projects, we adapt the stock market trend analysis indicators. Here we first include very well-established background about technical analysis indicators of momentum.  X  EMA  X  the exponential moving average of the momentum, or the  X  X irst  X  MACD  X  the difference between EMA  X  X  over two different time periods.  X  MACD Histogram  X  the difference between MACD and its moving average,  X  RSI  X  the relative strength of the upwards movement versus the downwards 3.2 Funding Momentum for Research Topics The degree to which a research topic has  X  X ncreasing momentum X  (funding-wise) can depend on many characteristics. As men tioned earlier, traditional measures of topic popularity rest on the topic X  X  frequency of occurrence in the literature. However, simple measures do not permit us to model things such as intervals in which popularity of the topic increases  X  X harply X .
 In this paper we characterize a topic X  X  funding success in terms of momentum . Specifically, we follow previous work of He and Parker [10], which measures momentum  X  using the well-known MACD histogram value from technical stock analysis  X  in order to define a  X  X urst X . The histogram value measures change in momentum, so they define the period over which it is positive as the burst period , and the value of the histogram indicates how strong the burst is. The stronger the burst, the greater its momentum.

For funding, one is often interested in selecting the best time to start in-vestment in a topic. If momentum plunges after we invest, we have entered the market at a bad time, and should perhaps have waited. We are also interested in the  X  X taying power X  of a topic, so that the frequency of a topic remains high even after bursts. Rapid drops in frequency after a burst can make a topic a poor investment (toward a funded portfolio of topics). Therefore, the funding momentum of a topic can depend on the pr esence of bursts, th eir strength, and the frequency afterwards. With this in mind we define the funding momentum FM of a topic for a period of m months as follows: The burst strength of a topic over a m -month period BS (topic, m) is the sum of the histogram values H for the topic in burst periods, or periods where the values are all positive. The frequency increase indicator FI (topic, m) indicates if the frequency of the topic increases or drops within the m -month period. We define the value of the funding momentum of a topic over a m -month period FM (topic, m) with an exponential model to normalize the value within the range of [0, 1] with  X  as a decay parameter. In this model, a higher burst strength or a higher momentum increase ratio yield higher funding momentum, with  X  controlling the rate of increase with respect to these factors.

The definition encodes the following intuition about funding momentum: (1) if there is no burst in the m -month period, then no matter how high the frequency or popularity, the m -month period has no funding momentum; (2) if there is a burst, but prior to the burst there is a drop in momentum, the m -month period has no funding momentum. (Hence, it may be advantageous to invest in the topic after the drop ends.) (3) if there is a burst, but after the burst there is a significant drop in popularity, the m -month period has no funding momentum. Instead, we may reduce the investment period to a smaller interval m .Wealsoset a threshold h (0  X  h  X  1) modeling whether a topic has increasing momentum or not given its funding momentum. If the momentum is greater than h ,wesay the topic has increasing momentum. As explained below, in our experiments, setting  X  as 10 and h as 0.2 and following the three selection criteria above has yielded results that are consistent with the RePORTER data.

This model formalizes three intuitive id eas: (1) research topics have bursts of popularity, and bursts can be defined in terms of momentum (as in [10]); (2) funded research proposals often explore novel potential correlations between popular research topics; (3) real data (like RePORTER) can be used to learn quantitative models of successful funding. The concept of funding momentum of a set of topics developed in this paper draws directly on these ideas. 3.3 Funding Momentum of Research Projects: Percentage Model Although we have explored other models, in this paper we consider only what we call the percentage model for funding momentum : a research project has increasing momentum if it contains sufficiently many topics that have in-creasing momentum for that period. Speci fically, we say a research project has increasing momentum when ever the percentage of thes e topics exceeds a thresh-old parameter t . In our experiments, this definition with t =0.2 has been adequate to accurately identify incr easing momentum intervals. As mentioned earlier, we have adapted methods of technical analysis to compute momentum. In the stock market, despite claims to the contrary, a common as-sumption is that past performance is an indicator of likely future achievement. Of course, this assumption is often violated, since the market is news-driven and fluctuates rapidly. As we show in our experiments, for our definitions of mo-mentum and funding momentum, the assumption often works well. Therefore, training classifiers on past funding momentum makes sense, and in some cases may even be adequate to forecast future funding momentum. Gryc [8] shows that indicators such as EMA, MACD histogram, RSI can help to improve prediction accuracy.

Although we are not able to validate whether the definitions can accurately identify intervals that are not of increasing momentum, the prediction methods we propose work well for the selection criteria encoded in Formulas 1 X 4. Alter-natively speaking, when we select the increasing momentum topics and projects based on these criteria, the prediction methods have good accuracy. Again, when negative information about success in funding is available to reveal more criteria, or any modification of the criteria, it can be assimilated into our model.
In our experiments, we have used four k inds of classifier to model whether a topic has increasing momentum: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, SVM and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The linear regression classifier estimates the output as a linear combination of the attributes, fit with a least squares approach. However, trends of the indicators are usually non-linear. Therefore, non-linear classifiers are generally able to achi eve better performance. ANN is a popular technique for predicting stock market pri ces, with excellent capacity for learning non-linear relationships without prior knowledge. SVM is another well-known non-linear classifier that has been widely applied in stock analysis. Compared with ANN and SVM, the Decision tree is much less popular, but as we will show later for determining whether a topic has increasing momentum or not, in our experiments the decision tree classifier performed as well as the SVM and ANN. (We used classifiers implemented in Weka [3], a well-known machine learning and data mining tool, with default parameter settings. The corresponding classifier implementations in Weka for C4.5 decision trees, ANN and SVM are the J48, the MultiLayerPerceptron, and Li bSVM classifiers, respectively.) 5.1 Analyzing Bursts for Research Topics and Projects The RePORTER database [2] provides information for NIH grant awards since 1986. Each award record includes a set of project terms, which can be considered as research topics in this project (we use  X  X opic X  and  X  X erm X  interchangeably). Since the total number of years is only 24, we consider the funding momentum for the terms at each month, and term frequencies are calculated by month. As RePORTER imposes limits on volume of downloaded data, we considered awards only for the state of California  X  a dataset containing 12,378 unique terms and 119,079 awards.
 We use technical analysis indicators such as the MACD histogram value and RSI to compute momentum and identify burst periods for the terms, adapting the definition of bursts as intervals of increasing momentum studied in He and Parker [10]. Burst periods for the terms  X  X  ntineoplastics X ,  X  X omplementary-DNA X , and  X  X ncogenes X  are shown in Figure 1  X  as well as their frequencies and funding momentum. The funding momentum covers the 6 month period beyond any time point. We set the the threshold value to 0.2 for selection of increasing momen-tum years (we call these years increasing momentum years). Clearly increasing momentum years are highly correlated with bursts. Strong bursts usually define intervals that have increasing momentum. Weak bursts, such as the one for  X  X ene expression X  around 1993, are omitted by the threshold filter. However, it is not necessarily the case that a strong burst period has increasing momentum. For example,  X  X ncogenes X  has a strong burst from year 1997 to 1999, but the increas-ing momentum years associated with the burst extended only from 1997 to the middle of 1998, because the burst levels off. According to criterion (3) in section 3.1, we say after the middle of year 1998,  X  X ncogenes X  does not have increas-ing momentum. We can also observe how c riteria (1) and (2) affect increasing momentum. For example, for  X  X ntineoplastics X , the increasing momentum years start after 1997, which is the end of its frequency plunge; criterion (2) avoids labeling years in a plunge followed by a burst as having increasing momentum. 5.2 Experimental Validation of the Funding Momentum Definition To validate our definition of the funding momentum, we have checked years labeled as increasing momentum against historical events. For example, during the early 1990s, advancements in genetics boosted deeper research on DNA. Two well-known projects, the Human Genome Project and the cloning of Dolly the sheep, started in 1990 and 1996, respectively. We checked the increasing mo-mentum years for all  X  X enetic X  terms, and most have increasing momentum years consistent with the year of the development of these two projects. For illustra-tion purposes, we randomly drew five terms and summarized their increasing momentum years in Table 2.

There has been a steady increase of research on HIV and AIDS since 1986, when the FDA approved the first anti-retroviral drug to treat AIDS [12]. There-fore we checked the increasing moment um years for terms related to  X  X IDS X , and obtained the results for the five randomly drawn terms shown in Table 2. We observed similar consistency betw een our increasing momentum years and the periods of expansion in HIV and AIDS research, supporting our funding momentum definition.

Following the percentage model of funding momentum, we do only the simple evaluation in which a project has increasing momentum if the percentage of the topics it contains that have increasing momentum is greater than a threshold t . This situation for research topics appears to differ significantly from that for news  X  memes  X  presented in [11]. where topics are more correlated and their clustering is stronger.

We can define the accuracy of our funding momentum definition for research projects as the percentage of consiste ncy between the increasing momentum years of the projects and their grant years. The more they are consistent with one another, the higher the accuracy. Varying the threshold as 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 and randomly selecting 1000 projects, we obtained the results shown in Table 3, showing the average number of term s contained by each project, which is around 16. Therefore, a threshold t =0.2 requires at least 3 topics be of increasing momentum for a project, while a threshold t = 0.8 requires at least 13 such topics. Accuracy of these results dr ops as the threshold increases. For t =0.2, the accuracy was sufficien tly high that we adopted t = 0.2 in all remaining experiments. 5.3 Prediction of Funding Momentum for Research Topics In order to predict the funding momentum for the research topics, we create our dataset where the attribute are the momentum of the topic, the technical analysis indicators MACD histogram value, and RSI value. The class is binary: whether the m month period from the current mo nth has increasing momentum or not. We apply J48, SVM, ANN, Linear Re gression classifiers on 1000 randomly selected research topics. We als o vary the length of the period m from half a year (6 months) to one year. We conduct a ten-fold cross-validation and the error rate of each classifier is shown in Table 4. As we can see, J48 and SVM achieve low error rate in general and their error rates remains almost constant for different time periods. ANN is superior to Linear Regression but both classifiers incur drops in their performance as m increases.

Figure 2 shows observed sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (1 -false positive rate) of all classifiers. ANN achieved the highest sensitivity. J48, SVM and ANN all had much better sensitivity than LR. All classifiers had specificity almost 1. SVM had the highest specificity, while ANN had the lowest. These results suggest that all classifiers make wrong predictions for positive instances. This performance may be caused by the un-balance property of our dataset, in which most instances are negative instances. This is reasonable since generally speaking the burst period is much shorter than the non-burst period, and only periods with strong bursts are reported as increasing momentum.

Earlier, in the related work section, we mentioned a few techniques for stock price prediction. However, these are not easily adapted to our problem of fund-ing momentum prediction. We therefore used a Naive method to predict funding momentum as the baseline. The Naive method simply assigns the funding mo-mentum of the next month as the funding momentum of the current month, with the assumption that the trend movement usually lasts for a while. The performance of the Naive method, reported in Table 4, was much worse than any of the classifiers, indicating that mu ch better performance can be achieved with intelligent classifier design.
 Next we compared the performance of the classifiers both with and without TA attributes (technical analysis indicators: MACD, histogram value, and RSI). Since the overall error rates of the J48 and SVM classifiers were superior to the others, we reviewed only the performance of these two classifiers. We again ran-domly selected 1000 research topics and c onducted a ten-fold cross-validation. Comparing the predicti on accuracy only for m =6, the experimental results re-ported in Table 5 show that when the technical analysis indicators were included, the performance of both classifiers improv ed significantly. The main performance improvements when TAs are included were in improved sensitivity; when TAs were not included, the two classifiers tended to make incorrect predictions for almost all positive instances.
 5.4 Prediction of Funding Momentum for Projects To predict the funding momentum of a project, we first predicted the funding momentum of terms in the project. Then we determined if a project had in-creasing momentum or not a ccording to the percentage of the terms increasing momentum. (If the percentage is greater than the threshold t , the project has increasing momentum.) Again we compared the performance of the classifier J48, SVM, ANN, Linear Regression and Naive. We conducted the experiments on 1,000 randomly selected pr ojects with threshold 0. 2forthe6monthperiod from the current month. Results are reported in Table 6: the performance of classifiers was positively related to thei r performance on research topics. Among these classifiers, the performance of J48 and SVM remained the best. However, since the variance of the classification error on terms accumulated, performance for each classifier got worse, especially for the Naive method. In this paper, by analyzing historical NIH grant award data (in RePORTER [2]), we were able to model occurrence pa tterns of biomedical topics in successful grant awards with a corresponding measure that we call funding momentum. We also developed a classification method to predict funding momentum for these topics in projects. We were able to show th at this method achieved good predic-tion accuracy. It seems possible that indi cators such as impact and significance could be addressed with variations on funding momentum. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative model of funding momentum for research projects. We also show in this work that the classification problem is highly un-balanced, Therefore the sensitivity of all the classifiers are not satisfactory. so un-balanced classification techniques might b e used to improve performance.

We proposed a percentage model for the funding momentum of research projects. There can be other models. Fo r example, in the percentage model, the topics the project contains may have semantic correlations in that some top-ics are always show up together. A mo re complicated model maybe needed to define the momentum of a research project. Another possible model is instead of considering the percentage of the increasing momentum topics in the project, we add the frequency of the topics as the  X  X requency X  of the project. We can then apply the same trend models to identify intervals of increasing momentum for the project. The intuition behind this additive model comes from stock market analogies, considering topics as independent stocks and the project as a  X  X ector X , with a sector index defined as the sum of sto cks it covers. Therefore, similarly we add the frequency of the topics to approximate the frequency of the project.
