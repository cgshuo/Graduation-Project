 In a trust network, two users who are connected by a trust relationship tend to have similar interests. Based on this observation, existing trust-aware recommendation methods predict ratings for a target user on unseen items by referencing to ratings of those users who are reach able from the target user in the forward direction of trustor-trustee relationship through the trust network. However, these methods have overlooked the possibility of utilizing the ratings of t hose users reachable in the backward direction, which may also have sim ilar interests. In this paper, we investigate this possibility by iden tifying and adding these users to the existing methods when predicting ratings for the target user. We perform a series of experiments and observe that our approach improves the coverage while preserving the accuracy.

The process usually involves first identifying those users deemed to have similar interests, and second predicting the rating for the target user using the ratings of these similar users. measured by coverage and accuracy. Roughly speaking, coverage means how much percentage of unrated items is actually predictable by the algorithm, whereas accuracy means the degree of correct prediction. Both covera ge and accuracy are improved as more and more users give rati ngs on more and more items, because this technique presumes sufficient ratings data of the target user and other users. total number of users and items. This leads to the data sparsity problem [1], resulting in low coverage and accuracy. To remedy this problem, trust-based approaches to collaborative filtering [6][7][8] have been proposed which utilize a trust network. users, in short, representing trus t relationships among people. In the trust network of Figure 1, for instance, nodes represent users and edges encode trust relationship, i.e., the edge (U represents  X  X  1 trusts U 4  X . Here, U 1 is called trustor and U Figure 1, U 4 is a trustee of U 1 , and a trustor of U 5 target user using the ratings on the target item given by neighbors, instead of similar users used in traditional collaborative filtering. 
Corresponding author In the existing approaches [7][8], the  X  X rustable X  users are defined to be those users in the trust network reachable from the target user within certain distance by following in the forward direction. In Figure 1, for instance, neighbors of the user U U }. similar users in these approaches is the assumption that a trustor would be interested in those it ems which his/her trustees are interested in, in short, that a trustor and a trustee would have similar interests. If this assumption is true, the reasoning in the reverse direction should also be tr ue. That is, a trustee would have interests in those items which his/her trustors are interested in. Most approaches have overlooked this possibility, and this paper aims to exploit this addition for improving ratings prediction. in a trust network: FWD(u) , BWD(u) , and UND(u) . FWD(u) represents the set of users reachable from u through the forward links, BWD(u) the set of users reachable from u through the backward links, and UND(u) the set of users reachable from u through the links regardless of the directions. In the trust network of Figure 1, for example, FWD(U 1 )={U 4 , U 5 , U 8 } as shown earlier, BWD(U 1 )={U 2 , U 3 , U 7 }, and UND(U 1 )={U 2 , U U , U 9 } if no distance limitation is imposed. experimentation using a real-world trust network data.

Through extensive experiments, we compare the accuracy and coverage of trust-based recommendation methods equipped with FWD(u), BWD(u), and UND(u). The results show that the coverage of trust-based recommendations is improved and the accuracy is preserved when the backward links (trustors) are additionally employed. recommendation that predicts the rating of a target user u by referring to the ratings of her/his neighbors. Tidal Trust [6], Mole Trust [7], and TrustWalker [8] are typical examples of trust-based recommendation methods. In these methods, the neighbors for a target user u corresponds to the set FWD(u) in our definition above. item i by Equation (1) below. weight  X   X , X  is the trust value by which user u assessed user v in the trust network. If u did not assess v , TidalTrust infers  X  aggregating the trust values between u 's direct trustees and v , weighted by the trust values of u and his/her direct trustees.  X  X  is an average value of all the ratings that a user u gave on items.  X  X   X , X  is a trust value that a user u assessed on a user v , and Mole Trust has its own way to compute  X  X   X , X  , different from that of Tidal Trust. The meanings of the other symbols are the same as those in Equation (1). TrustWalker assumes that no trus t values are given in the trust network, which is different from both of Tidal Trust and Mole Trust. TrustWal ker predicts,  X  X   X , X  , by Equation (3).  X   X , X  is a Boolean variable indicating whether a user v gave a rating on an item j in the data set, and  X  X  X  X  probability that a random walker who starts from the node corresponding to the target user u stops at a node corresponding to a user v in the trust network and selects an item j among the items that were rated by a user v . The probability of stopping at a user v is proportional to the similarity between the user u and the user v in terms of their ratings, and the probability of selecting an item j is proportional to the similarity between the item i and the item j . recommendation only take FWD(u) into account, ignoring BWD(u) and UND(u). In this paper, we show that BWD(u) and UND(u) provide fairly valuable information in recommendation, and that its application to the existing methods helps improve the coverage significantly, thereby alleviating the problem of cold start users. neighbors, we perform empirical studies using real-world data sets obtained from Epnions.com [9], a popular online product review site. The Epinions data sets contain users { u 1 , ..., u { i , ..., i n } such as movies, books, etc. Users are invited to give users are also invited to build a trust network by asserting binary trust statements, i.e., 1 means  X  X rust X  and 0  X  X o not trust X . For example, t u,v = 1 in case user u trusts user v . in our experiment. It contains about 49K users, 140K items, 665K ratings about products, 487K trus t statements among users, and 16K cold-start users. Cold start users refer to the users who give ratings on only very little items. In this paper, we treat as cold-start users those users who gave ra tings on less than 6 items. This data set is very sparse in that cold-start users occupy about 37% of the total, and the sparsity is 0.000097 (indicating the proportion of the user-item pairs having a rating value over the entire number of possible user-item pairs). ratings between a target user u and the users in the user sets, FWD(u), BWD(u), and UND(u), the la tter two being the new sets identified by our approach. The similarity calculation was based on correlation coefficient between the target user and each set, over the given ratings on the same items. The result of Table 2 indicates that the users in the new sets, BWD(u) and UND(u), are very similar to the target user, as much as the users in FWD(u) of existing approaches. of sets, FWD(u), BWD(u), and UND(u) for every user u . Note that 99% of the entire users are included in UND(u) for each target user. This is because the data set is a small part of Epinions.com, which is collected by depth-first search on the trust network [9]. The average numbers of users in the FWD(u) and BWD(u) for all the users are all equal. That is, even if each individual set of FWD(u) may be different from BWD(u) for a should be the same for these two classes. contains more users could not he lp to predict the ratings of recommendation methods can predict the ratings of items that were evaluated by the neighbors. Therefore, how many items are evaluated by neighbors is importa nt for improving coverage. For this reason, we measured the number of items that are evaluated by users in each user set. the users in FWD(u) or BWD(u) because of the mentioned reason above. The users in BWD(u) evaluates more items than the users in FWD(u). Using UND(u) help to predict about 54% more items than using only FWD(u). In addition, Table 4 shows that considering more users as the neighbors can help coverage improve because different users do not evaluate the exactly same items. Table 4. Number of items evaluated by users in each user sets different they are, especially between the users in FWD(u) of existing approaches and the users in our new sets, BWD(u) and UND(u). The difference comparis on was done using Jaccard Coefficients, as shown in Table 5. The result indicates that BWD(u) contains many users not in FWD(u), and so does UND(u). Since the new sets, BWD( u) and UND(u), identify new neighbors in addition to the set FWD(u), we envisage that utilization of BWD(u) or UND(u) will induce different results in the ratings prediction from existing approaches. Table 5. Difference between the  X  X ld X  and  X  X ew X  neighbors in many different items they rated. The purpose of this comparison is because, even though user groups are not entirely identical as shown above, coverage will not become much different by applying the newly identified group, if rated items are all identical. The difference comparison was done again using Jaccard Coefficients, as shown in Table 6. The result indicates that there is difference in the rated items among those groups, hence our approach may drive different results from existing approaches. 
Table 6. Difference between the  X  X ld X  and  X  X ew X  neighbor in BWD(u) or UND(u) has same interests to target user u in terms of items. Also, using BWD(u) make the different result in comparison to using FWD(u), and using UND(u) would improve coverage. coverage and the accuracy measures by additionally counting ratings information from the user s in BWD(u) or UND(u) to the existing approaches. In our experiment, we will compare the results obtained by applying BWD(u) and UND(u) to existing approaches with the results obtained by applying FWD(u) to the same approaches. [7], and TrustWalker [8] from existing trust-aware recommend-dation methods. For each method, the ratings prediction is performed based on the users in the set, FWD(u), but reachable within the distance 6 (for the sake of simplicity) from the target user following the forward edges in the trust network. [1][8] and root mean squared erro rs (RMSE) [1][8] as typically used by existing approaches. MAE calculates the mean of the errors (i.e., the differences) betw een predicted ratings and actual correct ratings, whereas RMSE count s larger errors more strongly by magnifying them. As for the correct answer, we have selected one user-item pair by the strategy of  X  X eave-one out X . Coverage recommendable pairs to the tota l number of user-item pairs selected as the correct answers. Additionally, we show the results combining RMSE and coverage through F-measure [8]. measure obtained after applying the three user sets to the selected existing methods, i.e., Tidal Trust, Mole Trust, and Trust Walker. Note that the cases using BW D(u) and UND(u) show better coverage than the cases using FW D(u) in all three methods. We believe this improved coverage to be attributable to that the set UND(u) is in fact a superset of FWD(u). On the other hand, the reason for improved coverage for the cases with BWD(u) over the cases with FWD(u) is because th e former contains less number of cases of |  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  |  X 0 than the latter. the existing methods. In the cases with Tidal Trust, the prediction accuracy using BWD(u) or UND(u) showed results a little better than using FWD(u). In the cases with Mole Trust and TrustWalker, however, the accuracy using FWD(u) showed results a little better than using BWD(u) and UND(u). We believe, Tidal Trust showed improved accu racy because this method has a policy of making use of only the mo st neighbors, not all users. In the methods utilizing BWD(u) and UND(u), the coverage has been improved greatly. As a result, the cases with BWD(u) and UND(u) show better F-measures in all methods. Table 7. Coverage and accuracy of each user set (All Users) Tidal Trust Mole Trust TrustWalker Measure for the cold-start users, showing that the coverage of the cases using BWD(u) or UND(u) became much increased that those using FWD(u), and the acc uracy using BWD(u) or UND(u) was almost comparable with the result using the entire set of users. The results using BWD(u) or UND( u) also had higher F-measure than those using FWD(u), because of the increased coverage and comparable accuracy. On the other hand, the coverage and accuracy results for the cold-start users were generally lower than the results for the entire users shown in Table 8. We believe that also have little connections with other users in the trust network. Tidal Trust Mole Trust TrustWalker and UND(u) showed increased co verage and similar accuracy compared to existing methods, both for the entire users and for the cold-start user. In particular, the coverage has been increased by a large amount for the cold-start user s, suggesting that our approach can provide a promising solution to deal with cold-start users. have utilized only the  X  X WD(u) X  users in ratings prediction on behalf of a target user u , we argue that the  X  X WD(u) X  and the  X  X ND(u) X  users can also be used equally well. In this paper, we have supported this argument through experimentation by applying our approach to some of the existing methods and showing positive results. Especially, our approach has shown large improvement in the coverage measure for the case of cold-start users.
