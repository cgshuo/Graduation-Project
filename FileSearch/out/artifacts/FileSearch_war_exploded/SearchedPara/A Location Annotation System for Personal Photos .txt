As the number of digital images in personal collections is increasing, it becomes necessary to support users of digital cameras with software tools fo r personal image management. We originally developed a time and location based clustering model to produce a browsing tool for coll ections of images stamped with GPS metadata [1]. The idea was to group the images into discrete events, where two images belonged to the same event if they were taken at similar times in nearby locations. We used the time clustering model of Platt et al. ( 2002) which first sorts the images in the collection by time, then marks the start of a new event whenever  X  time gap between image i and image i+1, gN is the time gap between two successive images, d is the width of a sliding window of successive images (e.g. d =10). K is a suitable threshold (Platt et al. used K = log17).  X  the average time gap between su ccessive images in the window. Our location clustering model ha s two components: a latitude clustering algorithm and a longit ude clustering algorithm. We used formulas which are analogous w ith that of Platt et al. (2000), except in that the images are initially sorted by latitude and longitude respectively rather than by time, and instead of gN and gN+1 being time differences, they are differences between adjacent images in latitude or longitude. Two images are considered to represent the same overall event if and only if they have been found to be in the same time event, the same latitude event, and the same longitude event. This system has been extended to allow users to retrie ve images in response to text queries, which are matched against keyword annotations for each image, which may be either system or user-generated. The system consists of three stages: image metadata extraction, event clustering and image annotation by looking up keywords in a gazetteer, and matching of user text queries against the image annotations. The gazetteer we used was the UK file of the Geographic Names Data Base, maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence
