 1. Introduction
For fast technological innovation, the developments of new products are becoming much complicated not only due to their system functioning but also because of their system components.
Therefore, reliability analysis is an important fi eld of academic research and practice. In the beginning, the idea of reliability of a system or a machine or a person was based on theoretical discussions. Later on, a mathematical shape was given to the concept of reliability of a system. The mathematical development of reliability gave thrust to many ideas in the fi eld of electrical, mechanical and electronics engineering and allied industries. In order to render the system as safe as possible, a number of analysis techniques have been developed: Failure Mode Analysis, Event
Tree Analysis, Markov Models and FTA. FTA is a powerful diag-nostic technique and is widely used for demonstrating the root causes of undesired events in system failure. The concept of the
FTA was developed by the Bell telephone laboratory in 1961 and it is widely used in many fi elds.

Traditionally, the reliability of a system's behavior is fully characterized in the context of probability measures. The outcome probability of the top event is certain and precise, as long as, the data of the basic events are from reliable information. However, in
The FTA approach assumes that the causes of events are random and statistically independent. But certain common causes can lead to correlations in event probabilities which violate the independence assumptions and could exaggerate the likelihood of an event fault. State space based approaches like the Markov models overcome this limitation, but it requires the solution to be computed over a set of equations that increases exponentially with the number of components. To overcome these limitations, Petri
Nets can be conveniently used since it allows us to describe large state spaces by a restricted number of model primitives (places, transitions and tokens). Unlike the Fault Tree, the use of Petri Nets also allows ef fi cient simultaneous generation of minimal cut and path sets. Hura and Atwood (1988 ) proposed the use of Petri Nets to represent Fault Trees. Kumar and Aggarwal (1993 ) used both Petri Nets and Fault Tree methods for software reliability analysis.
Petri Nets can also be used to directly simulate the Fault Trees. Liu and Chiou (1997 ) described such a method and proposed an algorithm for generating minimal cut sets of the translated trees.
Knezevic and Odoom (2001 ) developed a new methodology which uses Petri Nets instead of the Fault Tree methodology and solves for reliability indices utilizing the fuzzy lambda  X  tau method. Prediction of failure in an industrial system by the use of Fuzzy
Petri Net (FPN) was presented by Sharma et al. (2008) . Chen et al. (2012) presented a new method for fuzzy risk analysis based on the proposed new fuzzy ranking method for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers with different left and right heights.

Bearing in mind the great importance of the gas turbine for plant time between failures, expected number of failures, etc., should be carefully evaluated in order to anticipate the technical and econom-ical performance of the plant. In these types of problems, it rarely occurs that degree of acceptance, degree of rejection and degree of hesitation will be the same corresponding to different values of reliability. Therefore, in this paper, a new methodology named as vague lambda  X  tau is proposed for reliability analysis of the repair-able systems based on a trapezoidal vague set with different left heights and right heights. In this methodology, the trapezoidal vague set with different left heights and right heights is coupled with a conventional lambda  X  tau method to evaluate the vague expressions for OR-transition of the Petri Nets model. This paper involves the qualitative and quantitative analysis of gas turbine system. In qualitative analysis, the Petri Net model is obtained from parameters such as the expected number of failures (ENOF), mean evaluated using the vague lambda  X  tau methodology.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , the introduction to the Petri Net theory and conversion from FTA to a
Petri Net model is presented, while the lambda  X  tau methodology for determining reliability of repairable systems is presented in
Section 3 . Section 4 introduces the basic de fi nition and operations of the trapezoidal vague set with different left and right heights and Section 5 proposes a new approach of vague reliability and presents an algorithm to fi nd out the vague reliability of a system.
In order to illustrate the proposed approach, an example of a gas turbine system has been considered. Also, some comparisons with the existing approaches are discussed in Section 6 . Finally Section 7 makes conclusions. 2. Petri Nets theory
Petri Nets are general purpose graphical and mathematical tools for describing the relations between conditions and events. Owing to the variety of logical relations that can be represented with Petri
Net, it is a powerful tool for modeling system. It can be used not correlation between the Fault Tree and Petri Net is shown in Fig. 3 , which is the Petri Net transformation of Fig. 2 .

Minimal cut and path sets can be derived from a Petri Net model more ef fi ciently than from an equivalent Fault Tree model.
It was demonstrated through a matrix method in Liu and Chiou (1997 ), which shows that the determination of minimal path sets could be achieved in the Petri Net model without transforming the
Petri Net to its dual. This means that the minimal cut and path sets can be determined at the same time. Also, it was proved that for the same model, it takes about twice as much instructional steps to generate minimal cut sets in a Fault Tree model as in the equivalent Petri Net model. The minimal cut sets of the Petri Net model shown in Fig. 3 are {A,B,E,C,D}. 3. The lambda  X  tau methodology for determining reliability of repairable systems
The lambda  X  tau methodology is used to analyze the Fault Tree model of the repairable systems. The basic expressions for failure rate (  X  ) and repair time (  X  ) associated with the logical AND/OR gates of the Fault Tree model are presented in Table 1 . From these expressions, various parameters such as those shown in Table 2 could be obtained. 4. Vague set theory
In this section, some basic de fi nitions related to vague sets and arithmetic operations between trapezoidal vague sets with differ-ent left and right heights are presented. 4.1. Basic de fi nitions
De fi nition 4.1. ( Kumar et al., 2005 ) A vague set ~ V  X f x membership function  X  ~ V ;  X  ~ V : X - X  0 ; 1 and a false membership function  X  ~ V ;  X  ~ V : X - X  0 ; 1 . The values  X  ~ V  X  x  X  and the degree of truth membership and degree of false membership of x and always satisfy the condition  X  ~ V  X  x  X  X   X  ~ V  X  x  X  4.2.

The arithmetic operations between ~ V 1 and ~ V 2 are de fi follows: ~

Verma et al. (2013) proposed a vague lambda  X  tau methodology for reliability analysis of a system instead of the fuzzy lambda methodology ( Sharma et al., 2008 ).Themajoradvantageofusing and negative evidence for membership of an element in the set. Also, in vague sets the level of con fi dence of domain experts lies between  X  0 ; 1 . The major advantage of using vague sets over fuzzy sets is that the vague sets separate the posit ive and negative evidence for membership of an element in the set and also, in vague sets the level of con fi dence of domain experts lies between  X  0 ; existing method ( Sharma et al., 2008 ) all the parameters are represented by a trapezoidal vag ue set with the same left and right that trapezoidal vague sets with different left and right heights should be used instead of the trapezoidal vague set with the same left and right heights. Due to this reason, a new vague lambda technique is proposed for reliability analysis. The proposed method can model and analyze the vague reliability in a more fl exible and intelligent manner. In terms of imple menting arithmetic operations of the trapezoidal vague set with different left heights and right heights in reliability analysis, the conventional lambda  X  sions given in Table 2 are modi fi ed, using Eqs. (5)  X  (8) and which is stated as follows.

Let the failure rate and repair rate be represented by trape-zoidal vague set with different left heights and right heights ~  X   X  ;  X  height of truth and the complement of false membership values of of truth and the complement of false membership values of the trapezoidal vague set ~  X  i ; and ~  X  i  X  X  X   X  i 1 ;  X  i 2 where i  X  1 ; 2 ; 3 ; ... ; n ,  X  i 1 ;  X  i 2 ;  X  i 3 ;  X  are called the left height of truth and the complement of false membership values of the trapezoidal vague set ~  X  i , and called the right height of truth and the complement of false membership values of the trapezoidal vague set ~  X  i ; respectively.
Then, the failure and repair rate for the top event of the Petri Net 6.1. Vague reliability assessment of gas turbine
The steps for evaluating the vague reliability of the gas turbine system are given below
Step 1 : To handle the uncertainties and imprecision in the reliability data, the crisp value of (  X  )and(  X  )givenin Table 5 is converted into a trapezoidal vague set with different left heights arithmetic operations between trapezoidal vague set with different left and right heights based on the conventional lambda  X  tau methodology as given in Eqs. (13 )  X  ( 16 ). of the system, they can be used in determining a number of quanti fi able parameters such as the expected number of failures (ENOF), mean time between failures (MTBF), availability ( and the proposed method, for different membership values are shown in Table 8 and Fig. 8 . The comparisons between them are described as follows: (i) In the Kumar and Aggarwal (1993 ) method, the reliability of top event is equal to 0.9820 at all value of  X  , it means that this method does not consider any vagueness present in data. This method is applicable where the data are precise and certain.
Also, these methods do not consider the con fi dence level of domain experts. (ii) In the Sharma et al. (2008) method, for a particular value of crisp reliability  X  r  X  , if the truth membership value then the false membership value  X  ~ R  X  r  X  corresponding to the same value of  X  r  X  will be  X  1  X   X  . Therefore, the value of reliability of the system is  X  r  X  with the degree  X  of truth membership, degree  X  1  X   X  of false membership and degree 0 of indeterminacy (hesitation) membership. For example by using Table 8 , the value of reliability of the system is  X  r  X  0 : 9793  X  with the degree 0.5 of truth membership, the degree 0.5 of false membership. There is no degree of indeterminacy membership that the value of reliability is 0.9793. Also, this method does not consider the con fi dence level of domain experts (highest con fi dence,  X   X  1). (iii) In the Verma et al. (2013) method, let the value of particular value of crisp reliability  X  r  X  be  X  and corresponding to of reliability of the system is  X  r  X  with the degree  X  of truth membership, degree  X  of false membership and degree  X  1  X   X   X  of indeterminacy membership. For example by using
Table 8 , the value of reliability of the system is  X  r  X  0 the degree 0.3 of truth membership and degree 0.6 of false membership. There is the degree 0.1 of indeterminacy member-ship that the value of reliability is 0.9793 which is not con-sidered in both the methods ( Kumar and Aggarwal, 1993 ;
Sharma et al., 2008 ). Also, the proposed method considers the con fi dence level of domain experts  X   X   X  r 0 : 6and  X   X  (iv) In the existing approach ( Kumar and Aggarwal,1993 ), the results are unique at different levels of  X  ,whichmeansitdoesnot consider any vagueness. The existing approach ( Sharma et al., 2008 ) overwhelms the limitatio n of the existing approach ( Kumar and Aggarwal, 1993 ), but the results from this approach haveauniquevalueatamaximummembershipvalue(say  X   X  1) means the value of reliability at  X   X  1isacrispvalue.
The same is the case with the existing approach ( Verma et al., 2013 ). Therefore, to avoid the above said approach one can use the trapezoidal fuzzy number or trapezoidal vague sets, but it also has a constant value of maximum membership value. So, to overcome these limitations vagu e sets with different left and
