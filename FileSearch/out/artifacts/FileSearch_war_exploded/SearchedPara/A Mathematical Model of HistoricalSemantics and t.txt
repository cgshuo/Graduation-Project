 University of Toulouse III 1. Introduction
Ambiguity is ubiquitous in natural language. It is most dramatic when it concerns the parsing of a sentence in examples such as
However, the most common form of ambiguity concerns the meanings of individual words, as in the following examples:
The last example involves homographs (different words which happen to be spelled ambiguity is due to homography. (We obtained an estimate of approximately 2% by random sampling of English and French dictionaries [12, 21, 22, 24].) Many words have gained multiple senses by metonymy or by figurative or metaphorical uses. The result-ing senses are sufficiently different to be considered by lexicographers as distinct con-cepts (e.g., political party/drinks party). In information retrieval systems with natural language interfaces (Mandala, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 1999; Stevenson and Wilks 1999) or in models of human language processing via networks of semantic links (Fellbaum 1998; Hayes 1999; Vossen 2001), a fundamental question is what should correspond to a basic semantic concept. Is it a word, a word sense, or a group of word senses? number of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries provides convincing evidence that neither words nor individual word senses (as identified by lexicographers) correspond to concepts, but rather groups of word senses. Our model demonstrates that each word average 2.0 distinct senses per word listed in the dictionaries. This model also allows us to propose a novel and formal definition of the word concept . There are clear applications in artificial intelligence (Mandala, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 1999; Stevenson and Wilks 1998; Antilla 1989; Schendl 2001; Geeraerts 1997). 2. The Genesis of Word Senses
Word origin and the evolution of spelling, pronunciation, and meaning have long been studied by etymologists. Etymology tells us that many words in everyday use have a history that can be traced back thousands of years (Onions 1966; Picoche 1992). This can be contrasted with the hundreds of new entries which lexicographers add to each new edition of a dictionary. These new entries are not only neologisms, but also new senses for existing words. The history of the variations in spelling and pronunciation of particular words are not of direct concern here. We are interested in how word, sense pairs enter (or leave) a language. For each such semantic change, we can try to identify the originator, the reason, and the mechanism by which it occurs. 2.1 Origins of Semantic Change
Picoche (1992) states that the majority of words in French have a scholarly origin and were introduced by clerics, jurists, intellectuals, and scientists directly from Latin and Greek. However, it is clear that many words are of popular origin (e.g., bike , trainers ,and
OK in English or v  X  elo , baskets ,and OK in French) and have become accepted terms as the result of common use.
 guage to new communicative requirements (Schendl 2001). Discoveries and inventions words (e.g., the  X  X rmoured vehicle X  sense of tank which coexists with the earlier  X  X arge container X  sense). Another driving force in historical semantics is the human tendency toward efficiency of communication, by, for example, shortening words or expres-sions (e.g., clipping of omnibus to bus ), ignoring unnecessary semantic distinctions, and inventing new words to replace long expressions. Other reasons for semantic change 228 have more to do with human psychology than with practical necessity. Taboo leads to the introduction of slang words or euphemisms, such as to terminate for  X  X o kill X  or of its opposite (e.g., not bad for  X  X ood X ). New words may be employed to make an old product sound more modern, exotic, or appetizing (e.g., the old-fashioned British word chips is often replaced by french fries or frites on menus). The human tendency to emphasize or exaggerate leads to the replacement of severe by horrific or very by awfully (Schendl 2001). 2.2 Mechanisms of Semantic Change
We can divide the mechanisms for neologism into three categories (Algeo 1998; Antilla 1989; Chalker and Weiner 1994; Gramley 2001; Schendl 2001; Stockwell and Minkova 2001): 1. Word-creation from no previous etymon. This is rare but is the most likely 2. Borrowing from another language. This includes loan words (e.g., strudel 3. Word formation from existing etyma (words or word components). This
Mechanisms 1 and 3(f) X (h) are rare compared to 2 and 3(a) X (e) (Algeo 1998). Clearly, the above mechanisms are not exclusive. Borrowing and word formation are obviously both at play in examples such as blitz , which is a clipping of the German word blitzkreig , and the French word tennisman , which is a compound of two English words.
 a single sense, except when by coincidence the word being created, borrowed, or formed already exists with a different sense. In the rest of the article, we consider homographs produced by such coincidences to be different words. In most dictionaries, homographs have distinct entries. For example, the term bug , meaning  X  X rror in a computer program, X  was borrowed into French as bogue (by assimilation with the already existing word with dictionaries as two distinct words. recognized as a genuinely new word: ellipsis (Antilla 1989) (e.g., daily (newspaper) ), zero derivation (Nevalainen 1999) (also known as conversion [Gramley 2001; Schendl 2001]) French word meaning  X  X o verify X ).
 existing word (adapted from Algeo [1998]): 1. referential shift (e.g., to print now also refers to laser printers). 2. generalization (e.g., chap used to mean  X  X  customer X ) or abstraction (e.g., 3. specialization (e.g., in Old English fowl meant any kind of bird and meat 4. metaphor (e.g., kite , meaning  X  X ird of prey, X  applied to a toy). 5. metonymy (literally,  X  X ame change X ), that is, naming something by any of 6. clang association or folk etymology (e.g., belfry meant  X  X  movable tower 7. embellishment of language by using words which are more acceptable,
We use the general term association to cover all these cases. 3. The Near-Exponential Rule
In order to study the relative importance of neologism, obsolescence, and the creation of new meanings for existing words, we counted the number of senses listed per word in several different monolingual dictionaries. We observed the following general empirical rule satisfied to within a fairly high degree of accuracy by all the dictionaries studied [9, 12, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 31, 32]: of words in the dictionary with exactly s senses. If the near-exponential rule is satisfied, then the resulting plot should be very close to a straight line with a negative slope. This is indeed the case for the dictionaries tested, with varying values of the slope depending on the dictionary. Figures 1 and 2 show the plot of N s , on a logarithmic scale, against s 230 points ( s , N s ) for which N s &gt; 12 are plotted in the figures.
 pages of the dictionary. Sampling was performed independently for each dictionary, meaning that the random sample of words was different in each case. We excluded entries corresponding to proper names, foreign words, spelling variants, derived words (such as past participles), regional words, abbreviations, and expressions. We allowed hyphens within words but not spaces. Thus cat-o X -nine-tails counted as a word, but tower block and phrasal verbs such as give up did not. Only words forming part of
British English or French spoken in metropolitan France were considered. All words were treated equally irrespective of their relative frequencies. Thus the words get and floccinaucinihilipilification were given the same importance. The size of each dictionary that was sampled is given in the reference section. The dictionaries sampled vary in size from 20,000 to 80,000 words.
 experimental procedure or of lexicographical practice, we performed the same analysis on a dictionary of abbreviations and acronyms [7], a dictionary of scientific terms [1], a bilingual dictionary of slang words [17], and a dictionary of French synonyms [10]. The resulting curves, shown in Figure 3, are far from straight lines.
 number of words NT t with t translations plotted against t for several pairs of languages.
The NT t scale is again logarithmic. Although the near-exponential rule could also be said to hold for certain bilingual dictionaries, the curvature of the log NT curve varies considerably depending on the distance between the two languages. For pairs of languages with strong etymological connections (such as French and Spanish), 232 probably due to the greater differences in the segmentation of semantic space by distant languages (see Resnik and Yarowsky [2000] for some illustrative examples). It will be treated in detail in a follow-up article. 4. Words, Senses, and Concepts
In the following section we present a mathematical model which explains the near-exponential distribution of word senses observed in English and French dictionaries.
Not only do the curves of Figures 1 and 2 share the property of being close to straight the curves, this positive curvature cannot be ignored. We fitted a straight line to the curves and then used a chi-square test to judge the closeness of fit of this straight line to the data. For each curve the chi-square test demonstrated a significant discrepancy between the model and the data. For example, the significance level was 15 standard deviations for the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English ( LCDE ) [24]. In order to find a satisfactory model to explain this slight but consistently positive curvature, we study in more detail the process by which words gain new senses.
 has grown since its introduction into English from Old French in the 13th century. Its original meaning was a piece of cloth placed under a saddle. Over the centuries it gained many meanings, by extension of this original sense, which can be grouped together in the following concept: (C1) an often rectangular-shaped part of a surface (of a wall, fence, cloth, etc.), during the 14th century panel also gained the following meaning: piece of parchment (attached to a writ) on which names of jurors were written (hence by metonymy) list of jurymen: jury (Onions 1966). Four of the meanings of panel listed in the LDCE can be considered to be covered by the following general concept: (C2) a group of people (or the list of their names) brought together to answer 1. a side of a tower block 2. a school disciplinary committee then these would be by association with the two concepts listed above, (C1) and (C2), respectively. Note that neither of these potential new meanings would constitute a truly new concept, since they can be considered to be covered by the existing concepts (C1) and (C2).
 3. a wall which divides a large room into smaller units but which does not 4. a combined table and bench that can be used, for example, by a panel of by association with concepts (C1) and (C2), respectively, then these new meanings could be considered as corresponding to new concepts. These meanings are sufficiently different from the existing meanings listed in the LCDE that they themselves could give rise to further new meanings by metonymy, metaphor, etc., which would simply not be possible by direct association with the existing meanings. For example, the following meanings could theoretically be derived from the meanings 3 and 4, respectively, above (but not directly from concepts (C1) and (C2), respectively): 5. any division of something into smaller units 6. a combined desk and bench for a single person 234 eight meanings listed in Le petit Robert [21], which we can translate and paraphrase as follows: 1. a small piece of cloth (from toile =  X  X iece of cloth X ) and, in particular, one 2. a membrane used by butchers to wrap up certain pieces of meat 3. clothes, jewelry, comb, etc. (objects necessary to prepare one X  X  appearance 4. the action of combing, making up, dressing 5. a woman X  X  style of dressing 6. the cleaning of one X  X  body before dressing 7. a washroom, toilet 8. the cleaning, preparation of an object, text, etc.

We can group these meanings into three concepts: (D1) a small piece of material (meanings 1, 2) (D2) the objects used for, the action of or the style of dressing, making-up, (D3) a washroom, toilet (meaning 7)
We have grouped meanings together in this way because we consider it likely that new meanings for toilette which could enter the French language by association with an existing meaning would be very similar for those meanings grouped into the same concept, but very different for those corresponding to different concepts. Definition
Two meanings of a given word correspond to the same concept if and only if they could inspire the same new meanings by association.

We suggest grouping together different senses of a word, not only according to their parts of speech or to their etymology (i.e., the history) of word senses, but also according to their potential future: whether or not they could inspire the same new meanings by association. This can be compared with the biological definition of species in terms of the ability to breed together to produce viable offspring rather than in terms of history or physical characteristics. 5. A Mathematical Model of Word Sense Genesis
This section describes a stochastic model of the creation of word senses. This model not only explains the near-exponential rule but also provides a deeper insight into the process of naming. Let L D be a language as defined by the set of word, sense pairs in a dictionary D . We consider the evolution of the language L bear in mind that L D is, of course, only an approximate representation of the semantics of the corresponding natural language. For example, the compiler of a dictionary may choose to include archaic words as a historical record or to exclude whole categories of words such as slang or technical terms.
 word (by creation, borrowing, word-formation, or any other mechanism), or (c) the addition of a new sense for an existing word (by association with an existing sense).
Let t be the probability of a step of type (a), u the probability of a step of type (b), and v the probability of a step of type (c). Note that t + u + v = 1. The parameters of our model t , u , v are unknowns which will be estimated from the observed values of N number of words with s senses).
 1. New-word single-sense assumption: When a neologism enters the 2. Independence of obsolescence and number of senses: The probability it we require two editions of the same dictionary. The 1994 edition of the Dictionnaire
Less than 17% of these words are polysemic. Furthermore, this corresponds, according to our model and to within-sample error, to the proportion of originally monosemic period between the publication of the two editions. Assumption 2 above is not as important as assumption 1, since later we restrict ourselves to a no-obsolescence model.
 may correspond to a number c of essentially distinct concepts, where c is some number between one and s . For example, the plumbing and anatomy senses of joint correspond to the same concept, since they could inspire the same new senses by association. The  X  X igarette containing cannabis X  sense of joint clearly corresponds to a different concept, inspired by distinct concepts are assumed to occur independently. We assume that a word with s senses in L D represents on average 1 +  X  ( s concept creation factor (since, in a no-obsolescence model,  X  is simply the probability that a new sense for a word w can be considered a new concept compared to the existing senses for w ). We can now state a third assumption: 3. Associations are with concepts: The probability that a concept gives rise
The concept creation factor  X  is another unknown which will be estimated from the values of N s . 236 tractable: 4. Stationary-state hypothesis: L D considered as a stochastic process is in a 1993 editions of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ( SOED ) [32, 28]. In the space of 60 years, the number of words in the SOED increased by 24%. Nevertheless the values The corresponding values of N s are given in Table 1.
 on which our model is based are given in a later section, so as not to clutter up the presentation of the model in this section.
 constant.
 the process is  X  t + (1  X  t ) = 1  X  2 t , since the probability that a word sense is lost by obsolescence is t and the probability that a word sense is gained is 1 expected net increase in the number of words in L D during one step of the process, then we must have 1  X  2 t r = m ,since m is a constant. Thus Note that the number of words in L D would be constant if and only if t = 0 . 5. awordwith s senses loses one of its senses by obsolescence. Let p probability that the next change in L D is that a word with s senses gains a new sense.
Denote the expected net increase in N s by  X  s = dP ( s ), for some constant d . We then have the number of words is r .Thus  X  s = rP ( s ) = (1  X  2 t ) P ( s ) / m (by equation (2)). p ( s )and p out ( s ), which gives the following equation: since N s is decremented when a word with s senses gains or loses a sense and N incremented when a word with s  X  1 senses gains a sense or a word with s + 1 senses loses a sense.
 it follows directly that p out ( s ) is proportional to sP ( s ). Let p constant K . Then, since  X  s = 1 p out ( s ) = t , we have t = (1). Thus K = t / m and
Under the assumption that associations are with concepts, p 1 +  X  ( s  X  1) and P ( s ). Suppose that p in ( s ) = K P ( s )(1 +  X  ( s v ,  X  s = 1 P ( s ) = 1, and  X  s = 1 sP ( s ) = m , we have v =
K (1  X   X  ) + K  X  m .Thus K = v / (1  X   X  +  X  m ), and hence, for s = 1, 2, ...
Note that the creation of a new word with a single sense is a special case. By definition of u as the probability that the next step of the process is the creation of a new word,
Summing equation (3), for s = 1, 2, ... ,gives
Thus and, since by definition v = 1  X  t  X  u , simplification, for s &gt; 1: 238 s = 1 P ( s ) = 1and m hence is omitted: Proposition m seem to have any theoretical foundation, and since the observed values of P ( s )didnot, in fact, follow a perfectly exponential distribution, we decided to estimate the values of the parameters m ,  X  ,and t which would best explain the actual near-exponential distributions. We first set m =  X  s = 1 sP obs ( s ), where P
P ( s ) calculated from the values of N s . Then we calculated the values of  X  and t which minimized the sum of the squares of the errors in equation (5). For six out of the ten dictionaries tested, the best-fit value occurred when t = 0. The average of the best-fit dictionaries in order to obtain an alternative estimate of t . We discovered that while hundreds or even thousands of words were added between two different editions of the same dictionary [32, 28], very few words were removed due to obsolescence. For example, the number of words in the Dictionnaire de l X  X cad  X  emie Fran  X  caise [9] increased by 28% in 59 years, whereas the total number of word senses marked as obsolete in the latest edition is less than 1%. Our conclusion is that the English and French languages, as defined by dictionaries, are in a state of continual expansion, with an almost negligible loss of word senses by obsolescence.
 result follows immediately from equation (4) by setting t = 0: Proposition
When t = 0, the probability that the next addition to L D u = 1 / m .
 Theorem
When assumptions 1, 2, 3 and 4 hold and furthermore L D is subject to no obsolescence, then the probability that an arbitrary word in L D has s senses is given by Proof When t = 0, equation (5) becomes, for s &gt; 1
Summing equation (7) for s = 2, 3, ... ,gives since  X  s = 1 P ( s ) = 1,  X  s = 2 P ( s ) = 1  X  P (1),  X  m  X  P (1). Solving for P (1) gives
The closed-form solution for P ( s ) in the statement of the theorem then follows by an easy induction using equation (7). 6. Applying the Model to Experimental Data We make the no-obsolescence assumption throughout this section, that is, that t = 0.
Knowing that u = 1 / m allows us to estimate that, in French, approximately 60% of new word senses correspond to the creation of a new word and approximately 40% to the introduction of a new sense for an existing word. In English the split is approximately 50-50. There are, however, quite large variations (between 55% and 65% in French) depending on the dictionary consulted. Variations are inevitable, since different lexi-cographers have different interpretations of what constitutes distinct senses of a word.
We conjecture that similar percentages exist for all natural languages, although there will be variations among languages depending, among other things, on the ease with which new words can be created.
 curvature. This curvature can be explained by the fact that  X &gt; 0. Note that, under the assumption t = 0, the concept creation factor  X  is simply the probability that a new sense for an existing word is sufficiently different from previous senses for it to correspond to a new concept (capable of inspiring associations different from those that could be inspired by the existing senses). When  X  = t = 0, it follows from the results proved in log N s against s does indeed have a positive curvature.
 of N s , we generated the values of N s using equation (6) for various values of  X  .The results are plotted in Figure 6 (with the average number m of meanings per word set to be the same as that for the LDCE [24] in order to provide a concrete comparison). The observed values of N s (for the LDCE ) coincide so closely with those predicted by our model with  X  = 0 . 31 that the curves of observed and predicted values would be barely distinguishable if drawn in the same figure.
 best fit, in a least squares sense, between the observed values of N from the values of P ( s ) given by equation (6). These best-fit values of  X  are given in the second column of Table 2 for each dictionary we examined. The values of  X  vary between 0.22 and 0.41 for the English dictionaries and between 0.28 and 0.47 for the dictionary are ambiguous in the sense that they require more than one definition, only approximately one-third of this ambiguity corresponds to ambiguity in the underlying concept (as defined in section 4). 240 on the number of divisions into different senses the lexicographer chooses to list for each word. We can nevertheless calculate the average number of concepts per word in a dictionary. This number should be more independent of lexicographic choices. c = 1 +  X  ( m  X  1), for each of the dictionaries studied. The average number of concepts per word is not the same, even for dictionaries of the same language. Variations are to be expected as a result of different lexicographical choices of which words and senses to include in the dictionary. We can note, in particular, that technical terms do not have the same distribution of number of senses per word as everyday words. Furthermore, many derived words do not have their own entries but are simply listed at the end of the entry for the root word. For example, in the LDCE [24], solidly and solidness have no senses listed and were hence ignored in our study, even though solid has 15 senses in the same dictionary.
 for English dictionaries and a little less for French dictionaries. 7. Further Experiments to Validate the Model
As with any scientific theory, if our theory is correct, we should be able to put it to the test by means of experiment. Playing the devil X  X  advocate, we invented several exper-iments which, if unsuccessful, would demonstrate the invalidity of our mathematical model.
 out of the ten dictionaries tested, the  X  2 value was less than  X  should be exceeded in only 10% of random trials). In the one remaining case,  X  that the difference between the observed and predicted values of N distributed random variable with mean zero (Hoel 1984). It is interesting to note that the difference between the observed values of N s and those predicted by our model with  X  = 0 (corresponding to the hypothesis that associations are with words) or  X  = 1 (corresponding to the hypothesis that associations are with senses) are both statistically highly significant (at levels of 15 and 28 standard deviations, respectively, in the case of the LCDE [24]).
 generation of a dictionary using the stochastic process model described in section 5.
We used a random number generator to decide whether the next step should be the creation of a new word or the creation of a new sense for an existing word. Figure 7 is a graphical summary of one such simulation, for the particular values m = 0 . 6, t = 0, and words generated. After the generation of only 1,000 senses (which corresponds to less 242 can deduce that a steady state has been attained long before the simulation generates a dictionary of size comparable to those studied (several tens of thousands of senses). reasonable size, simply a mathematical consequence of our other assumptions. sponding to a word with s senses is 1 +  X  ( s  X  1), we tested a more general linear model b +  X  ( s  X  1) for a constant b . The best-fit values of b for each dictionary were all found to be between 0.98 and 1.08, thus confirming our assumption b = 1.
 through obsolescence contrasts with the fact that 22% of the words in the Oxford English
Dictionary ( OED ) [30] are marked as obsolete. Nevalainen (1999) points out that many of these obsolete words were abortive attempts by pre-17th-century writers to introduce new words which simply never caught on. Garner (1982) attributes 1,700 neologisms to
Shakespeare alone. Before the publication of the first monolingual English dictionaries in the early 17th century, both vocabulary and spelling were more a matter of personal taste than convention. Standardization occurred only after the publication of Samuel
Johnson X  X  dictionary [8] in the 18th century. We should mention in passing that the very exhaustiveness of the OED makes it completely unsuitable (in the present context) as an accurate representation of the English language, since 90% of the senses listed are unknown to the majority of educated native English speakers (Winchester 2003). Thus our model cannot be expected to provide a faithful prediction of the evolution of the
OED , since we assume that the set of word senses in a dictionary is an approximation attempting to list all English words ever used, most dictionaries aim simply to list a lifetime, which is more in keeping with the assumptions of our model. Not surprisingly, therefore, fitting our model to values of N s obtained from the OED gave incoherent values of the parameters (  X  = 1 . 51 when, by assumption, we should have 0 We obtained a similar anomalous best-fit value  X  = 1 . 16 for Webster X  X  Third International Dictionary [34], no doubt because this dictionary is again so exhaustive.
 dictionaries [1, 7, 10, 17], plotted in Figure 3, to explain why these do not fit our model.
The number of translations of a French word w in English slang [17] is related to the number of synonyms of w [10], since they both concern the onomasiological question converse of the semasiological question of the development of different meanings of a given word, which is the problem our model addresses.
 the question of the distribution of homographs in a language, since abbreviations and acronyms almost invariably obtain new meanings by coincidence rather than by association with existing meanings. For example, the  X  X emperature X  and  X  X emporary X  meanings of the abbreviation temp were clearly not derived by some direct semantic association between the notions of temperature and temporary (as would be required by our model).
 on the other hand, be partly explained by our model. The reason that the distribution of these types of terms is so far from satisfying the near-exponential rule is simply that 75% of the terms listed in scientific and technical dictionaries are composed of at least two words. When we count only single-word entries (as we did for all dictionaries in
Figures 1 and 2), we obtain a distribution which can be explained by our model. We and technical dictionary we examined [1] was much less than for English dictionaries of everyday language [19, 24, 28, 31, 32] (1.35 compared to 2.0), the number of concepts per word was approximately the same at 1.32.
 monolingual Basque dictionaries [14, 15, 16]. Basque is a well-known language isolate. curvature, and the values of N s predicted by our model provided a very good fit to the observed values of N s . The corresponding values of m ,  X  ,and c are given in Table 3. The number of concepts per word was approximately 1.2 for all three dictionaries. have chosen the pragmatically simple definition that the words of a language can be ap-proximated by those sequences of characters without spaces whose meanings are listed in a given dictionary. Applying this definition to a German monolingual dictionary [13], we observed the usual near-exponential distribution in N s parameters of our model were m = 1 . 20,  X  = 0 . 80, and c = 1 . 16. The average number of meanings per word m and the average number of concepts per word c are low, no doubt because many specialized terms which are expressed by a sequence of words in other languages count, according to our definition, as a single word in German. Further research is required to test our model on other languages with complex morphology. identical for the five English dictionaries tested (see Table 2). However, we found that this was not always the case, since further trials on six other English dictionaries gave a larger range of values, shown in Table 4, varying from 1.23 to 1.55.
 244 8. Relevance to Computational Linguistics group word senses into distinct concepts (as defined in section 4) has been successful.
The number NW i of words representing i concepts should demonstrate a distribution with  X  close to one, whereas the number NC j of concepts covering j dictionary meanings should demonstrate a distribution with  X  close to zero (i.e., an exponential distribution, as illustrated in Figure 6). Such a grouping of word senses into concepts is clearly useful not only in computer models of natural languages, but also in lexicography and histor-ical linguistics. In lexicography, different rules have been proposed for identifying pol-ysemy, based on etymology, statistical analysis of colocations in corpora, the existence of different synonyms (such as present X  X ow , present X  X ift ), antonyms ( right X  X rong , right X  left ), or paronyms ( race X  X acing , race X  X acist ), and the existence of ambiguous questions (such as the canine/male ambiguity of the word dog brought out by the question  X  X s it a dog? X ) (Robins 1987; Ayto 1983; Cruse 1986). In the context of computational linguistics,
Mihalcea and Moldovan (2001) relaxed these rules in order to find a more coarse-grained representation in WordNet, by grouping meanings based on similar synsets together with the existence of a common hypernym, antonym, or pertainym. The pos-sible translations of a word w into several foreign languages is another useful practical tool for the grouping of the meanings of w into concepts (Resnik and Yarowsky 2000). senses S 1 , S 2 of a word w could give rise to the same new senses for w by metaphor, metonymy, etc. The grouping of meanings into the corresponding equivalence classes could be an essential part of an automatic system for the interpretation of nonstandard uses of words. Words are often used with a meaning which is not explicitly listed in a dictionary. Metaphor and metonymy are obvious examples, but we can also mention meanings which are too specialized or too new to be listed in a general-purpose dictio-nary (such as the Internet meanings of the words provider , home ,and portal , for example). of a dictionary whose aim is exhaustiveness. The OED [30] and Webster X  X  [34] are curvature indicates a general-purpose dictionary whose aim is to list those words and meanings that an educated person can reasonably be expected to encounter during his or her lifetime. Machine-readable dictionaries play an important role in many natural-applications, an exhaustive dictionary is inappropriate. Finding the best-fit value of the concept creation factor  X  has allowed us to identify such dictionaries. Our model could also be used to estimate performance characteristics of systems which use machine-readable dictionaries, since we have given a formula for the expected number of words with s senses. For example, this might help us judge which is the best data structure to use to store a dictionary.
 near-exponential rule (with a slightly positive curvature when plotted on a logarithmic scale) for the number of words N s with s dictionary meanings. This provides an insight into language in general rather than any one language in particular. Our mathematical rule. Various mathematical models of the evolution of networks have been proposed small-worlds property of semantic nets (Gaume et al. 2002). It is worth pointing out that Price X  X  (1976) classical model for the number of journal articles with s citations is mathematically identical to our predicted value of N s if we set  X  = 1. Since our model is a strict generalization of Price X  X  model, it may find applications, both within and beyond the frontiers of linguistics, as a more general model for the prediction of network growth (Newman 2003). 9. Conclusion
Empirical evidence indicates that the number of senses per word in a dictionary has an approximately exponential distribution. We have shown that a stochastic model of historical semantics not only can explain this near-exponential phenomenon but can also use the distance from an exponential distribution to estimate the average number of distinct concepts per word as well as the concept creation factor (the percentage of new senses for existing words which can be considered genuinely new concepts). distinguishing among different parts of speech, distinguishing between everyday and technical terms, or introducing the extra parameter word-frequency. The introduction to the OED states that prepositions generally have more senses than verbs and adjectives, which in turn have more senses than nouns. Pagel (2000) emphasizes the fact that the evolution of language is not identical for all words. Fundamental vocabulary, including (Swadesh 1952). Zipf (1949) was the first to notice a correlation between word frequency and number of senses listed in a dictionary, in the form of a hyperbolic distribution. This can be summarized by saying that a word with frequency rank r has on average twice as many meanings as a word with frequency rank 10 r . A sophisticated stochastic model along the lines of the one presented in this article but taking into account frequency word. Unfortunately this is beyond the scope of this preliminary article, whose aim is simply to show that a simple stochastic model (based on grouping senses into distinct concepts liable to give rise to different new senses) can explain a universal property of monolingual dictionaries.
 using statistical analysis of dictionaries to model synonymy rather than (or as well as) polysemy. Indeed, it is an open question whether a similar approach to that followed in this work can be used to group together senses of different words which correspond to the same concept.
