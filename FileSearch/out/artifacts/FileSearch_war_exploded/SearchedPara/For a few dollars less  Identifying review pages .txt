 Shoppers are migrating to the web and online re-views are playing a critical role in affecting their shopping decisions, online and offline. According to two surveys published by comScore (2007) and Horrigan (2008), 81% of web users have done on-line research on a product at least once. Among readers of online reviews, more than 70% reported that the reviews had a significant influence on their purchases. Realizing this economic potential, search engines have been scrambling to cater to such user needs in innovative ways. For example, in response to a product-related query, a search engine might want to surface only review pages, perhaps via a  X  X il-ter by X  option, to the user. More ambitiously, they might want to dissect the reviews, segregate them into novice and expert judgments, distill sentiments, and present an aggregated  X  X isdom of the crowds X  opinion to the user. Identifying review pages is the indispensable enabler to fulfill any such ambition; nonetheless, this problem does not seem to have been addressed at web scale before.

Detecting review webpages in a few, review-only websites is an easy, manually-doable task. A large fraction of the interesting review content, however, is present on pages outside such websites. This is where the task becomes challenging. Review pages might constitute a minority and can be buried in a multitude of ways among non-review pages  X  for instance, the movie review pages in nytimes. com , which are scattered among all news articles, or the product review pages in amazon.com , which are accessible from the product description page. An automatic and scalable method to identify reviews is thus a practical necessity for the next-generation search engines. The problem is actually more gen-eral than detecting reviews: it applies to detecting any  X  X orizontal X  category such as buying guides, fo-rums, discussion boards, FAQs, etc.

Given the nature of these problems, it is tempt-ing to use supervised classification. A formidable barrier is the labeling task itself since human la-bels need time and money. On the other hand, it is easier to generate an enormous number of low-quality labeled examples through purely automatic methods. This prompts the question: Can we do re-view detection by focusing just on the textual con-tent of a large number of automatically obtained but low-quality labeled examples, perhaps also utilizing the site structure specific to each website? And how will it compare to the best supervised classification method? We address these questions in this paper. Main contributions. We propose the first end-to-end method that can operate at web scale to effi-ciently detect review pages. Our method is based on using simple URL-based clues to automatically partition a large collection of webpages into two noisy classes: One that consists mostly of review webpages and another that consists of a mixture of some review but predominantly non-review web-pages (more details in Section 4.2).

We analyze the use of a naive Bayes classifier in this noisy setting and present a simple algorithm for review page classification. We further enhance the performance of this classifier by incorporating infor-mation about the structure of the website that is man-ifested through the URLs of the webpages. We do this by partitioning the website into clusters of web-pages, where the clustering delicately balances the information in the site-unaware labels provided by the classifier in the previous step and the site struc-ture encoded in the URL tokens; a decision tree is used to accomplish this. Our classification method for noisily-labeled examples and the use of site-specific cues to improve upon a site-independent classifier are general techniques that may be appli-cable in other large-scale web analyses.

Experiments on 2000 hand-labeled webpages from 40 websites of varying sizes show that besides being computationally efficient, our human-label-free method not only outperforms those based on off-the-shelf subjectivity detection but also remains competitive against the state-of-the-art supervised text classification that relies on editorial labels. The related work falls into roughly four categories: Document-and sentence-level subjectivity detec-tion, sentiment analysis in the context of reviews, learning from noisy labeled examples, and exploit-ing site structure for classification.

Given the subjective nature of reviews, document-level subjectivity classification is closely related to our work. There have been a number of approaches proposed to address document-level subjectivity in news articles, weblogs, etc. (Yu and Hatzivas-siloglou, 2003; Wiebe et al., 2004; Finn and Kush-merick, 2006; Ni et al., 2007; Stepinski and Mit-tal, 2007). Ng et al. (2006) experiment with review identification for known domains using datasets with clean labels (e.g., movie reviews vs. movie-related non-reviews), a setting different from that of ours. Pang and Lee (2008b) present a method on re-ranking documents that are web search results for a specific query (containing the word review ) based on the subjective/objective distinction. Given the na-ture of the query, they implicitly detect reviews from unknown sources. But their re-ranking algorithm only applies to webpages known to be (roughly) re-lated to the same narrow subject. Since the web-pages in our datasets cover not only a diverse range of websites but also a diverse range of topics, their approach does not apply. To the best of our knowl-edge, there has been no work on identifying review pages at the scale and diversity we consider.
Subjectivity classification of within-document items, such as terms, has been an active line of re-search (Wiebe et al. (2004) present a survey). Iden-tifying subjective sentences in a document via off-the-shelf packages is an alternative way of detect-ing reviews without (additional) human annotations. In particular, the OpinionFinder system (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) is a state-of-the-art knowledge-rich sentiment-analysis system. We will use it as one of our baselines and compare its performance with our methods.

There has been a great deal of previous work in sentiment analysis that worked with reviews, but they were typically restricted to using reviews ex-tracted from one or two well-known sources, by-passing automatic review detection. Examples of such early work include (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). See Pang and Lee (2008a) for a more comprehensive survey. Building a collection of diverse review webpages, not limited to one or two hosts, can better facilitate such research.
Learning from noisy examples has been studied for a long time in the learning theory community (Angluin and Laird, 1988). Learning naive Bayes classifiers from noisy data (either features or labels or both) was studied by Yang et al. (2003). Their focus, however, is to reconstruct the underlying con-ditional probability distributions from the observed noisy dataset. We, on the other hand, rely on the vol-ume of labels to drown the noise. Along this spirit, Snow et al. (2008) show that obtaining multiple low-quality labels (through Mechanical Turk) can ap-proach high-quality editorial labels. Unlike in their setting, we do not have multiple low-quality labels for the same URL. The extensive body of work in semi-supervised learning or learning from one class is also somewhat relevant to our work. A major dif-ference is that they tend to work with small amount of clean, labeled data. In addition, many semi-supervised/transductive learning algorithms are not efficient for web-scale data.

Using site structure for web analysis tasks has been addressed in a variety of contexts. For ex-ample, Kening et al. (2005) exploit the structure of a website to improve classification. On a re-lated note, co-training has also been used to utilize inter-page link information in addition to intra-page textual content: Blum and Mitchell (1998) use an-chor texts pointing to a webpage as the alternative  X  X iew X  of the page in the context of webpage clas-sification. Their algorithm is largely site-unaware in that it does not explicitly exploit site structures. Utilizing site structures also has remote connections to wrapper induction, and there is extensive litera-ture on this topic. Unfortunately, the methods in all of these work require human labeling, which is pre-cisely what our work is trying to circumvent. In this section we describe our basic methodology for identifying review pages. Our method consists of two main steps. The first is to use a large amount of noisy training examples to learn a basic classifier for review webpages; we adapt a simple naive Bayes classifier for this purpose. The second is to improve the performance of this basic classifier by exploiting the website structure; we use a decision tree for this.
Let P be the set of all webpages. Let C + denote the positive class, i.e., the set of all review pages and let C  X  denote the negative class, i.e., the set of all non-review pages. Each webpage p is exactly in one of
C + or C  X  , and is labeled +1 or  X  1 respectively. 3.1 Learning from large amounts of noisy data Previous work using supervised or semi-supervised learning approaches for sentiment analysis assumes relatively high-quality labels that are produced ei-ther via human annotation or automatically gener-ated through highly accurate rules (e.g., assigning positive or negative label to a review according to automatically extracted star ratings).

We examine a different scenario where we can au-tomatically generate large amount of relatively low-quality labels. Section 4.2 describes the process in more detail, but briefly, in a collection of pages crawled from sites that are very likely to host re-views, those with the word review in their URLs are very likely to contain reviews (the noisy posi-tive set e C + ) and the rest of the pages on those sites are less likely to contain reviews (the more noisy negative set e C  X  ). More formally, for a webpage p , suppose Pr[ p  X  C + | p  X  e C + ] =  X  and Pr[ p  X  C Can we still learn something useful from e C + and e C  X  despite the labels being highly noisy?
The following analysis is based on a naive Bayes classifier. We chose naive Bayes classifier since the learning phase can easily be parallelized.

Given a webpage (or a document) p represented as a bag of features { f i } , we wish to assign a class arg max Bayes classifiers assume f i  X  X  to be conditionally in-dependent and we have Pr[ p | c ] = Let r i = Pr[ f i | C + ] / Pr[ f i | C  X  ] denote the con-tribution of each feature towards classification, and rc = Pr[ C ors. First note that A webpage p receives label +1 iff Pr[ C + | p ] &gt; Pr[ C  X  | p ] , and by above, if and only if  X  log rc .
 When we do not have a reasonable estimate of Pr[ C can do is to assume rc = 1 . In this case, p receives label +1 if and only if f i with log r i &gt; wards p being labeled +1 ; call f i to be a  X  X ositive X  feature. Typically we use relative-frequency estima-tion of Pr[ c ] and Pr[ f i | c ] for c  X  X  C + ,C  X  } . Now, how does the estimation from a dataset with noisy labels compare with the estimation from a dataset with clean labels? To examine this, we calculate the following: tonic but not linear in r i . Furthermore, it is bounded: (1  X   X  ) / (1  X   X  )  X   X  r r i &gt; 1  X  X  X   X r i + (1  X   X  ) &gt; X r i + (1  X   X  ) the last step used  X &gt; X  . Thus, the sign of log  X  r i is the same as that of log r i , i.e., a feature contribut-ing positively to positively to torted) and vice versa.

The above analysis motivates an alternative model to naive Bayes. Instead of each feature f i placing a weighted vote log  X  r i in the final decision, we trust only the sign of log  X  r i , and let each feature f i place a vote for the class C + (respectively, C  X  ) if log  X  r i (respectively, log  X  r i &lt; 0 ). Intuitively, this model just compares the number of  X  X ositive X  features and the number of  X  X egative X  features, ignoring the mag-nitude (since it is distorted anyway). This is pre-cisely our algorithm: For a given threshold  X  , the final label nbu  X  ( p ) of a webpage p is given by where sgn is the sign function. For comparison purposes, we also indicate the  X  X eighted X  version: If  X  = 0 , we omit  X  and use nb to denote a generic label assigned by any of the above algorithms.
Note that even though our discussions were for two-class and in particular, review classification, they are equally applicable to a wide range of clas-sification tasks in large-scale web-content analysis. Our analysis of learning from automatically gener-ated noisy examples is thus of independent interest. 3.2 Utilizing site structure Can the structure of a website be exploited to im-prove the classification of webpages given by nb (  X  ) ? While not all websites are well-organized, quite a number of them exhibit certain structure that makes it possible to identify large subsites that contain only review pages. Typically but not always this structure is manifested through the tokens in the URL corre-sponding to the webpage. For instance, the pattern http://www.zagat.com/verticals/ PropertyDetails.aspx?VID=a&amp;R=b , where a,b are numbers, is indicative of all webpages in zagat.com that are reviews of restaurants. In fact, we can think of this as a generalization of having the keyword review in the URL. Now, suppose we have an initial labeling nb ( p )  X  X  X  1 } for each webpage p produced by a classifier (as in the previous section, or one that is trained on a small set of human annotated pages), can we further improve the labeling using the pattern in the URL structure?
It is not immediate how to best use the URL structure to identify the review subsites. First, URLs contain irrelevant information (e.g., the to-ken verticals in the above example), thus clus-tering by simple cosine similarity may not dis-cover the review subsites. Second, the subsite may not correspond to a subtree in the URL hi-erarchy, i.e., it is not reasonable to expect all the review URLs to share a common prefix.
 Third, the URLs contain a mixture of path com-ponents (e.g., www.zagat.com/verticals/ PropertyDetails.aspx ) and key-value pairs (e.g., VID=a and R=b ) and hence each token (re-gardless of its position) in the URL could play a role in determining the review subsite. Furthermore, conjunction of presence/absence of certain tokens in the URL may best correspond to subsite member-ship. In light of these, we represent each URL (and hence the corresponding webpage) by a bag { g i } of tokens obtained from the URL. We perform a crude form of feature selection by dropping tokens that are either ubiquitous (occurring in more than 99% of URLs) or infrequent (occurring in fewer than 1% of URLs) in a website; neither yields useful infor-mation.

Our overall approach will be to use g i  X  X  to par-tition P into clusters { C i } of webpages such that each cluster C i is predominantly labeled as either review or non-review by nb (  X  ) . This automati-cally yields a new label cls ( p ) for each page p , which is the majority label of the cluster of p : where C ( p ) is the cluster of p . To this end, we use a decision tree classifier to build the clusters. This classifier will use the features { g i } and the target la-bels nb (  X  ) . The classifier is trained on all the web-pages in the website and in the obtained decision tree, each leaf, consisting of pages with the same set of feature values leading down the path, corre-sponds to a cluster of webpages. Note that the clus-ters delicately balance the information in the site-unaware labels nb (  X  ) and the site structure encoded in the URLs (given by g i  X  X ). Thus the label cls ( p ) can be thought of as a smoothed version of nb ( p ) .
Even though we can expect most clusters to be ho-mogeneous (i.e., pure reviews or non-reviews), the above method can produce clusters that are inher-ently heterogeneous. This can happen if the web-site URLs are organized such that many subsites contain both review and non-review webpages. To take this into account, we propose the following hybrid approach that interpolates between the un-smoothed labels given by nb (  X  ) and the smoothed labels given by cls (  X  ) . For a cluster C i , the dis-crepancy disc ( C i ) = quantity measures the number of disagreements be-tween the majority label cls ( p ) and the original label nb ( p ) for each page p in the cluster. The decision tree guarantees disc ( C i )  X | C i | / 2 . We call a cluster C i to be  X  -homogeneous if disc ( C i  X   X  [0 , 1 / 2 ] . For a fixed  X  , the hybrid label of a web-page p is given by hyb Note that hyb
Note that in the above discussions, any clustering method that can incorporate the site-unaware labels nb (  X  ) and the site-specific tokens in g i  X  X  could have been used; off-the-shelf decision tree was merely a specific way to realize this. It is crucial for this study to create a dataset that is representative of a diverse range of websites that host reviews over different topics in different styles. We are not aware of any extensive index of online review websites and we do not want to restrict our study to a few well-known review aggregation web-sites (such as yelp.com or zagat.com ) since this will not represent the less popular and more spe-cialized ones. Instead, we utilized user-generated tags for webpages, available on social bookmarking websites such as del.icio.us .

We obtained (a sample of) a snapshot of URL X  X ag pairs from del.icio.us . We took the top one thousand sites with review * tags; these websites hopefully represent a broad coverage. We were able to crawl over nine hundred of these sites and the re-sulting collection of webpages served as the basis of the experiments in this paper. We refer to these websites (or the webpages from these sites, when it is clear from the context) as S all . 4.1 Gold-standard test set When the websites are as diverse as represented in S all , there is no perfect automatic way to generate the ground truth labels. Thus we sampled a number of pages for human labeling as follows.
 First, we set aside 40 sites as the test sites ( S 40 ). In order to represent different types of websites (to the best we can), we sampled the 40 sites so that S 40 covers different size ranges, since large-scale web-sites and small-scale websites are often quite dif-ferent in style, topic, and content. We uniformly sampled 10 sites from each of the four size cate-gories (roughly, sites with 100 X 5K, 5K X 25K, 25K X  100K, and 100K+ webpages) 1 . Indeed, S 40 (as did S all ) covered a wide range of topics (e.g., games, books, restaurants, movies, music, and electronics) and styles (e.g., dedicated review sites, product sites that include user reviews, newspapers with movie re-view sections, religious sites hosting book reviews, and non-English review sites).

We then sampled 50 pages to be labeled from each site in S 40 . Since there are some fairly large sites that have only a small number of review pages, a uniform sampling may yield no review webpages from those sites. To reflect the natural distribu-tion on a website and to represent pages from both classes, the webpages were sampled in the follow-ing way. For each website in S 40 , 25 pages were uniformly sampled (representing the natural distri-bution) and 25 pages were sampled from among  X  X quivalence classes X  based on URLs so that pages from each major URL pattern were represented. Here, each webpage in the site is represented by a URL signature containing the most frequent tokens that occur in the URLs in that site and all pages with the same signature form an equivalence class.
For our purposes, a webpage is considered a re-view if it contains significant amount of textual in-formation expressing subjective opinions on or per-sonal experiences with a given product / service. When in doubt, the guiding principle is whether a page can be a satisfactory result page for users searching for reviews. More specifically, the human annotation labeled each webpage, after thoroughly examining the content, with one of the following seven intuitive labels:  X  X ingle X  (contains exactly one review),  X  X ultiple X  (concatenation of more than one review),  X  X o X  (clearly not a review page),  X  X mpty X  (looks like a page that could contain reviews but had none),  X  X ogin X  (a valid user login needed to look at the content),  X  X ub X  (a pointer to one or more review pages), and  X  X mbiguous X  (border-line case, e.g., a webpage with a one line review). The first two labels were treated as +1 (i.e., reviews) and the last five la-bels were treated as  X  1 (i.e., non-reviews). Out of the 2000 pages, we obtained 578 pages labeled +1 and the 1422 pages labeled  X  1 . On a pilot study us-ing two human judges, we obtained 78% inter-judge agreement for the seven labels and 92% inter-judge agreement if we collapse the labels to  X  1 . Percent-ages of reviews in our samples from different sites range from 14.6% to 93.9%.
 Preprocessing for text-based analysis. We pro-cessed the crawled webpages using lynx to ex-tract the text content. To discard templated content, which is an annoying issue in large-scale web pro-cessing, and HTML artifacts, we used the following preprocessing. First, the HTML tags &lt;p&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, &lt;/tr&gt;, and &lt;/td&gt; were interpreted as paragraph breaks, the  X . X  inside a paragraph was interpreted as a sentence break, and whitespace was used to tok-enize words in a sentence. A sentence is considered  X  X ood X  if it has at least seven alphabetic words and a paragraph is considered  X  X ood X  if it has at least two good sentences. After extracting the text us-ing lynx , only the good paragraphs were retained. This effectively removes most of the templated con-tent (e.g., navigational phrases) and retains most of the  X  X atural language X  texts. Because of this pre-processing, 485 pages out of 2000 turned out to be empty and these were discarded (human labels on 97% of these empty pages were  X  1 ). 4.2 Dataset with noisy labels As discussed in Section 3.1, our goal is to obtain a large noisy set of positive and negative labeled ex-amples. We obtained these labels for the webpages in the training sites, S rest , which is essentially S all S 40 . First, the URLs in S rest were tokenized using a unigram model based on an English dictionary; this is so that strings such as reviewoftheday are properly interpreted.
C + : To be labeled +1 , the path-component of the URL of the webpage has to contain the token review . Our assumption is that such pages are highly likely to be review pages. On a uniform sam-ple of 100 such pages in S all , 90% were found to be genuine reviews. Thus, we obtained a collection of webpages with slightly noisy positive labels.
C  X  : The rest of the pages in S rest were labeled  X  1 . Clearly this is a noisy negative set since not all pages containing reviews have review as part of their URLs (recall the example from zagat.com ); thus many pages in e C  X  can still be reviews.
While the negative labels in S rest are more noisy than the positive labels, we believe most of the non-review pages are in e C  X  , and as most websites con-tain a significant number of non-review pages, the percentage of reviews in e C  X  is smaller than that in e C + (the assumption  X   X  in Section 3.1).

We collected all the paragraphs (as defined ear-lier) from both e C + and e C  X  separately. We elim-inated duplicate paragraphs (this further mitigates the templates issue, especially for sites generated by content-management software), and trained a un-igram language model as in Section 3.1. The evaluations were conducted on the 1515 labeled (non-empty) pages in S 40 described in Section 4.1. We report the accuracy (acc.) as well as precision (prec.), recall (rec.), and f-measure (fmeas.) for C + . Trivial baselines. Out of the 1515 labeled pages, 565 were labeled +1 and 950 were labeled  X  1 . Ta-ble 1 summarizes the performance of baselines that always predict one of the classes and a baseline that randomly select a class according to the class dis-tribution S 40 . As we can see, the best accuracy is .63, the best f-measure is .54, and they cannot be achieved by the same baseline. Before present-ing the main results of our methods, we introduce a much stronger baseline that utilizes a knowledge-rich subjectivity detection package. 5.1 Using subjectivity detectors This baseline is motivated by the fact that reviews often contain extensive subjective content. There are many existing techniques that detect subjectivity in text. OpinionFinder ( http://www.cs.pitt. edu/mpqa/opinionfinderrelease/ ) is a well-known system that processes documents and automatically identifies subjective sentences in them. OpinionFinder uses two subjective sentence classifiers (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005). The first (denoted opf A ) focuses on yielding the highest accuracy; the second (denoted opf B ) optimizes precision at the expense of recall. The methods underlying OpinionFinder incorporate extensive tools from linguistics (including, speech activity verbs, psychological verbs, FrameNet verbs and adjectives with frame  X  X xperiencer X , among oth-ers) and machine learning. In terms of performance, previous work has shown that OpinionFinder is a challenging system to improve upon for review re-trieval (Pang and Lee, 2008b). Computationally, OpinionFinder is very expensive and hence unattrac-tive for large-scale webpage analysis (running Opin-ionFinder on 1515 pages took about five hours). Therefore, we also propose a light-weight subjectiv-ity detection mechanism called lwd , which counts the number of opinion words in each sentence in the text. The opinion words (5403 of them) were ob-tained from an existing subjectivity lexicon ( http: //www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa ).

We ran both opf A and opf B on the tokenized text (running them on raw HTML produced worse re-sults). Each sentence in the text was labeled subjec-tive or objective. We experimented with two ways to label a document using sentence-level subjectiv-ity labels. We labeled a document +1 if it contained at least k subjective sentences (denoted as opf where k&gt; 0 is the absolute threshold), or at least f fraction of its sentences were labeled subjective (denoted as opf tive threshold). We conducted exhaustive parameter search with both opf A and opf B . For instance, the performances of opf A as a function of the thresh-olds, both absolute and relative, is shown in Fig-ure 1. Table 2 summarizes the best performances of opf rows), in terms of accuracy and f-measure (bold-faced). Similarly, for lwd , we labeled a document +1 if at least k sentences have at least ` opin-ion words (denoted lwd ( k,` ) .) Table 2 once again shows the best performing parameters for both accu-racy and f-measure for lwd . Our results indicate that a simple method such as lwd can come very close to a sophisticated system such as opf 5.2 Main results As stated earlier, we do not have any prior knowl-edge about the value of  X  and hence have to work with  X  = 0 . To investigate the implications of this assumption, we study the performance of nbu  X  and nbw  X  as a function of  X  . The accuracy and f-measures are plotted in Figure 2. There are three conclusions that can be drawn from this study: (i) The peak values of accuracy and f-measure are com-parable for both nbu  X  and nbw  X  , (ii) at  X  = 0 , nbu is much better than nbw , in terms of both accuracy and f-measure, and (iii) the best performance of nbu  X  oc-curs at  X   X  0 . Given the difficulty of obtaining  X  if one were to use nbw  X  , the above conclusions vali-date our intuition and the algorithm in Section 3.1.
Table 3 shows the performance of the site-specific method outlined in Section 3.2. The clusters were generated using the unpruned J48 decision tree in Weka ( www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/ weka ). In our experiments, we set  X  = 1 / 3 as a natural choice for the hybrid method. As we see the performance of nbu is about 7% better than the best performance using a subjectivity-based method (in terms of accuracy). The performance of the smoothed labels (decision tree-based clustering) is comparable to that of nbu . However, the hybrid method hyb provement over nbu . Paired t-test over the accura-cies for these 40 sites shows both hyb to be statistically significantly better than the opf with best accuracy (with p&lt; 0 . 05 , p&lt; 0 . 005 , respectively), and hyb cantly better than nbu (with p&lt; 0 . 05 ). 5.3 Cross-validation on S While the main focus of our paper is to study how to detect reviews without human labels, we present cross validation results on S 40 as a compar-ison point. The goal of this experiment is to get a sense of the best possible accuracy and f-measure numbers using labeled data and the state-of-the-art method for text classification, namely, SVMs. In other words, the performance numbers obtained through SVMs and cross-validation can be thought of as realistic  X  X pper bounds X  on the performance of ( svmlight.joachims.org ) for this purpose.

The cross-validation experiment was conducted as follows. We split the data by site to simulate the more realistic setting where pages in the test set do not necessarily come from a known site. Each fold consisted of one site from each size category; thus, 36 of the 40 sites in S 40 were used for training and the remainder for testing. Over ten folds, the aver-age performance was: accuracy .795, precision .759, recall .658, and f-measure .705.

Thus our methods in Section 3 come reason-ably close to the  X  X pper bound X  given by SVMs and human-labeled data. In fact, while the su-pervised SVMs statistically significantly outperform nbu , they are statistically indistinguishable from hyb In this paper we proposed an automatic method to perform efficient and large-scale detection of re-views. Our method is based on two principles: Building a classifier from a large number of noisy labeled examples and using the site structure to im-prove the performance of this classifier. Extensive experiments suggest that our method is competitive against supervised learning methods that depend on expensive human labels. There are several interest-ing avenues for future research, including improv-ing the current method for exploiting the site struc-ture. On a separate note, previous research has ex-plicitly studied sentiment analysis as an application of transfer learning (Blitzer et al., 2007). Given the diverse range of topics present in our dataset, ad-dressing topic-dependency is also an interesting fu-ture research direction.
