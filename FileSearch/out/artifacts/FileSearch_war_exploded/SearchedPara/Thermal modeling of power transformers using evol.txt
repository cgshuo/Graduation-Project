 1. Introduction
Distribution transformers with core oil-immersed are one of the most common equipments in electric d istribution networks. The last decades have been marked by an increase in energy consumption on cities and rural areas. This raise in the energy consumption caused an increase in the number of distribution networks, and, conse-quently, in the number of operating transformers. With appropriate methods for predicting transforme r lifetime, the companies respon-sible for expansion of the electrical system can determine the ideal power of the transformer to be installed, since it is possible to estimate the loading curve with which the transformer will work.
With a suitable loading and methodology for predicting the lifetime, the companies can determine the electrical power that would minimize cost and maximize the lifetime. This improves the cost-benefit of distribution networks. The lifetime prediction is also important because it allows us to evaluate the optimal replacement time and maintenance of transfor mers. This prevents failures and also unexpected interruptions of the power supply ( Pylvanainen et al., 2007 ).

The lifetime methodologies for distribution transformer are aided by thermal models ( IEEE Guide for Loading Mineral-oil-immersed Transformers, 1996 ; International Standard Loading
Guide for Oil Immersed Power Transformer, 1991 ). The objective of thermal models is to determine the temperature at which the insulating paper is submitted. It is known that the insulating paper is the transformer part which degrades faster, since, when subjected to high temperatures, undergoes the polymerization process, causing the breakdown of cellulose fibers. When the average fiber size is reduced, the kraft paper loses its mechanical strength. By becoming brittle, the paper breaks due to vibration during the transformer operation, resulting in failure of electrical insulation. Thus, the high temperatures reduce the transformer life ( IEEE Guide for Loading Mineral-oil-immersed Transformers, 1996 ).

IEEE Guide for Loading Mineral-oil-immersed Transformers (1996) describe a deterministic thermal model using transient heating equations. In Jardini et al. (2005) this model was eval-uated. It was verified discrepancies between the model and the real values exceeding 10 1 C. Since the model is used to estimate the temperature which is used by lifetime estimation methodol-ogies, inaccurate thermal models imply on inaccurate lifetime estimation methodologies.

Given the complexity to develop high accuracy deterministic models, several recent works perform thermal modeling using black box models, defined based on historical data. Neural net-works and fuzzy systems are examples of history based methods that have been shown to be efficient in thermal modeling ( Galdi to learn complex nonlinear relations and to treat imprecise data ( Raoa and Gupta, 1994 ).

However, all these models lack for an important characteristics desired in order to be applied on real world problems. They are not adaptable. It is expected that the behavior of the transformer to be modeled changes due to variations in external inputs, structural changes, maintenance and so on. Thus, a model can be invalidated after a period of time if the parameters or the structure of the model does not adapt to cope with these changes.
This interest in adaptive system modeling has motivated the development of highly adaptive and intelligent systems, denomi-nated evolving intelligent systems (EIS) ( Angelov et al., 2010 ), whose models are self-developed from a stream of data. EIS are able to address problems of modeling, control, prediction, classi-fication and data processing in a non-stationary, dynamic chan-ging environments. Such systems embody online learning methods and one-pass incremental algorithms that evolve or gradually change individual models to guarantee life-long learn-ing and self-organization of the system structure ( Angelov et al., 2008 ; Gama, 2010 ).

Pioneering work in this area was addressed in the realm of 2000 ). In the turn of the centuries the area has expanded, encom-passing fuzzy rule-based systems (evolving fuzzy systems) ( Angelov and neuro-fuzzy hybrids ( Kasabov and Song, 2002 ; Leng et al., 2005 ). In the last years, the area also grew to expand statistical models ( Hisada et al., 2010 ), create granular co mputing mechanisms ( Leite et al., 2010 ) and hardware implementations.

Recently a new evolving fuzzy system has been proposed named evolving multivariable Gaussia n (eMG). The eMG is an evolving fuzzy system. Evolving fuzzy syst ems (eFS) can be seen as a synergy between fuzzy systems, as a mechanism for evolvable information compactation and representation, and recursive methods of machine learning ( Kasabov and Filev, 2006 ). The eMG is an evolvable fuzzy functional rule-based systems in which the struc-ture (number of rules and anteced ents/consequent parameters) continuously evolves based on clusters created/excluded by a recursive clustering algorithm ( Oliveira and Pedrycz, 2007 ). The parameters of the consequents ar e updated using weighted recur-sive least squares ( Young, 1984 ; Ljung, 1999 ).

This paper suggests the use of the eMG model to perform thermal modeling of power transformers. The aim is to predict the hot spot temperature based on historical data. The principal advantage of this model is the ability to adapt as the system changes, what makes it a good candidate to be used on real world applications, where the transformer behavior may change through time.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the deterministic model proposed in IEEE Guide for
Loading Mineral-oil-immersed Transformers (1996) which is the current model used for thermal modeling. Section 3 details the evolving fuzzy model used in this paper for adaptive thermal modeling. Section 4 addresses the simulation results and compar-isons. Finally, the conclusions and further developments are summarized in Section 5 . 2. Deterministic modeling
In IEEE Guide for Loading Mineral-oil-immersed Transformers (1996) a thermal model is proposed that determines the hot spot temperature as a loading function. Nominal transformer data are used to perform the calculations. Eqs. (1) X (7) describe the calculation procedure. The symbol list below shows the meaning of each variable.

Symbols list of the thermal model: y amb ambient temperature, y TO top oil temperature, D y H hot spot temperature rise above top oil temperature,
D y H , I hot spot temperature rise above top oil temperature at the
D y H , R hot spot temperature rise above top oil temperature in the

D y TO , I top oil temperature rise above ambient temperature at the D y

TO , U top oil temperature rise above ambient temperature at the
The hot spot temperature is given by Eq. (1) as a top oil temperature function and the increase in hot spot temperature above the top oil temperature. The top oil temperature is obtained by the sum of its increment with ambient temperature. y  X  D y H  X  D y TO  X  y amb  X  1  X 
The value of D y TO is given by Eq. (2). Here the instantaneous value of top oil temperature rise depends of the initial and final values of this magnitude for the loading level. Also depends of the top oil thermal constant time. The initial and final values, D y and D y TO , U , are obtained by Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. D y D y D y
In Eqs. (3) and (4) there is an n index and in Eq. (2) a time constant t TO , which are dependent on the transformer type of cooling. The values for these indices or method for estimate them are described in IEEE Guide for Loading Mineral-oil-immersed Transformers (1996) . Eq. (5) describes how to calculate the value of D y H . And Eqs. (6) and (7) show how to calculate the values of D y H , I and D y H , U , respectively.
 D y D y D y
The value of D y H , R must be obtained from thermal tests. If it is not possible to perform thermal tests, an alternative way to obtain the values is suggested in IEEE Guide for Loading Mineral-oil-immersed Transformers (1996) . Alternatively, one can calculate the top oil temperature and hot spot temperature values by applying the finite difference method in differential equations of the system ( Swift et al., 2001 ). The m exponent is an empirically derived exponent used to calculate the variation of D y
H with changes in load. The value of m has been selected for each mode of cooling to approximately account for effects of changes in resistance and off viscosity with changes in load. 3. Evolving multivariable Gaussian
This section describes the evolving fuzzy model used for thermal modeling. The eMG ( Lemos et al., 2010 ) is an evolving multivariable Takagi X  X ugeno model, which uses an evolving
Gaussian clustering algorithm, rooted in the concept of partici-patory learning ( Yager, 1990 ) in order to adapt the rule base for each input sample. At each iteration the clustering approach is created, extracted or two rules can be merged.

Most of eFS systems perform clustering in the input or input X  output data space, and create rules using one-dimensional, single variable fuzzy sets which are projections of the clusters on each input variable space. During fuzzy inference, the fuzzy relation induced by the antecedent of each fuzzy rule is computed using an aggregation operator (e.g. a t-norm) and the input fuzzy sets.
This approach is commonly used, but it may cause information loss if input variables interact ( Kim et al., 1998 ; Abonyi et al., 2002 ). For instance, system identification and time series fore-casting usually use lagged values of the input and/or output as inputs, and these lagged values tend to be highly related.
The clustering procedure used by eMG considers the possibi-lity that input variables may interact with each other. Clusters are estimated using a normalized distance measure (similar to the
Mahalanobis distance) and trigger ellipsoidal clusters whose axes are not necessarily parallel to the input variables axes, as it would be the case if the Euclidean distance were used ( Kasabov and
Song, 2002 ; Lughofer, 2008 ; Angelov and Filev, 2004 ). The idea is to preserve information about interactions between input vari-ables. The fuzzy sets of the rules antecedents are multivariable
Gaussian membership functions characterized by a center vector, and a dispersion matrix representing the dispersion of each variable and interactions between variables. Each rule is asso-ciated with a cluster, and the antecedent parameters are defined as the corresponding cluster center and dispersion matrix. Note that, while the use of multivariable Gaussian membership func-tions may improve the model performance, it also reduces the interpretability of the models, since multivariable membership functions are not easily interpretable as univariable membership functions, normally used on traditional evolving fuzzy models. 3.1. Gaussian participatory evolving clustering
The clustering algorithm proposed in Lemos et al. (2010) assumes that the knowledge about the system to be modeled is the cluster structure, i.e., the number of clusters, the correspond-ing cluster centers v i k for i  X  1 , ... , c k , where c clusters at step k , and the shape of clusters determined by S each step, the learning process may create a new cluster, modify the parameters of an existing one, or merge two similar clusters.
The cluster structure is updated using a compatibility measure r k
A  X  0 ; 1 and an arousal index, a k i A  X  0 ; 1 . The compatibility measure computes how much an observation is compatible with the current cluster structure, while the arousal index is the output of an arousal mechanism that acts as a critic to remind when the current structure should be revised in front of new information contained in data.

Thresholds are defined for the compatibility measure ( T r the current observation is less than the threshold for all clusters, i.e., r k the greatest compatibility is greater than the threshold, i.e., the cluster center with the highest compatibility is adjusted as follows: v  X  v k i  X  G k i  X  x k v k i  X  X  8  X  where G i k is
G  X  and a A  X  0 ; 1 is the basic learning rate.

According to Yager (1990) , the compatibility r k i is a function that measures the compatibility between the current belief of the model, here viewed as each cluster center, and the current observation (data). This function is such that it should approach zero as observations become contradictory with the current belief, i.e., the cluster centers, and approach one as the observations become in complete agreement with the current belief. For example, if x k is equal to a cluster center, then r k i  X  F  X  x
The arousal index is the output of an arousal mechanism used to measure the confidence about the current knowledge of the system. For example, while a single low value of the compatibility measure causes aversion to learning, suggesting an outlier, a sequence of low values of the compatibility measure should imply on a revision of the current knowledge about the system.
The compatibility measure r k i suggested in Lemos et al. (2010) uses the squared value of the normalized distance between the new observation and cluster centers ( M-Distance ):
M  X  x , v k i  X  X  X  x k v k i  X  X  S k i  X  1  X  x k v k i  X  T  X  10  X 
To compute the M-Distance , the dispersion matrix of each cluster S k i must be estimated at each step. The recursive estima-tion of the dispersion matrix proceeds as follows:
S  X  X  1 G k i  X  X  S k i G k i  X  x k v k i  X  X  x k v k i  X  T  X  X  11  X 
The compatibility measure at each step k is given by r k  X  F  X  x k , v k i  X  X  exp  X  1 2 M  X  x k , v k i  X  X  12  X  Fig. 1 illustrates the compatibility measure in two dimensions.
The cluster is centered at v  X  X  00 T with the following dispersion matrix:
S  X  0 : 51  X  13  X 
Looking at Fig. 1 one can note that, as the M-Distance increases, the compatibility measure decreases exponentially.

To find a threshold value for the compatibility measure, we distribution. Thus, given a significance level l , the threshold can be computed as follows:
T  X  exp  X  1 2 w 2 m , l  X  14  X  square distribution with m degrees of freedom, where m is the number of inputs.

The compatibility measure threshold defines an equidistant ellipse centered on the cluster center. The shape and orientation of the ellipse depend on the dispersion matrix and the radius depends on the significance level, that is, decreasing the signifi-cance level increases the ellipse radius. Fig. 2 illustrates the equidistant ellipse defined by T r for the cluster illustrated in Fig. 1 and l  X  0 : 05.

The arousal mechanism proposed in Lemos et al. (2010) monitors the compatibility index using a sliding window assembled by the last w observations. The arousal index is defined as the probability of observing less then nv violations of the compatibility threshold on a sequence of w observations, that is, more than nv points outside the equidistant ellipse defined by the compatibility measure threshold on a sequence of the last w observations. Low values of the arousal index are associated with no or few violations of the compatibility threshold, implying a high confidence about the system knowledge. High values of the arousal index are associated with several threshold violations, meaning that the current cluster structure must be revised.
More specifically, the arousal index is defined as the value of the cumulative probability of NV i k , i.e., a k i  X  p  X  NV
NV k is a random variable describing the number of threshold violations on a sequence of last w observations for a given cluster and l , where l is the probability of observing a threshold violation. See Lemos et al. (2010) for a detailed discussion about the arousal index.

A threshold value is defined for the arousal index T a as 1 l , where l is the same as the one that defines the threshold for the compatibility measure.

Fig. 3 illustrates different combinations of compatibility mea-with high compatibility measure and low arousal. In this situa-tion, the current observation x k is in agreement with the current belief and it will provide new information to update the cluster parameters. Fig. 3 (b) shows an observation with low compat-ibility measure and low arousal index. The current observation has a low compatibility, but the previous ones have high compatibility values, so the arousal index is low. This situation illustrates how the learning mechanism handles an outlier. The outlier will provide (almost) no information for updating the cluster parameters, since the learning rate will be modulated by a low value of the compatibility measure. Finally, Fig. 3 (c) shows an observation with low compatibility measure and high arousal index. The compatibility of the current observation and the previous ones are low, resulting in a high value for the arousal index. A high arousal index suggests the need for revision of the current belief. Therefore, the arousal index cancels the modula-tion effect of the compatibility measure in the learning rate, allowing a low compatibility sample to provide information for updating the cluster parameters. The extreme case occurs when the arousal index exceeds the related threshold, and a new cluster is created with the center defined as the current observation.
For a detailed discussion about this clustering algorithm, refer to Lemos et al. (2010) . 3.2. Evolving fuzzy model
The eMG model uses the evolving clustering algorithm described in order to define the rule base. The number of eMG rules is the same as the number of clusters found by the clustering algorithm at each step. At each iteration a new cluster can be created, an existing cluster removed, or existing clusters updated. In other words, rules can be created, merged, or adapted at each step of the algorithm. Rule antecedents are of the form: x k is H i  X  15  X  where x k is a 1 m input vector and H i is a fuzzy set with multivariable Gaussian membership function of the form: H  X  x  X  X  exp  X  1 2  X  x v  X  S 1  X  x v  X  T  X  16  X  where v is the 1 m center vector and S is a m m symmetric, positive definite matrix. The center vector v is the modal value and represents the typical element of H ( x ). The matrix S denotes the dispersion and represents the spread of H ( x )( Gomide and Pedrycz, 2007 ). The parameters of the membership functions, v and S , are extracted directly from the corresponding clusters. The model is formed by a set of functional fuzzy rules: R : IF x k is H i THEN y k i  X  g k io  X  where R i is the i th fuzzy rule, for i  X  1 , ... , c k , c step k .

The model output is the weighted average of the outputs of the each rule, that is: ^ y  X  with normalized membership functions: C  X  x k  X  X  cluster membership function at step k .

The parameters of the consequent are updated using the weighted recursive least squares ( Ljung, 1999 ; Astrom and Wittenmark, 1988 ) algorithm, similarly as other TS evolving fuzzy models ( Angelov and Filev, 2004 ; Lughofer, 2008 ). Hence, the consequent parameters and matrix Q i of the update formulas for x rule i at each iteration k are
Q  X  Q k i
As new data are input, the eMG algorithm may create, update or merge clusters. Thus, the set of rules, the rule-base, must be updated as well. This is done as follows.

If a new cluster is created, then a corresponding rule is also created with antecedent parameters extracted from the cluster and consequent parameters computed as the weighted average of the parameters of the existing clusters: g k  X  The matrix Q is set as Q k new  X  o I m  X  1 .

If an existing cluster is updated, then the antecedent para-meters of the corresponding rule are updated accordingly.
Finally, if two clusters i and j are merged, then the consequent parameters of the resulting rule are computed as follows: g k  X  The matrix Q is set as Q k new  X  o I m  X  1 .

The eMG model has only three parameters: the basic learning rate a ; the window size w used by the arousal mechanism; the confidence level l to compute thresholds T r and T a .
The basic learning rate is used to update the cluster para-meters and is usually set to a small value, i.e., typically
A  X  10 1 , 10 5 .

The window size w is a problem specific parameter because it defines how many consecutive observations must be considered to compute the arousal index. This parameter can be interpreted as the  X  X  X emory X  X  of the novelty detection mechanism used for x  X 5  X 4  X 3  X 2  X 1 0 1 2 3 4 5  X 5  X 4  X 3  X 2  X 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 creating new clusters (rules). Increasing w , increases the influence of old observations in the novelty detection mechanism. In other words, considering the current system knowledge, w defines the length of the anomaly pattern (formed by the last w observations) needed to classify an anomalous data sample, i.e., a data sample with low compatibility measure, either as the center of a new cluster or as a noise or outlier.

The value of the significance level l defines the compatibility measure threshold. The equidistant ellipse formed by the com-patibility measure threshold illustrated in Fig. 2 increases as l decreases. So, decreasing l , decreases the number of data samples with a compatibility measure below T r . This will decrease the false alarm probability of generating a new cluster when the current observation is only a noise or outlier. However, a low value of l also decreases the sensibility of the clustering algo-rithm. The algorithm will not be able to distinguish between different clusters with close centers. Summarizing, a low value of l decreases the false alarm rate but also decreases the sensibility of the clustering algorithm; while a high value of l increases the sensibility of the algorithm but also increases the false alarm rate.
The value of l is also used for defining the arousal index threshold T a . So, the lower bound of l must be defined based on the selected value for w , such that the arousal threshold corre-sponds to more than one compatibility threshold violation.
Otherwise, a single observation with a low compatibility measure (lower than the compatibility measure threshold) will generate a new cluster and the arousal mechanism described will not be used, that is, no matter how large w will be, for a very low value of l , only the current observation will be used to decide if a new l must be greater than or equal to 0.001, in order to have an arousal index threshold corresponding with at least two compat-ibility threshold violations. 4. Experiments
In this section the proposed evolving fuzzy model is used to estimate the hot spot temperature of a power transformer. The data set used in experiments is the same of Galdi et al. (2000) . The data set used was collected from measurements performed in a experimental power transformer. The characteristics of the power transformer are listed in Table 1 . The transformer has fiber optic sensors installed at several points in order to measure tempera-ture. In order to measure the load, a Hall effect sensor was used.
Data were obtained from three 24-h load curves, totaling 72 h of data acquisition. The data was sampled from each sensor at 5-min intervals and different loading current profiles. Two load curves exceed the transformer nominal power. More information about the measurement system can be obtained from Galdi et al. (2000) and Villacci et al. (2005) .

The eMG model is a one-step ahead forecaster whose purpose is to predict the next (5 min) hot spot temperature value using the actual and lagged values of hot spot temperature ( T ) and load ( K ). Previous work ( Hell et al., 2008 ) suggests as inputs the current and one step delayed values of hot spot temperature and load: ^ T k  X  1  X  f  X  T , K , T 1 , K 1  X  X  23  X 
The modeling performance was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE), the non-dimensional error (NDEI) and the mean absolute error (MAE). The NDEI is the ratio of the root mean squared error by the standard deviation of the target data. The results obtained were compared with the deterministic model described in Section 2 and alternative history based models. The error measures are computed as follows: RMSE  X  1 N NDEI  X  RMSE std  X  y k  X   X  25  X  MAE  X  1 N std  X  X  is the standard deviation function.

The experiment has been conducted as follows. The data set representing 2 days were input to the eMG algorithm (576 observations) and the evolved model performance was evaluated using data of the last day (288 observations), keeping the model structure and parameters fixed at the values found after evolving during the period of 2 days. The eMG started clustering with the first observation, and the parameters were chosen as l  X  0 : 05, a diagonal matrix containing the variance of each input variable in the diagonal, estimated using the first 50 input samples. Fig. 5 shows the results provided by the eMG model and Fig. 4 illus-trates how the fuzzy rules evolve during the first two days.
Table 2 shows how eMG performs against the deterministic model described in Section 2 and alternative evolving and fixed structure history based modeling methods using the error mea-sures ((24) X (26)). The MLP has one hidden layer with four neurons trained with backpropagation algorithm, the ANFIS has four fuzzy sets for each input variable and four fuzzy rules generated by means of the fuzzy c -means clustering procedure Number of Fuzzy Rules ( Bezdek, 1981 ). The MLP adopted the following scheme for initialization phase: small weight values randomly assigned;  X  0 : 9 as momentum parameter; 500 as the maximum number of epochs, and an adaptive learning-rate starting from Z  X  0 : 01 as initial step size. The ANFIS has 100 as maximum number of rate and s i  X  1.1 as step size increase rate. The parameters of the eTS model were set to r  X  0.3 and O  X  750. The xTS ( Angelov and
Zhou, 2010 ) has O  X  750. The parameters of all models were selected in order to provide the best results.

Table 2 suggests that eMG performs best among all the models. When compared with alternative history based models, one can also note that the eMG model has simpler structure (fewer number of free parameters).

The error indices used in Table 2 are good indices to measure the model accuracy. However, they do not reveal whether the results from one model is statistically superior to any other model. Therefore, it is desired to employ some statistical test that could help to compare two models in terms of accuracy.
The MGN test ( Diebold and Mariano, 1995 ) is a parametric test used to compare the accuracy of two forecasting models. The test statistic for this test can be computed as
MGN  X  ^ r sd ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi where ^ r sd is the estimated correlation coefficient between s  X  r
N 1 degrees of freedom. For this test, if the forecasts are equally accurate, then the correlation between s and d will be zero.
Table 3 shows the pairwise comparisons between the forecasts of the eMG and all other alternative approaches using the MGN test (27). The table shows the MGN statistic and the correspond-ing p-value (tail of the distribution). Analysing this table, one can note that the eMG model shows statistically significant evidence of superior performance, for a significance level of 0.01.
Note that, when compared with fixed structure models, like MLP and ANFIS, besides the superior performance, the main advantage of the eMG model (and also any other evolving model) is the adapt-ability. The MLP and ANFIS models have a fixed structure, defined during the training step. That is, in order to use such models, a training step is required in which the structure of the model is defined and the parameters are adjusted. The eMG model, and all other evolving fuzzy models, do not necessarily demand a training step. The learning can happen continuously. These models can start to learn from a single observation and adapt not only their parameters but also their structure as the input data stream changes. This continuous learning capability gives them the ability to cope with changes in the transformer behavior due to structural changes, environmental changes and maintenance which are likely to happen during the lifetime of the transformer.

In order to illustrate this continuous learning feature, a new experiment was performed. In this experiment, all data samples were used as inputs of the three evolving models. In this situation, the learning process is continuous, that is, all models start with a single rule, created using the first data sample, and for each new data sample, the models first estimate the output and then use the sample to adjust the parameters and evolve the structure.
In this way, the models are constantly adapting in order to cope with changes in the transformer behavior.

Fig. 6 illustrates the sample-wise accumulated squared error for the three evolving fuzzy models for the three days. 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 Temperature (C) 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09

Analysing Fig. 6 one can note that the eMG has a lower accumulated error curve when compared with eTS and a similar curve when compared with xTS, suggesting that eMG and xTS are able to adapt quickly with changes in the input data stream. 5. Conclusion
In this paper a new thermal model for distribution transfor-mers has been proposed. The model is an evolving fuzzy func-tional Takagi X  X ugeno model within the framework of multivariable Gaussian membership functions.

The proposed model was evaluated using data from an experimental power transformer. The experiments performed and their results suggest that the eMG model has a higher accuracy for estimating the hot spot temperature. The hot spot temperature estimation is directly related with the accuracy of transformers lifetime estimation. Thus, the results suggest that the use of the eMG model for thermal modeling of transformers improves the lifetime estimation accuracy. Accurate transformers lifetime estimation methodologies allow a better operation plan-ning, i.e., transformer replacement and maintenance, improving the power system reliability.

Besides the superior accuracy, the main advantage of the eMG model is the adaptability. This model is able to adapt its parameters and also its structure based on continuous readings of inputs in order to cope with effects related to transformer aging, replacement of transformers parts, etc.

Despite the adaptability and superior accuracy of the eMG model when compared with heat equations, in order to use this model for transformer thermal modeling temperature measurements are necessary. In order to obtain such measure-ments, it is necessary to identify the hot spot region of the transformer and, after that, install sensors inside the transformer.
Since this is usually a time and energy consuming procedure, the cost-benefit of using the eMG model instead of heat equations should be evaluated for each case. Note, however, that this restriction is necessary not only for eMG, but for all history based models.

In recent years the amount of nonlinear loads has increased, giving rise to a large amount of harmonics in power systems. Harmonics alter the transformers thermal behavior, since the
Foucault currents losses are proportional to the square of fre-quency ( Fuchs et al., 1999 ). There is a demand for models that are also responsive to the harmonic content of the electrical network.
Future work shall address modifications in the proposed model to make it sensitive to the harmonics.
