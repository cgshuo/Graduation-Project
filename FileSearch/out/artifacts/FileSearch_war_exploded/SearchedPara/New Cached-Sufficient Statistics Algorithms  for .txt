 This talk is about recent work on new ways to exploit preprocessed views of data tables for tractably solving big statistical queries. We'll describe deployments of these new algorithms in the realms of detecting killer asteroids and unnatural disease outbreaks. In recent years, several groups have looked at methods for pre-storing general sufficient statistics of the data in spatial data structures such as kd-tr ees and ball-trees so that both frequentist and Bayesian statistical operations become fast for large datasets. In this talk we will look at two other classes of optimization required in important statistical queries. The first involves iterating over all spatial regions (big and small). The second involves detection of tracks from noisy intermittent observations separated far apart in time and space. We will also discuss th e implications that have arisen from making these operations tractable. We will focus particularly on Andrew Moore (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm) is director of Google's newest engineering office, located on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, PA. Prior to recently joining Google, Andrew was a professor of robotics and computer science at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. Andrew began his career writing video-games for an obscure British personal page=software&amp;fille=detail&amp;num_log=2). He rapidly became a thousandaire and retired to academia, where he received a PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1991. He researched robot learning as a Post-doc working with Chris Atkeson at MIT, and then moved to CMU. His main research interest is data mining: statistical algorithms for finding all the potentially useful and statistically meaningful patterns in large sources of data. (http://www.autonlab.org) has de vised several new ways of performing large statistical operations efficiently, in several cases accelerating state-of-the-a rt by a several magnitudes. Members of the Auton Lab collaborate closely with many kinds of scientists, government agencies, technology companies and engineers in a constant quest to determine what are some of the most urgent unresolved questions at the border of computation and statistics. Auton Lab algorithms are now in use in dozens of commercial, university and government app lications. Andrew became a US citizen in 2003, and lives in Pittsburgh with his wife and two children: William (7) and Lucy (1). In his non-work life he has no hobbies or talents of any significance.
