 LIAAD -INESC Porto L.A., FEP, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal 1. Introduction exponentially in last decades. The rapid progress made in science and technology has contributed to the emergence of a volatile and fast pace evolving world, which demands new perspectives in knowledge discovery upon data, such as time-oriented perspectives. The paradigm of change mining arises as a consequence ofthis evolution andencompasses data mining mechanismsthatmonitormodelsandpatterns over time, compare them, detect and describe changes, and quantify them on their interestingness [10]. Therefore, the challenge of change mining lays not only in the adaptation of models to changes in data distribution but also in the understanding of changes themselves. Bearing this in mind some researchers and practitioners of data mining developed methods and techniques t o study evolution that provide insights about the behavior of data, or models, ove r time (see, for example, Spiliopoulou et al. [31], Baron and Spiliopoulou [6], Aggarwal [2], Asur et al. [4]).

Clustering is one of the most popular and useful tasks of data mining, and is broadly used in business can only describe well a speci fi c time moment. Nevertheless, companies make medium and long-term decisions based on these results, which are highly susceptible to change. Therefore, monitoring the dynamics of clusters structures is very important in many real world applications, since it fosters the creation of sustainable knowledge about the evolution of phenomena and, consequently, the adoption of or unveil the emergence of new ones. For these reasons, this study can bene fi t several areas, such as Marketing, Fraud Detection, Economy and Finance. For instance, the study of the evolution of customer segments allows the detection of shifts in preferences and consumer habits, which can help the forecast improve customer relationship management (CRM). The domain knowledge acquired by these means can act as a powerful differentiating factor in the market and strongly contributes to the creation, or reinforcement, of a company X  X  competitive advantages. Regarding Economics, it may be of interest to study the evolution of the economic activity sectors of a given country in order to discover emerging and does not take into account its evolving nature. Therefore, the study of the dynamics of clusters horizons and opening new paths in the way we think about problems.

To help decision makers and practitioners of several areas make better and more reasoned decisions, in this paper we present a generic framework to study the dynamics of clusters, which can provide solid knowledge about the studied problem. The MEC framework was designed to monitor clusters transitions them. MEC encompasses a taxonomy of various types of clu sters transitions, a tracking method based to clusters structures returned by any clustering algorithm.

Contrary to earlier research, our proposal takes into account the dynamic nature of real world phenom-ena, and is focused on the modeling, characterization and further understanding of changes in groups of entities (e.g. activity sectors, companies, consumers a nd countries). The relationship between changes can then be explored in order to perform two types of analyses: one focused on the discovery of general analyses can be very useful in the context of Economics and Management problems. To illustrate it we conduct two real world case studies using datasets from Banco de Portugal Central Balance-Sheet Database (from now on, we will refer to these datasets as Banco de Portugal datasets )andthe The Data Page of New York University  X  Leonard N. Stern School of Business.

In this paper we focus on the Business and Economic domain. Yet, the proposed approach may prove in news topics), just to name a few.
 we present the adopted scheme to de fi ne clusters, introduce our taxonomy for clusters transitions and explain the foundations of our tracking method. In Section 4 we show and discuss two real world case studies using economic and fi nancial datasets. Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary and some directions for future research. 2. Related work Despite the extensive study of the clustering problem (good surveys can be found in Jain et al. [20], the context of evolution, the research endeavor has been mainly directed to the adaptation of clusters to changed populations. However, the dynamic nature of most problems encouraged new directions in research. This effort is clearly present in the areas of machine learning and data analysis.
Currently, there are several algorithms that directly, or indirectly, aim to capture and understand the dynamic nature of these datasets, which are particularly susceptible to the occurrence of changes in the underlying structur e. The last decade has been especially profuse in t he design of transition and algorithms designed to operate in streaming environments. The fi rst may be focused on transitions experienced by generic patterns [7,12,17], clusters [16,31,34] or association rules [5,6]. Within the scope of static data, relevant work for generic patterns include the FOCUS framework and the algorithm MH-DIFF. FOCUS framework [17] describes a general model (e.g. decision trees, frequent item sets and clusters) by a structural component and a measure c omponent, and computes the deviation between two deviation, is assessed using standard statistical techniques. Chawathe and Garcia-Molina [12] designed as nested-object data (e.g. trees). The problem of identifying change between two snapshots of data is regarded by the authors as the problem of fi nding the best way to edit a tree created in t another tree, created in t editing operations.

An interesting work regarding association rul es was proposed by Baron and Spiliopoulou [6]. These authors devised PAM (Automated Pattern Monitor) to ef fi ciently monitor patterns and detect meaningful imported to the monitor and stored according to the GRM (Generic Rule Model), which models both the representative rules are monitored over time, and PAM detects a change when these statistics are above algorithm to understand the underlying causes.
 et al. [16] address the problem of m onitoring the dynamics of communities. They consider two types of communities, at the subgroups level: stable communities and high fl uctuating communities; and propose two different methods to tackle each one of the problems. These methods are based on visualizations of the network and their subgroups, and on the analysis of different statistics to detect transitions such as growing , declining , merging and splitting of communities. Basically, the main goal of this A more detailed framework can be found in Asur et al. [4]. In this work, an event-based framework for leave , appearance or disappearance of individuals (entitie s). Although the evolution is monitored by comparing static snapshots of data, obtained in consecutive time periods, the devised event detection algorithm is incremental and can be easily extended to a streaming environment.

Concerning data streams, approaches focusing unclassi fi ed data are quite common (here we include clustering algorithms for mobile objects or spatio-temporal objects). These approaches [1,2,13,15,21, algorithms. Important research includes the work of Aggarwal [2], Chen and Liu [13], and Elnekave et visualize and diagnose different types of changes in evolving data streams. The proposed techniques the underlying change: while the temporal velocity pro fi le gives an overview of the density rate of taxonomy: data coagulation ,data dissolution and shift of data. This framework can also be extended to high-dimensional data streams.

Chen and Liu [13]proposed an online entropy-basedmethodto automatically validate theclustering and of data. The proposed framework extends the work done in determining the best k for static datasets  X  Method BkPlot  X  to categorical data streams, with the help of a summarization structure called HE-Tree (Hierarchical Entropy Tree).

Elnekave etal. [15]addressed theproblemofclustering thetrajectories ofmovingobjects and developed an incremental clustering algorithm to fi nd groups of similar objects that evolve over space and time.
Although these researches study the evolution of clusters, they use quite distinct approaches to tackle the problem. Based on our knowledge, presently there are only two research works that address a problem closely related to ours [ 30,31]. MONIC framework [31] also proposes a cluster transition model to track cluster changes, supporting cluster comparisons across the time axis. MONIC uses a data aging function that assigns lower weights to older observations and computes the overlap of clusters to capture its evolution. An extension to this framework, called MONIC + , was later proposed by the same for different kinds of clusters broadens the application of the framework and turns it independent of the clusters discovery process. However, if we compare both sys tems (MONIC and MONIC + ) to our framework, we conclude that they use different metrics to detect change and do not provide techniques to visualize the monitoring process. Our earlier work [26] also proposes a framework to model the MONIC and MONIC + . The work presented in this paper is a substantial extension of our previous research [26].

Somewhat related is the work on novelty detection that can identify new concepts (in our terminology, concepts, such as splits, merges, deaths and survivals.

There are also classic statistical methods, such as Panel Data Analysis (PDA) [33], focusing on the collected at two or more points in time. The analysis of this data aims to model the heterogeneity, or and our framework share the same goal, they use quite different ways to achieve it. Moreover, PDA MEC , since the evolution is not as easy to understand using regression models. 3. MEC Framework
We developed MEC framework in order to monitor the evolution of clusters structures (also referred evolution refers to transitions undergone by clusters during the time interval under observation [ t (  X  t =1 ,...,T  X  i ). The main goal is to identify hidden behavioral patterns and create useful and actionable knowledge based upon these fi ndings.

In the nextsubsectionswe present the adopted sche meto representclusters, our taxonomy of transitions and the devised method to monitor clusters evolution.
 usually denoted as clusters  X  = { C 1 , ..., C 1. C 3. Observations assigned to a given cluster are more similar to each other than to observations 3.1. Cluster characterization
MEC framework assumes that clusters are represented by enumeration (also known as extensional given clustering algorithm (see De fi nition 2).
 De fi nition 2  X  Representation by Enumeration: Let x a vector of real numbers in a d -dimensional space x representation of a cluster is de fi ned as follows: where m is the number of observations assigned to cluster C clusters and t =(1 , ..., T ) ,where T corresponds to the last analyzed time stamp.
This type of representation does not involve information loss and enables the monitoring of each object or privacy issues. 3.2. Taxonomy of transitions to occur in clusters structures we considered the following taxonomy:  X  X irth  X  a new cluster emerges  X  X eath  X  a previous discovered cluster disappears  X  Split  X  one cluster is separated into two or more clusters  X  X erge  X  two or more clusters fuse, or merge, into one cluster  X  Survival  X  a cluster that does not suffer any of the above transitions These transitions are external, as they relate to changes in the whole Clustering , and represent fi ve basic types of changes that clusters may undergo between two consecutive time points. The adopted terminology is the one introduced by Spiliopoulou et al. [31] and can be found in Table 1. The formal de fi nition of these transitions are summarized in Table 2.

Here we expose the method we devised to track the evolution of clusters, which allows the detection which clusters of time point t correspond to clusters previously found in t space or, in other words, the matches of clusters. In our method, the mapping process explores the which assumes the minimum of  X  =0 . 5 . These conditional probabilities are computed for every pair of possible connections between clusters obtained at consecutive time points and they represent the edges important information about the degree of permanency of objects in a given cluster, and can be used to to the modeling of matching problems, which is one of its main applications.

Although in this paper we only explore crisp clustering, the previous formula can be extended in operation, and A  X  B ( x )=max[ A ( x ) ,B ( x )] for the standard union operation. over time. In real world applications this can be of major interest, especially in the Economics and Management fi eld (for instance, it allows the de fi nition of a company X  X  life cycle).
To detect changes, we formally de fi ne the transitions that a cluster C  X   X  to  X  . This formal design is based on the external transitions of MONIC framework external transitions [31] andisdepictedinTable2.

Table 2 presents the formal de fi nition for each one of the transitions. A cluster is born when the that can be considered an approximate match. Similarly, a cluster dies when all links that connect this cluster to clusters of the following time point are below the split threshold. Exceptions are made when Regarding clusters split , it is assumed that a cluster of t if exists, at least, two clusters C merge occurs when there are, at least, two different clusters from t of one link between a pair of clusters C threshold.

Our transition detection algorithm c overs the introduced elements of the framework and it was imple-mented in R. This implementation was supported by the de fi nitions presented in Table 2. 4. Real world case studies
In order to show the potential of the application of our framework to economic problems and glean from Banco de Portugal Central Balance-Sheet Database and The Data Page of New York University  X  detection of rare events in European companies. Since the experiments require prede fi ned thresholds, we begin this section with a threshold X  X  sensitivity analysis, to help us choose its values. 4.1. Threshold sensitivity analysis
In order to help the decision of choosing reasonable values for the thresholds we studied the impact of the obtained conclusions are very similar to the ones returned using the fi nancial dataset. We made of of  X  =0 . 5 . 4.1.1. Survival threshold Table 3 shows the relationship between values of  X  and the number o f occurren ces of each transition. of survivals and merges detected. It would also be expected that the increase of  X  leads to a greater number of births, deaths and splits. Table 3 is consistent with the expected results, since the number of merges decreases and the number of splits increases to more demanding values of  X  .However,the the explanation is very simple: due to the change of the threshold value a merge was replaced by one survival, since the weight assigned to one of the edges became lower than the threshold. Concerning why the number of births and deaths remain constant for different threshold values. The reason behind weights.
 not suffer modi fi cations.

The survival threshold analysis, using the datasets from Banco de Portugal, led to the following main conclusions: the more challenging the survival threshold, the lower the number of survivals and merges and the higher the number of splits. Births and deaths remain constant. Using the European companies datasets, we also verify that the number of deaths increases for higher values of the threshold. 4.1.2. Split threshold
Regarding the split threshold  X  , it is expected that the higher its value, the greater the number of deaths and births, and lower the number of splits. One can also deduce that the number of merges and However, the same analysis for the European companies datasets con fi rmed the second hypothesis: the higher the value of  X  the higher the number of deaths and the lower the number of splits. 4.1.3. Discussion once the number of transitions are more volatile and sensitive to small variations of  X  .
Based on the information acquired by this analysis we chose the following values for the thresholds:  X  =0 . 2 and  X  =0 . 6 , which we assume to be reasonable values. We tried to be less demanding to capture a wider variety of transitions. 4.2. First case study  X  portuguese activity sectors that represent emergent economic areas. We intend to detect the general trends in the economic sectors and try to understand what explains it.

To conduct this case study, we extracted three datasets from Banco de Portugal. Each dataset corre-sponds to a year (2005, 2006 and 2007) and each one consists of 12 observations characterized by 9 aggregated indicators (number of companies, net income, investment rate, return on equity, net asset were standardized, using Z-scores, so all attributes could have the same importance in the computation of the clustering results. The adopted scheme to classify the activity sectors was CAE (Portuguese nomenclature  X  the principal activity sectors -, which corresponds to the top of CAE X  X  hierarchy and is composed by 17 sectors, namely:  X  A  X  Agriculture, hunting and forestry  X  B X  X ishery  X  C  X  Mining and quarrying  X  D  X  Manufacturing  X  E  X  Production and distribution of electricity, gas and water  X  F  X  Construction  X  G  X  Wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal goods  X  H  X  Hotels and restaurants (restaurants and similar)  X  I  X  Transport, storage and communications  X  J  X  Financial Activities  X  K  X  Real estate, renting and business services  X  L  X  Public administration, defense and "mandatory" social security  X  M  X  Education  X  N  X  Health and social work  X  O  X  Other community, social and personal activities  X  P  X  Activities of households with employed persons and production activities of households for own  X  Q  X  Organizations and extraterritorial institutions
However, we only have information available for 12 sectors. It should be noted that activity sectors and performance indicators are exactly the same, for all periods under analysis, which is a requirement for the application of MEC framework. In order to discover the clusters (input of our study) from these for the agglomerative hierarchical algorithm, us ing Ward X  X  method. The determination of the critical an useful and popular quality index for crisp clustering evaluation.

Some of the reasons behind the choice of the average silhouette width are the following: is one of the than, for instance, the Davies-Bouldin index [27]; and also because there are some guidelines about how area of clustering validation.

Afterwards, we applied our transition detection algorithm to the returned clusterings, setting a fi xed  X  =0 . 2 and  X  =0 . 6 , whose choice was guided by the previously presented thresholds X  sensitivity analysis. These thresholds values are more relaxed and allow the detection of a wider variety of transitions between clusters, are depicted in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3 we observe two bipartite graphs, one corre sponding to transitions e xperienced during time explained by the low number of observations. The com position of each cluster, in each year, is shown consulted in Tables 8, 9 and 10. These centroids are standardized so if they are negative it means that of the attribute. Concerning the transitions, in the former there were:  X  Survival (1) 4  X  C 2 (2005)  X  C 1 (2006)  X  Merge (1)  X  { C 1 (2005) ,C 3 (2005) }  X   X  C 2 (2006)
In the latter, we observe:  X  Survival (2) -C 1 (2006)  X  C 2 (2007) and C 2 (2006)  X  C 1 (2007)
To better understand the meaning of the detected changes, and since we have access to whole data, we to another during each considered time interval.

Survival of cluster C 2(2005) : In [2005 , 2006] cluster C2 was composed by only one activity sector and C  X  Mining and quarrying). If we analyze the economic and fi nancial indicators of this group we Portuguese market place, in 2006.
 Merge of clusters C 1(2005) and C 3(2005) into cluster C 2(2006) : In 2006 , activity sectors D  X  H -Hotels and restaurants (restaurants and similar) and I  X  Transport, storage and communication, from services, M  X  Education, N  X  Health and social work and O  X  Other community, social and personal remarkable improvement of the net income.
 Survival of cluster C 1(2006) : In 2006, cluster C1 was composed by activity sectors B, C and E. improved their economic and fi nancial performance, contrary to sector B, whose indicators remained unchanged.

Survival of cluster C 2(2006) : During [2006 , 2007] , some activity sectors leave cluster C 2(2006) , namely, sector F  X  Construction, K  X  Real estate, renting and business services and N  X  Health and to the improvement of the net income of these sectors.

In general, and bearing in mind the initial goal of this case study, we conclude that there were not considered years. However, we observe that there are some modi fi cations in this structure during time with medium and bad ones. The information acquired by this means can be used to perform a deeper economic analysis, once it uncovers and highlights the important issues of the studied problem. 4.3. Second case study  X  european companies The second case study was designed using fi nancial datasets, extracted from The Data Page of New York University  X  Leonard N. Stern School of Business, which contains fi nancial information on individual European companies. We chose datasets available for years 2003, 2004 and 2005. The data was preprocessed in order to remove missing values, remove outliers and select the best features to describe each company. After this preprocessing stage, each dataset consisted of 1071 observations, objects and attributes are exactly the same for 2003, 2004 and 2005. Experimental conditions are also the same, with the exception that we use k-means algorithm, instead of the agglomerative hierarchical fi nd clusters (or smaller clusters within the main clusters) which evolution can be seen as anomalous, and focus on the analysis of their characteristics. The unusual behavior may not necessarily be related rather, allow the discovery of interesting facts about the studied problem.

The datasets used in this case study seemed appropriate to test this approach, since there is more analysis, and we only keep the edges whose weights are considered low, since high weights are related 0 . conditions are highlighted in Fig. 4-(b), and are the following: Time interval [2003 , 2004] :  X  { C 3(2003) ,C 1(2004) }  X  { C 3(2003) ,C 2(2004) }  X  { C 3(2003) ,C 5(2004) }  X  { C 4(2003) ,C 3(2004) } Time interval [2004 , 2005] :  X  { C 1(2004) ,C 3(2005) }  X  { C 1(2004) ,C 4(2005) }  X  { C 3(2004) ,C 4(2005) } the corresponding industries, that migrate from one cluster to another. Then, we ordered the industries based on the frequency of appearance in these clusters and assumed that these industries are those who show rare behavior, ie, who strongly deviate from the general trends of evolution. Following this procedure we discovered that some companies who operate in industries such as Transport Marine, Retail-Apparel/Shoe, Electric Integrated, Paper &amp; Related products and Medical-Hospital, for time interval [2003 , 2004] , Apparel Manufacturers, Brewery, Real Estate Management and Services and considered time horizon, that may be related to possible merges or demerges of companies, bankrupts cannot be inferred based only on these datasets. It would be necessary more information, for example, provided by domain experts, newspapers or economic websites, to achieve more accurate conclusions about the distinct behavior of these industries. 5. Conclusions and future work
In this paper we introduced a framework for addressing the problem of monitoring the evolution of transitions between snapshotsof data. The process of detecting and characterizing these changesexplores of analysis can be used as means of gaining insights about important occurred events, such as splits,
As future work we are extending and evaluating Eq. (1) to fuzzy clusters structures. A step ahead is the development of similar methods to monitor the evolution of social networks, which we are starting now.
