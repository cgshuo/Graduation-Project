 Animal models for human diseases are of crucial importance for studying gene expression and regulation. In the last decade the developmen t of mouse models for cancer, dia-betes, neuro-degenerativ e and many other diseases has been on steady rise. Microarra y analysis of patterns of gene ex-pression in mouse models of various pathological types and the study of molecular level changes as a result of inter-ventions, holds lot of promise to the understanding of bi-ological processes involved. The genes which show normal variance across genetically identical mice are of particular interest because they could serve as a databank for possi-ble false positiv es in gene expression studies in similar kind of mice. Also they could provide useful insigh ts into the biological processes behind the di X eren tial expression pat-terns in otherwise similar mice. Our approac h systemat-ically remo ves variance due to experimen tal noise in each of the mice and then mines for normal variance among the identical mice.This analysis carried over six tissues sampled from mice, resulted in several genes which showed varia-tions among identical mice, thus enabling a comprehensiv e database of normal variations in gene expression for mouse models. A large number of these genes are known to be re-lated to stress response, hypertension and heat shock. Also Principal Comp onen t Analysis was done to visualize sim-ilarit y among the mice models and within the replicates. These studies help in the design of gene expression studies in mouse models and help in validation of the results. Keyw ords: gene expression, replicates, mouse models, nor-mal variance, immune response, hypertension, principal com-ponen t analysis High-throughput gene expression has become an importan t tool to study transcriptional activit y in a variety of bio-logical samples. Mouse models are playing an importan t role in the study of developmen tal biology , genetics, be-havior, and disease. To interpret experimen tal data, the exten t and diversity of gene expression for the system un-der study should be well characterized. An ubiquitous and  X  This work was supp orted in part by NSF CAREER Award IIS-0092978, DOE Early Career Award DE-F G02-02ER25538 and NSF grant EIA-0103708 under-appreciated problem in microarra y analysis is the in-cidence of microarra ys reporting non-equiv alent levels of an mRNA or the expression of a gene for a system under repli-cate experimen tal conditions. This is due to various sources of noise contributed by the technicalities of the experimen t and also biological variation. Statistical metho ds have been developed to determine the signi X cance of the fold changes observ ed between the test sample and normal sample, ac-coun ting for the noise. Unfortunately little is known about the normal variance of mouse gene expression in vivo or the noise in the microarra y data due to biological variation. Levels of several genes vary signi X can tly in more than one tissue. These variances in gene expression migh t be one of the reason for observing di X eren t phenot ypes of transgenic mice based on a di X eren t genetic background. These studies will help to de X ne the baseline level variabilit y in mouse gene expression and accen tuate the importance of replicated mi-croarra y experimen ts. Furthermore, the analysis is expected to expose some genes which have been reported previously as di X eren tially expressed because of pathological state or experimen tal variation. Also further study of these genes could lead us to useful insigh ts into the biology behind the normal gene expression variation, indep enden tly of genetics. The use of replicates in microarra y experimen ts is not very widely recognized because of the prohibitiv e costs and the time involved. However, the use of replicates is very impor-tant to develop more reliable and consisten t  X ndings. A sin-gle microarra y experimen t would contain signi X can t inher-ent noise. By pooling data from replicates, we can provide a more reliable classi X cation of gene expression [11]. Statisti-cal metho ds have been used for analyzing replicated cDNA microarra y experimen ts. The authors stress that replica-tion in microarra y studies is not equiv alent to duplication and hence is not a waste of scien ti X c resources. Experimen-tal replication is essen tial to reliable scien ti X c disco very in genetic researc h. [20] developed a mathematical model to estimate the number of replicates needed to provide data within acceptable error limits. [11] have modeled the e X ect of number of cultures, arrays, etc. on the variabilit y in the data (from preliminary experimen ts); target fold change in data and costs of experimen tal comp onen ts.
 Although wide range of study has gone into the use of repli-cates to minimize the e X ect of noise on the resultan t  X nd-ings, little researc h has gone into explaining the normal vari-ation of some genes in genetically similar species. [4] ana-lyzed the expression pro X le of normal male C57Bl6, C3H, Balb/c, DBA/2, and FVB mice, respectiv ely, to study the normal variance. In total, they pro X led gene expression of 75 mouse samples of 15 di X eren t individuals. They used a U74A mouse Gene array from A X ymetrix to quan tify tran-script levels in brain, liver, heart, spleen, and kidney in the  X ve genetic backgrounds. [16] assess natural di X erences in murine (i.e., mice/rats) gene expression, they used a 5406-clone spotted cDNA microarra y to quan tify transcript levels in the kidney , liver, and testis from each of 6 normal male C57BL6 mice. They use ANO VA to compare the variance across the six mice, to the variance among four replicate ex-perimen ts performed for each mouse tissue. For the 6 kidney samples, 102 of 3,088 genes (3.3%) exhibited a statistically signi X can t mouse variance at a level of 0.05. In the testis, 62 of 3,252 genes (1.9%) showed statistically signi X can t vari-ance, and in the liver, there were 21 of 2,514 (0.8%) genes with signi X can tly variable expression. Imm une-mo dulated, stress-induced, and hormonally regulated genes were highly represen ted among the transcripts that were most variable. The expression levels of several genes varied signi X can tly in more than one tissue. Natural variabilit y is also interest-ing from a biological standp oint. Inbred mouse populations allow us to study how gene expression varies without the e X ect of genot ypic variation.
 The analysis of the gene expression assays from three tis-sues in mouse (kidney , testis, and liver) have resulted in a set of genes which have been found to have normal physi-ological variance across the six mice. A large set of these genes are missing from a previous analysis carried out on the same datasets [16]. Also our metho d was tested on a dataset [12], where similar analysis was conducted using A X ymetrix oligo arrays. Our approac h resulted in  X nding of many genes which exhibited normal variance among three identical mice. This analysis was done over four mouse tis-sues (brain, heart, liver, lung). We found a good number of genes which are known to be involved in stress response and hypertension. Some of the genes have been reported in pre-vious studies as signi X can tly di X eren tially expressed, under di X eren t pathological conditions. This calls for further anal-ysis of these genes, before reporting them as di X eren tially ex-pressed genes in all further studies, involving study of gene expression in mice using microarra ys. Principal Comp onen t Analysis has been done to capture the variance in the data and provide a powerful tool to visualize the similarit y among the mice and within the replicates. We used three datasets of kidney , liver and testis available at http://www.pedb.org/MSM/NORMAL provided by [16]. Six ge-netically identical male C57BL6 mice were used to compare the expression values of 5,406 unique mouse genes. Four sep-arate microarra y assays were conducted for each organ from each animal, for a total of 24 arrays per organ. For half of the replicate arrays, the experimen tal RNA was labeled with the Cy3 dye and the reference RNA with the Cy5 dye; for the other half, the labeling scheme was reversed to control for any dye-based bias. Also the dataset of [12] was used which contained the expression values for three mice across the four organs of liver, heart, lung and brain. Each ex-perimen t was replicated three times. A X ymetrix oligo chips were used in these experimen ts.
 In ideal conditions, the gene expression values for each gene should be the same across all array experimen ts. But due to the technical limitations the data contains lot of inheren t noise, which could also be due to normal variation in expres-sion of the genes across the genetically identical male mice. Our goal is to extract those genes which are contributing to the noise due to their biological variance.
 In our paper, we try to capture the genes which show vari-ance among the identical mice, by trying to eliminate the variations which come in due to experimen tal errors and  X  X ctuations. We use a very robust metho d to exclude genes, which would eliminate any considerable variance in the repli-cates. Our approac h is based on the following steps: 1) Cal-culation of fold-c hange ratio and discretization of expression levels for each gene, 2) Elimination of experimen tal noise, 3) Constructing an expression pro X le for each gene, and 4) Calculating and raking by gene variabilit y via entropy cal-culation. We describ e the steps in more detail below. We assume that we have n genes, in m mice, with r repli-cates for each mice, for a given tissue. We denote gene i as g i . Let S i t denote the expression level for gene g the test sample and S i r the expression of g i in the reference microarra y samples. We de X ne fold-change ratio as the log-odds ratio of the expression intensities of the test sample over the reference sample, given as log 2 ( S i t S i variabilit y, we discretize the fold-c hange into k bins rang-ing from very low expression levels to very high expression levels. The data is normalized in such a way that the me-dian of the deviation from the median was set to the same value for the distribution of all the log-ratios on each ar-ray [16]. Similar analysis was done for the A X ymetrix data. The raw data containing the intensities was median centered and scaled by the standard deviation. This normalization technique was chosen after experimen ting with other meth-ods like linear regression and mean centering. Though none of these metho ds yielded a normal distribution for the his-togram plot of the gene expression values of all clones in a sample, the median centered normalization technique per-formed the best and also provided a uniform distribution for our binning metho d.
 If the number of bins for expression level discretization is too small or too high, then it leads to problems in analysis. In coarse binning, the information about the values is ignored, and in a very  X ne binning, the patterns are lost. We tried several values of k and found that k = 5 works well. The bin intervals are determined using the uniform frequency binning metho d. Other popular metho ds like discriminan t discretization, boolean reasoning based and entropy based discretization can be considered [13]. In frequency binning metho d we discretized the relativ e expression (fold-c hange) into 5 levels depending on their expression value. The values of -1.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, and 1.5 for the fold change ratio were taken as thresholds for very low (VL), low (L), normal (N), high (H), and very high (VH) expression, respectiv ely. That H 2 [0 : 5 ; 1 : 5), and V H 2 [1 : 5 ; + 1 ). We use the notation g to denote the expression level for gene g i in a given replicate, where e 2 f V L; L; N; H; V H g . The binning strategy used in the case of A X ymetrix data was slightly di X eren t. Since the distribution was not symmetric the intervals too were optimized such that the number of genes falling within each bin was roughly the same. Histogram plots were constructed for all the samples to analyze for the distribution patterns. High (H), Very Low (VL), Low (L) or Normal (N) The expression levels were binned in the following 4 intervals [  X 1 ;  X  0 : 1), [  X  0 : 1 ; 0), [0 ; 0 : 3), [0 : 3 ; 1 ]. Explaining the metho d for the  X rst dataset with the help of an example, let us consider the expression of 4 genes in six mice with 4 array replicates in each, as shown in Table 1. The analysis of the second dataset also emplo ys the same metho dology , only that the initial binning step is slightly varian t. In order to eliminate the noise due to experimen tal  X  X ctu-ations, we process the data taking one mice at a time. For every mice the genetic expression signatures are obtained and compared across all r replicates. Only those genes which show consisten t expression signature in all r replicates are chosen and the ones which show even a slight deviation in any of the replicates are eliminated. This metho dology takes a very stringen t approac h towards eliminating even the slightest errors due to technical noise. One shortcoming of this approac h is that it would not eliminate any genes which show high  X  X ctuations in the range (  X  0 : 5 ; 0 : 5) . In our study of normal variance to identify genes which have been falsely reported as di X eren tially expressed, the genes which we migh t fail to eliminate do not contribute to the databank anyway, because they lie in the normal expression range. So, our approac h would eliminate most of the noise which comes due to technical/exp erimen tal issues. This op-eration is done on all m mice, as a result of which we have gene expression signatures in all the mice with minimal ex-perimen tal noise.
 Table 2: Gene expressions after elimination of experimen tal noise Table 2, illustrates this process on our example data. For example consider Mouse1. Since gene g 4 is di X eren tially expressed as L in replicate 1, but as N in the other three replicates, we eliminate g 4 from further consideration. The resulting expression signatures for Mouse1 and other mice from our example are shown in Table 2. Let F j represen t the gene expressions of the j -th mice after the elimination of experimen tal noise. The F j 's contain the expression level (very high, high, normal, low, very low) in-formation of each gene in each of the m mice in our example. Some values could be missing due to elimination in the  X rst stage. The F j values, for our example of six mice, are shown in Table 2.
 From the F j values we construct a frequency table, which contains the number of occurrences of each gene for each dis-cretized expression level (VH, H, N, L, VL). The frequency of every distinct (gene g i , expression level e ) pair across all F , is used to populate the frequency table. The frequency for gene g i and expression level e is given as f i e = P where m is the number of mice, and  X  i e ( j ) is a characteristic function that notes the presence/absence of gene g i at level e in mouse j , de X ned as:  X  i e ( j ) = 1, if g i e 2 F j if g i e 62 F j . The frequency table obtained for our example is shown in Table 3. As an example, g 2 , has expression level V L in mice 1 and 2, level N in mice 3 and 4, and level H in mice 5 and 6. Thus the expression pro X le for g 2 is given by the vector (0 ; 2 ; 2 ; 0 ; 2), as shown in the table. Table 3: Expression Pro X le: Frequency table for the four genes The genes that show presence in more than one discrete level are of interest to us. The frequency table is analyzed further to identify those genes which show considerable vari-ance by their presence in more than one state. To capture the variance in a gene's expression level, the entropy mea-sure was used. Entropy gives us the amoun t of disorder in the expression values of a gene, and thus is a measure of the normal variance, since the noise due to experimen tal varia-tion is eliminated prior to this step. The entropy measure for a gene g i is given as follows, E ( g i ) =  X  P k e =1 where k is the number of discrete expression levels, and p is the probabilit y of gene g i having expression level e , which is given as p i e = f i e By de X nition of entropy, if a gene has only one expression level (say j ), then p i j = 1 and E ( g i ) = 0. On the other hand, if a gene has the most variance (i.e., equal occurrence at each expression level), then P i j = 1 =k for all expression levels j , and E ( g i ) =  X  P k j =1 1 =k log 2 (1 =k ) =  X  log log 2 ( k ). In our approac h genes with entropy 0, i.e., those having no variance in expression across the mice, are dis-carded, and the remaining genes are ranked in descending order of their entropy (and thus variance). The entropy ranking for the four genes (along with the probabilit y of each expression level) in our example are shown in Table 4. Gene g 2 and g 3 are of most interest to us because they show variation in expression states across the six mice. On the other hand gene g 1 is always high in all six mice, showing no variance. In our approac h to experimen tal noise elimination, any gene with varying expression level among the replicates is con-sidered experimen tal noise, and eliminated. Instead of such a stringen t approac h, we can choose to retain a gene pro-vided it has the same expression level in a given fraction of the replicates. For instance, gene g 4 has expression level N in three out of the four replicates for Mouse1. If we set our threshold to 75%, then we would retain g 4 N in the gene expression for Mouse1 in Table 2.
 Another approac h is to construct a weighted expression sig-nature, as follows: For every gene we record the fraction of the replicates in which it takes a particular value. For in-stance, for Mouse1, gene g 1 always takes the value V H , so its weighted expression is g 1 V H (1 : 0) . On the other hand, gene g 4 is N in three and L in one out of the four replicates; we by w i e ( j ) the weight of gene g i at expression level e in Mouse j . Table 5 shows the weighted expression signatures for all the six mice (note: if the weight is 1 : 0 we omit the weight; From the weighted gene expressions, we can construct a weighted pro X le using the approac h in Section 2.3. The weighted frequency for gene g i and expression level e is given as f i e = P m j =1 w i e ( j ), where m is the number of mice. The weighted frequency table obtained for our example is shown in Table 6. As an example, g 4 , has expression levels N (0 : 75) in Mouse1, N (1 : 0) in Mouse2, N (0 : 75) in Mouse3 and Mouse4, and N (0 : 5) in Mouse6. Thus f 4 N = 0 : 75 + 1 : 0 + 2  X  0 : 75 + 0 : 5 = 3 : 75, and similarly f 4 L = 2 : 25. Thus the weighted expression pro X le for g 4 is given by the vector (0 ; 0 ; 3 : 75 ; 2 : 25 ; 0), as shown in the table. From the weighted expression pro X le, we can deriv e the entropy-based variabilit y ranking for each gene as shown in Table 7. Comparing with Table 4, we  X nd that g 3 is ranked higher in terms of variabilit y than g 2 , but the overall trend is similar. PCA [7] is a classical technique to reduce the dimensional-ity of the data set by transforming to a new set of variables (the principal comp onen ts). It has been used in the analy-sis of gene expression studies. Principal comp onen ts (PC's) are uncorrelated and ordered such that the k -th PC has the k -th largest variance among all PC's. The k -th PC can be interpreted as the direction that maximizes the variation of the projections of the data points such that it is orthogonal to the  X rst k  X  1 PC's. PCA is sometimes applied to re-duce the dimensionalit y of the data set prior to clustering. Using PCA prior to cluster analysis may aid better extrac-tion of the cluster structure in the data set. Since PC's are uncorrelated and ordered, the  X rst few PC's, which contain most of the variations in the data, are usually used in clus-ter analysis. Unless external information is available, [19] recommend cautious interpretation of any cluster structure observ ed in the reduced dimensional subspace of the PC's. They observ e no clear trend between the number of princi-pal comp onen ts chosen and the cluster qualit y. [6] use PCA analysis for extracting tissue speci X c signatures. In this paper we use PCA to analyze how well the genes we have extracted capture the normal variance between the mice, eliminating the variance due to any other sources to the maxim um possible exten t. Projection on to a 3-dimension space (the top three PCs) allows for better vi-sualization of the entire data set. Figure 1 shows the ar-rangemen t of the samples by plotting them on the princi-pal comp onen ts deriv ed from: 1) PCA analysis of all the genes in the dataset, and 2) PCA analysis of only those genes which were found to have normal variance across mice. These plots are shown for all the three tissues under study . Kidney and testis show non-random arrangemen t of the as-say points while liver has less discernible patterns. As dis-cussed in the next section, we observ ed that 1) the experi-mental replicates belonging to any single mice cluster close to each other, and 2) the mice (biological replicates) are also group ed into visible clusters. Pathologically similar mice are clustered together.
 We applied our entropy-based metho d to detect normal vari-ance in gene expression for the two datasets taken from [16] and [12]. Due to lack of space we give a detailed accoun t only for the  X rst dataset, and show some results on the latter in the Appendix. For the kidney tissue, Table 9 shows the genes that were previously unrep orted as having di X eren tial expression, Ta-ble 10 shows the list of genes that were previously reported as varying by [16] and also con X rmed by our entropy-based approac h, and Table 8 shows the genes that were reported as varying by [16] but not found by our analysis. We missed some previously known varying genes due to our stringen t elimination of any gene that shows variable expression in di X eren t experimen ts. We veri X ed that all these genes were dropp ed in our experimen tal noise elimination step. Table 8: Uncon X rmed previously reported varying genes (Kidney) In kidney tissue around 3.5% of the 3088 genes where found to be showing considerable variance across the six mice. As reported by [16] we found several immune modulated and stress responsiv e genes. Apart from Cish (reported pre-viously), other hypertension related genes like Asah1 and Adrb2 were found to show di X eren tial expression across the six mice. Adrb2 and Asah1 are well known rat hypertension-associated homologue also known to be play a role in hyper-tension in humans. Also the gene Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (Drosophila)) was found to be di X eren tially ex-pressed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeted against Ezh2 reduce the amoun ts of Ezh2 protein presen t in prostate cells and also inhibit cell proliferation in vitro. Ectopic expression of Ezh2 in prostate cells induces tran-scriptional repression of a speci X c cohort of genes [14]. A gene from the solute carrier family Slc12a2, was found to be having high normal variance among the six mice. Many of the solute carrier genes are known to be involved in hy-pertension. Shoc2, involved in shock response and Itga3, a immune response related gene were also found to be di X er-entially expressed. This could be due to the varying physi-ological state of the mice at the time of killing. These genes were also reported by [16]. Also Psmd7, a programmed cell death protein, was found to be variably expressed among the six mice. In liver tissue 23 out of 2513 genes, show signi X can t vari-ation in their expression levels among the six mice. CisH and cyp4a14 were also found showing high variance in the liver tissues as we had observ ed in the kidney . CXADR, a target for experimen tal gene therapies for cancer [9], has been found to be considerably varying in gene expression among the mice. NeuroD2 was found to exhibit di X eren tial expression levels among the six mice. Its associated protein is necessary for developmen t and surviv al of central nervous system neurons [15]. Over expression of Hoxb6 [8] produces early postnatal death with craniofacial and axial anomalies, especially in the cervical region. Hoxb6 is expressed in lung of 14 day old mouse embryos, declining in level with gesta-tional age but still presen t at birth [3]. Hoxb6 is involved in transcription factor complexes and has found to be nor-mally varying. Also Ncor2, a nuclear receptor co-repressor 2 was found to be variably expressing, It performs combina-torial roles of the nuclear receptor co-repressor in transcrip-tion and developmen t. A heat shock protein, Hspa9a, was also found to be variably expressing. The liver was found to have the least amoun t of genes whose expressions levels varied considerably . Out of the 3252 genes analyzed in the testis tissue, 63 were found to be showing di X eren tial expression levels across the six mice. R1p2, a normally varying gene in our analysis is known to be involved in the developmen tal stages of mouse [10]. Nr4a2 a nuclear receptor and RAC3 a co-activ ator for nuclear/steroid receptors have been found to be dif-feren tially expressing. [18] show that mouse RAC3 is ex-pressed in a tissue-sp eci X c fashion and distributed mainly in the oocytes; they found that the steroid receptor co-activ ator SRC-3 (p/ CIP/ RAC3/ AIB1/ ACTR/ TRAM-1) is required for normal growth, puberty, female repro ductiv e function, and mammary gland developmen t. We hypothe-size that RAC3 could play an importan t role in the devel-opmen t of testis as well. Map/Erk kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activ ate the Erk/MAP kinases and have been impli-cated in cell growth and di X eren tiation. [1] have observ ed that MEK2 RNA message is expressed at high levels in all embryonic tissues examined, including all neural tissues, and liver. MEK1, on the other hand, is expressed at very low levels in most embryonic murine tissue but can be detected in developing skeletal muscle. RELNOC was another pro-tein kinase which was found to be di X eren tially expressing among the six mice. Cox8a is another importan t and well studied gene involved in electron transp ort which was found to be di X eren tially expressing among the mice.
 Importan tly, many of the genes that we found to vary nor-mally have been reported previously to be di X eren tially ex-pressed because of a pathological process or experimen tal
Table 9: Previously unrep orted genes with normal variance (Kidney)
Table 10: Previously reported (common) varying genes (Kidney) intervention. One recen t study used microarra ys to inves-tigate the di X eren tial gene expression patterns during pre-implan tation mouse developmen t [10]. Rpl12 was reported to be di X eren tially expressed while we found it to be nor-mally varying in the testis tissue. PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) feeding can in X  X ence Protein Kinase C (PKC) activit y [2]. Itrp1 is another gene which has been reported as di X eren tially expressed [5] in papillary thyroid carcinoma, while we found this gene to be normally varying in kid-ney tissues. Another study investigated the e X ects of acet-aminophen on gene expression in the mouse liver [17]. Eight of the genes reported to di X er in response to acetaminophen, including CisH2, and Hsp40, were genes we found to vary normally . Examining the PCA plots visually gives us a good idea of how our approac h has faired (see Figure 1). In the case of capturing normal variance in kidney tissue, our metho d was able to separate the noisy data and group the assays into distinguishable clusters. By eliminating the experimen-tal noise we expect the replicates to form a close group for each of the mice. In the case of the kidney tissue for genes with normal variance, the assays arrange into two clusters. One of the clusters has assays which include the replicates from four mice (M1, M2, M5, M6), while the other clus-ter has mice M3 and M4. This indicates that there is a high similarit y among these mice in kidney tissue. Similar results were obtained after the analysis of testis tissue. However the same mice did not cluster together as those from the kidney analysis. This shows that the normal expression patterns are tissue speci X c and cannot be generalized on the whole. In the case of liver tissue no clear patterns were visible on performing the PCA analysis. To summarize, kidney gene expression patterns from the third and the fourth mice are fundamen tally di X eren t from the other ones. In the testis, the  X rst two mice are systematically di X eren t from the last four mice. No pattern was observ ed in liver. PCA can be ad-ditionally used as a platform to compare the performance of di X eren t metho dologies to determine normal variance. The performance can be judged visually on the basis how well the replicates cluster together or measure the goodness of the clusters. We applied our entropy-based metho dology on the A X ymetrix dataset from [12]. Some of the genes showing normal vari-ance for Lung tissue are shown in Table 11. Similar results were obtained for other tissues (Brain, Heart, Liver); we omit the results due to lack of space. The metho dology followed here has signi X can t advantages over the ANO VA analysis [16] used on the same datasets. One of the main advantages being that this metho d is very robust to outliers. By binning the expression values we are minimizing the e X ect of a few outliers as far as possible. The possible use of even a single outlier skews the F-statistic thus giving a false positiv e for di X eren tially expressing genes in normal identical mice. But the binning metho dology seems to give an unfair advantage to those genes which fall in the center of the bins (more variance allowed), over the ones which lie close to the interval boundaries. The inter-val boundaries on inspection, revealed very few genes exist-ing near the bin interval cuts. We found many more genes which showed higher variabilit y than those reported in the existing database. Also it has been observ ed that the genes which were missing from our results were eliminated during the  X rst step of pruning where genes showing the slightest experimen tal variation were eliminated. If the data is ex-tremely noisy , containing high levels of both experimen tal and biological variance, or if the number of experimen ts is large, this pruning step migh t eliminate most of the genes. To avoid this, the weighted pro X le metho d can be used to characterize the variance. Also the underlying assumptions about the distributions of the populations and the indep en-dence of the samples, required by the ANO VA analysis, are not necessary for our metho dology . Since our metho dology makes use of the frequency distributions in the bins, the entropy measure calculated can be compared across vari-ous experimen tal setups. The dependence on the size of the experimen ts (number of experimen tal and biological repli-cates) is less compared to the F-statistic measure. Our approac h to identify genes which show signi X can t vari-ation in their expression levels among the six mice has re-sulted in a set of stress response and hypertension genes which where not found in a earlier work [16] . Sah, Cox, Cyp4a series of genes are well studied hypertension related genes. This has been observ ed in spite of stringen t crite-ria to eliminate experimen tal noise. Also the percen tage of the genes which show normal variance are found to be ex-actly the same as the ones obtained in the earlier work even though the approac hes followed by the two authors is totally di X eren t. This was observ ed at signi X cance levels of two fold for the log2 based ratios. Similar analysis was done with higher signi X cance values which resulted in fewer numbers of genes to be normally varying. These set of genes represen t stronger candidates showing normal variance in their expres-sion levels. The approac h though simple in nature seems to perform considerably well and there is around 65% overlap in the results of this approac h and the earlier one which is considered as a benchmark for studying normal variance in mice. Also a vast number of normally varying genes genes where found from the [12] dataset in brain, heart and lung tissues. These are ranked on the basis of the entropy mea-sure and depending on the user needs the database can be referred for top x% of the normally varying genes found. Ap-proximately 4% of the 15,000 clone id's presen t on the chip seem to exhibit normal variance among the identical mice in all of these tissues. Quite a few of these genes have been re-ported as di X eren tially expressed in gene expression studies under various pathological conditions. The authors suggest caution to investigators in the case where they observ e these genes to be varying in their analysis. Further quan ti X cation studies need to be done before reporting them. Also the analysis can be convenien tly modi X ed to  X nd the control genes which show negligible variance, which could be useful for normalization techniques which make use of the control genes. Also PCA could o X er a powerful visualization tool to see which of the mice or the replicates are systematically similar to each other. We observ ed that the third and the fourth mice were very di X eren t from the other four in the kidney tissue. In the testis the  X rst two mice were systemat-ically di X eren t from the other four. In liver no clear pattern was discernible. This leads us to believe that normal vari-ance is tissue speci X c.
