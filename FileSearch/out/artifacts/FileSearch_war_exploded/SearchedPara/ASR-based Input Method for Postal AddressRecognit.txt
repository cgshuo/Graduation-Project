 The market of postal services in China has increased significantly over past few decades. According to National Bureau of Statistics of the People X  X  Republic of China, the total number of workforce behind this market has reached beyond 700,000 people outputting a total delivery of mail and packages of more than 61 billion pieces annually. In order to provide a more reliable postal service in such a large scale, postal tracking for mail and packages has become a standard service provided by many of the shipping and postal companies today. However, to enable such service, the shipping and postal companies often need to first hire logistic information system before enabling the tracking service.
 address input in Chinese. According to the hand written address provided by insufficient because keyboard based Pinyin input method is slow, and Pinyin to Hanzi conversion is not perfect. Furthermore, any error made during this data entry process will introduce additional costs to the service provider. of entering Chinese postal address based on using automatic speech recognition technology (ASR). A new ASR-based input method, namely Voice Postal Input (VPI) system, built from this research, will provide a faster and more accura-cy input method compare to traditional keyboard typing. Therefore, shipping service providers can lower the costs needed to hire large number of typist. Ul-timately, this will translate to a cheaper shipping service for everyone in China. To our knowledge, this will be the first attempt, both in academic and commer-cial settings, to apply ASR technology to postal address recognition in Chinese Mandarin. Our experiment results have proven the feasibility of our approach, and have shown that high recognition accuracy can be achieved. Data entry process has always been human intensive and time consuming. Es-pecially in Chinese language, typing in Chinese has been a difficult task due to the nature of the language[1]. Because of its facility to learn and use, Pinyin is by far the most popular keyboard input method in China [1]. However, Pinyin input suffers from several challenges. It is slow in terms of input speed compared to voice [2], and the Pinyin to Hanzi character conversion is error prone due to typographical errors during typing and the conversion itself is far from perfect [3]. There are 410 syllables in Chinese and they correspond to over 6000 common Chinese characters. This implies that on average, each syllable corresponds to about 17 characters. As the result, a Chinese typist must then select a choice correct character from the list [4].
 contains 4.2 Roman characters. Based on a skilled typist, an average keystroke about 840 ms. An extra time of 450 to 600 ms is also required to identify the correct choice of character from the pinyin candidate lists [4]. Finally, the total time spend to type a Chinese character with Pinyin input method would then fall into the range of 1290 ms to 1440 ms per character.
 method by voice therefore is proposed. An ASR-based input method will avoid the typographical errors from user as well as the error-prone Pinyin to Hanzi conversion. Knowing that speech is the most effective and fastest form of human communication [6], ASR-based input method will introduce significant improve-ment to postal address entry process. The Voice Postal Input (VPI) system we created is based on client-server based software architecture where the client captures the audio data from end user, and the computational intensive speech recognition resides on the server. Our server end integrated with two of the most popular ASR products for Chinese Mandarin, namely iFLyTek Voice Cloud and Nuance Recognizer. Although iFly-Tek Voice Cloud has been successfully integrated into many products in China, and has proven to have high recognition accuracy for open speech dictation [5], but it is lacking the flexibility for the developer to customize a language model for a domain specific task. In later section, we will show customizing a language model becomes very in postal address recognition. Nuance Recognizer, on the other hand, gives the developer the ability to customize a language model for domain specific task. For flexibility and future studies, our VPI system can easily be expanded to include any additional recognizer from its server end. we also introduced a process named Geo-Topology Realignment (GTR) which takes the recognition results as an input, and makes corrections to possible mis-recognitions through the knowledge learned from the Chinese geographical topol-ogy. GTR correlates the relationship between province, city, district and street information and form a geographical topology offline. When GTR receives the string against the knowledge from this topology to identify possible invalid ad-dress combinations and makes correction accordingly. Finally, the output of GTR will be sent back to the web client and will be presented as final result. 4.1 Evaluation Data Set The evaluation data used to test the VPI system consists of 5170 recordings. Each audio recording contains exactly one postal address randomly picked from 150 thousand valid postal addresses collected. Each postal address is read out by both male and female voice in official Chinese Mandarin without carrying any local accent. The recording session was done in a control environment with minimal background noise, and each participant was asked to speak with their normal speaking rate. Due to the business requirement from postal companies, house numbers were to be ignored. This evaluation data set is used throughout this paper to provide consistent measurements and meaningful comparisons between different processes and features. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics Two common methods were used to evaluate the performance of recognition accuracy. word accuracy, W Acc which is derived from Levenstein distance, or Edit Distance, is used to measure word level accuracy, and Sentence Accuracy, S Acc , is used to measure how well the recognizer perform in terms of the whole address. geographical level, the following metrics are also introduced each measuring the accuracy at province, city, district and street level respectively.  X  P Acc word accuracy at province level only  X  C Acc word accuracy at city level only  X  D Acc word accuracy at district level only  X  St Acc word accuracy at street level only 5.1 Using Open Speech Recognition In first attempt, we first establish a baseline from using iFLyTek Voice Cloud. Using such an open-speech recognizer, our system suffers from confusing similar or identical sound characters. In extreme cases, out-of-context vocabularies, in this case, being the non-postal address related words, are found in the recognition result. Table below shows some of the errors produced by iFlyTek Voice Cloud. ilar or identical street names such as  X   X   X   X   X  with  X   X   X   X   X  while both being valid street names. In I-2,  X   X   X   X   X  with  X   X   X   X   X  were phonetically identical words. However, the term  X   X   X   X   X  would most likely not to be a name of a street because of the term  X   X   X   X  does not make much sense in Chinese language. Case I-3 and I-4 suffers the similar misrecognition issues. I-7 and I-8 demonstrate more severe errors where terms like  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X  , which makes very little sense in Chinese language, and are out of context of postal address, were found in the recognition result. We observed that iFlyTek Voice Cloud, being an open-speech recognizer, is trying to predict a sequence of words which are most likely to generate the observed a-coustic feature without specifically considering the postal address context. More specifically, a character like  X   X   X  and  X   X   X  , which are phonetically identical, was misrecognized since  X   X   X  is a more popular character in Chinese language. Since open speech recognizer such as iFlyTek Voice Cloud is designed to handle common Chinese vocabularies. As a result, Chinese common terms such as  X   X   X   X  ,  X   X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X  might appear many times in its training cor-characters appears in Chinese postal address. 5.2 Customized SLM for Postal Address Recognition We further investigate on recognition performance using Nuance Recognizer, and to explore the benefits of ngram customization. In a domain specific task such as postal address recognition, being able to customize the language model become useful because it gives a better approximation on priori probability of how words ngram customization is to train a language model with words only appeared like the city  X   X   X   X   X  will have a higher probability compare to a similar sounding term  X   X   X   X   X   X  which was previously produced as a misrecognition by iFlyTek Voice Cloud.
 as a feature. In the case of Chinese postal address, we take the complete province, city, district or street name such as the province  X   X   X   X   X  , or the district  X   X   X   X   X  as a Chinese word. These two language models were generated from 150 thousand valid postal addresses in China. Good-turing smoothing technique was applied to both language models. Table below shows the recognition results from our character bigram model, and word bigram model.
 recognition. However, when model with character as feature, the recognizer still tends to produce errors with characters sound very similar to each other, and performs poorly compare to word bigram model. For instance, ID N1 of table x.x, the street name  X   X   X   X   X  sounds similar to  X   X   X   X   X  , a character bi-gram model have seen both the term  X   X   X   X  , and  X   X   X   X  as well as  X   X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X  . Using Baidu  X  s search result as a measuring baseline, the term  X   X   X   X  occurred 77 million times in the search result, and the term  X   X   X   X  appeared 8.3 million times.  X   X   X   X  appeared 330 thousand times, and  X   X   X   X  appeared 85 million times. A character bigram model favors the more popular term of  X   X   X   X   X  over the less popular  X   X   X   X   X  , which leads to a misrecog-nition. Similarly,  X   X   X   X  can be found 16 million times from Baidu  X  s search result compared to the less popular  X   X   X   X  appearing 865 thousand times in the result. Using character as a feature lacks of the contextual information of the previous postal address term. A word bigram model overcome the errors produced by the character bigram. For example, knowing the city name being  X   X   X   X   X  can help to increase the probability of street name  X   X   X   X   X  over the street name of  X   X   X   X   X  because  X   X   X   X   X  never appeared in the city  X   X   X   X  .  X  Similar cases can be found for street name  X   X   X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X   X  , and the district and street combination of  X   X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X   X  X   X   X  5.3 Geo-Topology Realignment A word bigram model significantly improve the recognition accuracy. However, due to the lack of geographical knowledge, ngram model still suffers from some of the mis-recognition errors listed below. We have identified the following five major types of mis-recognition errors from our bigram model.
 C1 -Invalid address combination C2 -Similar sounding words C3 -Missing words C4 -Encoding issue C5 -Other errors To tackle the misrecognition errors from our ngram model, a geo-topology was nodes, 1320 city level nodes, 30972 district level nodes and 103446 street level nodes were created with appropriate links between each level of nodes in the geo-topology. This geo-topology forms a set of rules to validate the recongition result, and to correct possible misrecognition errors based on the relation between each node in the geo-topology. Two correction methods below are designed for the GTR process.  X  Skip Match. If two words, w x , w y in the recognized string can match to 5.4 Overall Recognition Accuracy We consolidate our experiment results and provide a summary on recognition accuracy using different techniques below.
 poorly with a word level accuracy of 87.79%. In experiment iFlyTek+GTR, GTR is applied to the results from iFlyTek Voice Cloud, there is about 2% absolute im-provement is observed. When GTR is applied to the results produced by Nuance Recognizer with a customized word bigram (Experiment Word.Bigram+GTR), there is approximately 4% absolute improvement compare to the original bigram results reaching 96.54%. is observed when GTR is applied to the results produced by both iFlyTek and word bigram model achieving 96.93% word accuracy rate, and with the sentence accuracy is at 85.07%. This means for every 100 addresses inputted using VPI system, only about 15 addresses will contain errors. There is less than 1% that the misrecognition error will occur at province or city level, and about 2% chance to 93.57%. 5.5 Speed Performance As described earlier in this section, our VPI system consists of a web client to GTR. Separate measurements have been taken for each of the individual sub-task, including: t 1 time it takes to read an address t 2 transmission time for voice data from client to server t 3 processing time required by iFlyTek Voice Cloud t 4 processing time required by Nuance Recognizer t 5 processing time required by GTR t 6 transmission time of results from server to client A complete breakdown of VPI system processing time is shown in table below. derives from the average process time of 8390 ms for an 11 character Chinese postal address. VPI system performance can further be enhanced. Current ver-sion of runs the speech recognition in serial process, meaning it will run iFlyTek first and wait for the recognition complete before running Nuance Recognizer. This workflow can be further improved by running both iFlyTek and Nuance recognition in parallel with a multithreaded module. It is estimated that 1951 ms of processing time can be saved. In addition, audio streaming allows further time saving. Instead of spending 2682 ms to record an input, audio streaming allows VPI system to start capturing voice data and start the recognition pro-cess right away. With a buffer size of 1 second, audio streaming will send the recorded data to server every second. This will also significantly cut down the processing time of VPI system. By entering postal address through voice using VPI system, the data entry person is estimated to be 33.15% -63% faster than by using traditional keyboard with Pinyin input based on the estimation of 1129 ms per character typing speed for an average user [4]. We focuses on implementing an ASR-based input system for Chinese postal the commercial settings. With a proper language model trained specifically with address specific data, and integrating geo-topology knowledge, the VPI system is able to achieve very high recognition accuracy. On the other hand, using VPI system, the input rate per character is estimated to be 762 ms per character, which is about 33% faster compare to keyboard based Pinyin input method. To our knowledge, our ASR-based input method is the first attempt ever to applied speech recognition accuracy in the domain of postal address recognition. The implication of this work is that using speech as an input for Chinese postal address is indeed feasible. Shipping and postal companies in China can use VPI system to improve their data entry process to reduce operation costs. Ultimately, people in China can also be benefitted with a cheaper shipping service due to such reduction.
