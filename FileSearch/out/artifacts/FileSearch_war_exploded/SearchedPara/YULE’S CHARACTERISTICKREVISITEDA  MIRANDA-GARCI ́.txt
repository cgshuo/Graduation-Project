 A. MIRANDA-GARCI  X  A 1 and J. CALLE-MARTI  X  N 2 1. Introduction In itself, stylistics stands out as a solid field of research and has traditionally been the basis for critical studies of literary works, but it was mathematical linguistics that steadily introduced the quantitative component resulting from the computation of textual features. This task was eased with the advent of computers, which facilitated the handling of texts as well as originated new statistical models, procedures, techniques and specific software. The quan-titative analyses that they provide have favoured, directly or indirectly, non-traditional authorship studies, some times for literary purposes, and others for the sake of justice reports. At first, the Gordian knot of these studies was lexical richness itself and a glance at the numerous studies reviewed by Tweedie and Baayen (1998, pp. 323 X 352) reveals the numerous attempts to find a constant to measure the level of lexical richness accurately. values mostly depend on text length and, on account of their number and variety, they can be classified in terms of their objective, be it lexical richness or lexical repetition. To the long list of constants to determine the level of lexical richness and repetition in a text, and to help accomplish authorship attribution studies, we must add those procedures based on p.c.a., weighted cusums, determinant analysis, etc., and the subsequent clustering, matching, chronological sequencing of the texts under scrutiny (complete works or fragments).
 characteristic) in authorship attribution, either in isolation or together with other constants, in this paper we will review the value of the so-often cited K from a formal perspective, as its authority to measure lexical repetition has been accepted since Yule X  X  contribution (Yule, 1944).
 the TACT-generated figures for K using the corresponding formula, and thus provide The Old English Concordancer with that constant (Miranda-Garc X   X  a et al ., 2004). The try-and-check work on the various expressions of the for-mula allowed us to ground reasonable doubts about the lack of normaliza-tion of some figures for K published in recent issues of Computers and the Humanities (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998; Smith and Kelly, 2002; Somers and Tweedie, 2003; Hoover, 2003). It is, perhaps, this lack of standardization the reason for the inaccurate results generated by TACT, information made explicitly known by Hoover when he states that  X  X  X he figures for K in Table I are independently calculated rather than taken from TACT X  X , thus thanking the advice of the reviewers of the journal for pointing out that  X  X  X he figures for K that TACT produces are erroneous X  X  (2003, pp. 173 X 174).
 the relevant literature, as the following instances show. We may consider valid the figures for K plotted in Figures 3, 5, 9 X 14 in (Tweedie and Baayen X  X  article 1998, pp. 333 X 345), where the origin of the y -axis starts at 80/90. This same argument may be used for the figures in Tables I and II and their plotting in Figure 2 (Smith and Kelly 2002, p. 417), where the value for K ranges from 27 through 37. See also Table 1 in Hoover (2003, p. 155) wherein the figures range from 82.734 through 92.6514 (Hoover, 2003, p. 155). However, Somers and Tweedie (2003, p. 418) cannot plot the value of sample C1 in Figure 1 because  X  X  X it] has a value for K of 162572, and thus is off the scale of the graph at the top X  X . Although it may be at first daring to question this value without knowing the specific text length ( N ), it should be noted that the authors can hardly obtain this value unless TACT has been employed and, more importantly, a top high-repetition text is involved. Perhaps, it is more plausible to think that 162574 is not the value for K but for Z , as the y -axis scale has been mistakenly located instead of that of x , and vice versa. As a matter of fact, the comparison of this figure with those cited above confirms it, since the experimental data indicate that the range of Z is always a 10 3 multiple.
 288 far-reaching nature. One of them has to do with the misinterpretation of the data, often leading to erroneous conclusions. The other is concerned with the use of results for comparative purposes inasmuch as, if ill-founded, they are not suitable for a further comparison with those obtained by other researchers. For all these reasons, we consider that a kind of normalization would benefit other researchers insofar as they could take advantage of any investigation published so far, thus ever-enriching authorship attribution studies as a field of research. Therefore, the present report will be concerned with the handling and computation of Yule X  X  K and, having this objective in mind, the paper has been organised as follows. After this introduction, the first part of the next section illustrates the lexical profile and part of the statistical results of a short piece of literary work as generated by TACT; the second reviews the different expressions for K in the literature; in the third one the values of the lexical profile are used in the different expressions and the results are accordingly discussed; finally, our conclusions are offered in section 3.
 2. Development 2.1. Lexical profile and statistics from tact For the calculation of K by TACT, we used the electronic version of a text containing the first chapter of the Latin Gospel according to Saint John. The lexical profile generated is shown in Table 1. For clarity, the percentage columns are omitted, the figures for the Most Frequent Word (MFW), the hapax legomena (HL) and hapax dislegomena (HD) are arrow-pointed, and the statistical notation is included in the second row.
 results; however, only those relevant for this study are shown below. 2.2. Expressions for Yules X  X  K To check the values for K as generated by TACT we implemented the appropriate expression. The different expressions found in the specific liter-ature are reproduced below.

 290 2.3. Results and discussion At first sight, expression (1) does not seem to be equivalent to expressions (2) and (3). To check our intuition, the values for i , V ( i , N ), and N from the lexical profile were applied to the three expressions. Before proceeding with the computation, it is convenient to emphasize that the elements of the summation in (1), (2), and (3) have the same values and, therefore, so is the result, as shown in Table II.
 (1) K =10 4 *(0.012633662 X 755)/ (2) K =10 4 *( ) 1/755 + 0.012633662) = 10 4 * 0.01130916 = 113.091583 (3) K =10 4 * (0.012633662 X  1/755) = 10 4 * 0.01130916 = 113.091583 The result from (1) shows that this expression is not equivalent to those in (2) and (3). At the same time, all the values for K differ from the one computed by TACT ( 1260.1202 ). These facts may be interpreted as shown in Table III. Expressions (2) and (3) were presented as equivalent to (1) (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998, p. 330; Somers and Tweedie, 2003, p. 413), but their identical result ( 113.091583 ) shows quite the contrary, that is why they are, in our opinion, the only valid. Expression (1), in turn, has to be discarded in view of the negative result, in our case ) 13.24481148 , which is bound to be always negative, as you subtract a whole number ( N &gt;1) from a figure (the sum-mation) less than the unity. A negative number cannot be valid as a measure of the repeat-rate. Although expression (1) is attributed to Yule, the fact is that the original formula is as follows (Yule, 1944: 57): where S 2  X  Sf x X 2 , and S 1 = S ( f x X ), then the resulting expression would be (2) and (3). Therefore, we suppose that it has been miscopied.
 greatest difference is found in the use of the scaling factor 10 5 instead of 10 4 . The other divergence must arise from considering negligible the term ) 1/ N when handling very large texts. In fact, if we compare the values for K as generated by TACT with those independently calculated with expression (2) or (3), they tend to approach with increasing N and, in turn, diverge with decreasing N . This same divergence could only be explained by the mistaken inclusion of the term ) 1/ N within the summation (4). For the sake of illus-tration, compare the values of K in texts of increasing length in the table below. For this purpose, an electronic version of the gospels (G) has been used, both in Latin (L) and in Old English (WS), so that they may be compared with smaller pieces  X  with the first and the four first chapters of The Gospel according to St. John . In addition, the value for K has also been calculated using versions of The Lord of the Rings (LR) and Harry Potter (HP), considering some books independently and as a whole.
 292 when calculating Herdan X  X  Vm , which rises as a modification of Yule X  X  characteristic and is defined with the following formula (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998, pp. 330): 3. Conclusions In this study we have shown the appropriate way of calculating Yule X  X  characteristic so as to measure the lexical repeat-rate of a text by imple-menting expressions 2 and 3. However, TACT-generated figures are bound to coincide with those of 2 and 3 whenever the former is divided by 10 (with just negligible differences when short or medium-sized texts are involved). Therefore, a TACT-generated four-digit figure must be roughly adjusted to a three-digit figure (by dividing by 10), if they are to be compared with the results otherwise obtained. The opposite also holds true, were the figures for K around 80/90 independently generated, as in the examples above, they would require a scaling factor of 10 to be compared with those by TACT . studies inasmuch as all the researchers could interpret the lexical repetition values in the specific literature with the same weight, thus enabling them to compare data. Likewise, they should be informed of the way in which the values have been obtained, either by TACT or independently. In the case of the latter, the expression used is also needed so as to make the appropriate adjustments.
 even minor differences in the figures for K may be useful as a diacritic when similar-sized texts are compared. For this purpose, we support Rudman X  X  desideratum of the scientific status of the field proposing  X  X  X o treat each study as a unique, hard scientific experiment with the concomitant controls, rigor, reproducibility, open availability of all data, programs and tests performed, and with a well articulated theoretical framework X  X  (Rudman 1998, p. 351). In particular, we propose that researchers provide some basic statistical information of the work under scrutiny so as to allow other colleagues to re-use them, compare with their own data, or even check whether the values presented are within an acceptable range. Although some papers actually include the figures for N, HL, HD and others, our proposal would also include the values for V ( N ) and the summation of the formula. With this note, we have tried to highlight the divergences in the values for Yule X  X  K when TACT is employed so as to avoid the errors and/or the misinterpre-tations commented in the introduction.
