 Trust propagation algorithms (e.g., TrustRank [ 1 ]), which propagate trust of a carefully selected seed set of good pages to the entire Web, have been widely used for spam demotion. However, in most existing algorithms, trust is prop-agated in non-differential ways. Thus, a differential trust propagation scheme in which a page propagates less trust to a (suspicious) spam neighbor than a normal one is urgently needed [ 2 ]. In this paper, we propose a differential trust propagation scheme with community discovery. Firstly, considering known spam pages and reputable pages as seeds, we extract communities using seed-based community identification techniques. We then use the extracted communities to limit across-community-boundary trust propagation. Since most members of the extracted communities are spam pages, the good-to-bad trust propagation can be efficiently limited. Experimental results show that our scheme can significantly improve the performance of trust propagation algorithms such as TrustRank, LCRank, CPV.
 where s is the normalized distrust score vector for the bad seed set S  X  : We call linear combination of TrustRank and Anti-Trust Rank [ 5 ] LCRank for  X &lt; 1) are two coefficients to give different weights to Limited TrustRank scores t and Anti-Trust Rank scores d in the linear combination. Our Limited LCRank (L-LCRank) algorithm uses L-TrustRank score in the combination.
 Limited CPV. CPV [ 6 ] assigns two scores to each page called AV Ra n k ( AV for Authority value) and HVRank (HV for Hub Value) . The iteration formulas of Limited CPV (L-CPV) are: hv ( p )= We conducted experiments on WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset [ 7 ] and TREC Cate-gory B of ClueWeb09 dataset [ 8 ]. We chose TrustRank [ 1 ], LCRank [ 5 ] and CPV [ 6 ] as the baseline algorithms for comparison with L-TrustRank, L-LCRank and L-CPV. To evaluate the performances of spam demotion algorithms, the set of sites (pages) is split into a number (we use 20 here) of buckets according to PageRank values, then evaluation criteria below are used.
 ClueWeb09 are shown in Fig. 1 -3 and Fig. 4 -6 , respectively. It can be obviously seen that our algorithms put fewer spam sites in the top buckets than the baseline algorithms, which is a significant improvement in demoting spam sites. propagating scores with limitation, which is more aligned with the idea of trust propagation, i.e. it only propagates trust to the pages which are really trustwor-thy. Experimental results indicate that the limited versions of such algorithms as TrustRank, LCRank and CPV can achieve better results for spam demotion.
