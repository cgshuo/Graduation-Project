 extraction methods have been the most commonly used by many QA systems. In the entity recognition). additional advantages in QA [1, 2]. grained classification. we treat all kinds of named entity types. textual co-occurrence patterns. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and its use in question answering. quantity, event, animal, plant, material , and term . detection using CRFs and NE classification using Maximum Entropy (ME). probability of a state sequence y given an input sequence x as follows: name class states. input sequence x as follows: FSM translations more likely. extracted by boundary detector as follows: 
We use the following features: 
The primary advantage of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) over hidden Markov assumptions required by HMMs. Additionally, CRFs avoid the label bias problem, a tasks [3, 4]. 3.1 Fine-Grained NER 6,000 documents tagged by human annotators. We used 5,500 documents as a training ME) and 10 (for CRF). We perform 500 iterations for training. Table 1 shows the performance of boundary detection and NE classification using 84.3% F1 using ME and CRF respectively. In NE classification, we could achieve an 84.0% F1 using ME (we assume the boundary detection is perfect). CRF and ME. In named entity recognition, our proposed model NER-4 that is broken down in two parts obtained 77.7% F1. We could not train NER-2 because training is too slow. we reduced the training time to 27% without loss of performance. 3.2 QA with Fine-Grained NER We performed another experiment for a question answering system to show the effect answer rank(RAR) of the first correct answer. and then the indexer generates Answer Index Unit (AIU) structures using the answer candidates and content words to AIU structures [5]. module. Answer Index Unit (i.e. fine-grained named entity information). The QA system with retrieval. Random Fields (CRFs) for question answering. We used CRFs to detect boundary of the question answering, The QA system with passage retrieval and AIU (fine-grained demonstrated that our approach is effective for QA. 2. Study Field FD_OTHERS 3.
