 This paper presents ExperTime, a web-based system for tracking expertise over time. We visualize a person X  X  expertise profile on a timeline, where we detect and characterize changes in the focus or topics of expertise. It is possible to zoom in on a given time period in order to examine the underlying data that is used as sup-porting evidence. It is also possible to perform visual and quantita-tive comparison of two arbitrarily selected time periods in a highly interactive environment. We invite profile owners to evaluate and fine-tune their profiles, and to leave feedback.
 H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval Temporal expertise profiling, expert profiling, expertise retrieval
Over the past decade, the increased availability of online evi-dence that can be traced and mined has led to a renewed interest in two types of expertise retrieval system: expert finding systems (to locate individuals who are experts on a given topic) and expert profiling systems (to describe the expertise of a given person) [1]. In practice, the two tasks X  X inding and profiling X  X re strongly con-nected; once potential expert candidates are identified, a closer look into their profile is needed before they are actually contacted.
Our focus lies in two important issues related to expertise profil-ing that have received little attention so far. First, the expertise of a person on a given topic should be considered in context; that con-text is comprised of the larger landscape of knowledge areas within the domain and of the distribution of the person X  X  expertise across. Second, expertise is not static, it changes over time. In scientific fields that are rapidly developing, such as computer science,  X  X nce an expert always an expert X  does not hold. Therefore, it is vital to be able to track changes in a person X  X  expertise over time.
We build on prior work [3] and propose to use domain-specific topic taxonomies that enable us to capture and conveniently visu-alize a person X  X  expertise at any given point in time. By displaying a series of profile snapshots on a timeline, we can have a complete overview of the development of expertise over time. In addition, we identify and characterize important changes that occur in these profiles. Profile owners are invited to refine the profiles we auto-matically generated for them and are encouraged to leave feedback.

Publications are key indicators of expertise in an academic con-text. Bibliographic databases, like DBLP, have been used to mine information networks, including clustering, ranking and profiling of conferences and authors based on research sub-fields [5, 6]. Bib-liographic collections have also been used for expert finding [2, 4]. ArnetMiner [6], a tool for automatic extraction of information about researchers, addresses, among other things, the problem of analyzing expertise evolution over time. Their solution, however, is based on keyword statistics projected on a time axis and lacks higher organizational structure.
In this section we briefly introduce the temporal expertise pro-filing method underlying our system. For a full account we re-fer the reader to [3]. We model the expertise of an individual as a series of timestamped hierarchical profiles (referred to as pro-file snapshots from now on). We assume that a (domain-specific) taxonomy of expertise areas is provided and weigh nodes in this tree-shaped hierarchy based on documents supporting evidence of expertise. This representation not only allows us to measure how broad, narrow, or diverse one X  X  expertise is, but also facilitates the formal comparison and characterization of changes between two profile snapshots. Changes are divided into two main groups, de-pending on which level of the topic hierarchy is affected: changes in the field of research (i.e., top-level nodes) and changes in the top-ics of research (i.e., lower-level nodes). Our method has two main parameters: (1) the decay factor controls the rate at which expertise  X  X ades away, X  and (2) the focus threshold sets the sensitivity of the method to changes. We allow the user to tune these values (see  X 4).
In this work, we focus on the computer science domain, for two reasons. One, we are reasonably familiar with the domain, and, two, there are publicly available sources of publications and topic classification systems in this area. Specifically, we use DBLP as our bibliographic database and the ACM 1998 Computing Classifi-cation System as our taxonomy. We use the provided ACM classi-fication, where available, and use an automatic classifier for the rest of the publications. (We offer our users the possibility to refine this categorization.) Note that our the system is not tailored to any spe-cific domain; topic taxonomies are available for other disciplines as well (e.g., PubMed in medicine), which makes our system easily extensible to other fields.
A number of researcher profiles have already been processed and made available. Those who are not yet in our system can sign up and claim their profiles. Figure 1 displays an example profile. We distinguish between two user modes: (1) the user is only a viewer of a profile, and is not allowed to make changes, and (2) the user is the owner of the profile. In the latter case, the user is allowed (and encouraged) to change the settings and to adjust her expertise profile to what she believes is best reflecting reality. A key design objective was that such changes shall take effect immediately, i.e., we update the underlying model when the parameter settings (such as the decay factor and focus threshold) or the data (assignments of publications to categories and weighting of publications and/or categories) are modified. When displaying a profile, we indicate whether it is an automatically generated one or one that has already been curated by its owner. Next, we briefly discuss the main com-ponents of the interface, indicated with circled letters on Figure 1.

The system consists of two main building blocks. The back-end part, using mostly Java and MySQL technologies, is responsible for the extraction, processing, and storage of information. The front-end is an HTML5 website using servlets for communication with the server and JavaScript with additional libraries, such as jQuery and D3.js, for visualization and interactivity.
In this paper, we have described a demonstration of a temporal expertise profiling system, called ExperTime. We presented our initial motivation, used methods and underlying data, as well as the main functionality of the system. The next step on our research agenda is the evaluation of temporal expertise profiles. This is a challenging problem for two reasons: (1) the notions of focus and topic changes are subjective and are likely to vary from person to person, and (2) the complexity of the task is beyond the point where TREC-like benchmark evaluations are feasible. The feedback we plan to obtain with the ExperTime system, both implicit and ex-plicit, will provide invaluable information to guide the development of appropriate evaluation methodology.
