 a ,  X  1. Introduction
Social interactions have been becoming increasingly observable and measurable with advancements in technology. Interactions using online social media platforms, mobile phones and email are commonly represented as graphs, whose structural analysis may reveal interesting insights about the underlying social networks. For example, community detection techniques have been exten-sively used to identify groups of people characterized by a high level of interactions and to understand social communication through-out the network by finding cohesive subgroups ( Scott, 2000; Falzon, 2000; Fortunato, 2010; Schaeffer, 2007 ).

A cohesive subgroup is a  X  X ightly knit X  subset of actors in a social network, which was originally modeled using the graph-theoretic concept of a clique ( Luce and Perry, 1949 ). The notion of a clique embodies a perfect cohesive group, it compels every two individuals in the subgroup to be directly connected to each other. However, requiring every possible pairwise connection between the individuals in a subgroup is often overly restrictive from a practical perspective, as doing so yields only  X  X erfectly cohesive X  clusters while ignoring other important cohesive subgroups. In addition, clique-detection algorithms may fail to identify cliques in which a few edges are absent due to imprecisions in collecting the data. To overcome these issues, clique relaxation models have been introduced, including the k -clique ( Luce, 1950 ), relaxing direct interaction between individuals; the k -club ( Alba, 1973; Mokken, 1979 ), relaxing reachability; the k -plex ( Seidman and Foster, 1978 ), allowing at most k non-neighbors; and s -defective clique ( Yu et al., 2006 ), allowing at most s missing edges. Clique relaxation mod-els have been extensively used in social network analysis ( Pattillo et al., 2012; Nastos and Gao, 2013; Scott, 2000; Wasserman and Faust, 1994 ).

This paper proposes a novel clique relaxation based on the notion of clustering coefficient . This concept gained popularity in the study of the so-called small-world networks ( Watts, 1999; Watts and
Strogatz, 1998 ), where it is used to model the hypothesis that two people are more likely to be friends if they have a friend in common.
For a given actor (node) with more than one friend (neighbor), its local clustering coefficient measures the local density of direct con-nections between its friends. Clustering coefficient is equal to one when the node X  X  neighborhood is fully connected (forms a clique).
On the other hand, a close to zero clustering coefficient means that there are hardly any connections in the neighborhood. Many real-life networks have been empirically found to have many nodes with rather high clustering coefficients ( Newman, 2003 ), which also appears to be a natural property to expect of cohesive sub-groups in social networks. In fact, according to ( Jackson, 2008 , p. 35), clustering coefficient is  X  X he most common way of measuring some aspect of cliquishness. X  Hence, it is reasonable to define a cohesive subgroup by requir-ing that the corresponding subset of nodes induces a connected subgraph with a desired (high) clustering coefficient  X  . We will an  X  -cluster can be viewed as a clique relaxation.
 Our study focuses on computing  X  -clusters of the largest size in social networks, which is of interest for several reasons. Larger cohesive subgroups tend to have more influence on the overall net-work structure than their smaller counterparts. In fact, the largest size of a cohesive subgroup of a certain kind can be thought of as a global measure of cohesiveness of the whole network with respect to the imposed definition of cohesiveness. The presence of large cohesive subgroups consisting of considerable portions of a net-work implies a high level of cohesion in the network, whereas their absence indicates the opposite. Nevertheless, smaller cohesive sub-groups may also be of interest, and the approaches proposed in this work can be easily modified to compute all  X  -clusters of a given size by introducing the corresponding constraints in the considered optimization models.
 Dropping the connectivity requirement from the  X  -cluster definition may result in a structure with multiple connected com-ponents, each of which is a connected  X  -cluster. This motivates a novel clustering algorithm, which uses the multiple connected  X  -clusters as the  X  X eeds, X  with the remaining nodes assigned to these seed clusters using a certain strategy. The algorithm yields encour-aging results on the social networks used in our experiments. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the necessary definitions and study some basic structural properties of  X  -clusters. Section 3 provides opti-mization models for finding the largest  X  -clusters in a network. In
Section 4 , the proposed models are used to analyze several well-known social networks. The proposed local  X  -clustering algorithm is outlined and tested in Section 5 . The paper concludes with a summary of findings and suggestions for future research in Section 6 . 2. Definitions and properties This section presents basic graph-theoretic definitions and nota-tions used throughout the paper. Let G = ( V , E ) be a simple graph with set V of n vertices (nodes) and set E of edges (links), E j } of i in G , respectively, and let A G be the adjacency matrix of G . The distance between vertices i and j in G is denoted d G ( i , j ); d if i and j are not connected. The diameter of G is denoted diam ( G ).
Given a subset V  X  V , the corresponding induced subgraph G [ V ] is defined as G [ V ] = ( V , E ), where E is the subset of edges of G connecting pairs of vertices from V .
 Watts and Strogatz (1998) define the local clustering coefficient for a node of degree at least 2 as the proportion of links between the vertices within its neighborhood divided by the number of links that could possibly exist between the neighbors. The following notations will be used in the definitions below:
D =
Definition 1 (Local clustering coefficient) . The local clustering coef-ficient C i of node i of degree d G ( i )  X  2 in G is given by
C = 1 The global clustering coefficient C of G can be thought of as the proportion of triangles among the triplets, where a triplet is defined as an ordered subset of three vertices that induces a sub-graph with at least two edges. It can be expressed mathematically as follows.

Definition 2 (Global clustering coefficient) . The global clustering coefficient C of graph G that has at least one connected component with more than 2 vertices is given by
C = 1
D
It is interesting to note that both local and global clus-tering coefficients of a graph can decrease with an increase in edge density. Indeed, Fig. 1 shows a graph where adding an edge between nodes 3 and 5 decreases the cluster-ing coefficients. Before the dashed edge is added, local clustering coefficients of the corresponding nodes are { 1 , , 1 , 1 3 , 1 , 1 } , and the global clustering coefficient is
After the addition, local clustering coefficients change to { 1 , , 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 } , and the global clustering coefficient value is .

We define a local  X  -cluster as a subset of vertices that induces a subgraph in which each node X  X  local clustering coefficient is at least  X  .
 vertices C  X  V is called a local  X  -cluster if G [ C ] is connected and that is,
Note that the definition of local clustering coefficient implies
Also, it is easy to see that the edge density of the subgraph induced by any local  X  -cluster is at least  X  . However, the set of vertices inducing a subgraph with the edge density  X  may not be a local  X  -cluster.
 Similarly, we can define a global  X  -cluster as follows. that is,
It is obvious that a local  X  -cluster is also a global  X  -cluster, whereas the converse does not hold in general. Hence, the def-inition of a local  X  -cluster guarantees stronger cohesiveness properties than those enforced by the definition of a global  X  -cluster. This is also evident from the experiments with real-life networks reported in Section 4 , which led us to focus primarily on local  X  -clusters in this study.
 3. Mathematical models
Next we formulate optimization models for detecting the largest a maximum size subset of vertices with the local (global) clustering coefficient above the given threshold value  X  . We start by describ-ing formulations for finding largest local  X  -clusters, which can also be altered to address the maximum global  X  -cluster problem as discussed in Appendix D.

Decision variables . Let us define x i as a binary decision variable indicating whether node i is in the set C , that is, x = 1 , if node i is in the local (global)  X  -cluster C ; The vector x consisting of x i i  X  V defined as above is called the characteristic vector of the subset C of vertices.

Objective function . Our objective is to maximize the number of vertices in the  X  -cluster C : maximize
We consider three different approaches to modeling the local  X  -cluster constraints , which ensure that the set of nodes in C satisfies the local  X  -cluster definition. The first two approaches, referred to as the cubic and quadratic model, respectively, are based on alter-native straightforward representations of Eq. (3) in terms of the decision variables (Section 3.1 ), whereas the third model, called the triangle model, is based on somewhat more sophisticated argu-ments (Section 3.2 ). As we will observe later, the triangle model outperforms the other two models in terms of running times when used in conjunction with an optimization solver, hence we give this model a more detailed treatment, while most derivations related to the cubic and quadratic models can be found in appendices. 3.1. The cubic and quadratic models
To ensure that the subset of vertices C induces a local  X  -cluster, we impose three sets of constraints. The first set of constraints for-malizes the requirement that each node must have degree at least 2 in G [ C ]. This requirement can be expressed as follows: If x i = 1 (meaning that i  X  C ), this constraint guarantees that at least 2 neighbors of i are included in C . We call the constraints in Eq. (6) the degree constraints .

The second set of constraints expresses Eq. (3) from the defini-tion of a local  X  -cluster in terms of the decision variables. Namely, for each node i in the  X  -cluster, we need to make sure that ing coefficient constraints . Since C is unknown, we need to rewrite Eq. (7) to avoid using C explicitly. We consider two alternative rep-resentations for Eq. (7) , one (cubic) obtained by multiplying both based on introducing a term in Eq. (7) that makes the constraint redundant when i /  X  C . The corresponding equations are given by x and respectively. The term  X  d G ( i ) 2 (1  X  x i ) vanishes if x i  X  C ), in which case Eq. (7) is satisfied, and makes the constraint of the local clustering coefficient constraints in Eqs. (7a) and (7b) needs to be used, leading to two alternative models, which we will refer to as the cubic model and the quadratic model , respectively.
Finally, the third set of the local  X  -cluster constraints assures that the induced subgraph G [ C ] is connected and is referred to as the connectivity constraints . While there are several ways to describe connectivity mathematically, here we adopt a compact model of
Veremyev and Boginski (2012) recently proposed to bound the diameter of a graph when searching for k -clubs. A k -club is defined as a subset of vertices inducing a subgraph of diameter at most k ( Mokken, 1979 ). By setting k = n  X  1, the model can be used to enforce connectivity (see Appendix A). It should be noted that we set k = diam ( G ) in our computational experiments as it seems coun-terintuitive to search cohesive subgroup with diameter larger than the diameter of the network.

To make use of off-the-shelf binary linear optimization soft-ware for solving the proposed models, we linearize the nonlinear constraints in Eqs. (7a) and (7b) , respectively. The resulting mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations are derived in Appendix B.

Note that if we drop the connectivity requirement from the def-inition of an  X  -cluster, a feasible solution to each of the considered optimization models corresponds to a disjoint union of  X  -clusters.
That is, the vertices corresponding to each connected component of the subgraph corresponding to a feasible solution form an  X  -cluster. 3.2. The triangle model
In this section we consider an alternative formulation for solv-ing the considered problem, referred to as the triangle model . In this formulation, we use a value-disjunction technique to model the required number of triangles in the subgraph induced by an  X  -cluster. Moreover, we use a slightly modified version of k -club constraints ( Veremyev et al., 2015 ) and show that we can relax the integrality requirements for almost all variables in the correspond-ing formulation to enhance the performance of MIP solvers.
For any i  X  V , let z = is d . This requirement can be enforced by the following constraints:
Since we are only concerned with i  X  C (i.e., x i = 1), we use con-straints in Eq. (8) in a relaxed form: where M is a sufficiently large constant, e.g., M = d G ( i ). Next, for each edge { i , j }  X  E , we introduce a variable  X  that  X  ij = 1 if and only if x i = 1, x j = 1. Then, for any node i clustering coefficient constraint can be written as Observe that for any i  X  V the number of variables z id is d
Hence, we only need 2 | E | of variables z id and | E | of variables  X  Also, for every pair of nodes i and j define u ( ) ij  X  { and only if both nodes i and j are in local  X  -cluster C and there is a path of length at most between i and j in G [ C ], where  X  {
Appendix B, we use variables p ( ) ij indicating that there is a path of length (exactly) between i and j in G [ C ]. As can be seen from the formulation below, using variables u ( ) ij instead of p ( ) simpler modeling of recursive distance-based constrains. Then the triangle formulation can be stated as follows: maximize subject to a  X   X  x i ,  X  ij  X  x j ,  X  { i, j }  X  E, i &lt; j (13) dz id  X  u  X  x i + x j  X  1 ,  X  i, j  X  V, i / = j (15) u = 0 ,  X  { i, j } /  X  E, i / = j (16) u u  X  u  X  x i , u ( ) u  X  R + ,  X  i, j  X  V,  X  { 1 , . . ., L } (20) x  X  { 0 , 1 } z id ,  X  ij  X  R + ,  X  i, j  X  V, d  X  { 1 , . . ., d
Note that we relaxed the integrality requirements for variables u  X  and z id . For the variables u ( ) ij and  X  ij this can be done without altering the optimal solutions due to the maximization nature of the problem ( Veremyev et al., 2015 ). We show that z id variables can also be relaxed in Proposition 1 in Appendix C. 4. Analysis of  X  -clusters in real-life social networks We implemented the proposed formulations using FICO Xpress-
IVE Version 1.24.04 solver. All computations were performed on a Dell Precision WorkStation T7500  X  computer with eight 2.40 GHz Intel Xeon  X  processors and 12 GB RAM using single thread processing only.

In preliminary experiments, we verified that all three proposed models yield identical solutions and observed that the triangle model outperforms its competitors in terms of running time on all instances. Hence, we use the triangle model in all experiments discussed below.

We analyze several well-known social networks by varying the clustering coefficient threshold level, as described in the following four subsections. 4.1. Zachary X  X  karate club
The first social network we analyze is the karate club example first studied by Zachary (1977) . The corresponding graph describes social relationships among 34 members of a university karate club, where the nodes represent its members. If two members are friends outside the club, then an edge is present between them. The graph has the total of 78 edges. After a dispute between the instructor (Mr.
Hi, a karate instructor, node 1) and the club X  X  administrator (John A., the club president, node 34), the club split into two factions, with 16 and 18 members, respectively. Since the members of each group are known, this example is often used as a benchmark for network clustering algorithms.

We first study the effect the split had on local and global clus-tering coefficients. As can be seen from Table 1 , global clustering coefficient increases after the split. For Mr. Hi X  X  group, the increase is quite significant. However, in the case of John X  X  faction the increase in global clustering coefficient is rather small. This may suggest that Mr. Hi X  X  faction is more cohesive than John X  X . This hypothesis appears to be especially reasonable if one analyzes the aspects that led to the divide: Mr. Hi wished to raise the price of karate lessons, whereas John insisted on stabilizing prices. Accord-ing to Zachary (1977) ,  X  X he supporters of Mr. Hi saw him as a fatherly figure who was their spiritual and physical mentor, and who was only try-ing to meet his own physical needs after seeing to theirs. The supporters of John A. and the other officers saw Mr. Hi as a paid employee who was trying to coerce his way into a higher salary. X 
Based on this description, Mr. Hi X  X  supporters seemed to have formed a more ideologically united group than their opposition.
We computed all the largest global and local  X  -clusters in the karate club network for  X  = 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6. The correspond-ing results are presented in Table 2 . For each considered value of  X  , members of each largest  X  -cluster ( X  X embers X ). We observe that two maximum cliques of size 5, { 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 } and { 1, 2, 3, 4, 14 which have 4 out of 5 vertices in common. The union of these two cliques gives the largest local and global  X  -cluster for  X  = 0.9, see consisted of members of Mr. Hi X  X  faction only. However, for  X  = 0.8 and below, all the largest global  X  -clusters consist of a mix of mem-bers of both factions. As for maximum local  X  -clusters, there are only two optimal  X  -clusters for  X  = 0.7 and one  X  for  X  = 0.6 that contain an  X  X utlier X  node 9, representing a member of John X  X  fac-tion. Interestingly, Zachary (1977) points out that  X  X erson number 9 was a weak supporter of John but joined Mr. Hi X  X  club after the split. X 
Next, we compute the largest local  X  -clusters that contain node 34 (John, the leader of one of the two factions). The corresponding the same pair of alternative solutions given by cliques of size 4. For  X  = 0.6, there is a unique maximum local  X  -cluster containing node 34. This solution consists of 6 nodes and is nothing else but the union of the two cliques obtained for higher values of  X  . Note that all the nodes listed in the optimal solutions in Table 3 are members of John X  X  faction.

The CPU time used to compute each maximum local and global  X  -cluster has not exceeded 6 s, with local  X  -clusters computed slightly faster than the global ones. Taking into account that local  X  -clusters are also superior to the global ones in terms of their cohesiveness properties, we do not find global  X  -clusters to be of much interest in studying cohesive subgroups and focus on com-puting local  X  -clusters in the remaining experiments. 4.2. Football graph Second, we analyze the football graph due to Girvan and
Newman (2002) , which represents American college football games in year 2000. Nodes represent 115 teams that played in that season and 613 edges represent games played between them. These 115 teams are subdivided into 11 conferences. Usually, each team plays most of its games with the teams in the same conference. Table 4 presents clustering coefficient information for each conference. In addition, there were 5 teams that did not belong to any conference, referred to as independents.
 We computed the largest local  X  -clusters in the football net-work for  X  = 1, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.75. The corresponding results are presented in Table 5 . For each considered value of  X  , this table reports the size of the largest  X  -cluster ( X  X ize X ) and lists the nodes of each optimal  X  -cluster ( X  X olutions X ). We observe that for  X  = 1 and 0.9, the largest  X  -clusters are given by two maximum cliques of size 9. The first maximum clique corresponds to Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and the second maximum clique corresponds to
Western Athletic Conference (WAC). As we decrease  X  to 0.8, we obtain a unique optimal solution, which consists of 9 teams from WAC and three teams from other conferences, namely Conference
USA (Houston), Mountain West (New Mexico State), and Sunbelt (Nevada Las Vegas).
 For a slightly smaller value of  X  = 0.75, we obtain 10 optimal solutions, each consisting of 25 teams. The solutions roughly cor-respond to 3 conferences in their size and consist of 3 large clusters corresponding to different conferences and a couple additional teams outside. Most of the solutions reported in Table 5 for  X  = 0.75 consist of 8 teams from ACC, 8 teams from WAC, 8 teams from Mountain West Conference, and 1 more team that plays two teams from one of these three conferences (e.g., Vanderbilt, Oklahoma, and Arizona, respectively, in the first three reported solutions).
Again, we observe that local  X  -clusters with high values of  X  consistently describe tightly knit groups of actors. However, as  X  is decreased from 0.8 to 0.75, we see a dramatic increase in the size of
This can be explained by the clearly-defined modular structure of the football network, where teams from the same conference are clustered together in a supervised fashion due to the conference schedule requirements. The same is not expected to be the case in social networks where actors are free to decide on their local interactions. 4.3. Terrorist network compiled by Krebs
Finally, we consider the terrorist interaction network compiled by Krebs (2002) using the information available about the tragic events of September 11, 2001. This network consists of 62 nodes representing terrorists connected to the attacks (see Appendix E for the list of names), and the edges correspond to pairs of persons that were known to interact in the past. In total there were 153 interactions observed.

We compute the largest  X  -clusters for  X  = 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7 and 0.6. The results are reported in Table 6 . There are three maximum cliques of size 6 for  X  = 1, each of them shows the close relation-ships between hijackers. All members of the first two groups were among the hijackers involved in the World Trade Center attacks, and all nodes in the third group were members of the Hamburg terror cell ( Krebs, 2002 ). For  X  = 0.9, node 23 is added to one of the cliques, which also corresponds to a terrorist that took part in the WTC North attack. Likewise, for  X  = 0.8 node 10 is added to the largest 0.9-cluster, an alleged organizer and financier of the 9/11 attacks. For  X  = 0.7 there are two optimal solutions of size 9 differing by just one node; namely, node 21 from the first solu-tion is replaced by node 32 in the second solution. Most of the nodes included in the solutions were linked to the Hamburg ter-ror cell. For  X  = 0.6, we have a unique optimal solution of size 13 (see Fig. 3 for an illustration). Interestingly, 11 of the 13 nodes cor-respond to actual hijackers involved in the WTC South, WTC North, and Pentagon attacks. The two remaining nodes (24 and 31) were linked to two of the hijackers involved in the Pentagon attack. In particular, node 24 represents an FBI informant, whose  X  X ontacts with the hijackers, had they been capitalized on, would have given the San Diego FBI field office perhaps the Intelligence Community X  X  best chance to unravel the September 11 plot X  according to Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.
 4.4. Additional experiments
Additional experiments have been performed to assess the scalability of the proposed method. Social networks from Trick X  X  graph coloring page ( Trick, 2004 ) and Pajek dataset ( Batagelj and Mrvar, 2006 ), as well as Barab X si-Albert ( Barab X si and Albert, 1999 ) and Erd  X  os-R X nyi ( Erd  X  os and R X nyi, 1959 ) random graphs have been used for this purpose. The detailed results are reported in Appendix F. We observe a significant increase in the running time with the increase in the number of vertices and edge den-sity. This is not surprising, since all known exact methods for NP-hard problems have exponential worst-case time complex-ity. Hence, heuristic approaches ( Glover and Kochenberger, 2003 ) need to be developed to deal with large-scale instances of social networks. 5. Local  X  -clustering algorithm
Dropping the connectivity requirement from the definition of an  X  -cluster may result in solutions corresponding to disjoint unions of  X  -clusters. These disjoint  X  -clusters can be used as seeds for clustering methods that partition the network into clusters. In this section, we discuss such a clustering algorithm and evaluate its performance on the three real-life networks used in the previous section.

Algorithm 1. Local  X  -clustering algorithm.
The proposed approach is outlined in Algorithm 1 . We proceed by computing a maximum local  X  -cluster with relaxed connec-tivity requirements, which typically results in several  X  -clusters
V , . . ., V k corresponding to different connected components in the tial seed. At each iteration of the algorithm, we pick an unassigned node i that has the largest number of neighbors in one of the clus-ters V j and assign i to V j . We apply the procedure recursively until 25 21 29 39 15 33 all nodes are assigned to a cluster. In the experiments below we used  X  = 1.
 We first apply the proposed local  X  -clustering algorithm to the Zachary X  X  karate club network. We demonstrate the results in Fig. 4 . In the figure, black edges belong to the subgraph induced by the maximum relaxed  X  -cluster solution, and gray edges are outside of the subgraph. Our clustering algorithm finds three clusters, one of which coincides with the John X  X  faction (dark-gray nodes). The other two clusters correspond to Mr. Hi X  X  faction (light-gray nodes), with one of the clusters consisting of a group of 5 students that only interact among themselves and with Mr. Hi (the corresponding nodes are shown as dashed circles) and the other cluster contain-ing the remaining light-gray nodes (shown as solid-border circles). The clustering we obtained can be viewed as an enhancement of the results reported in the literature, since in addition to correctly identifying the two factions it singles out a clearly defined subgroup within one of the factions.
 The second considered example deals with the football graph. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5 . In this figure, colors of edges have the same interpretation as in the karate example above. Our clustering algorithm finds 11 clusters, nearly coinciding with the actual conferences. The algorithm expectedly places the five inde-pendents by assigning them to  X  X losest X  conferences. In addition, it misplaces four teams from Sunbelt Conference, which are assigned to the Western Athletic Conference cluster and SEC. This can be explained by observing that the number of games the misplaced teams played against the other Sunbelt Conference teams and Western Athletic Conference/SEC teams was similar. The results we obtained are comparable with the results of Girvan and Newman (2002) .

Finally, we apply our clustering algorithm to the Krebs X  X  terrorist network, with the resulting clusters shown in Fig. 6 . The algorithm finds six clusters, three of which consist of the associates of the hijackers (with just one exception, hijacker node 22, included in one of the clusters), and the remaining three of which correspond to the actual hijackers. The three groups roughly correspond to the WTC, Pentagon, and Pennsylvania attacks, respectively. 6. Conclusion
In this paper we introduce new clique relaxation models that are based on local and global clustering coefficients, respectively. Imposing a high lower bound  X  on the clustering coefficient (local or global) within a cluster ensures that the corresponding subnetwork has strong cohesiveness properties. We formulate optimization models that allow to compute largest local and global  X  -clusters in a network and use them to compute solutions for several real-world social networks from the literature. We observed that local  X  -clusters were better in identifying real-life cohesive subgroups than their global counterparts. We also use local  X  -clusters to develop a network clustering approach, referred to as a local  X  -clustering algorithm. The method first computes a largest local  X  -cluster with relaxed connectivity constraints and then uses each connected component of the solution as a seed cluster. Preliminary experiments with the proposed algorithm show very promising results.
 Our work can be extended in several interesting directions. On the one hand, the proposed optimization approach could be enhanced by using scale reduction techniques and exploring the possibility of developing better formulations as well as combinato-rial algorithms for the problems of interest. On the other hand, the inherent computational intractability of the considered problems, which generalize the notoriously hard maximum clique problem, suggests that exact approaches like those proposed in this paper, will require runtime that will depend exponentially (in the worst case) on the size of the networks. Such approaches are applica-ble only to small-to medium-size instances and their scalability is limited. Hence, developing effective heuristic algorithms ( Glover and Kochenberger, 2003 ) could be the best option from a practi-cal perspective, when one has to deal with networks consisting of millions of nodes and edges.

Another important practical issue that needs to be addressed is the choice of the values of  X  that would yield  X  -clusters of high interest for a particular application. Intuitively, this choice should depend on the clustering coefficients of the networks under investigation as well as other application-specific criteria. Perhaps one could develop semi-automated rules for choosing appropriate values of  X  . Furthermore, depending on an application, the pro-posed models could be enhanced by enforcing additional properties desired of cohesive subgroups sought. Such modeling enhance-ments could also lead to computational advantages as they would reduce the set of feasible solutions. Finally, this work can be extended to directed ( Watts and Strogatz, 1998 ), weighted ( Opsahl and Panzarasa, 2009 ), and two-mode networks ( Opsahl, 2013 ).
