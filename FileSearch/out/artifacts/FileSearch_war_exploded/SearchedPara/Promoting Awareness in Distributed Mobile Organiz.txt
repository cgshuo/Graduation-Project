 Increasing mutual awareness among distributed collaborators has been a focus of the CSCW community for over a decade. The majority of these studies, however , have been on availability and contextual awareness among coworkers in distributed but fixed contexts. This paper intends to contribute to our understanding of the awareness needs of distributed, mobile organizations by describing the inadvertent erosion of awareness in a 25-member division of one high-tech firm and the members X  responses to proposed solutions. The findings suggest that managerial shifts may need to precede technology developments. K.4.3 Computers and society, Organizational impacts, CSCW Management, Performance, Design, Human Factors Awareness, self-organizing sy stems, organizational design Awareness of one X  X  coworker s X  activities and whereabouts facilitates communication, coor dination, and productive but unplanned encounters for informati on exchange [2, 4, 5]. A taken-for-granted feature of co-located contexts, maintaining awareness of distributed coworkers can be time consuming, distracting, intrusive, and require not-yet-habitual behaviors [5]. As organizations extend the application of real estate usage strategies such as  X  X oteling X  and telework ing beyond consultants and sales personnel to engineers, accountants, and managers, staying connected with remote colleagues is becoming a growing concern for an increasing proportion of the workforce [1, 10].  X  X lexGroup X  is a 25-member division of a high-tech products and services firm that has combined  X  X eleworking, X   X  X oteling, X  and  X  X istributed collaboration X  in a flexible organization design expected to become increasingly common [1]. The division consists of four functional s ubgroups responsible for designing both technologies and managerial tools to support these flexible configurations.  X  X aking their own medicine, X  the group includes geographically-distributed members who work  X  X lexibly, X  meaning that each member works at home at least two days per week, then in unassigned, reservable workspaces in one of several national and international campuses the remaining days. Members typically m ove among campuses. The division members have all work ed in other departments prior to joining FlexGroup, so each member brings a breadth of both technical expertise and organizational knowledge. The group X  X  projects include  X  X nitiatives X  that involve members from at least two functional subgroups within the division in addition to involvement in projects led by other divisions. Some of the subgroups X  projects are directly interdependent, requiring temporal coordination between groups to deliver a promised product or service on time, while others are more politically coupled in that the outcome of one project may affect the organization X  X  receptivity to the next. Organizational investments in enabling technologies include support for home office equipment, a phone forwarding system, a calendaring system, and the ability to locate coworkers on campus via the workspace reservation system. In addition, designated campus locales called  X  X eighborhoods  X  have been created for groups with a critical mass in or near a metropolitan area. Current efforts to facilitate awar eness include monthly meetings of the project leaders; a monthly meeting of the entire division to relay organizational information; and an un-enforced rule that division members will work in or near the  X  X eighborhood X  on Tuesdays if they are in town. Finally, the flexible office strategy is based on a philosophy of  X  X hoice X  regarding the timing and location of one X  X  work. The FlexGroup members have also embraced the choice philosophy, and have modified their work practices accordingly. At the time of the study, the divi sion manager expr essed moderate to high dissatisfaction with the level of awareness among subgroups and a belief that lack of awareness was contributing to inter-group conflicts over resour ces and performance evaluations [see parallels in 2]. He designed an exercise to improve cross-group awareness for the annual off-site: Each initiative leader reported on the background, progress, and next steps of his or her project. In response, division me mbers clarified their roles with respect to each objective after gaining a sense of the big picture. communication practices to improve availability, activity, and personal awareness [11]. I attended the off-site as a partic ipant-observer, then interviewed each division member to ask about the perceived level of awareness prior to the off-site. Three months later, I asked each member to provide sociometric data reporting frequency of interaction and levels of awareness based on the most recent two weeks. I then re-interviewed 18 of the 25 members when they completed the sociometric questionnaire. The data indicate that the division members have self-organized around project objectives, a predicted pattern for  X  X irtual X  organizations. While the partic ipants communicate intensively with others working on the same objective, however, they have little contact with anyone outside that group except in formal meetings. When one objective is completed and the members disperse to work on other projects, the pattern repeats. The following comment was common:  X  X  talked to him when we were working together, but we don X  X  have any projects in common now, so I never talk to him anymore except at staff [meeting]. X  Despite this pattern and the manager X  X  perceptions, the members reported relatively high satisfaction with their awareness of their coworkers during the initial interviews:  X  X  think I am able to talk with everyone I need to. X  When prompted to clarify their expectations regarding an  X  X ppropriate X  level of interaction to maintain coworker awareness, the following statement was common:  X  X h, it would be nice to say  X  X i X  once in a while, but I don X  X  need that to get my work done. X  Despite a widespread, positive assessment of the off-site exercise, responses in the second round of in terviews indicated that neither overall communication practices nor members X  preferences for contact with and information about their coworkers had changed. Most members reported that they had been completely unaware of at least one of the projects reported on during the exercise and had been surprised by the status of other projects. This information had proved useful to most in either clarifying their own role in the project or adjusting their expectati ons of others. For instance, the  X  X nalyst X  group complained that they were often not called in on a project until it was  X  X oo late, X  meaning that the team had collected data without asking for assistance in the design of the data collection instruments, so the data was incomplete and of poor quality, but too little time remained for the analysts to compensate for the errors. Nonetheless, the  X  X hat I need to know to do my job X  ethos prevailed. For instance, one project leader began sending broadcast messages about his pr oject on a regular basis, but several members involved in that project complained that the messages were  X  X rritating X  because they did not relate directly to themselves and their own role. Unchanged communicative practices include delayed or non-responses to one another X  X  em ails, avoiding the  X  X eighborhood, X  and not forwarding one X  X  phone. When queried about these practices, members complained that such expectations (phone forwarding, working in the neighborhood) were  X  X ypocritical X :  X  X he purpose of the program is to allow each of us to work in the way that we are most productive. I X  X  not a phone (email, office, IM) person. I shouldn X  X  have to forward my phone if that doesn X  X  work for me. X  The majority of CSCW awarene ss literature is concerned with maintaining workplace awareness [3, 4] among distributed collaborators accountable for achieving common goals [see 4, 7, 8 for exceptions]. From this perspective, FlexGroup is a success story: The members, for the most part, use the tools available to them to stay in close contact with the other members of their current project groups. Some of the most significant benefits of informal awareness, however, come from serendipitous connections, whether technical or social, that enable project success [6]. By communicating with their immediate collaborators only, the members of FlexGroup limit their resources. One implication of these pre liminary observations is that developing and maintaining periphe ral awareness in distributed groups, at least for the time being, requires explicit attention. A taken-for-granted feature of co-located environments, workers may need education on the value of peripheral awareness. [1] Apgar, M. The Alternative Workplace: Change Where and [2] Cramton, C.
