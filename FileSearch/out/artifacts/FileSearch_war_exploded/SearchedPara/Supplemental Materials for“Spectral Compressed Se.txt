Specifically, We will use  X  i,l := |  X  e ( i,l ) | as a short hand notation. prove in this manuscript. smallest values obeying that under either of the following conditions: then X is the unique solution of EMaC with probability exceeding 1  X  1 n 2 with probability exceeding 1  X  1 n 2 built upon the noiseless situation, which is deferred to Appendix G. that our analysis already entails all reasoning required for Theorem 3. Some of their mutual connections are listed as follows. 1. G L = E  X  L E L , and G R = ( E R E  X  R ) T ; 2. For any a , b  X  [ n 1 ]  X  [ n 2 ] , one has 3. The incoherence measure satisfies 4. The measure  X  4 can be bounded by  X  1 and  X  3 as follows Proof. See Appendix A.

 proceeds as follows: in Lemma 2, which we will verify step by step.
 and hence W = F j 0 , then one can verify that with overwhelming probability one has This allows us to bound kP T ( F i ) k F as follows which immediately validates Condition (18): measure then one has for all 1  X  i  X  j 0 with probability exceeding 1  X  ( n 1 n 2 )  X  3 . Proof. See Appendix E.
 condition (3) of F 0 can carry over to every P T ( F i ) (1  X  i  X  j 0 ) . One can then verify that for every i ( 0  X  i  X  j 0 ), for any t  X  p  X  ( F ) n 1 n 2 , holds with probability at most c 8 exp  X  c 9 qt 2  X  ( F ) n Proof. See Appendix F. Lemma 6 immediately yields that for all i (0  X  i  X  j 0 )
P for some constant c 13 &gt; 0 . Under this condition, we can conclude hence EMaC admits perfect reconstruction of X .
 matrix, one can verify the identities and which immediately give with the convention that 1  X  ( y immediately yield Owing to the multi-fold Hankel structure of A a , the matrix UU  X  Since there are only  X  b nonzero entries in A b each of magnitude 1  X   X  each entry of UU  X  is bounded in magnitude by which immediately implies that Similarly, one can derive magnitude of all entries of UU  X  A a V V  X  can now be bounded by Since A b has only  X  b nonzero entries each has magnitude 1  X   X  The above bounds (26), (27) and (28) taken together lead to P a | X  UU which simply come from the inequality (28), and matrix B such that For any ( k,l )  X  [ n 1 ]  X  [ n 2 ] , we can then bound Since A ( k,l ) has only  X  k,l nonzero entries each of magnitude 1  X   X  which indicates that  X  2  X   X  2 1 c 2 s r . Now look at P a P U A b , and that UU  X  A b has  X  b non-zero columns, or, and hence UU  X  A b , where the last inequality follows from Lemma 3. Similarly, one has lemma by considering two scenarios separately. The last term of (34) can be bounded as this situation. We would first like to bound n 1 n 2 m A  X  + A  X  P T ( H e ) term can be lower bounded by verify that By definition, we have the identities and thus Note that Owing to the fact that each entry of E  X  L has magnitude 1  X  A similar argument yields  X  Define a family of operators We can also compute and hence Comparing (42) and (43) gives where the inequality follows from our assumption that E ( Z a i ) = 0 . This further gives We can then bound the operator norm as This together with (46) gives completes the proof.
 Fix any b  X  [ n 1 ]  X  [ n 2 ] . For any a  X  [ n 1 ]  X  [ n 2 ] , define allows us to derive and thus This immediately gives which further leads to which immediately leads to For any a  X  [ n 1 ]  X  [ n 2 ] , define that we can write This immediately gives Moreover, we have, in distribution, the following identity hence E The definition of the spectral norm k M k := max  X  : k  X  k where the last inequality uses the fact that k A a k 2 = 1  X  .
 The fact that E H  X  i = 0 yields and hence H e = A  X  ( H e ) + A  X   X  ( H e ) , we can obtain The second term can be bounded using the triangle inequality as Since the constraint of Noisy-EMaC requires P  X   X  X  X  X o structure of the enhanced form allows us to bound A  X   X  X e  X  X o e  X  n 1 n 2  X  , which immediately leads to Combining this with (49), we have Further from Lemma 2, we know that Therefore, combining all the above results give recognizing these two conditions are equivalent to (7).
