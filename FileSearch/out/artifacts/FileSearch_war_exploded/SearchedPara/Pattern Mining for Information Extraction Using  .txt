 Information extraction systems use automated methods to extract from natural-language text facts or pieces of information related to a particular topic or event. The facts are used to fill pre-defined templates or to populate a database for various pur-poses. Information extraction is usually performed using pattern matching X  X earching formation. These extraction patterns can be constructed automatically or semi-automatically by the system by analyzing sample relevant text and the associated answer key (the training corpus) that is usually constructed by human analysts. An in-formation extraction system requires an extensive training corpus or review of the ex-traction patterns by a human expert to achieve good accuracy. 
The challenge is to develop user-friendly personalizable information extraction information to supplement the small amount of information provided by the user conveniently available source of supplementary information to exploit to improve the extraction patterns. 
In this study, we attempt to develop a method to mine candidate linguistic patterns from the text corpus for information extraction. The candidate patterns mined from clear about the following two approaches) 1. Machine-assisted pattern construction: given a sentence containing a target piece of information to extract, the system can present the most promising candidate pat-terns (this term is not clear) for the user to select and customize to form an extrac-tion pattern. 2. Pseudo-supervised learning method: an automated method in which the system is generate a training set. Since the training set generated by the seed pattern is not as good as a manually constructed training set, the patterns learnt will include a high-er proportion of erroneous patterns. Limiting the patterns learnt to those in the set of candidate patterns will serve to filter out the more promising patterns. learning. We retrieved a sample of medical abstracts from the Medline database on treatment relations from the abstracts. Instead of manually constructing a training set, we assumed that any sentence that contains a treatment concept (e.g. drug) and a dis-ease concept expresses a treatment relation between the treatment and disease. In oth-later be applied to other sentences to extract new treatments, new diseases and new re-lations. Figure 1 shows the overall process for mining information extraction patterns; detailed explanations follow in later sections. In an earlier study [1], we had found that mining patterns to extract drug and disease in a sentence is a non-trivial task. We used the Apriori algorithm [2] to mine sample occurring word patterns to see if these patterns could be used to identify treatment re-lations in sentences. Various measures were used to rank the rules, such as Rule Con-fidence, Normalized Chi Square, Confidence Difference and Confidence Ratio. The results were not convincing as the rules contained few terms that signified a treatment relation. 
Word patterns and statistical association measures alone were not good eno ugh to construct extraction patterns. Statistical association measures need to be combined syntactic and semantic constraints might be helpful, we manually constructed extrac-tion patterns for identifying sentences containing drug-disease relations based on 100 abstracts. We found that the patterns could be grouped into the following domain-specific semantic categories: From this, we compiled a dictionary of words belonging to these semantic categories. 
We continue to investigate what kind of syntactic and semantic constraints can be imposed on linguistic patterns mined from a text corpus to generate good quality ex-straints from the domain-specific semantic categories would improve the extraction patterns. 1570 abstracts were downloaded from the MEDLINE database [3] via the PubMed in-the MMTx (MetaMap Transfer) program developed by the National Library of Medi-cine [4] to produce an output text file. MMTx is a part-of-speech and semantic tagger which takes biomedical text as input and identifies Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts in the text by mapping relevant phrases to the UMLS Metathesaurus [5]. The output was further processed to tag the tokens (either words or phrase chunks) formation in a relational database. patterns that occur at least 5 times in the corpus. A token can be represented by either of the following attributes: 
Example candidate patterns generated are shown in Table 1. Note that there is an implied wildcard (representing 0 to 3 tokens ) between the tokens in each pattern X  X .e. the patterns are sequential patterns but not adjacent patterns. 
Without any lexical, syntactic or semantic constraints, a large number of candidate training set, there were on average more than 1000 candidate patterns that match parts of the sentence and have to reviewed by a human analyst to select an extraction pat-candidate patterns. 
Based on an informal error analysis, we introduced the following constraints to improve the quality of the candidate patterns:  X  The pattern must not contain a preposition as the first or last token 
We then filtered out the patterns containing a treatment concept and a disease con-tences. The treatment and disease concepts were identified using the UMLS semantic types annotated by the MMTx program. 
On examining the candidate patterns, we found some useless patterns that contain the treatment concept and disease concept in adjacent positions (with no tokens be-tween them). These were eliminated since the tokens between the treatment and dis-ease concepts seem to be the most useful for identifying disease-treatment relations. 
Next, we separated the candidate patterns into 2 subsets:  X  Subset 1 contains a word token that matches an entry in the domain-specific  X  Subset 2 does not contain a word in the dictionary. Subset 1 contains 62 candidate patterns, some of which are listed in Table 2. 
The candidate patterns were converted to final extraction patterns. Converting a candidate pattern to an extraction pattern involves indicating where the extraction slots are in the pattern X  X he placeholders for the information of interest to extract. To extract a disease-treatment relation, two slots X  X  disease slot and a treatment slot need to be created, and this can easily be accomp lished by converting the disease concept can be constructed: 
We have investigated only the last two types of patterns. 114 extraction patterns (Type 2 and Type 3) were derived from the 61 candidate pat-terns. The patterns were applied back to the corpus, i.e. the 1570 medical abstracts, to extract disease and treatment from each matched sentence through pattern matching. extractions by the pattern. 
The average precision for the two-slot ( disease+treatment ) patterns (Type 3) were: 
The average precision for single-slot ( treatment only) patterns (Type 2) were: 
Wrong extractions were mainly due to six causes: 1. Erroneous Parsing. The MMTx parser and an auxiliary annotation module failed to tag noun phrases with correct part of speech class and hence incurred missing hits. 2. Inadequate chunking. The current prepro cessing is unable to recognize major phrasal units such as noun phrases and hence causes a lot of inaccurate extractions. 3. Complex entity names. Names of most drugs or therapies, especially their abbre-viations and acronyms, often could not be tagged as noun or adjective and hence ended up with  X  X nknown X  as their part-of-speech tag. 4. Complex syntactic structures. Coordination, relative clauses, prepositional phrases, etc. reduce the extraction accuracy of a pattern. 5. Coreference problem. Pronouns and definite references are common in medical ar-ticles probably because of the complex names of many medical terms.
