 Distance metric learning is an important machine-learning technique and has played a critical role in various tasks of real-world intelligent systems. Typically, any task that requires dissimilarity/similarity measures has to assume some forms of distance metrics or distance functions, either explic itly or implicitly. For example, Euclidean distance is widely used in many real-world applications, such as face recognition and automated image annotation. Many studies have shown that the choice of distance metrics could greatly affect the performance of tasks, making distance metric learning an important research topic.

A large number of algorithms have been proposed and studied for distance metric learning. Numerous applications have been found for distance metric learning, in-cluding pattern recognition, natural langu age processing, computer vision, computer graphics, multimedia retrieval, web search and mining, bioinformatics, etc. For ex-ample, distance metric learning has been applied to boost the quality of data clus-tering, improve the accuracy of object reco gnition, and enhance the performance of image/video retrieval. Despite the extensive efforts, there are a number of important issues that need to be further explored and investigated when applying distance metric learning in real-world applications.

This special Section presents high-quality articles that aim to advance the state-of-the-art research on distance metric learning, with the focus on solving important and practical issues in deploying distance metric learning to intelligent systems in vari-ous domains. The selection of articles explore and develop practical distance metric learning techniques as a key component technology of an overall, perhaps large-scale, real-world intelligent system. The special Section not only addresses novel method-ology and theory, but also emphasizes the innovative applications of distance metric learning techniques in real-world intelligent systems. In particular, this special Sec-tion received a total of 9 submissions, about half of which were invited from carefully selected papers accepted by top conferences. The editors managed the rigorous review tasks from this pool of good quality submissions, which involved 26 reviewers. Finally, three articles are accepted in this special Section.
 In the first article entitled  X  X ultiview Metric Learning with Global Consistency and Local Smoothness X , Zhai et al. address a multiview metric learning problem where the same object could have different observations from multiview observation spaces. To handle the unique challenges arising from multiviewed data, the authors present a new distance-metric learning method in a semi-supervised learning setting that takes into account both global consistency and local smoothness. The basic idea is to reveal the shared latent feature space of the multiview observations by embodying global consistency constraints and preserving loc al geometric structures. An empirical eval-uation on face alignment shows promising performance of the proposed method.
In the second article entitled  X  X ransfer Metric Learning with Semi-Supervised Ex-tension X , Zhang and Yeung address a practical challenge of distance metric learning due to the insufficiency of labeled data. They propose a transfer learning technique that improves the learning of distance metric of a target task by exploiting the labeled data from the other tasks. A convex optimization formulation is presented to model the relationships among tasks in the form of a task covariance matrix. They further extend the proposed transfer metric learning to the semi-supervised learning setup in order to effectively explore the unlabeled data. The effectiveness of this method was validated on several applications.
In the third article entitled  X  X etric Learni ng for Estimating Psychological Similar-ities X , Xu et al. address an important problem in cognitive psychology for quantifying the perceived similarities between stimuli. They present a novel general metric learn-ing algorithm called Yada that is based on two-alternative forced-choice behavioral experiments. The proposed method tries to learn forward and backward nonlinear mappings between an objective space where the stimuli are defined and a subjective space where the perceived similarity is me asured. The empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real human behavioral datasets shows that Yada outperforms several of the state-of-the-art algorithms for embedded and metric learning, both in terms of likelihood and recovery error.
