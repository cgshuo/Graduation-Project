Chapter 10 ( X  X  X he User Dimension in Information Representation and Retrieval X  X ) focuses on the inter-action between users and information systems, while Chapter 11 ( X  X  X valuation of Information Representa-tion and Retrieval X  X ) presents various criteria for evaluating information representations and retrieval systems.

The author describes the entire field from a high level perspective. Technicalities and implementation is-sues have been avoided to give the reader a broad theoretical grasp of the field. The book has been logically organized to show the relationship between information representation and information retrieval and to show how the latter depends on the former. Key concepts and techniques have been systematically explained.

The book covers the diversity of information types (e.g., image, sound, textual and multilingual infor-mation) with great clarity. The author clearly illustrates the difficulties associated with the organization of non-conventional information sources and the lack of a comprehensive and complete method of repre-senting such information relevantly.

Although the book title suggests a focus on  X  X  X he digital age, X  X  it lacks coverage of many recent innova-tions associated with search and retrieval on the World Wide Web. The author discusses the distributed nature of the Internet and difficulties associated with heterogeneous information types and representations. However, the book does not cover the functioning of search engines such as Google, recommendation serv-ices, Web services, and other technologies that are redefining information retrieval on the Internet. More importantly, one could imagine devoting some time to explaining the quantity of information accessible through the World Wide Web and why that makes accurate and timely information retrieval methods crit-ical in the digital age.

Regardless, the book provides a strong introduction to the fundamentals of information retrieval. Many important topics are covered and explained clearly, making it a strong introductory text for undergraduate students along with those who want to become familiar with information retrieval techniques without get-ting into mathematical formalisms or implementation details. Readers can use the basic concepts in this book as background for deeper exploration of topics in more specialized texts.
 Designing Portals: Opportunities and Challenges. Edited by Ali Jafari and Mark Sheehan. Information Science Publishing, 2003, $67 ISBN 1-59140-108-9
Web-based portals are changing the way computer users access information. Growing from news and commercial information sites, portals offer a powerful way of connecting and presenting individualized con-tent to a user. Nowhere is this more evident than at institutions of higher learning, where portals provide the capability to present a wide range of content to the many audiences across a university. Deciding on what content to present, designing an interface, and addressing how the content can be accessed and by whom, offer unique challenges as portal designers are forced to coordinate applications and information sources that are controlled by campus organizations that seldom interact and who might even be competing against each other for budget money and enrolment.

In their book, Designing Portals: Opportunities and Challenges , Ali Jafari and Mark Sheehan walk the reader through the entire process of constructing an information portal at an institution of higher learning.
Both authors use their significant experience in building enterprise wide portals to address the wide range of issues that face a university that is readying themselves for the leap into the murky waters of information portals. This reference is aimed at a project manager who has been given the task of implementing an enter-prise-wide portal.

The book consists of 14 chapters divided into four sections. An extensive preface and introductory chap-ter present an overview and a motivation for the book. The authors stress the political and business impacts of portals, reminding the reader that the development of a portal is much more involved than creating a website. They also point out the potential range of stakeholders that would be involved in a portal project and the challenges that are posed by inter-organizational politics.

The second section introduces the theory of portals and discusses the impact that portals have on an organization  X  s mission statement and business strategy. The six chapters of this section explore the differ-ence facets of specifying the portal design, assembling the project team, and evaluating different develop-ment options. Each chapter is an independently produced paper of conference or journal length, offering the reader the benefit of analyzing a common problem through different author  X  s viewpoints.
The third section consists of four portal development case studies. In each, a different university  X  s devel-opment efforts are presented from the point of project initiation to fielding. All express a consistent set of requirements and project management tasks while discussing the success of their in house developed portal solution. This presentation is complimented by the next section, which contains five papers from portal ven-dors. The chapters of the fourth section highlight the use of commercial products to unify or bridge the wide variety of web-based content and products commonly found at a university.

The book also contains two appendices. The first is a presentation of the results of an online survey con-ducted by the authors in the summer of 2001. These results capture questionnaire responses from users that were presumably interested in portals and portal development. The inclusion of this information is questionable, as the author admits that the number of participants was not statistically valid and the par-ticipants themselves self-selected.

The second appendix is a white paper published by the authors in 2000 as part of a portal development project. It is specific to a particular project but is a good example of material that has been used successfully in a development effort. The reader could use this information as a template to create descriptive and plan-ning documents for his or her own projects.

If there are drawbacks to Jafari and Sheehan  X  s book, they are because the material is a compila-tion of papers, as opposed to chapters written by the same authors. Because each of the chapters  X  authors is discussing a similar topic, there is some repetition and overlap between the chapters. Because of this, a reader might find themselves taking pieces of different chapters as they develop their own strategies.

Overall this book covers the wide range of topics surrounding a portal development initiative. The authors present a broad overview of material based on the experiences gained through large scale portal projects at major universities across the United States. Project managers and university administrators interested in creating a portal for their institution should read this work, as the issues are presented in clear, non-technical form and the case studies include many different development approaches and products. Sec-tions of these papers can easily be  X  X  X ifted X  X  and used in development efforts sponsored by any large organization.

In conclusion, the book was informative and would certainly whet the appetite of anyone charged with creating an information portal in an academic setting.
 Trust in Knowledge Management and Systems in Organizations. By Maija-Leena Huotari and Mirja Iivonen (Eds.), Idea Group Publishing, 2004, $79.95, 352 pages, 1-59140-126-7 (Hardcover) ISBN 1-59140-127-5 (e-book)
Virtually every respectable publication about knowledge management (KM) includes a statement relat-ing to trust being the necessary key factor that enables knowledge to be shared willingly within an organ-ization. For example, Baumard (1999) discusses trust as a tacit foundation for relationships, organizational understandings, and  X  X  X oral agreements X  X  among colleagues. Elisabeth Davenport has discussed establish-ing  X  X  X wift trust X  X  in virtual organizations (2004) based on the work of Meyerson, Weick, and Kramer (1996) and Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998). In an essay in Sharing Expertise: Beyond Knowledge Management , Hinds and Pfeffer say,  X  X  X eing motivated to share what you know with others requires trust X  X ot only trust-ing those others (something that is diminished with competition) but also trusting the larger institutions within which the sharing of expertise is occurring X  X  (2003, p. 15). And as (Thomas) Davenport and (Lau-rence) Prusak state in their seminal work Working Knowledge ,  X  X  X he role of trust in knowledge transactions helps explain why knowledge initiatives based solely on the belief that infrastructure creates communication seldom deliver the expected benefits X  X  (1998, p. 36).

Now Maija-Leena Huotari and Mirja Iivonen have organized and edited an entire volume devoted to the subject of trust in knowledge management and organizational systems, and there is plenty to write about and reflect on as the authors in this work attest. Trust in Knowledge Management and Systems in Organi-zation goes beyond the standard  X  X  X ow to X  X  works and those that reflect on  X  X  X essons learned X  X  in the KM arena with an approach that is both theoretical and practical. The book  X  s greatest value is the in-depth examination of the trust factor from the standpoint of researchers, librarians, and practitioners in disci-plines ranging from information studies and administrative science to knowledge management, and com-puting. Ten of the sixteen authors represented here are affiliated with Finnish universities as are the editors, so there is a definite Finnish flavor to the work, however, overall, it is not provincial but a collection of writings with an international perspective.

The book is divided into four sections: trust in performing, trust in online communities, citizens  X  trust in institutions, and trust models with essays that should be useful to those interested not only in formal knowl-edge sharing programs but also in organizational systems, virtual teams, e-government, and e-commerce. In the opening chapter the two editors provide an excellent overview of the importance of trust in the man-agement of knowledge-based organizations. This chapter is very well written citing leading authors and thinkers in the field of KM, and it would make a fine core text in a university seminar on knowledge management.

Several of the most intriguing chapters here are those written by the Italian authors. Andreina Mandelli examines the intersection of trust, self-organization, and hierarchies in value networks as well as the oppor-tunities and potential problems of societies that rely on networked economies. Her view is fresh and her
