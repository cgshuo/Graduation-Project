 Today, organizations are more and more facing compliance issues coming from inter-national and national regulatory bodies, from standardisation bodies as well as from recognized professional and/or sectorial associations. Demonstrating compliance to Indeed, the organization has to set-up the appropriate systems (processes, people and IT)  X  X mplementing X  the regulations. They also have to establish the necessary evi-dences to demonstrate their compliance. 
In our research, we focus on a specific regulatory context made from non-prescriptive regulations which applies on networked organizations. In contrast with supposed to do exactly the required actions, non-prescriptive regulations such as goal-based, risk-based or principle-based regimes offer more freedom regarding how to implement their requirements and thus open innovation opportunities regarding the implementation within a specific organization. This freedom can be exploited by the organization for differentiating itself from the others in terms of, for example, a better productivity (optimized processes) or a competitive Quality of Service (QoS) advan-tage (enhancing its customers X  level of trust). 
In our context, we consider the application of the regulations to networked organi-zations, more specifically to IT service value networks called  X  X ervice systems X . In [1], they are defined as  X  X  configuration of people, processes, technology and shared information connected through a value proposition with the aim of a dynamic co-creation of value through the participation in the exchanges with customers and external/internal service systems X . According to this view, a service system can be itself composed of service systems, cooperating to produce a global business service. In Luxembourg, we have a typical national service system business case where we can find telecommunication companies offering communication services to data cen-ters. Data centers themselves offer services to Archiving companies, which then have their services used by Financial IT Service Providers. Banks finally outsource part of their IT to these IT service providers. 
In such value constellation, there are interesting questions regarding the com-pliance of the whole service system to a set of non-prescriptive regulations and norms. Besides the question of a common interpretation of the requirements by each individual company, there is the question about how the requirements have been implemented by the different companies, the level of interoperability existing between the different implementations and finally the global level of compliance that the glob-al service system can demonstrate. Examples of requirements that apply to this service system are related to security and risk management (like those included in the ISO 27000 or ISO 15408), privacy issues (coming from national laws and EU direc-tives) as well as IT Service Management (like ITIL and ISO 20000). In the rest of the v3. [2] At the end of the previous section, we have raised a number of problems, which cor-respond to the following research questions: To answer to these two questions we propose a solution which is summarized in Figure 1 and includes two components: 
Note that the overall approach supports the (internal and/or external) auditors in their compliance checking process. Each organization has to trace its implementation to the ArchiMate model, this one is itsel f traceable to the Process Reference Frame-work which itself is linked to the regulation. 3.1 Introduction to 15504 For structuring and organizing the requirements inherent to regulations and norms, we have found and experimented a valuable requirements template and associated guide-lines that are made available through the 15504 standard [5]. In 15504 standard, a generic requirements X  taxonomy together with a predefined requirements X  structure define a framework used for eliciting and structuring requirements as well as for as-sessing and measuring the compliance of deployed Business Processes (BP) against these requirements.15504 (previously known as SPICE) provides an assessment model against which the assurance aspects of an organization in terms of realization of its BP and their contribution to business services objectives can be defined and measured. Built on top of those predecessors, the main originality of 15504 is to stan-dardize the structure of assurance requirements by defining a taxonomy of generic BP assurance goals that are applicable to BP of business domains. Fig. 2 presents the generic guidelines associated with the construction of a process reference and assess-ment framework (called PAM). On the left part of Fig. 2, from the bottom to the top, one can read the business capability goal of the services at level 1, and then, from 2.1 to 5.2, the different levels of assurance that can be associated to this BP.

According to 15504, a PAM describes requirements on BP implementing QoS as-surance attribute with the purpose and outcomes of each assurance attribute. The purpose of an assurance attribute  X  describes at a high l evel its overall objectives  X  [5]. Each purpose is fully decomposed into outcomes and indicators (see right part of Fig. 2. Each outcome is an observable achievement of some assurance attribute. An outcome describes that an artefact is produced, a significant change of state occurred, or some constraint has been met. Outcomes can be further detailed with indicators focusing on  X  sources of objective evidence used to support a judgment about the ful-filment of outcomes  X , for instance: work products ( X  an artefact associated with the execution of a process  X ), practices ( X  activities that contributes to the purpose or out-comes of a process  X ), or resources (e.g.  X  human resources, tools, methods and infra-structure  X ) [5]. 
Outcomes and indicators are organized into di fferent aspects. The first aspect is re-aspects associated with the activity. This result is in a taxonomy of assurance re-quirements goals. 3.2 Application of the 15504 Framework to ITIL 15504 has been applied by our research team at Tudor centre in several contexts where process needs to be assessed against assurance and performance levels. Pro-duced reference models include Basel II Risk Management in the financial sector, Sarbanes-Oxley, the 27000 series for security management , and COSO. In this paper, we illustrate its application in the the context of service management with the specific ITIL [2] target. The work performed by the Centre in this domain has reached a high level of visibility with the publication of the TIPA (Tudor X  X  ITSM Process Assessment) book [6] and the participation as co-editor of the ISO 20000-4. 
TIPA is an open framework for the assessment of ITSM processes. It describes requirements on 26 processes (see Fig. 3) belonging to 5 groups. 
A concrete example is given in Fig.4 with a fragment of the final result associated with Service Level Management. This example illustrates the different ISO 15504 concepts introduced in the previous sub-s ection: Purpose, Outcomes and Indicators ance aspect  X 2.2 X . One can read in the purpose and outcomes of level 1 that the main service level agreement, SLA), recording, monitoring and reporting. The level 2.2,  X  X ay-to-day X  management activities requires that agreements comply with pre-defined templates and that a formal internal review of the SLA must be organized. 3.3 Building Compliant 15504 Service Management Requirements Models As explained in the preceding section, 15504 helps to better structure specific types of QoS requirements models with a process reference framework (called PAM). Diffi-culties arise when creating those PAM: 15504 does not provide any guidance in the incremental elaboration of a PAM. It prov ides generic concepts used in PAM and rules (meta-requirements, see Fig.2) that must be satisfied by PAM, but gives no knowledge domain which is needed for that. This guidance can be given by GORE techniques, such as i* [7]. This has led to the development of a rigorous methodology (summarized in Fig. 5) supporting the transformation of natural language flat re-quirements from the original text of the norm into structured requirements organized in a PAM. 
The proposed methodology relies on a taxonomy of concepts close and compatible to those of 15504. The rules and heuristics that we have discovered regarding the use of i* in support to the progressive and systematic elaboration of PAM are presented in [8,9]. They are summarized in the next para graph in the context of the elaboration of the paraphrased result presented in Fig. 6. 
The QoS goals are expressed in terms of i* soft-goals and goals. The 15504 stan-filled when executing BP that implement the service. As indicated in Fig. , purposes an equivalent collection of other soft-goals and/or goals associated with domain corresponds to the first purpose shown in Fig 4.. Since outcomes are objectively ob-servable, they are modelled as goals (which can be further refined) and never with soft-goals. The horizontal lane of outcomes corresponds exactly to the outcomes shown in Fig. 4. Indicators are added an d modelled according their types, e.g. practices, work products and resources needed for the performance of the BP realizing resources (for work products and resources) and actors (for resources). For example, the work product  X  X LA X  is mapped to the i* resources  X  X LA X , and the practice  X  X onitor SL X  is mapped to the i* task  X  X onitor SL X  [12]. 
Finally, the i* mode and its tabular representation (Fig.4) are the inputs for the fi-nal structured text. An excerpt of it associated with the Service Level Management reference process is presented in Fig. 7. In [10], Zachman introduces its framework for managing enterprise architecture. His proposition includes the fundamentals of a conceptual information model that can be used for implementing an information system supporting the management of an en-terprise. More recently, ArchiMate [4] app ears as an emerging standard associated with a language for describing the different facets of an information system (business, application, infrastructure). Together with its tool support, ArchiMate allows to create a new  X  X econd order X  information system, the one which is needed for support-ing enterprise architects and decision makers in their management of enterprise IS transformations. 
We claim that compliance issues require similar  X  X econd order X  IS supporting organization in the management of their enterprise architecture specifically dedicated to the implementing of the regulations and norms requirements. The existence of such IS also helps in demonstrating the compliance of the organization to the internal and external auditors by explaining how the model is the mirror of the organization. Our research objective is to support companies in the development of that kind of IS. To this end, we are working on the design of enterprise architecture blueprints associated with the process reference models introduced in the previous section. At this stage, we are using ArchiMate for representing these blueprints in terms of Archi-tecture Reference Models. In Fig. 8, we present an excerpt of such model associated with the Service Level Management reference process. On this model, one can read how we use ArchiMate concepts for representing Purposes in terms of Goals, Expected Results in terms of Requirements, Best Practices in terms of Business Proc-esses and WorkProducts in terms of Business Objects. 
Taking this reference architecture as an input, the Enterprise Architect can design its own implementation which if also represented in ArchiMate can easily be traced to the reference model and thereby demonstrate its compliance. 
More details regarding the development and use of reference architectures in the telecommunication sector can be found in [11] In this paper, we have introduced the framework that we are developing for support-ing a service system composed from several organizations in their implementation of the requirements coming from different norms, regulations and best practices. We illustrated part of this framework within the context of ITIL best practices. 
This framework is produced by Tudor, a Research and Technological Organization whose part of its mission is to support private and public entities in their socio-economic development. Within this context, the proposed framework aims at support-ing these organizations in: Acknowledgements. The presented results are relying on a team of persons.
