 In this paper we present a syst em for cross-lingual information retrieval, which can handle tens of languages and millions of documents. Functioning of the syst em is demonstrated on corpus of European Legislation ( 22 languages, more than 400,000 documents per language). The syst em uses an interactive web-interface, which can take advantage of a predefined thesaurus allowing the user to dynamically re-rank the retrieval results based on the mapping onto a predefined thesaurus. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ] Performance, Experimenta tion, Human Factors. Canonical Correlation Analysis, Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval, Dynamic Search Ranking, Search Result Visualization In this paper we present a syst em for cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) working over the multilingual corpora of European Legislation Acquis Comm unautaire [1]. The unique part of the corpora is an alignment over 22 official languages of European Union and annotation of documents using EuroVoc thesaurus. The system uses Ca nonical Correlation Analysis for correlating words from differe nt languages and extracting language-independent latent di mensions, which serve as interlingua used to index the doc uments and match them against given queries [2]. Finally, during the retrieval time, EuroVoc thesaurus is used to let the user visually extend the query and re-rank the results in real-time. The system is performing sear ch over Acquis Communautaire (AC) corpus [1]. The corpus includes more than 400,000 texts written in 22 languages, namely: Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, La tvian, Maltese, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, and Swedish. An alignment is provided for each language pair, resulting in 231 alignments. Note that not all of the texts appear in all the languages or are aligned with all the languages. Most of the texts have been manually classified into the EuroVoc thesaurus. EuroVoc is a multilingua l thesaurus used specially for annotating European Legislation. It consists of more than 6,000 terms which are organized hierar chically up to 8 levels deep. The core component of the system is Canonical Correlation Analysis [2], a method for automatically extracting latent language-independent concepts from aligned corpora of texts. The documents are indexed by the di scovered latent concepts and a standard inverted index is used for the retrieval. The presented system uses a new enhanced version of the method, which is able to linearly scale with regards to the number of documents and number of language s. This makes it especially appropriate for the task of CLIR over millions of documents from 22 different languages as in the AC corpora. Due to efficiency of the applied method the whole search engine, including the preprocessing, correlation and inde xing stage, can run on a single high-end desktop computer. The main interface of the search engine is a web site, like in standard search engines: the user specifies a query and gets back a list of relevant documents. The us er can also specify language of the query and can filter the relevant documents by language. In case when language of the query is not specified, the system automatically classifies the query into one of the 22 languages. The user can navigate the resu lt list by using the SearchPoint gadget [3], which is located on the right side of the results list. The gadget visualizes the most relevant EuroVoc terms for the documents from the list and the us er can choose, by a simple mouse move, to re-rank in real-time the result list by putting emphasis on the selected EuroVoc terms.
