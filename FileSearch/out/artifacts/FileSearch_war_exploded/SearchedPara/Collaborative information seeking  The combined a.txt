 1. Introduction Information needs and the activities involved in seeking and using information are frequently collaborative.
This has instigated research on collaborative information seeking in general ( Foster, 2006; Karamuftuoglu, 1998 ), in specified domains such as command and control ( Prekop, 2002; Sonnenwald &amp; Pierce, 2000 ), edu-2004 ), as well as research on technologies supporting collaborative information seeking ( Lieberman, van
Dyke, &amp; Vivacqua, 1999; Romano, Roussinov, Nunamaker, &amp; Chen, 1999 ). In this research, collaborative information seeking is typically defined inclusively and in contrast to contemporary models of information seeking (e.g., Kuhlthau, 1991; Wilson, 1999 ), which are seen as focusing predominantly on the individual information seeker. This, however, makes collaborative information seeking a vague concept, especially with regard to whether the collaborating actors as a group are informed by the information-seeking activities.
Following Karamuftuoglu (1998) , this paper contends that information seeking is just as much about mak-ing coherent sense of information as it is about finding extant information. In a collaborative context, infor-mation is typically distributed unevenly across actors, and they may interpret the information known to them in different ways or be unable to make coherent sense of it. On the one hand, this is what makes communi-cation and information seeking worthwhile activities. On the other hand, it also emphasizes the considerable work and constraints involved in making coherent sense of information within a group of actors. This may be particularly evident in relation to knowledge work (e.g., Kidd, 1994 ) and engineering projects (e.g.,
Curtis, Krasner, &amp; Iscoe, 1988 ), the two domains primarily underlying this paper. This paper proposes that the uneven distribution of information and the different meanings actors may derive from the informa-tion known to them make collaborative information seeking inextricably related to an essential aspect of collaboration:
Collaboration requires a certain level of agreement and shared understanding, often termed common ground ( Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991; Olson &amp; Olson, 2000 ). The collaborating actors need not, and in practice do not, agree about everything but without common ground collaboration is unlikely to succeed.
Establishing common ground is often a lengthy process (e.g., Potts &amp; Catledge, 1996 ) while the result is a temporary agreement, necessitating continual efforts to maintain common ground. The complexity of establishing and maintaining common ground increases with the size of the collaborating group.
The acquisition of information by some actors in a group will lead to a gradual disintegration of common ground unless information is continually shared and a common understanding reached, at least about core issues ( Schmidt &amp; Bannon, 1992 ). Depending on the amount and frequency of information sharing the group will either maintain common ground, disintegrate into subgroups with various kinds of interrelations, or become more closely knit through the creation of more extensive common ground. If the pattern of sharing remains stable over extended periods of time it becomes constitutive of how actors perceive the purpose and closeness of their collaboration ( Talja, 2002 ). Hence, collaborative information seeking must include informa-tion sharing in order to encompass processes of making coherent sense of acquired information among the members of a group. While information sharing is included in some definitions of collaborative information seeking (e.g., Karamuftuoglu, 1998 ) it is, however, explicitly excluded in other definitions (e.g., Hansen &amp; be argued that this exclusion involves an under-recognition of the importance of common ground and may lead to either individual or group reductionism. 2. Definition
In his review, Foster (2006, p. 330) defines the research field of collaborative information seeking as  X  X  X he study of the systems and practices that enable individuals to collaborate during the seeking, searching, and retrieval of information X  X . This is an example of a definition that assigns information sharing a borderline sta-tus and thereby dissociates acquisition of information from being informed by it, a dissociation this paper argues against. Instead, this paper proposes that collaborative information seeking is defined as the informa-tion-seeking activities performed by actors to inform their collaborative work combined with the collabora-tive-grounding activities involved in making this information part of the actors X  shared understanding of their work:
Information seeking is construed as the activities involved in realizing a need for information, exploring this information need, identifying possible information sources, consulting selected sources, adapting informa-tion to work problems, as well as coming across information without actively looking for it. These activities occur in a collaborative context but can be performed by individual actors or by several actors in collaboration.

Collaborative grounding is construed as the active construction by actors of a shared understanding that assimilates and reflects available information. This involves that information items are shared and their meanings debated and resolved, at least locally and temporarily. As collaborations become larger, the work involved in collaborative grounding escalates and collaborative grounding is increasingly restricted to core information.

Over time, the two activities of information seeking and collaborative grounding will dynamically and repeatedly change the balance between individual and shared understanding. Fig. 1 illustrates that informa-tion-seeking activities tend to shift the balance between individual and shared understanding toward a larger proportion of individual understanding because information seeking is often delegated to subgroups of actors or information is encountered by individual actors. Conversely, collaborative-grounding activities drive the balance toward a larger proportion of shared understanding and thereby counter the effect of information seeking. Collaborative information seeking entails a continual effort to maintain the balance between individ-ual and shared understanding at a level that provides the common ground necessary for working together while at the same time recognizing the crucial importance of information and understanding specific to indi-vidual actors ( Schmidt &amp; Bannon, 1992; Talja, 2002 ).

An often-cited example of collaborative information seeking is Allen X  X  (1977) description of the gatekeeper, who takes the responsibility to look for information and forward it to colleagues in her organization. Another example highlights project groups as a core forum for collaborative information seeking. When one project participant formulates an information need, another may know an appropriate source, the actual consulting of this source may be delegated to a third project participant, the information obtained is then discussed at a project-group meeting, and this partly advances the participants X  shared understanding and partly spawns new questions and thereby continued collaborative information seeking ( Hertzum, 2002 ). 3. Discussion
Collaborative information seeking is often studied in relation to project work because projects provide a very common frame for collaboration. Collaborative information seeking is, however, not restricted to pro-jects but can also take place, and be studied, at more fine-grained levels such as individual search sessions as well as at more coarse-grained levels such as entire organizations. Such variations in granularity constitute one dimension of collaborative information seeking with far-reaching implications for the issues to be addressed, the means for addressing them, the research methods appropriate for studying them, and so forth.
Research on collaborative information seeking has treated variations in collaborative information seeking along, at least, six main dimensions:
Purposes , that is the overall reasons for which collaborative information seeking is done, such as current awareness, routine search needs, and exploring a new or unfamiliar area ( Hirsh &amp; Dinkelacker, 2004 )or strategic, paradigmatic, directive, and social information sharing ( Talja, 2002 ).

Types , that is the types of information sought, such as factual information ( Lazonder, 2005 ), assessment ( Hansen &amp; Ja  X  rvelin, 2005 ), and opinion and creative discourse ( Zipperer, 1993 ).

Roles , that is patterns of activities and responsibilities assumed by or assigned to actors, such as informa-tion gatekeeper ( Allen, 1977 ), information-seeking instigator ( Prekop, 2002 ), and information sharer.
Activities , that is prototypical actions and interactions performed by actors, such as specifying information needs ( Bruce et al., 2003 ), assessing information sources ( Hertzum, 2002 ), browsing ( Twidale, Nichols, &amp;
Paice, 1997 ), people finding ( Yiman-Seid &amp; Kobsa, 2003 ), searching project files ( Hertzum &amp; Pejtersen, 2000 ), and consolidation meetings ( Beyer &amp; Holtzblatt, 1998 ).

Granularity , that is the level at which collaborative information seeking is performed or studied, such as conversational turns ( Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991 ), search sessions ( Lazonder, 2005 ), projects ( Bruce et al., 2003 ), organizations ( Allen, 1977 ), and professions.

Coupling , that is the interconnections between different actors X  activities in performing collaborative infor-mation seeking, ranging from loose couplings among actors who mainly work individually ( Hertzum, Pej-tersen, Cleal, &amp; Albrechtsen, 2002 ) to tight couplings among actors whose performance involves frequent interactions ( Hyldega  X  rd, 2006 ).

The dimensions convey a diversity we have only begun to systematically address in the research on collab-orative information seeking. Typically, individual studies focus on some dimensions and are conducted with-out reference to a broader framework. Without positioning studies in a landscape spanned by, for example, the six abovementioned dimensions of collaborative information seeking it becomes difficult to integrate the insights gained from different studies.

Collaborative grounding provides multiple illustrations of interrelationships among the dimensions. If most activities are performed individually (coupling dimension), collaborative grounding becomes an essential, dis-tinct activity. If information-seeking activities are mostly performed collaboratively (coupling dimension) they subsume collaborative grounding, and the distinction between information seeking and collaborative ground-ing becomes predominantly analytic. Collaborative grounding is particularly important to the success of tightly coupled activities because actors X  need for common ground increases as activities become more tightly coupled ( Olson &amp; Olson, 2000 ). Collaborative grounding is, however, partial in several respects. In a project context (granularity dimension), collaborative grounding may, for example, unfold around a few core actors (role dimension) that are able to articulate the project vision clearly (type dimension). The other actors may be unaware of some information or simply unable to make out how the various pieces of information hang together, and they depend on the core actors X  sense of the project and ability to direct the project (activity dimension). Furthermore, collaborative grounding can only be achieved when a shared understanding can be reached, which is surely not always the case, and it is restricted to the points where the actors X  individual perspectives come together (purpose dimension).

Collaborative information seeking, as defined in this paper, has much in common with learning-in-working ( Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991, 2001 ). In discussions of how organizations learn we find a distinction between indi-vidual and social learning, which resembles the distinction between individual and collaborative information seeking. The distinction between individual and social learning concerns a difference between knowledge resid-ing in individual humans and knowledge that is embedded in cooperative work arrangements. At the individ-ual end of the spectrum Simon (1991, p. 125) states that  X  X  X ll learning takes place inside individual human heads; an organization learns in only two ways: (a) by the learning of its members, or (b) by ingesting new members who have knowledge the organization didn X  X  previously have. X  X  Conversely, at the social end of the spectrum Brown and Duguid (1991, p. 46) conclude from a study of service technicians that  X  X  X ot only is the learning in this case inseparable from working, but also individual learning is inseparable from collective learning. The insight accumulated is not a private substance, but socially constructed and distributed. X  X  The difference between the two viewpoints is to some extent a matter of the dominant level of analysis. They con-cur that both skilled individuals and elaborate collaborative practices are needed to accomplish many complex tasks. Similarly, the gap between models of individual information seeking (e.g., Kuhlthau, 1991; Wilson, 1999 ) and of collaborative information seeking is primarily a matter of the level of analysis, not a disagree-ment about whether collaborative practices exist and matter. Further, Brown and Duguid X  X  (1991) work sug-gests that information seeking may be collaborative to an extent that goes beyond previous work on collaborative information seeking and certainly merits taking the collaborative level as one X  X  point of departure.

A focus on the collaborative level entails that collaborating actors are seen as actively and continually con-structing their collaboration ( Schmidt &amp; Bannon, 1992 ). Thereby, such a focus seeks to avoid two reductionisms:
An individual reductionism in which focus is on the individual actor and collaboration is neglected or reduced to the sum of the individual actors X  activities.

A group reductionism in which the group is seen as a unitary actor and collaboration is, hence, blackboxed, suggesting it is a smooth and near automatic process.

Hitherto, collaborative information seeking has mostly been defined and discussed in contrast to individual reductionism. Group reductionism is, however, common and renders invisible a complex aspect of working together. Group reductionism is, for example, apparent in most software-engineering methods (e.g., Sommer-ville, 2004 ), which contain numerous techniques for acquiring and recording information but seldom provide guidance about how to systematically share and discuss acquired information within the project group.
In terms of the two sets of activities that constitute collaborative information seeking these software-engineering methods are biased toward information seeking to the extent of largely bypassing collaborative grounding. 4. Conclusion
Collaborative information seeking is an important, yet complex aspect of collaboration. As defined in this paper, collaborative information seeking is the combined activity of information seeking and collaborative grounding. This definition is proposed to anchor collaborative information seeking in the common ground necessary for collaborative work, to avoid both individual and group reductionisms, and to provide a basis for investigating how information can be effectively acquired and assimilated by collaborating actors. As foci of future work, this paper points, in particular, to an elaboration of the balance between common ground and the information and understanding acquired by and specific to individual actors.
