The need for more mature techniques to extract and manage information from the literature in biomedicine is rapidly growing, as we begin to see an increasing number of field experts who are potential users of such techniques. We present, in this special issue, advances in the field, ranging from biomedical-named entity recognition, identifying pairs of terms that are related in ways that are not predicted in advance, using machine learning in two phases for enhanced extraction of biological event information, extracting contrastive information through the analysis of negation, and terminology-based knowledge mining for novel knowledge discovery.

Biomedical-named entity recognition (NER) is one of the most heavily dis-cussed topics in the field, one that must be addressed adequately for later stages of text mining and management. The proposal by Park et al. [2006] is to use a maximum-entropy (ME) model, with separate feature sets, orthographical and lexical, for the two phases of recognition and classification, with the help of domain-salient words and collocations as lexical knowledge, automatically ex-tracted from the literature. The experimental results show that the two-phase method improves the performance over the mixed method for recognition and classification, although it is not clear if lexical knowledge meaningfully con-tributes to the process.

While the problem of biomedical NER is being resolved, the conceptual re-lationships among biomedical-named entities (or terms), often captured in on-tologies, are also of much interest. In particular, automatic identification of such relationships would be very helpful to balance the amount of informa-tion between existing ontologies and the vast and rapidly growing raw corpora, suchasM EDLINE . The proposal by Nenadic and Ananiadou [2006] is to identify such relationships indirectly, by dealing with the simplified notion of semantic-relatedness between two terms, through linguistic analyses of lexical, syntactic, and contextual similarities among biomedical terms. Although the evaluation shows that the trade-off between coverage and precision is rather high in the proposed method, the suggested measure for success, such as the distance in an existing ontology, and the identification of latent links between some terms, provide a good incentive for further research directions.

In addition to conceptual relationships among biomedical terms, information about interactions among biomedical entities, as identified from the associated syntactic and discourse-related information among biomedical terms, has been the target for active research in the field, called biomedical information extrac-tion. Kim et al. [2006] address the issue of extracting biological event informa-tion from the literature, using a two-phase machine-learning architecture, first focusing on high recall with a supervised machine learning and then raising precision with maximum entropy (ME) classification to filter out incorrect re-sults. Extracting event information, whether from abstracts only or from full texts as well, is known to be much more difficult than extracting interaction information. To improve the performance of the system further, they propose using two-level extraction rule learning, where short-span rules on intra-NP events are followed by long-span rules on full sentences that are reannotated beforehand to hide details of intra-NP events. The experimental results con-firm that the combined performance of precision and recall, as computed by
F-measure, benefits from two-phase two-level machine learning, although im-plications of such divisions of labor are yet to be studied further, especially with respect to what it means to be high-quality events that must survive the extraction process.

The results of biomedical studies, as reported in the literature, sometimes include ones that are negatively qualified, in addition to those that are stated in a positive manner. The fact that a certain entity does not interact with another entity may not be of much significance if it is stated without reference to any other facts, as it may often be possible to rephrase the fact in a positive manner, voiding the difference in polarity. Furthermore, it does not rule out the possi-bility for a future positive result with a refined condition. What is interesting, however, is that such negative results are often stated with reference to other results, resulting in contrastive information. Kim and Park [2006] propose to extract such contrastive information from the literature and advance the need for keeping track of such information in existing databases. The significance of such contrastive information is that it may give a clue to the underlying ontological assumptions, which may not always be well known, and thus pro-vide crucial pieces of information for automatic ontology construction. This opens up other research directions for related knowledge discovery, reported elsewhere.

The reasons that we endeavor to conduct text mining and management over the biomedical literature certainly include that of making known struc-tured facts available from unstructured or semistructured data sources such as M
EDLINE , which is a great help in itself, considering the cost of searching for such facts each time the need arises. However, they also include that of making it easier to discover novel pieces of knowledge, or even actively searching for them with inference. Mima et al. [2006] explore this possibility, by integrating various knowledge sources and structuring them through indexing, ontology development, and visualization. The full potential for this proposal is yet to be seen, however, as some of the modules, such as knowledge map generation, are not shown as applied to the domain of biomedicine. This is another active area of research in the field and awaits further study.
