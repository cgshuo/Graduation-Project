MaSe provides a sandbox environment for high school stu-dents to create their own personalised search interface. It has been designed with two major goals in mind: (1) as a hands-on tutorial for school children, to excite them about programming and computing science through the develop-ment of a practical application, and (2) to enable children to design and create their own search interface without ex-tensive programming knowledge or prior experience. Con-sequently, MaSe provides a way to ascertain what children would like from a search engine interface in an exploratory and creative way as they can create a working prototype. This approach contrasts with previous work on exploring children X  X  requirements of IR systems which attempts to di-rectly elicit user needs through more traditional methods (i.e. surveys, interviews, focus groups, etc) [2, 3]. However, we have attempted to incorporate the design guidelines for children as identified by [2, 3] into MaSe, where: we make use of bright colours, large text fonts, spell checking and the use of icons to represent search services, as well as including a thematic experience as suggested by [2], with the use of a puppy avatar and puppy dog footprints.

MaSe 1 is built using the PuppyIR framework [1], which utilises a pipe and filter architecture. The framework pro-vides a number of query and document processing compo-nents to filter and modify the content (i.e. to filter out inappropriate words, expand queries, simplify snippets and more) and has connections to a wide range of back end search services such as Bing, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, etc. During the tutorial, students connect these components together to create various search services, which teaches them about: (1) how information flows through a pipe and filter architecture, and (2) how they can configure different search services and their associated pipelines for their search interface. Students can then select and customise the set of search services that they would like within their search interface. As discussed
