 In the educational context, we face wi th continuous modeling and execution of processes. We can exemplify the educatio nal context with learning, teaching and scientific scenario. Human learning does not take place on a single level, but it is a stratified process. the educational system throughout the whole world is organized is an acknowledge-ment of this. One cannot send a child to university first. He must start in the first class and then progress year after year to the higher levels of education. 
Research and scientific organizations have the aim of creating and to disseminating knowledge. For the construction of scientific knowledge, research work is carried out which can be described as a discovery process, an investigation of a fact or confirmation of hypotheses. Scientists plan their research by designing sequential use of the past experiences offers a learning opportunity and expedites activity planning and execution. Knowledge about previous research can increase work efficiency and quality so as to allow for successful practices being reused, the notion about how the data had been acquired and previously handled. 
A workflow management system, in this environment, aids activity planning and allows for control and coordination of these activities. Besides, the information generated during the planning and execution of the work can be considered as documentation of the activities. However, the workflow system does not have as its objective supporting the collaboration among the professionals, faster knowledge Thoth objective. 
The paper is organized as follows. The second section describes how we can reuse educational processes and its advantages. The third section explains the workflow management system and the way it is used in the educational environment. Section four presents the Thoth and how the CBR was implemented, while section 5 presents conclusions and future work. Reusing processes is a manner of reducing errors, improving already known processes and execute processes in a faster way. 
We find several approaches related to reuse educational content, as the learning reused or referenced during technology supported learning. In spite of the success of educational processes. In this section we will talk about two kind of educational processes: the scientific and the teaching process. 
To accomplish their scientific work, a researcher collects and analyses a great amount of data and information from many sources, such as text and spreadsheet adapting models. An important phase to completing these activities satisfactorily is planning. During planning, researchers define the strategies to obtain the answers and solutions to the problems which motivated the research. 
Planning, in a scientific context, means establishing which and how simulations need to be done; locating, constructing or adapting models and data, defining documents that should be consulted and finally defining adequate sequence for activities which need to be executed. This task is normally complex because of many factors. Sometimes research demands knowledge from different domain areas or a high degree of specialization. The multidisciplinary character makes it necessary to consult information sources from other domains or collaborate with specialists from these domains. 
Besides, it is common to find a great amount of data and information without use; information, which renders work execution ha rder, it being necessary to adapt models for the amount and quality of existing data and information. 
Also, it is important to observe that activities are normally experimental; thus it is possible perform modifications in those activities even when they are already in execution. When unexpected results come from simulations, for example, new activities can be necessary or subsequent activities can be discarded. 
In scientific procedures, the reuse of processes, and sometimes only the observation of information about these proce sses, prevents mistakes to be repeated and allows doubts to be eliminated, providing economy of time and resources. 
Related to the teaching context, new teachers receive little guidance about what to teach or how to teach it. Learning to teach well is slow, is a difficult work. Managing a classroom, choosing or creating curriculum, developing sound instructional strategies, accurately assessing student understanding, and adjusting to student needs are complex tasks, and new teachers need time and support to develop the necessary knowledge and skills. However, a way of help novices is the possibility of they watch the experts and develop their craft under guidance. That is, analyze and reuse successful teaching process of experienced colleagues. which demands functionalities not supported by a traditional system. As described in [1], the following aspects should be supported so as to support the scientific activity, but can be interpreted to support educational activity too:  X  Incompleteness: educational workflows can be executed even when their  X  Partial Reuse: educational workflows differ from traditional ones because they  X  Dynamic modification: educational workflows can be redefined during their 
Our approach, called Thoth, was conceived on the premise that this information is, in fact, an important resource of organizational learning and an important aid for the design and the execution of the educational processes. However, this resource is sub-visualization [2]. The Thoth has as its purpose allowing for the reuse of the existing knowledge in the educational activities stored in the Workflow Management System. A researcher can use the system to consult and reuse the definition of the model of the past processes performed when he/she plans his/her own activities, to consult information of similar activities during the execution of his own activities, to interact with other users that have participated in the design or execution phases in similar processes and activities. The Thoth environment is detailed in Figure 1. 
During process design, the user uses the system defining a set of parameters, for related with the selected parameters. From the moment processes are located, the user can navigate to each one, choosing activities, documents and other artifacts to use in his/her own processes. Then, after the user chooses the activities that will be reused, it refine the search with specific properties coming from activities and processes, process (previous activities and successors activities), needed competences to execute these activities, documents manipulated in them and tools used can be employed in the definition of the appropriate processes that should be returned. The Thoth provides an instant messaging tool allowing for this communication. Communication allows that issues about some process or doubts raised after the process browse can by debated with an activity performer. 4.1 CBR Approach in Thoth information from activities and processes, which could be useful for the accomplishment of educational work. In Thoth, the approach is performed by raising the analogy between process instances and the cases. The reasoning process executed in Thoth is accomplished with the aid of ontology which allows for the identification reasoning, for semantic aspects to be iden tified and considered during the calculations in a computationally-feasible manner. 4.2 Classification Process The approach for classification and search used in Thoth is similar to one the usually found in information retrieval systems [4] [5]. Classification is done when process information is stored in the Workflow System and it has, as a result, a set of ontology of these concepts, the analysis of the resources(documents used, manipulated data, etc) attached to each activity from the proce sses to be executed. This allows for first the activities and then the process being associated with the ontological concepts. related to each resource type. This process is aided by automatic classification images, maps, tables, etc., metadata analysis allows for the same kind of association. 
The identified concepts work as process and activity descriptors. The storage of these descriptors is accomplished in a similarly to the proposal for [6]; in this approach, the descriptors are stored with an id for the classified objects (in the case of figure 2. 4.3 Search Process The search process starts with the selection of the descriptors as user request or by the automatic capture of these characteristics in a modeled process. During the search, the previously executed and stored in the workflow system database. 4.3.1 Similarity Definition Several approaches were analyzed for the similarity definition among ontological concepts for the definition of similar concep ts. Two works are selected as a guide for the definition of our strategy: one developed by Rodriguez [7] and the other developed by Bergmann [8]. In both, calculation is performed through the computation of intra-class similarity and of inter-class similarity. Intra-class similarity properties can be identified in the immediate super-class that subsumes the classes being compared. Inter-class similarity has the objective of exploring the existent semantics in class hierarchy. 4.3.2 Performing the Search As result of search requisitions, a SQL query is generated. The query is done on the table that links the ontology with the processes, described previously. 
First, the SQL query contemplates only the original concepts selected by the user or identified automatically in the processes. If the amount of returned processes is not enough, a second search is accomplished. In this case, the query is expanded with the concepts identified as similar through the method explained in section 4.3.1. The Thoth brings a new approach to knowledge reuse in the educational environment, by aggregating a workflow management system, CBR and ontology. Some proposals example the BOE systems [9], the WASA systems [10], the conceptual scientific CPSE prototype [11], among others. None of these uses the CBR approach to enable process reuse; the CPSE for instance, allows for visualization of all of the occurrences of a process. The BOE allows for the reuse, but a keyword search is done to locate the process. Moreover, a collaborative module was developed with the purpose of enhancing knowledge exchange among the researchers. 
We are focused on the development of classification, similarity reasoning and search strategies. The next step compri ses the enhancement of the collaborative module with new functionality to allow for more participation in the design process of the researchers consulted (Collaborative edition of activities and process). Other future work comprises a modification to allow for use with other workflow systems, through the development of a prototype following the WfmC standard [12].
