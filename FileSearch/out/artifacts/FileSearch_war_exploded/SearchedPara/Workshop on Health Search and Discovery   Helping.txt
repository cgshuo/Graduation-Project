 This workshop brings together researchers and practi tioners from industry and academia to discuss search and discovery in the med-ical domain. The event focuses on ways to make medical and health information more accessible to laypeople (including enhancements to ranking algorithms and search interfaces), and how we can dis-cover new medical facts and phenomena from information sought online, as evidenced in query streams and other sources such as so-cial media. This domain also offers many opportunities for appli-cations that monitor and improve quality of life of those affected by medical conditions, by providing tools to support their health-related information behavior.

Health seeking; Medical discovery; Data mining; Social media. Health-related information is one of the most widely searched do-mains on the Web. A recent survey by the Pew Internet and Amer-ican Life Project found that 59% of U.S. adults have looked online for health information in the past year, with 35% of respondents attempting to diagnose a medical condition online [1]. Health in-formation seeking is conducted using both search systems such as Internet search engines and via social media (e.g., advice from friends). Research has indicated that cyberspace can be a dangerous place for those with no medical training. Web search engines can surface alarming content that can cause unwarranted anxiety [4]. Such challenges necessitate new information retrieval (IR) meth-ods X  X oth backend and frontend X  X o significantly improve the search experience for health information seeking. These methods can, for example, translate layman and technical terminology, and consider domain knowledge and interpretability and health-related reliability or authority during ranking or crawling [3]. This domain also presents unprecedented opportunities for the development of applications that monitor and improve the quality of life of people affected by a variety of medical conditions via tools to support their health-oriented information behavior. Mining aspects of that be-havior (e.g., queries and social media interactions) with consent in the aggregate across many users has potential to assist in medical discoveries [5] and enhance public health monitoring [2]. The monitoring and use of health-related online behavior also brings into sharper focus important tradeoffs between privacy and
