 Recommender systems have cemented themselves in the daily experiences of most online users. In this work we will elabo-rate on the different challenges faced when creating recom-mendations in the following domains
We will review how we address these different challenges in Schibsted. Schibsted is an international media company with over 200 million unique users a month, split across 39 countries across the world.

Concretely we will review, and compare the primary chal-lenges between the different domains mentioned as well as the commonalities and general lessons we have learnt. For example in a two sided marketplace, it is important that both actors in the interaction are considered when creat-ing recommendations. Constraints such as price sensitivity and geographical location become important when identify-ing good quality recommendations for our users.

Alternatively, in online news we need to consider issues such as freshness and topical relevance when creating rec-ommendations for users, while also striving to ensure we have editorial satisfaction. Finally we can look to generic recommendation solutions where we provide simple rec-ommendation API end points. In this case it is important to ensure good quality recommendations while ensuring a generic enough solution that it can be used in many differ-ent scenarios.

What makes these challenges particularly interesting is that we approach these different challenges with a holistic view of for improving the overall user experience for our users in Schibsted.
