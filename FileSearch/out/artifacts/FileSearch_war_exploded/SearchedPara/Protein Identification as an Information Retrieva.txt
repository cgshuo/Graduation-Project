 We present the first interdisci plinary work on transforming a popular problem in proteomics, i.e. protein identification from tandem mass spectra, to an Info rmation Retrieval (IR) problem. We present an empirical compar ison of popular IR approaches, such as those available from Indri and Lemur toolkits on benchmark datasets, to represen tative popular baselines in the proteomics literature. Our experiments demonstrate statistically significant evidence that popular IR approaches outperform representative baseline approaches in proteomics. H.4.m [ Information Systems Applications ]: Miscellaneous; I.5.2 Algorithms, Design, Experi mentation, Performance Interdisciplinary Investigation, Protein Identification, Tandem Mass Spectra Protein Identification from tande m mass spectra (MS/MS) is a crucial step for many important bi omedical applications such as drug discovery and disease biomarke r detection, i.e. detection of proteins present in the tissue of an unhealthy individual but usually absent in a healthy individual, for early diagnosis of life threatening conditions such as Cancer. We formulate the protein identifi cation problem in the form of a query-specific document retrieval pr oblem in IR. Proteins consist of sequence of peptides, each of which is a sequence of amino acids. Drawing an analogy to a text document, we consider the protein as a document, while th e constituent peptides are word-tokens, each consisting of amino acids similar to the character alphabet in textual documents. Due to our IR-based formulation, the rich body of research findings in text retrieval would provide meaningful insights into how to leverage state-of-the-art IR methods directly or with adaptation, including efficient inverted indexing, effective term wei ghting schemes, smoothing and dimensionality reduction technique s, choices of similarity measure in retrieval models, we ll-understood evaluation metrics, and standardized software t oolkits like Lemur and Indri. The task of protein identification is to find a mapping from the thousands of observed MS/MS spectra, obtained by analyzing the input sample under a Mass Spectromete r, to the true proteins in the input sample. It is typically accomplished in two steps: first, identify the peptides based on observed spectra; second, predict proteins based on system-predicted peptides. Popular peptide identification appr oaches perform database search by comparing the empirically observed mass spectra of unknown proteins to the theoretical mass spectra of known proteins. The theoretical spectrum of each peptide is derived based on existing knowledge about lower-level chem ical properties of amino acid letters. SEQUEST [3] and XTandem! [1] are some of the popular peptide identification approaches that compare theoretical and empirical spectra. literature for protein identification from the intermediate peptide identification step. The ProteinProphet system by Nesvizhskii et al [2] is a popular method that is commonly used in comparative evaluations on benchmark datasets . ProteinProphet estimates the probability of each protein as a probabilistic-OR function of the constituent peptides as q and protein i in the input sample, and J is the total number of identified peptides. We will refer to this method as prob-OR in the rest of the paper. A recent work by Li et. al. [6] models the input sample as a multi-protein mixture and solves the Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) solution for the mixture weights. The input to our protein identification system is a set of peptides with confidence scores which are produced by a well-established method for peptide identification from a sample of MS/MS spectra [3] . We present the scored peptides using a normalized query vector ) , , 2 , 1 ( J q q q q L r = such that = be a document vector representing a protein in the database and define within -document term weighting as The dot-product similarity in a standard Vector Space Model (VSM) is calculated as ij p This scoring function is based on the cross entropy between the query and proteins, similar to the KL-divergence-based language model for document retrieval [4]. It is well known in IR research community that such models mimic a probabilistic-AND, i.e., only documents which contain all the query terms will receive positive weight. On the other hand, if we choose term weighting scheme, the dot -product similarity becomes: This is a variant of probabilistic-OR, because a protein receives a positive weight if at least one of the constituent peptides is found in the query. The connections from probabilistic-OR and probabilistic-AND to conventional VSMs invite a questi on: are they better choices than other variants of VSM, e.g., the commonly used cosine similarity with TF-IDF term weighting scheme? Since the latter is not a probabilistic scoring function, direct theoretical comparison on the basis of probabilistic modeli ng is impossible. However, an empirical comparison between these VSM variants would be highly informative and practically important for a thorough investigation on the applicability and effectiveness of advanced IR techniques in solving the protein identification problem. For evaluation and benchmarking of protein identification algorithms, we use standard pr oteomic mixtures whose MS/MS spectra are publicly available. Table 1 summarizes the datasets. The PPK [5] queries and corre sponding protein database is publicly available. However, fo r the Mark12 and Sigma49 query sets, we created corresponding prot ein database by contaminating the relevant proteins with 50, 000 proteins randomly sampled from the SwissProt protein repository.

For evaluating a met hod on one dataset, we used the remaining two datasets as the validation sets for tuning parameters. Table 3 summarizes the performance of the various approaches in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP) over the three query sets. The IR approaches clearly outperform domain-specific approaches over all the benchmar k datasets. We also performed one-sample proportion tests for evaluating the statistical significance of these results and observed statistically significant evidence in favor of our analysis for p-value &lt; 0.01 Dataset X!
