 Much information exists on the internet: it is said that an information explosion is occurring. Obtaining information that has high awareness and a high profile can be accomplished easily on the internet using search engines. Nevertheless, it is difficult for us to obtain information which has less awareness and which has a low profile because there is little information about it. We have no clues to extract such information. However, we consider that some important information exists among that minority information. For example, sports can be regarded as including a few majority sports and many minority sports. Majority sports such as baseball, basketball, and footb all (soccer) are reported by media, and we know them well. Actually, however, they are only a few sports among many sports enjoyed throughout the world. Many minority sports exist throughout the world as well. Moreover, some information about them does exist on the web. They might be interesting sports for us, but we do not know how to know more about such minority sports. We consider it convenient for users and authors who transmit the minority information, when a search system can search for minority information from the web. In this paper, we propose such a minority search system. At this time, we consider it nece ssary to search for minority information in which a user is interested. Using our proposed system, the user inputs a query which represents their interest in majority information. Then the system searches for minority information that is similar to the majority information provided. Consequently, users can obtain the new information that users do not know and can discover new knowledge and new inter ests. Our proposed method consists of  X  X elevance of content X ,  X  X nalogy expressi on X , and  X  X ategory filtering X . As described in this paper, we extract minority information from Wikipedia as a first step of the research because muc h information has been gathered in Wikipedia.
The flow of search minority information progresses as follows and as shown in Figure 1: 1. The user inputs majority information in which the user is interested. 2. The system extracts articles from Wikipedia that include analogy expressions 3. It extracts Wikipedia articles related to the keyword. At this time, we cal-4.

Then, it performs sports filtering and extracts minority articles from the candidates. In this case, the results are  X  X andy X ,  X  X oalball X , and  X  X uju X .

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents dis-cussion of related work; Section 3 explains methods of searching for minority information; Section 4 explains the prototype system, and section 5 explains experiments; we conclude this paper in Section 6. In this research, we propose a method of searching for minority information from Wikipedia. Ohshima et al.[1] proposed methods of searching for web pages that are regarded  X  X emantically X  as  X  X iblings X  with respect to given page examples. Their approach was designed to find pages that are similar in theme but which have different content from the given sample pages. They designated this as  X  X ibling page search X . We search for minority information that is similar to a user X  X  input, but which has low acknowledgement and low popularity.

Some studies have calculated the importance degree and relevance degree of web pages using web link graphs. The most famous among the research efforts is page rank[2]. Wang et al.[3] proposed a content X  X ink coupled clustering algorithm that clusters web pages by combining contents and link analysis. They studied the effects of out-links (from the web pages), in-links (to the web page), and terms on the final clustering results as well as how to combine these three parts effectively and thereby improve the qualit y of clustering results. Glover et al.[4] analyzed the relative utility of document texts, and text in citing documents near a citation for purposes of classification and description.

Some studies have specifically examined the Wikipedia link graph. Milne et al.[5] proposed the Wikipedia link vector model (WLVM). It is unique in that it uses only the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia rather than its full textual content. Chernov et al.[6] proposed extraction of semantic information from Wikipedia by analyzing the links among categories. For this study, we use a link graph to extract related content. Ho wever our target research is extraction of minority information. It therefore differs from methods used in other studies.
Some studies have examined re-ranking. Zhuang et al.[7] proposed a Q-Rank to refine the ranking of search results effectively for any given query by construct-ing the query context from search query logs. Lee et al.[8] describe a model of an information retrieval system based o n a document re-ranking method using document clusters. Chidlovskii et al.[9] proposed a system for coupling a user and community profiling with the information search process. The search pro-cess and the ranking of relevant documents are accomplished within the context of a particular user or community persp ective. The methods of their re-ranking methods resemble those used in our research. Nevertheless, the purpose of our research differs. We seek to extract minority information. We first extract candidates of minority information that is similar to the user X  X  input keyword from Wikipedia. At this time, we use methods of two types:  X  X elational search X  and  X  X nalogy search X . 3.1 Relational Search The purpose of this study is searching for the minority content resembling the user X  X  input majority content. We extract high relational content using a link graph and calculation of similarity. The following is the process used to extract the high relational content from Wikipedia. 1. We make articles of a query where the user inputs a basic node and creates 2. We regard nodes which are linked to the basic node as related to the basic 3. We delete the inlink node, which has only one anchor text of basic node, 4. We calculate the similarity between each inlink node and basic node using For example, as shown in Figure 2, we first delete nodes C and G because they are only linked from the basic node. Nodes D and F have only one anchor text of a basic node; they are deleted. The similarity degree of node H is less than 0.35. We delete it. In this case, nodes A, B, and E become related information. 3.2 Analogy Search Sometimes minority information is extremely minority information that has only a small Wikipedia article or none at all. In this case, we can not extract it using relational search because the similarity is too small. However, as one character-istic of minority information, people sometimes explain it through comparison with majority information. For example, the article about  X  X epak takraw X  which is a kind of sport, is compared with  X  X olleyball X . The article of  X  X oulash X  which is Hungarian food is compared to  X  X tew X . We specifically examine the character-istics. Then we propose an analogy search. Comparison words are often used, suchas X ...like X  X nd X  X imilarto .... X  Table1presentsexamplesof comparison words.
 3.3 Extraction of Minority Information Candidates We extract candidates of minority information from related information and anology information. The meaning of minority is  X  X he smaller part or number; a number, part, or amount forming less than half of the whole. X . As described in this paper, we regard less-acknowledged and less-popular information as minority information. However, we do not know what less-acknowledged and low popu-larity information are. When we extract minority information, we specifically examine the numbers of edits and editors of Wikipedia articles. Our hypothe-sis states that  X  X ajority information is known by many peopled and the article of it has many edits and many editors. However, minority information is known by few people and its related articles have few edits and few editors. X 
We conducted an experiment to prove that hypothesis. For this experiment, we use sports data because subjects can judge it easily. In our experiments, 13 subjects judged 150 sports that we se lected randomly from Wikipedia. The subjects judged the results using the following three-step judgment process: 1: I know it. 0: I know only the name of it. -1: I do not know it.

Table 2 presents some results of the ex periment. The average is obtained by dividing the total of the results by the number of subjects. When the value of the average is near  X 1 X , many people know the sport. When the value of the average is near  X -1 X , it means that few people know the sport. We regard the value of the average under  X 0 X  as the supervised data of minority sports. After experimentation, we examine the numbers of edits and editors of each Wikipedia article. The results are shown in Table 3, Figure 3, and Figure 4. In Table 3, listed from No. 1 to No. 4 are majority sports. They have numerous edits and many editors. From No. 5 to number No. 8 are minority sports; they have few edits and few editors. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, the numbers of edits and editors increased, the sport whose result of experiment is  X 1 X  increases. However, where both the number of edits and editor s decrease, sports for which the results of the experiment are  X -1 X  increase. Resul ts show that our hypothesis is correct, which means that the majority information has many edits and many editors and that minority information has few edits and few editors.
We measure the numbers of edits and editors of both the related information and analogy information. Subsequently, we extract candidates of minority in-formation from them using thresholds. In our experiment, the threshold of the number of edits is 180; the threshold of the number of editors is 80. 3.4 Category Filtering Some different category articles exist among candidates of minority information. For example, when a user wants to know about minority sports and inputs majority sports, some minority sports team names, and equipment of the sports. They are not minority sports names. We must remove this information from candidates of minority information. We propose category filtering to extract minority information that a user wants to know. We first conduct filtering based on the Wikipedia category. Subsequently, we filter based on LSP methods. Filtering Based on Category of Wikipedia Wikipedia articles are divided by category. The category has a hierarchic struc-ture. We specifically examine the category and extract two level above in the structure. First, we extract the category of the user X  X  input query. Then we also extract a category of all candidate minority information. If a candidate of mi-nority information differs in terms of the category of the query, then we remove it from minority information candidates.
 Filtering Based on LSP Method Filtering based on category of Wikipedia can not remove all different minority information. For example, when the user inputs a sport name, equipment of sports sometimes can not be removed b ecause the category of the equipment is  X  X ports X . Then we filter the information using LSP method, which was proposed by Nakayama et al.[10]. Nakayama et al. specifically examined the Wikipedia article grammar and proposed the LSP methods which regard the lead sentences of the article as important sentences. The lead sentences of almost all articles of Wikipedia consist of an is-a relation. The LSP method specifically examines the is-a relation and extracts upper concepts of the article. For example, an article of  X  X acquet X  is  X  X  racquet is a sports implement. X  The last words of  X  X mplement X  are the upper concept of  X  X acquet X . In thi s case, the upper concept is not a sports name. For that reason, we remove it from candidates of minority information. In this way, we use the LSP method to filter the different category candidates.
After filtering, the candidate of minority information becomes minority infor-mation. We developed a prototype system using our proposed method. We used Ruby as the programming language, and used CGI as the user interface. Figure 5 shows the user input display and the output of the system. The first user input query and click search button. Then the system searches for the minority information that is similar to the query and displays the result. Results are displayed in the list and the user selects the article that the user wants to know. We conducted two experiments. One measured benefits of analogy search, the other measured benefits of our proposed system. In our experiments, we target sports because it is easy to distinguish majority sports from minority sports. 5.1 Experiment of Analogy Search We used an experiment of analogy search to measure the system benefits. We measured the minority degree of the results of analogy search using the num-bers of edits and editors. First, we input seven types of majority sports names and extracted analogy information using analogy search. Next we calculated the numbers of edits and editors.
 Results and Discussion Table 4 presents results of the experiment . Many articles extracted using analogy search were lower than the threshold of n umbers of edits and editors described in section 3.3. Futsal and Beach volleyball are majority sports, but these sports are greater than the threshold numbers of ed its and editors. Therefore, the system does not regard them as minority sports. In this way, our proposed analogy search and number of edits and editors is beneficial to extract minority information. 5.2 Experiment Conducted Using the Proposed System We measured the benefit of our proposed system using the prototype system. We input majority sports of twelve types and calculated the precision, recall, and F -measure. This time, we regard 116 minority sports as the correct answer. The 116 minority sports comprise 59 minority sports that users judged in our experiment in section 3.3 and 57 minority sports obtained manually from Wikipedia. Results and Discussion Table 5 presents the results of our exper iment. The average of the recall, preci-sion, and F -measure show good results. However, the results of golf and football are not better than those of other sports because category filtering using LSP method is not good. Category filtering using LSP method examines only the first sentence. When the first sentence of an art icle has multiple verbs, the system can not ascertain the upper co ncept from it. Many articl es are related to minority sports resembling golf or football have multiple verbs in the first sentence, the system therefore can not obtain the co rrect upper concept and delete them from minority information list.
On the other hands, one of the results of rugby is cricket. However, the cricket is not similar to the rugby. The reason why the cricket is included in the results is analogy search. There is a sentence which is  X  X he manager can not instruct to players while playing a game like rugby X  in the cricket article. In this case,  X  X ike rugby X  is not similar to the game. In this way, we have to consider the words of analogy search. We proposed a method of searching for minority information that is less-acknowledged and has less popularity in Wikipedia. We first extracted re-lated information that resembles the user X  X  input query using related search and analogy search. Next we extracted minority information candidates using the numbers of edits and editors. Finally, we calculated category filtering and ex-tracted minority information from Wikipedia. We developed a prototype system and experiments to measure the benefits of our proposed system.

In the near future we will study the following:  X  Improvement of cat egory filtering.  X  Extraction of personalized minority information.
  X  Extraction of minority information from the web.
