With the development of the Internet of things , cloud computing , social network technology and the rapid development of cyberspace, the amount of information growth in the exponential in recent years. In this context, the recommendation system has been put forward widely concerned by academia and indu stry and has been applied to many related research results. The core of the recommendation system is recommendation algorithm. By digging the binary relationship between users and projects, it can help users find interesting objects (such as information, s ervices, articles, etc.) easily from massive data and generate personalized recommendation list to meet their interest preferences.

The traditional recommendation algorithm can be divided into three main categories: content -based recommendation algorithm, collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm and hybrid recommendation algorithm. Researchers have found that the ability to generate recommendations based solely on the user's rating of the item does not accurately reflect user preferences. For exampl e, the user of objects A and B were scored for 2 points and 3 points, then the results of different recommendation algorithm to predict the results may be same: a prediction of A items 2.5 points and B items 3.6 points ; Another prediction results for the A items 2.5 points and B items 2.4 points. the square errors of the two predictions are (0.52 + 0.62). However, the order of the items accurately reflect a user's preference s. in order to solve the above problems of traditional recommendation algorithm, this paper presents a research on collaborative recommendation algorithm based on naive Bayesian. taking movie recommendation as an example, based on the traditional recommend ation algorithm, we analyze user's factors to predict the audience ratings of the recommended film and re -order. recommendation and provides better service for users. 2.1 User clustering
With the increasing number of online users with collaborative filtering algorithms, if the user does not perform cosine clustering and calcula te the user similarity directly, Queen in 1967[49], whose criterion function is the distance squared, shown in Equation . 
In this paper, the clustering of users is the discovery of the distribution of user groups set of all video types, so the user's viewing history is vector space V (D), so that user (12,13,68,45,23,56,48,52,53,12). the user's preference for the video type is rep resented users. 2.2 User trust metrics
Usually the user has a different preference for the film, and some may only like the same category of movies, some may like to see a fe w categories of movies. For example, the user u likes comedy movies, user V likes disaster and art movies.When the user only knows the type of film without knowing the specific story and content of the movie, the user's score will be biased by personal emo tions. therefore, the formula for introducing user U to user V is as follows: in the above formula,  X   X  and  X   X  represent the number of evaluation items for user U and user V. the traditional similarity calculation method is mainly based on the cosine similarity measure and the Pearson similarity measure method. the cosine formula is as follows: the Pearson similarity formula is as follows: so the improved similarity form ula is as follows:
In summary, the algorithm is improved as follows: (1) Analyze the user's movie viewing history . The k -means clustering algorithm is (2) Use similar formulas(2 -5) to find similar neighbors in cluster Cluster_u . (3) Filter the records of similar neighbors . the items of high scores target users have (4) Recommend the results to the user . 3.1 Data preparation
The experimental data are from public data on Tencent Weibo and Youku. experimental data contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 target users who joined them in 2000. 80% of the data is used as the training data, and the rest as the test data. 3.2 Calculation and Analysis
In the experiments, coSine and PearSon were used as the similarity evaluation experiment with the accuracy, recall rate as the evaluation criteria, as shown in Figure 2.

MAE is used to measure the difference between the estimated score and the true value of the recommended algorithm. The smaller the MAE value, the higher the accuracy. it is de fined as follows.  X   X  X  X  is the estimated score of item i for user i, and  X   X  X  X  is the true score of item i for user i. The sets U and I are the set of users and items in the test set, respectively. Pij is the estimated score of item i for user i, and rij is the true score of item i for user i. The sets U and I are the set of users a nd items in the test set, respectively. N is the number of  X 
In order to verify the proposed quality of the proposed algorithm, the traditional Bayesian collabo rative algorithm were compared. In the test, the nearest neighbor sets of the target users were 5, 10, 20, and 40 respectively. The results are shown below.
The K -means algorithm is used to cluster the user preference ve ctor. In order to get on the joint similarity recommendation algorithm [8] and the p roposed algorithm for comparison.
 but the the proposed algorithm recommendation co llaborative filtering algorithm works Interest combines the user's interest and takes full account of the user's hobby and the popularity of the film in such viewers, making the predictive value more reasonable and improving the recommended accuracy.
This paper presents a recommendation algorithm based on trust and users X  interest , which can be used to calculate the popularity of the film under the user characteristics by observing the history of watching the movie and analyzing the user's interest.  X  The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a significant improvement in the recommendation accuracy compared wi th the traditional video recommendation algorithm.
