 1. Introduction
The goal of the study 1 presented in this article is to investigate to what extent the classification of a web page by a single genre matches the users X  perspective. The extent of agreement on a single genre label for a web page can help understand whether there is a need for a different classification scheme that overrides the single-genre labelling.

Although it has already been pointed out that users often disagree in assigning a genre label to a web page, and that genre classification using a single genre label does not reflect the users X  perspective (e.g. cf. Rosso, 2005, p. 116 ), the single genre classification scheme is still largely used in many fields, such as corpus studies (e.g. the genre annotation of the British National Corpus by David Lee 2 ), automatic genre classification (e.g.
Lim, Lee, &amp; Kim, 2005; Meyer zu Eissen &amp; Stein, 2004 ), or document retrieval evaluation (e.g. TREC HARD 2003 and 2004, or TREC-2006 Blog Track 3 ).

Genre is a notoriously complex concept to pin down in its entirety. Even if we limit our investigations to the genre of written documents, definitions abound. Many interpretations have been proposed since Aristotle X  X 
Poetics , and recently definitions of genre have been adapted to the new digital environments, like corporate intranets or the web (e.g. cf. Erickson, 1999; Yates &amp; Orlikowski, 1992 ).

The lack of a unified view of what genre is constitutes only one of the hurdles in genre classification. An additional problem is represented by the loose boundaries between the term  X  X enre X  with other neighbouring and researchers working with genre have proposed a multi-facetted classification. The multi-facetted classifi-cation has its roots in the works of S.R. Ranganathan, an Indian scholar, who posited that any complex entity could be viewed from a number of perspectives or facets. The multi-facetted classification is a multi-dimen-sional view that highlights different aspects in a document, not necessarily different genres. It was adopted
Kessler, Numberg, and Shu  X  tze (1997) in automatic genre classification of text documents, 4 and it was sug-management in a corporate environment, and by Crowston and Kwasnik (2004) in information studies.
In this article I would like to focus on the genre dimension. More specifically, I will explore the users X  per-spectives on genres of web pages (e.g. FAQS , ESHOPS , HOW-TOS ,or BLOGS ). My unit of analysis is then the indi-vidual web page. Genres on the web can be also studied using other units of analysis, for example they can be analysed at website level, as preferred by Shepherd and Watters (1999), Rehm (2005) ,or Mehler and Gleim (2006) .

Broadly speaking, genres are textual categories that streamline communication relying on acknowledged conventions and raising predictable expectations. For instance, the conventions underlying the FAQs genre are represented by a sequence of questions about recurrent issues accompanied by related answers. When browsing FAQs web pages, users X  expectations are to find information or instructions to solve common prob-lems. The majority of websites  X  from banking to travel, to sport, to Do-It-Yourself, to computing  X  include FAQs web pages.

Optimistically, Karlgren, one of the leading scholars in automatic genres identification, states that the term when the task is to find agreement on the genre label to be assigned to a document. This task is even more arduous when the document to be classified by genre is the individual web page (e.g. see the small-scale user study in Santini, 2005 ). Web pages often are more unpredictable and difficult to sort into a single genre than documents in other media, like paper printing, where social rigidity, work practices or stable settings favour more controlled and standardized text production ( Yates &amp; Sumner, 1997 ).

A web page often appears to be composite, with a visual organization of the space, where different com-municative purposes and several functions are included at the same time. Textual complexity is not an exclu-sive trait of web pages. For instance, the interweaving of visual and verbal is common in magazine covers, as highlighted by Held (2005) . What is new is the widespread use of composite and complex web pages. For example, the space in a web page is often divided into different sections, organized by lists of links  X  mainly isolated noun structures or verbal elements, as reported by Haas and Grams (2000, pp. 186 X 187)  X  and snip-pets of text scattered around the main body of the document  X  like navigational buttons, menus, ads, and search boxes  X  that are visually dislocated in different areas of a single page. The detection of regularities in the visual form, or  X  X  X hape X  X , of digital documents, and the formation of emerging cognitive models play Campbell, 1999 ). Additionally, hyperlinking (studied by Crowston &amp; Williams, 1999; Haas &amp; Grams, 1998; Jucker, 2002 ), interactivity and multi-functionality (analysed by Shepherd &amp; Watters, 1999 ) affect the textu-ality of web pages, which also heavily rely on the use of images and other graphical elements. Although the use of fonts of different types, sizes, and colours, as well as the use of formatting devices  X  like columns, lines separating different sections of a document, pictures, etc.  X  has a long-standing tradition (see Waller, 1987 ), a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE organized in columns and headlines does not lose its specific linguistic and textual characteristics when included in a corpus such as the British National Corpus. The same is not true for many web pages, since the visual structure of a web page incorporating a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE in most cases cannot be flattened out or ignored without losing important information, as noted by Watters and Shepherd (1997) in their interpretation of the digital broadsheet as an evolving genre. As highlighted by Furuta and Marshall (1996) , the complexity of web pages can be explained by the flexibility provided by HTML and the simplicity of such a language that allows the creation of more complex texts without much effort or expertise. Hence, a web page can be considered as a sort of container of multiple texts  X  so much so that in coding the pages of their sample, Haas and Grams (2000) repeatedly encountered pages that could be interpreted as comprising several textual components. Solutions such as the artificial separation of what is considered the main body from the rest would be an arbitrary operation and would not make sense in many cases, for instance in a search page similar to webpage _ 05 or webpage _ 06 (see Appendix ). In brief, in a web page, not all the ele-ments necessarily belong together, but they all contribute to form a  X  X  X nified whole X  X , even without any linear progression, as explained by Johnsen (2000) through the concepts of  X  X  X hetorical clusters X  X  and  X  X  X erceptual cohesion X  X .

The textual complexity of web pages also accounts for the  X  X alleability X  of genre. As Yates and Orlikowski (1992) and others have stressed, genres are rarely homogeneous. On the contrary, they tend to overlap and mix. In an open communication space like the web, where many communities meet, each with its own genre system and repertoire (cf. Crowston &amp; Williams, 2000 ), phenomena such as genre colonization, 5 genre com-bination (cf.  X sterlund, 2006 ) and genre contamination, common also in other environments, are likely to occur.

Although it is possible to do genre classification leaving the concept of genre implicit, and simply rely on intuition, I would like to propose a characterization of genre classes that is suitable for complex documents, like web pages. I see genres as named communication artefacts, linked to a society or community, character-ized by conventions, raising expectations, showing hybridism or individualization, and undergoing evolution. As exemplified earlier with FAQs, genres show sets of standardized or conventional characteristics that make them recognizable, and this identity raises specific expectations. Genres also evolve over time, following social and cultural needs. For instance, longitudinal studies show that the NEWSPAPER genre has changed when mov-ing from paper printing to the web ( Ihlstro  X  m &amp; Henfridsson, 2005 ). Together with conventions and expecta-tions, genres have many other traits. With my characterization, I would like to focus on two traits that seem to be important on the web, namely hybridism and individualisation. As a matter of fact, genres are not mutually exclusive and different genres can be merged into a single document, generating hybrid forms. Additionally, genres allow us a certain freedom of variation and consequently can be individualised. It is also important to note that before genre conventions become fully standardized, a genre does not have an official name. A genre name becomes acknowledged when the genre itself has an active role and a communicative function in a com-munity or society ( Swales, 1990, pp. 54 X 57 ). Before this acknowledgement, a genre shows hybrid or individ-ualised forms, and indistinct functions. Currently, many web pages seem to be characterized by the attributes of hybridism and individualization, showing multiple genres or no genre at all.

Since web pages tend to be complex documents, the study presented in this article aims at investigating whether the classification of a web page by a single genre label does account for the users X  perspective.
The difficulty of assigning a single genre to web pages is well expressed by Rosso (2005) , when he reports the comments of the participants to his studies:
This difficulty has been pointed out also by other scholars and researchers who carried out surveys about the genre of web pages, namely, Dewe, Karlgren, and Bretan (1998) , 6 and Haas and Grams (2000) , 7 Crowston and the difficulty of fitting a web page into a single genre for different reasons: either the page is multi-genre, or without any genre; either genre conventions are unclear, or genre taxonomy is fuzzy; and so forth. However, the authors of these surveys limit themselves to point out this difficulty without questioning or discussing the tical purpose of exploring genres on the web ( Crowston &amp; Williams, 2000 ), or finding genre categories useful able categories for web pages ( Haas &amp; Grams, 1998 ). Therefore, these studies are very informative in many respects.

My aim is different. As mentioned earlier, I wish to investigate whether the classification of a web page by a single genre represents the users X  perspective on the genre of web pages. My hypothesis is that a single genre label does not account for the users X  perspective on the individual web page . As explained above, the visual orga-nization of a web pages favour the tiling of different types of text, not necessarily connected to each other.
For this reason, users tend to focus on the type of text, or on the textual function, they are more interested in, when they classify a web page by a single genre. In this way, they create different genre perspectives on the same web page. In order to test my hypothesis, I submitted a restricted number of web pages (25 web pages) to a large number of web users (135 subjects) asking them to assign only a single genre label to each of the web pages. Users could choose from a list of 21 genre labels, or select one of the two  X  X scape X  options, i.e.  X  Add a label  X  X nd X  I don X  X  know  X . The rationale is to observe the level of agreement on a single genre label per web page, and draw some conclusions about the appropriateness of limiting the assignment to only a sin-gle label when doing genre classification of web pages. Results show that users largely disagree on the label to be assigned to a web page.
This article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the principle of  X  X ser warrant X  applied and adapted to analyse the users X  perspective on genre of web pages; Section 3 explains the study design; in Section 4 ,I report the experimental results and discuss them; finally in Section 5 , I draw some conclusions. 2. Users X  perspective on the genre of web pages: the principle of  X  X ser warrant X  applied to genre
One may argue with Stam (2000, p. 14)  X  X  X re genres really  X  X ut there X  in the world, or are they merely the constructions of analysts? X  X . Although the views of intellectuals, academics, or genre analysts are undoubtedly important because they contain the level of abstraction or generalization that non-experts usually do not have, the users X  view on genre cannot be simply ignored. As a matter of fact, the users X  perspective is fundamental when it comes to the application of the concept of genre for practical purposes, like building a corpus annotated by genre or enabling users to search by genre on the web or in a digital library. This view from the bottom has already been applied in similar tasks, for example by Aires, Santos, and Alu X   X  sio (2005) for compiling a corpus according to what the user wants, or by Rosso (2005) to assemble a genre palette useful for web searches.
In the present study, the users X  perspective is expressed by the assignment of a single (genre) label to a web page. I put the term  X  X enre X  into brackets because the full set of labels employed in the study includes 21 web genre labels plus two  X  X scape X  labels, namely the  X  Add a label  X  and  X  I don X  X  know  X  options. The difficulty of assigning a single label to a web page is analysed using the principle of  X  X ser warrant X . According to the standard ANSI/NISO 11 Z39.19-2005 ( NISO, 2005 ): This concept was discussed by Lancaster (1986) to explain the inclusion of certain indexing terms in retrieval systems. Currently, the  X  X  X nformation Retrieval Expert Answers X  X  12 web-based service defines this concept as User warrant is one of the standards used by multi-lingual countries to develop their vocabularies. For exam-ple, it is include in the Guide to the Development and Maintenance of Controlled Vocabularies in the Government of Canada , 13 supported by the Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada (TBS), where it is defined as follows: More related to my study is the application of the principle of user warrant as proposed in Rosso (2005, p. 104) Building on Rosso X  X  user warrant interpretation, I extend this principle to adapt it to the purpose of my study in the following way:
Single genre : when the agreement of many users on a single genre label is high, then the web page is not a case when the majority of web users use the  X  Add a label  X  option to add new, but consistent, genre labels for the same web page.

Multiple genres : when the agreement of users on the genre of a web page is fragmented across a limited can be profitable.

No genre : when a large part of agreement aggregates around the two  X  X scape X  options,  X  Add a label  X  and  X  I don X  X  know  X , or is fragmented across many labels then the web page cannot be easily sorted into any genre, i.e. a zero-genre classification can be more appropriate. 3. Study design
As mentioned earlier, this study relies on the users X  perspective of the genre of web pages. The users X  per-spective is expressed by labelling a web page using one label, and analysed using the principle of user warrant.
I adapted this principle to my needs building on Rosso X  X  interpretation. The idea behind my adaptation of this principle is to exploit the different levels of agreement on the genres of web pages to assess the difficulty of classifying a web page by a single genre. For instance, if many users agree mostly on a single genre label when they see a web page, then the web page is not difficult to classify into a single genre. By contrast, when the agreement of users on the genre of a web page is fragmented across a number of genre labels, then the web page is difficult to sort into a single genre. The unit of analysis is the individual web page. The screenshots of the 25 web pages used in this study, and the original URLs ( Table A1 ) are shown in
Appendix in sequential order. These web pages are also available online as bitmap files at &lt;http:// www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.Santini/&gt; . The web pages included in the study were downloaded in early 2005.
 Criteria of selection :
I collected from the web 21 web pages that could represent the 21 genre labels. Ideally, each web page rep-resents a single genre or a predominant genre. In other words, each of these web pages is a stereotypical exem-plar of a web genre. For the association one web genre = one web page I used a criterion of  X  X bjective sources X  ( Santini, 2006a ). In brief, I selected these  X  X epresentative X  web pages in either of the following ways:
The web pages showed the name of the genre in the title. For example, FAQS was in the title of web-page _ 12 , and HOTLIST was in the title of webpage _ 15 (see Appendix );
The web pages were downloaded from genre-specific portals or archives. For example, webpage _ 01 rep-resenting an ESHOP was downloaded through &lt; http://www.shops.co.uk &gt;;
The genre was included in the URL. For example, webpage _ 10 representing the ABOUT PAGE (see Appen-dix ) was downloaded from &lt; http://infogistics.com/about.html &gt;.

In the set of web pages, I also included three web pages from the SPIRIT collection 14 (see webpage _ 18 , webpage _ 21 , and webpage _ 23 in Appendix ), and a common web page type, without any official genre name, downloaded from the live web (see webpage _ 17 in Appendix ). I assigned nicknames to these four web pages to facilitate any reference to them during the discussion of the results. These nicknames are the following:  X  webpage _ 17 = RYANAIR ;  X  webpage _ 21 = CITIDEX ;
In summary, the total number of web pages included in the study is 25, namely 21 web pages selected with the criterion of  X  X bjective sources X , and four arbitrary web pages.

Table 1 lists the web genres included in the study, and the web page representing that genre. It is important to note that my initial association was never shown to the participants and has no influence on the results of the study . Discussion and conclusions are based on the labels assigned by the 135 web users and summarized in Table 3 , and not on my initial choices or associations, which should be merely considered as a random starting point. The web pages presented to the subjects are arbitrary web pages that can be found on the web, and the labels were suggested by the web page creators, either through the title or in some other ways. It is worth reminding that the subjects had the possibility of specifying their own labels by using the two  X  X scape X  options. 3.1. Comparison with Rosso X  X  experiment 3 Mark Rosso conducted an experiment ( Rosso, 2005, pp. 103 X 131 ) that may appear similar to the study that I present in article. I will highlight the main similarities and differences between the two experiments to under-stand better the rationale behind them. This comparison does not imply that my experimental choices are better than Rosso X  X , or viceversa. The breakdown of similarities and differences should help the readers under-stand the different experimental stances. In brief, Rosso X  X  objective is to measure the users X  recognition of the genres in his palette. He emphasizes the consensus among users in order to validate a genre palette to be used for web searches. My objective is to explore to what extent users agree on a single genre label per web page. I analyse the distribution of the different labels assigned to a web page, and emphasize the dissension among users. My motivation is to justify the adoption of a more flexible genre classification scheme that goes beyond the single genre assignment. 3.1.1. Similarities
The use of user warrant to assess the users X  perception on genre of web pages, instead of the traditional user-respondent agreement.

The selection of different degrees of genre typicality, including web pages that do not seem to fit into any categories.
 The use of human subjects belonging to a university environment.

The use of percentage to measure the agreement (or  X  X  X onsensus X  X , in Rosso X  X  terminology). 3.1.2. Differences
My goal is to show that single-genre classification of web pages does not represent the users X  perspective.  X  Rosso X  X  goal is to validate a genre palette by showing that users can recognize the 18 genres he has iden-
I do not provide any definition list of the genres presented to the users. I prefer that users follow their own idea of genre.  X  Rosso provides a definition list, where users can go back to any time to check the descriptions of genres.
I present 25 web pages to the subjects with a list of 21 genre labels plus two  X  X scape X  labels, the  X  Add a label  X  and  X  I don X  X  know  X  options, for a total of 23 labels. The idea is that if the subjects are not happy with the proposed labels they can add their own label or say that they do not know.  X  Rosso presents 55 web pages to be classified with one of the 18 genres in his palette. He also provides an
I select 21 out of 25 web pages according to the criterion of  X  X bjective sources X . Ideally each of these web pages should represent a genre on the web. However, this  X  X bjective X  classification is never shown to the subjects. The aim is not to see if they comply with a given classification, but to see to what extent they agree with each other in assigning a single genre to these web pages. If the subjects are not happy with the list of genres, they can use the two  X  X scape X  options. This means that they are free to express their own perspective on the web pages and are not influenced my view of genre. For example, one of the subjects added a new label for all the web pages shown in the study.  X  Rosso selects his web pages through the use of an algorithm and the specification of queries in a search
My experiment relies on the participation of 135 subjects.  X  Rosso X  X  experiment relies on 257 subjects. 3.2. Possible objections to the study design
The study is based on 25 web pages labelled by 135 web users using a single label. Several objections might come to one X  X  mind regarding this experimental design.

The first objection is about the number of web pages. One might argue that 25 web pages are not represen-tative because it could be that a particular genre works better than another, or that a particular page is not as exemplar as I supposed to be. This objection would be valid if the aim of the study was to  X  X  X uess X  X  the  X  X  X ight X  X  genre for a web page, or to verify that users can recognize genres of web pages. In such cases presenting only one page per genre would surely involve a bias. Instead, the aim of this study is to observe the extent to which a large number of users spontaneously agree on the same label. The study is designed to leave space to users X  own genre vocabulary, so when they are not happy with the labels listed on the screen either they can add their genre for a web page, or to check that a particular genre is recognised, but to observe the degree of agreement in choosing a genre label for a web page.

A second objection is about the study design as a whole. In this study web users had to select a single label by clicking on a radio button. One might argue that the selection of multiple labels through check-boxes and the observation of the agreement on several labels would have supported the need for multiple genre classification better, because users might have all agreed on the same two, or three or four genre labels. This objection points to the next step of the research: once the inappropriateness of the single genre classification is fully acknowledged, then we can start thinking of finding solutions to assign multiple genre labels to the individual web page. At the current stage, my aim is to show the inadequacy of the single-genre labelling.

Undoubtedly, the multi-genre assignment seems to be the unavoidable future direction, as already pointed out by Rosso:
However, designing an experiment based on multiple genre classification is not a trivial endeavour, and many issues need to be addressed. For instance: (1) Should users add their own genre labels (thus giving then priority to users X  own vocabulary) or should (2) If they add their own labels how shall we face the problems of genre synonyms, like NEWS BULLETIN and (3) Should genre labels be rated, assigning a confidence score for each rating as suggested by Rosso (2005, p.
These and other questions are indeed the focus of future research on genre classification. 3.3. Experimental choices
I made a number of experimental choices in this study. First, I included only one page per web genre to keep a reasonably short run time. I tried to include as many genre labels as possible (in order to have a broader view) that could be processed in no more than 15 X 30 minutes. Time limitation for a volunteering audience was the main reason for  X  X ffering X  only one web page per genre. Nonetheless, some of the subjects complained that the study was too long and they lost interest along the way. 15
Second, the term  X  X enre X  was never mentioned in the study because I did not wish to trigger any reflection or afterthought about this term. I preferred having a labelling/classification that was as spontaneous as possible. The goal of the study was not declared either. Participants were only told to select a label for each web page. The idea was to ask for a genre classification of web pages implicitly , and observe the users X  reactions. How-ever, some subjects enquired about the goal of the study. 16
Third, when the genre was mentioned in the main heading of the original web page, I deleted the genre name. I thought that it would have been too easy to make a choice in the conditions shown in Fig. 1 . There-fore, users were presented the web page as shown in Appendix ( webpage _ 15 ). The only exception to this rule was the ABOUT PAGE , which was presented untouched (see Appendix ).

Fourth, I also arbitrarily decided the kind and number of genres to be included in the study. I used some of the web genres included in this study also for my experiments on automatic genre identification (see Santini, 2006a; Santini et al., 2006 ). One of the subjects complained that I did not include American genre names, with-out indicating, however, any example. 17
The main limitation of this study is graphical. Web pages were presented as screenshots (exactly as they appear in Appendix , or in the bitmap files available at &lt;http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.San-see Appendix ). The lack of context was noted by the subjects who straightaway complained. 18 3.4. Participant sample
Asking a web user to classify a web page by genre is not a easy task because genre identification requires a level a society without computer-mediated communications, web genres would make no sense), cultural/educational level (without a certain degree of education, an academic home page cannot be identified or perceived as belong-ing to a (sub)genre), and the membership in a community (being a  X  X logger X  makes it easier to identify a BLOG or a CLOG ). In this study, I assumed that the level of abstraction needed to perceive web genres could be found in a university environment where medium-high education, free access to computer-mediated communication and familiarity with the web are the norm. More specifically, I assumed that the subjects of the study were presum-ably students, researchers, teachers, or administrative staff, and had three elements in common: (1) They had at least a secondary school diploma, or equivalent, which is usually the basic requirement to (2) They were used to computer-meditated communication, as much interchange at university occurs via (3) They were familiar with the web, for instance to carry out bibliographic researches, or for providing
Giving priority to the level of education and to Internet literacy, I left details about age, gender, profession and more personal or demographic information as optional additions, and I will not include them in the dis-cussion of the results.

The study is based on participants who volunteered within the University of Brighton (UK), the Informat-ics Department of University of Sussex (UK), a Department of Dalhousie University (Canada), a Department of Syracuse University (USA), plus a small number of academics in other universities and research institutes in
Europe. Potential participants were sent an email, and this email was re-distributed within their university or department.

One hundred and ninety eight users in total began the experiment. A number of them (27 users) did not write any name or nickname and a small portion (6 users) wrote only their first name, but this was not enough to let them continue because first name and surname were set as required fields; a larger part (30 users) dropped out at different level of the study; in the end, the total number of participants who went through the whole study and provided valid responses for the experiment amounted to 135 users.

Fig. 2 shows the welcome page of the study. Only Surname and First Name were set as required fields, but participants were told that they could use pseudonyms/nicknames. These two fields were used to build unique identifiers for each of the subject (a sequential number was added in order to avoid homonyms). Later on, all the names were eliminated and replaced with serial numbers to ensure confidentiality.
 3.5. Participant task The study was web-based. It was uploaded on to the ITRI server (University of Brighton, UK) at the end of February 2005, and kept online for one month up to the end of March 2005.

The participants X  task was straightforward. Users were asked to go though 25 web pages and label each page by selecting a radio button. There were 23 labels available for selection, i.e. 21 genre labels and the two  X  X scape X  labels,  X  I don X  X  know  X  and  X  Add a label  X . Subjects appreciated the possibility of adding their own label 19 and the possibility of stating they did not know how to label a web page.

Fig. 3 shows how a web page was presented to the user. The general structure includes a space for the snap-shot of the web page in the upper box, 21 radio buttons with genre labels in the bottom box on the left-hand side (LHS), and two  X  X scape X  buttons ( X  I don X  X  know X  and  X  Add a label X  ) plus a text box for optional comments in the bottom box on the right-hand side (RHS). Most participants did not comment on the arrangement of the study. However, some suggested a different layout of the screen, 20 and few complained about it. 21
As it was not possible to move to the next page without selecting a radio button, participants who completed could use the same label for more than one web page, or never employ a label if deemed inappropriate.
Participants could add additional personal details in the welcome page ( Fig. 2 ) if they wished to do so (some of them asked to be sent the results of the study by email), and specify optional comments on each web page. In the last page of the study, where they were thanked, they could add additional comments.
The web pages were presented to the subjects in the following random sequence: webpage _ 04 , web-page _ 25 , webpage _ 03 , webpage _ 02 , webpage _ 05 , webpage _ 19 , webpage _ 23 , webpage _ 15 , web-page _ 11 , webpage _ 13 , webpage _ 21 , webpage _ 12 , webpage _ 07 , webpage _ 09 , webpage _ 24 , webpage _ 08 , webpage _ 20 , webpage _ 14 , webpage _ 16 , webpage _ 10 , webpage _ 06 , webpage _ 18 , webpage _ 22 , webpage _ 01 , and webpage _ 17 .

Among drops-out, 12 left at the welcome page, but wrote a full name; 7 left at the first or second page of the at page 16. Among possible hypotheses for dropping out, some are easy to identify: lack of interest in the study, tiredness (too many web pages to be assessed); or lack of familiarity with the suggested labels. Very few users started the study, left and resumed later on. Most of the participants went through the study without any break. 4. Results
The counts discussed in the following subsections are mostly based on percentage. 22 I grouped results according to three ranges of agreement on the most voted label: an agreement above 80% is considered to be high; an agreement between 50% and 80% is considered to be medium; finally an agreement below 50% is considered to be low. I will show later whether these thresholds make any sense. 4.1. Single-label agreement
A view of the data of this study is offered in Table 2 . This table shows the number of subjects assigning a particular label to a particular web page and the percentage of the most voted label. For example, the label ESHOP (8th row) was assigned to WP1 23 (first column) by 119 subjects (highlighted in bold), which corresponds to 88.15% (bottom row). Four subjects thought that WP1 was a CORPORATE HOME PAGE , seven selected NET AD , one subject chose FRONT PAGE , another subject selected HOTLIST , one DID NOT KNOW , two added a new label for it. In order to understand whether these results were due to chance, I submitted them to statistical tests of significance (Chi-square, Fisher X  X  Exact test, and Likelihood Ratio, as implemented in SPSS). These tests showed that the results were statistically significant (Sig. .000), i.e. the association of labels to web pages was not due to chance.

Using the three thresholds mentioned above (i.e. above 80%, between 80% and 50% and below 50%) I could identify three ranges of agreement in the users X  perspective. Table 3 shows the percentage of agreement by range: Top ( Above 80%), Middle ( Between 50% and 80%), and Bottom ( Below 50%). The records in the third column, Agreement on the labels of web pages , show the name of the page, the genre label that received the high-est agreement, the percentage of agreement, and the value of the pairwise agreement. For example, web-page _ 02 , was classified as a PERSONAL HOME PAGE by 88.89% of participants, with a pairwise agreement of 0.79.
According to the percentages shown in Table 3 , participants show the highest agreement, i.e. above 80%, on the genre of five web pages: webpage _ 02 was classified as a PERSONAL HOME PAGE by 88.89% of the partici-pants, webpage _ 01 as an ESHOP by 88.15%, webpage _ 11 as CORPORATE HOME PAGE by 88.15%, webpage _ 12 as FAQS by 83.7%, and finally webpage _ 05 as a SEARCH PAGE by 82.96%.

In the middle range (agreement between 50% and 80%) two cases are particularly interesting, webpage _ 10 and webpage _ 21 . Webpage _ 10 was classified as a CORPORATE HOME PAGE by 94 web users (69.63%), only 32 participants (23.7%) labelled it as ABOUT PAGE . One of the four pages without any official name, i.e. web-page _ 21 ( CITIDEX ), was assessed as a SEARCH PAGE by 57.8% of participants.

The bottom range contains four interesting cases, namely webpage _ 17 , webpage _ 18 , webpage _ 23 , and webpage _ 15 . Webpage _ 17 ( RYANAIR )and webpage _ 18 ( ADIRONDACK ) were two of the web pages without any official genre. Webpage _ 17 was classified as ONLINE FORM by 42.22% of participants, and webpage _ 18 ORGANI-ZATIONAL HOME PAGE by 38.52%. Although these web pages do not look like as stereotypical exemplars of a web genre, a majority of users (a thin majority, indeed) could perceive some genre conventions in them. More prob-and all roughly indicate some kind of  X  X roduct information page X . However, more than 10% preferred to select  X  I don X  X  know  X . Similarly, webpage _ 15 shows a majority of 23.7% of users who preferred to add a label. 25
A first conclusion can be drawn from these results. According to the labelling expressed by the 135 subjects on 25 web pages, a high agreement on a single label exists only on a restricted number of web pages, namely 20% (i.e. 5 web pages out of 25). For the rest, i.e. 80% of the web pages, the subjects show different level of disagreement, in some case particularly acute, as in the case of webpage _ 23 and webpage _ 15 .
Fig. 4 shows the charted percentages. The average of agreement on the top range is 86.37%, on the middle range 61.04%, on the bottom range 38.36%.
One problem with percentage analysis is that it fails to take account of agreement for categories other than the most popular, so a 60 X 10 X 10 X 10 X 10 split among five categories will look exactly the same as a 50 X 50 split among two categories. For this reason it is customary to look at pairwise agreement, i.e. the percentage of agreeing judgment pairs. For example, the 60 X 10 X 10 X 10 X 10 split has 60 * 59/2 + 4 * 10 * 9/2 = 1950 agreeing pairs (39.4%), whereas the 50 X 50 split has 2 * 50 * 49/2 = 2450 agreeing pairs (49.5%), so the latter has higher agreement overall.

The pairwise agreement on the individual web pages is shown in the column  X  X airwise Agreem. X  in Table 3 , and it matches the percentages except for a slight difference in very few cases.

In conclusion, the agreement expressed by the 135 users appears to be stable on a single label only in the top range. 4.2. Beyond the single label
In the previous section, I showed the agreement on the most voted labels as expressed by 135 web users on 25 web pages. According to the subjects X  labelling, a single-label agreement is reasonably stable on five web pages. In most cases (20 web pages out of 25), the agreement on a single label is moderate (middle range) or low (bottom range). In this section, I show another view of the data based on the distribution of agreement across several labels. It is worth saying that participants in this user study explicitly complained about the lim-this restriction.

Table 4 shows a breakdown of the raw counts and percentages of the five web pages where users reached an agreement of above 80%. The main aggregation of agreement is around the first label (1st). However, three web pages ( webpage _ 02 , webpage _ 01 ,and webpage _ 05 ) also show that some users preferred other labels (2nd). In the representation of the agreement on different labels I applied a threshold in order not to clutter the table with too much data. More specifically, I included in the table only labels that received at least six votes, that is 4.4% of agreement. A threshold of 4.4% approximately corresponds to the chance of randomly assigning one of the 23 labels to a web page [(1:23) * 100]. For this reason, I did not include a second label for webpage _ 11 and webpage _ 12 , since they did not reach six votes (cf. Table 2 ).

The situation appears much more fragmented in Tables 5 and 6 . Each web page in these tables has been assigned to at least three labels. The main difference between Tables 5 and 6 is that in Table 5 the gap between the first label and the next label is wider than in Table 6 . The average gap between the 1st label and the 2nd label in Table 5 is about 43%, while it decreases to about 15% in Table 6 . In other words, in Table 6 the agree-ment is more evenly spread over several labels.

In Table 6 , two cases are particularly fragmented, i.e. webpage _ 23 and webpage _ 15 . These two web pages were very difficult to classify according to the participants X  behaviour. Most users preferred to add their own label, a fair number of users declared that they did not know the most suitable label for these two web pages, and the rest of votes are spread over a large number of labels. By adding up the percent-ages of the two  X  X scape X  options, I get a percentage of 37.04% for webpage _ 23 and of 28.89% for webpage _ 15 .

In conclusion, according to the labelling of 135 subjects, all the 25 web pages except two (namely, web-page _ 11 and webpage _ 12 ) have received more than one label. The aggregation of agreement around a sin-gle label is stable only for the five pages of the top range. The rest of web pages show aggregation of agreement around at least three labels. 4.3. Discussion
From the data shown in the previous subsections, it appears that only a small number of web pages would unproblematically fit into a single genre, namely the five web pages showed in Table 4 . Most of the web pages included in the study would benefit from a multi-label classification, because users perceive them from different angles.

I included in the study both  X  X bjective X  exemplars (21 web pages) and web pages without any official genre (four web pages). From the results, it appears that most of these web pages were assigned to at least three labels. This means that a multi-genre classification would be not only beneficial, but also more real-istic. When the fragmentation across many labels is very large (say more than 4 or 5 labels), probably it would be more appropriate to assign a zero-genre label, thus signalling the uncertainty of the genre assignment.

The thresholds and the percentage ranges (above 80%, between 50% and 80%, and below 50%) are infor-mative. Web pages with an agreement of above 80% aggregate most votes at most on two labels ( Table 4 ). Web pages with an agreement between 50% and 80% aggregate votes on at least three labels, but the gap between the first label and the other labels is quite wide ( Table 5 ). Web pages with an agreement below 50% aggregate votes on at least three labels, but the distribution of votes is spread much more evenly across the labels ( Table 6 ).

In conclusion, I interpret the large disagreement on a single genre assignment as a motivation for a more flexible classification scheme, i.e. a scheme that goes beyond the single genre classification.
It is worth noting that this interpretation of the results is only one of the possible views of the data collected in this study. I suggested a preliminary interpretation in terms of genre evolution in Santini (2006b) . In future, this data can be exploited to produce further findings. For example, they would be useful in investigating the following issues: web genre granularity : to what extent can participants distinguish among different types of HOME PAGES , such as personal, academic, corporate, or organizational? web genre exposure : to what extent are participants familiar with recent labels, such as CLOG or EZINE ?
Are they able to assign them to the appropriate web pages? Or are these labels still very opaque to them? web genre clairvoyance : are participants able to suggest labels for complex or hybrid web pages? unpopularity of web genre label : why are SPLASH SCREEN and HOT LIST such unpopular choices? Have they been replaced by other genre labels? relations among genres : what is the relation among genres? Tables 5 and 6 help identify genres that users see as similar or related. For example, labels such as HOW-TO and TUTORIAL are often used interchange-ably. 5. Conclusions
The goal of the study presented in this article was to investigate the extent to which the classification of a web page by a single genre matches the users X  perspective.

Since web pages are a complex type of document  X  encompassing several texts not necessarily related to one another  X  my hypothesis was that users tend to focus on the type of text, or on the textual function, they are more interested in, when they classify a web page by a single genre. This results in the creation of different genre perspectives on the same web page. In order to test this hypothesis, I submitted a restricted number of web pages (25 web pages) to a large number of web users (135 subjects) asking them to assign only a single genre label (choosing among 21 genre labels and two  X  X scape X  labels) to each of the web pages. According to the labelling expressed by the 135 who took part in this study: five out of 25 web pages received an agreement on a single genre label above 80%: 20 out of 25 web pages were labelled using at least three genre labels; when genre conventions are particularly weak or unclear, web users tended to disagree more, and this resulted in the use of a larger number of genre labels.
These findings suggest that: multi-genre labelling is likely to better represent the users X  perspective, which appears diversified because a web page can be seen from different angles; zero-genre label may be useful to signal the uncertainty (represented by the selection of the two  X  X scape X  options) or extreme fragmentation of genre assignment.

These findings shows that there is the need of a more flexible genre classification scheme that goes beyond the single-genre classification. I propose using the zero-to-multi-genre classification scheme that could help account for the current situation of genres on the web, where it is often difficult to fit a web page into a single genre. Following this scheme, a zero-genre label is assigned when a web page appears very individualized, with unclear genre conventions, and the agreement of web users appear sparse or spread over a large number of genre labels; a single-genre label is assigned when a web page complies with the convention of a single genre; finally, multiple genre labels are assigned when a web page is hybrid and composite.

This interpretation of the findings complies with the characterization of the genre of web pages that I sug-gested in the Introduction. This characterization includes the two attributes of genre hybridism and individ-ualization, where the first attribute accounts for multi-genre classification, and the latter for zero-genre classification.

A viable future experiment would be the investigation of the extent to which web users agree on the same set of genre labels for a web page. This could be done by allowing multiple classification. However, as men-tioned earlier, doing multiple classification implies addressing a number of thorny issues. Discussion on these issues would provide new valuable insights useful for genre classification practices.

Once these and similar issues have been settled, we could imagine a future scenario where the creation of genre-annotated corpora is carried out by the web users themselves, maybe within a net of Internet social networks. 27 This would also allow for genre investigations through the lens of social network anal-ysis, an approach pioneered by Paolillo, Warren, and Kunz (2007) . It is worth stressing that the creation of reliable and shareable genre-annotated corpora is fundamental for a number of tasks, such as lan-guage studies, genre theory, genre analyses, automatic genre classification, and evaluation of web applications.

In conclusion, genre is an important concept that shapes communication and social interaction. Hopefully future research will head towards a more fine-grained genre classification scheme, overriding the oversimpli-fying assumption that a document can be assigned to only one genre.
