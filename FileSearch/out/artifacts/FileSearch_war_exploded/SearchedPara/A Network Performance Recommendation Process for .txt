 Advanced applications have caused endusers to show a new interest in accessing network measurement and statu s data across multiple domains, in order to detect occasional net work problems. Diversity of network technologies, technical soluti ons and network managers add to the complexity of providing such information, which, when available, includes techni cal details that are meaningful only to specialists. However, contex t awareness can ease the recommendation process underlying a mo nitoring infrastructure. This research investigates a novel approach for traffic monitoring in view of the context informati on used to provide network performance recommendations in the most productive way.

The strong presence of recommenders systems in eco mmerce and correlated areas does make sense, since they facili tate the users X  task in finding products that best fit their expect ations. However, recommenders systems have evolved over the last few years, adopting new recommendation techniques to predict u ser X  X  preferences and ratings. These advances have not on ly encouraged the adoption of recommenders in ecommerce but also opened opportunities in other areas, like network performa nce monitoring and evaluation. Users usually have different quality expectations i n dealing with their networked applications, which vary according to the kind of task intended. However, the majority of the current traffic monitoring solutions don X  X  take into consideration users X  individual expectations when providing network perf ormance information. The network performance evaluation would be more pr oductive if it were associated to the users X  individual aspects and the context regarding the application use. In this sense, the a doption of recommender systems concepts in the network perform ance monitoring field can bring great contributions to u sers and applications. Although at a first glance, recommend er techniques can only deal with User x Item relation, some recent publications [2] have demonstrated that recommendations can be e laborated considering other aspects, like those related to co ntext information, representing a specific situation. The se initiatives support the idea that current network performance a dvisors development can also include context processing, in view of users X  profiles, application features and network p erformance information as a path to reach a more user customiz ed network diagnostics. Context awareness can ease the recommendation proce ss underlying a monitoring infrastructure. However, th e problem still lies in choosing the best strategies to identify, g ather and process context parameters in this domain. Therefore, we fi rstly define context as being all the information about users, a pplication and networks needed to give the best and useful perform ance information to multimedia applications users. Then, through this definition, we gather the information related to th e processing parameters used to predict user X  X  preferences on ne twork usage. And finally, in terms of context processing, we pro pose a four phased hybrid recommendation process that relies on a combination of conversational, knowledgebased and casebased recommendation methods [2], due to the problem comp lexity. The Conversational recommender method [9][10] facil itates user model definition through dialogs which guide the us er X  X  network use intent elicitation as well as stereotype identi fication. The Knowledgebased method [7], in turn, assists applic ation class identification by rulebased induction. Its employm ent is facilitated by efforts related on the literature [5 ] regarding generic applications types and their general quality of ser vice (QoS) requirements, especially within the multimedia appl ication domain. At last, the Casebased methods [8] enable the user X  X  preference prediction based on similar situations o ccurred in the past through casebased reasoning (CBR), where cont ext parameters define a case. Both topics  X  Contextaware and recommender systems  X  have been widely discussed in the literature [1][2]. How ever, this combine these areas with the purpose of providing a more customized network monitoring environments which ad vises users with choices that best fit their expectations. This research investigates a novel approach for net work performance recommendation which takes into account the user X  X  preferences and applications X  features. As mentioned before, monitoring can be more product ive if it is accomplished by a recommendation infrastructure tha t predicts users X  expectations based on their profiles and con texts. Br X zillon [1] defined context as any information ap plied to characterize and interpret the situation where a us er interacts with an application in a given instant. Previously, Shil it [4] categorized context in three groups: computing context which co nsiders computer resources like connectivity, bandwidth, et c.; user context that is related to personal information, li ke profile, location and nearby people; and physical context th at describes aspects like noise, temperature, and lighting level . These concepts reinforce our approach in which context is identifi ed by the combination of computing context (network condition s involving two end points in a specific time) and user context (personal preferences and expectations), characterizing a us er X  X  situation dealing with an application. Consequently, instead of the traditional User x Item relation, in this proposal the recommendation process was concei ved to deal with a threedimensional User x Application x Network performance relation. Besides that, these dimensions should be processed through a hybrid recommendation approach that relies on a combination of conversational, knowledgebased and case based reasoning methods. Context in network performance recommendation can b e inferred from context dimensions broadly discussed in litera ture [3]. Hence, a specific situation (case) is characterized by a user ( who ) dealing with an application ( what ) in order to perform a particular task, during a specific time ( when ), involving two network end points ( where ) under certain network performance condition ( how ). In others words, these parameters describe a cas e as follows:  X  Who: describes the user profile that is made up by personal  X  What: identifies the application of interest from u sers. Each  X  Where: identifies the network path between two end points.  X  When: describes the application X  X  period of utiliza tion.  X  How: describes the network performance. It should b e a These context parameters define a specific situatio n processed by network performance recommendations, as demonstrate d by the examples on Table 1. It shows that the same user (J ohn) has two different contexts for the same kind of application (VoIP) that varies according to his role. 
Case Who (role) When What How R #1 John (Researcher) Noon VoIP MOS 4 3 #2 John (Professor) Night VoIP MOS 3 5 #3 Carol (Student) Night VoIP MOS 4 4 In this sense, the rating ( R ) assigned by this user indicates that his satisfaction level (1 to 5) varies according to the role when the recommendation was requested and obtained. So, alth ough the MOS (Mean Opinion Score) 1 value for the night is lower than the midday X  X  value, John assigned a better evaluation f or the night one. John X  X  recommendation cases can further be use d as a basis for other similar situations. The similarity betwee n cases is calculated by weighting factors associated with con text parameters that define a case. The motivation for this research is to find ways of including personalization on network performance recommenders by considering context parameters. Therefore, the appr oach proposed here is based on multidimensional recommendations, originally proposed by Adomavicius and his colleagues [2] that borrowed ideas from OLAP database processing. Their work is a relevant contribution for the recommendation process propose d on this research since it deals with context issues. Thus, the network performance recommendation space S is defined as a Cartesian product S , where D 1 and D 2 represent the dimensions comprising a set of attributes that defi nes the users X  profiles and applications features, respectively. D imension D turn, comprises a set of attributes that defines th e performance of function L that informs the performance of an appli cation  X  from the processing of the network performance metrics i n a path  X , at a given moment  X  plus extra performance associated factors, such as operating system performance, denoted as  X  . The recommendation process depicted in Figure 1 is broken into four phases. The Data gathering phase implements th e conversational method as a first step to facilitate the user model definition through dialogues that help on the user X  s preferences matched against a knowledge base until it finds a c orresponding application class. The Early requirements phase ide ntifies users X  preferences and their stereotypes. The Learning pha se obtains users X  feedback, registers them on the recommendati on base for future searches and updates the user model. Finally , the Recommending phase aims at choosing and executing t he best recommendation strategy. The process phases rely on both a recommendation ba se and a knowledgebase. The knowledge base should have a se t of rules required to find measurement tools associated with application network metrics; QoS parameters associated with the network applications types; and measurement tools associate d with network topology. This information defines the dime nsion D We have instantiated part of the recommendation pro cess through the development of a prototype [6] that followed th e architecture depicted in Figure 2. This architecture aims at ela borating recommendations from the user model (D 1 ) application features (D 2 ) and network performance data (D 3 ). It also has an interface module to deal with endusers or other client appli cations that request recommendations. ITUT recommendation P.800.1, 2006 The modules presented in the architecture are weakl y coupled, in the way that their concepts can be adopted by diver se types of networks and use cases. The roles that each module plays in the architectur e are described as follows:  X  Interface : Its main goal is to provide system access to user s  X  Knowledge Manager : This module enables the system to  X  Performance Analyzer : This module does performance tests  X  User modeler : Recommendations should be elaborated  X  Recommender : This module plays the main role within the The goal of this initial development was to evaluat e a system which relies on ontology use to suggest suitable ap plications according to the network conditions, application X  X  features, and users X  intents. Besides that, the system follows co nversational recommenders X  concepts, carrying out a conversation with the user to progressively narrow down his/her preferenc es. Thus, the dialog helps the system to identify application X  X  f eatures as well as to gather user X  X  information needed for recommen dations processing. For application classification, we developed a moni toring knowledgebase that relies on MonONTO ( Mon itoring Onto logy) [5], a domain ontology for network monitoring and recommendation for advanced Internet applications u sers. It brings together terms related to the domains of adv anced applications and their QoS requirements, network mo nitoring environments, and some aspects concerning endusers . Through MonONTO, we could formalize terms and concepts; clar ify relationships and restrictions corresponding to eac h of those concepts; elucidate the main properties or attribut es that compose each concept; and enable the creation of a knowledg ebase for the domain of network monitoring and advanced Internet applications. In terms of accessing network performance data, the system utilized PerfSONAR 2 services. PerfSONAR is a service oriented architecture for multidomain network monitoring. I t defines protocols for communication, a base architecture of services and different examples of implementation. The PerfSONAR services act as an intermediate layer between measurement in frastructures and measurement data client applications, like the ones for diagnostic and visualization. For the system intera ction we developed MentorWeb 3 , an improved and webbased version of http://www.perfsonar.net http://tools.nuperc.unifacs.br/mentorweb Mentor recommender tool [6]. As we can see on the F igure 3 (a), after the data gathering phase which gets the user personal information, the recommender goes to the early requ irement phase. On this step it tries to find out more infor mation about the application the user intends to run. Users can coun t on dynamics helps that guide on finding the right answers. As t he application class is identified the recommender goes to the las t step shown on Figure 3 (b). On this step, the user can furnish a name for his/her application if the system doesn X  X  have it on its kn owledgebase. So far, we have formulated the problem, designed an d implemented the ontology knowledgebased and starte d the prototype development. Besides that, we also formal ized the network performance recommendation problem, identif ying three context dimensions. The user X  X  information used by the tool is based on Internet2 EduPerson 4 LDAP schema. It will be used on further works for user modeling. Due to the current casebased reasoning simplification, in the next development s tages we will make use of CBR frameworks to incorporate an improv ed case based reasoning in the prototype. This development will enable us to perform tests on real scenarios like the Brazili an National Research and Education Network backbone with a large r number of users and further perform statistical analysis.
