 M. Naeem, D.C. Lee n 1. Introduction
Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communica-tion systems have significantly higher channel capacity than the single-input-single-output (SISO) system for the same total transmission power and bandwidth ( Telatar, 1999 ; Goldsmith et al., 2006 ). However, increased number of antennas in the
MIMO system has a cost consequence. In practical wireless communication systems, signals of each antenna go through a separate Radio Frequency (RF) hardware known as RF chain (e.g., amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, etc). In MIMO systems, combining signals carried by a larger number of antennas results in a high hardware cost due to the large number of RF chains.
Molisch et al. (2005) showed that hardware cost can be signifi-cantly reduced by selecting a good subset of antennas from the set of physically available antennas and using the signals from the selected antennas only, without sacrificing the advantage of multiantenna diversity. A block diagram of MIMO system with provided a detail description of antenna selection problem and its benefits. In this paper, we discuss the algorithm to select a good subset of antennas on the basis of channel conditions in real-time.
The complexity of optimally selecting transmit and receive antennas can increase exponentially with the number of transmit and receive antennas. Exhaustive Search Algorithm (ESA) evaluates the antenna combination that giv es the best performance (perfor-
Enumerating over all possible combinations and finding the one that in a real-time environment, in which the channel condition changes frequently and the antenna selection should quickly adapt to changing channels, a computationally efficient algorithm is needed.
A number of antenna selection schemes, with a motivation to reduce computational complexity have been presented in literature 2010 ; Gharavi and Gershman, 2004 ). In the recent years, antenna selection schemes are also proposed for wireless LAN, Cognitive one side i.e., either transmit antenna selection or receive antenna selection. There is very little work for joint transmit and receive antenna selection. In this paper, we apply Binary Particle Swarm
Optimization (BPSO) to the real-time joint transmit and receive antenna selection problem. We focus on the joint antenna selection problem because the computation al complexity is typically more challenging in joint selection; however, the same scheme is applic-able for separate receive and transmit antenna selections.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system model for joint transmit and receive antenna selection, which uses BPSO.
We also discuss how to tailor the conventional BPSO to the joint antenna selection problem to improve the algorithms X  speed of converging a good (nearly optimal) solution. Simulation results and computational complexities are presented in Section 4. 2. System model We consider a MIMO system with N T transmits antennas and N
R received antennas. Because of cost concern, we consider a system that has only N t and N r RF chains at the transmitter and that the receiver has the channel side information (CSI), but the transmitter does not. We denote the channel state by complex selects N r receives antennas to connect to RF chains from the N receive antennas. Moreover, the receiver also selects N t antennas from the N T transmit antennas for the transmitter, and this decision (selection) is communicated to the transmitter side through a low rate, highly reliable feedback channel.
We denote the collection of all possible joint transmit and receive antenna selections by F . Then, the number of possible ways of selecting antennas is F jj  X  selection of transmit and receive antennas by f in F . We denote the channels formed between the selected N t transmit antennas (maximum mutual information) associated with selected trans-mit and receive antennas ( Molisch et al., 2005 ) under circular symmetric white Gaussian noise assumption is
C  X  H f  X  X  log 2 det I N r  X  r N where r is the average signal to noise ratio per channel use, and I denotes the n n identity matrix, and ( ) H denotes the conjugate transpose of matrix ( ) (we are assuming that the transmitter equally splits its transmission power among the selected transmit antennas and feeds independent data streams to these transmit antennas. These are reasonable policies of the transmitter under the assumption that the transmitter does not have CSI. The receiver does not feedback CSI.)
We can model joint transmit and receive antenna selection problem as a combinatorial optimization problem as max We represent each selection of f by binary string as Q  X  q T 1 , q T 2 , ... , q T N of whether antenna j is selected or not from N R receive antennas. Exhaustive Search Algorithm (ESA) evaluates all possible 9 combinations, which is computationally inefficient. High-speed communications demand an antenna selection scheme with lower complexity. In the next section we will describe the BPSO-based joint transmit and receive antenna selection scheme. 3. Binary particle swarm optimization for joint antenna selection
In this section we present a joint transmit and receive antenna selection scheme that utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). PSO is a collaborative computational technique that is derived from the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. The PSO is found robust in solving global optimization problems ( Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995 ). Like other evolutionary algorithms, PSO is a population-based search algorithm. In PSO, each individual is tion (or swarm). If we represent the optimization as minimizing the cost function of several variables, x 1 , x 2 , y , x fitness measure F ( x 1 , x 2 , y , x n ), then vector ( x space. Exploring through the space to find the best solution can be analogically viewed particles flying in the space to find the best position. PSO provides a population-based search procedure, in PSO system, particles fly around (change their position) in a multidimensional search space (set of all potential solutions). its own experience and on the basis of the neighboring particles X  experience, making use of the best position encountered by itself and its neighbors. Thus, the PSO system combines local search methods with global search methods. Therefore each particle has a tendency to fly (move) towards better and better solutions ( Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995 ). In this paper, we have formulated the joint transmit and receive antenna selection problem as a discrete binary optimization problem and applied Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) ( Kennedy and Eberhart, 1997 ). BPSO is a binary version of PSO. In BPSO every particle X  X  position is expressed as a string of binary digits  X 0 X  and  X 1 X  (bits). In BPSO, a particle can move from its current position to any other feasible position in the search space by flipping various numbers of bits.
In general, BPSO can be characterized by parameters and notations ( I s , F , N , I ter , D , w l ,P l B ,G l B , V population i.e., the number of particles, I ter are the maximum Mobile Radio Channel 1 number of iteration and D is the dimension of the particle position the l by X l bk (best among the history of particle k  X  X  positions); that is, by
X argmax 0 r i r l F (X l k ). We explicitly denote its components as tively, we denote P l B  X  [P l 1 ,P l 2 , y ,P l bN ]. G l of fitness function F .Thatis,G l B argmax 1 r k r N F (p l as G particle k at the l th iteration. We also explicitly denote its tion collectively, we denote V l  X  [V l 1 ,V l 2 , y ,V l In this paper we also introduce modifications to conventional selection scheme. Especially, we devise, for the antenna selection modified BPSO algorithm can be briefly described as follows.
Step 0 : generate initial population and velocities. At the initial iteration l  X  0, initialize each particle X  X  best position, P 0
P b 2  X  X 0 2 , , P 0 bN  X  X 0 N ; initialize the global best as Step 1 : update the iteration counter.

Step 2 : for each particle, calculate the velocity. v g bi A 0 , 1 fg , x l 1 k , i A 0 , 1 fg , p l 1 bk , i A 0 , 1 fg k  X  1 , 2 , ... , N and i  X  1 , 2 , ... , D  X  4  X  where U(0, 1) is the random variable uniformly distributed in interval (0, 1), and c 1 4 0 and c 2 4 0 are social and cognitive parameters to control the movement of the particle in any specific direction.

Step 3 : update the position of particle k X  X  i th element as x where s is a sigmoid-kind function ( Kennedy and Eberhart, 1997 ). In this paper we use s  X  q  X  X  X  1  X  exp  X  q  X  X  1 .
Step 4 : evaluate the current population according to the fitness function F. Store these values in temporary variables P B  X  X  P Step 5 : if the convergence criteria are satisfied, then terminate. Otherwise go to step 6.

Step 6 : f or k  X  1, 2, y , N , update the particle k X  s best as if F  X  P Tmp bk  X  4 F  X  P l 1 bk  X  , then P l bk  X  P Tmp bk Step 7 : update the global best as G l B  X  argmax 1 r k r N to step 1 and repeat the steps.

In the joint antenna selection problem, we represent the selection of antennas by a binary string (vector) Q  X   X  q , q T , ... , q T N the string (dimension of the vector) Q is exactly the total number of antennas (both transmit and receive antennas) in the system.
Value 1 of an element indicates that the associated antenna is selected, and value 0 indicates that the antenna is not selected. (Each particle X in the general description of BPSO represents a candidate value of Q .)
Now we discuss the modification to the conventional BPSO. In reduce the average convergence time (the number of iterations until initial selection of antennas, which we call the initial feed and antenna selection problem, we set the length of binary string X (dimension of vector X 0 ) to be the total number of antennas. Exemplary methods of choosing the initial feed include (1) Adjacent Feed (AF) method and (2) Norm Based (NB) method.

Adjacent Feed technique is shown in Fig. 2 (b). This example idea of Adjacent Feed technique. In AF methods, for transmit antenna selection, N t bits are set to one and placed adjacent to to 1 and placed adjacent to each other in the vector; e.g., vector positions of the particles.

The idea behind Norm Based feed is to contrive the initial population by utilizing domain knowledge of the MIMO system.
In this method, the antennas with best channel conditions are with the best channel conditions act as an initial feed to generate cyclic shifted BPSO population. Best norm based cyclic initial population technique is shown in Fig. 2 (c). This example uses the best norm feed technique. In this method, for transmit antenna
Similarly for receive antenna selection, N r bits are set to 1 with and seventh location. It means first, third and seventh antenna best channel conditions. After setting the norm based initial feed,
Cyclic shifted initial population prevents biased antenna selec-tion at the start of the algorithm. If the initial population is generated randomly, some antennas may not be selected at all in has seven ( N T  X  7) transmit antennas ( x 1 , x 2 , y , x system has seven ( N R  X  7) receive antennas ( x 8 , x 9 , transmit antenna 3 has less chance of selection in any candidate solution in the initial population because each individual in the population has element x 3  X  0. In another extreme case of the random initial population, some antennas may be selected too often observe that each individual in the population has element x
This cause receive antenna 7 to be selected in all the candidate eliminate the possibility of such bias.

The use of cyclic shifts as the initial positions of the population ensures that every antenna is selected more or less the same number of times in the initial population (equal opportunity for all antennas). In the example shown in Fig. 2 (b), each transmit 0, 0) and its six cyclic shifts. Likewise, each receive antenna is cyclic shifts. (In randomly generated initial population, some antenna may not be selected in the initial population in an extreme case.) After generating cyclic shifts of initial feeds for transmit and receive antennas separately, one can think of a number of ways of combining these transmit and receive antenna selections to generate initial positions of the particles. In this paper we use a concatenation technique shown in Fig. 2 (b). To generate initial positions of particles, we concatenate the initial feed (binary string) of the transmitter and the initial feed of the receiver string pairs, and we choose max( N T , N R ) min( N (whichever has the smaller number of antennas) and concatenate other side one by one. Fig. 2 (b) shows the BPSO initialization procedure for the case that transmitter and receiver have different including concatenation of differe nt transmitter-receiver combina-tion of strings or by adding randomly generated positions. 4. Computational complexity and simulation results
For performance comparison, we present the simulation results of the proposed BPSO joint transmit and receive antenna selection and compare them with the results from existing antenna selection schemes. The channel is assumed to be quasi-static, and different channels in the MIMO are assumed statisti-cally independent. The parameters used for simulations are selected such that the performance of BPSO is evaluated for different search space sizes and signal to noise ratios. All the simulations are performed using Monte Carlo runs. Each result is an average of 5000 independent simulation runs.

For performance comparison, we used two scenarios ( N T , N N results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the performance of the ESA (optimal), Gershman algo-rithm ( Gershman et al., 2004 ) random selection, norm based selection ( Molisch et al., 2005 ), Gorokhov algorithm ( Gorokhov and Fang, 2007 ) and the BPSO-based antenna selection. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , BPSO population is generated randomly for BPSO. (The BPSO performance curves shown in Figs. 3 and 4 result from applying the conventional BPSO to the antenna selection problem.) These figures show that 10% outage capacity achieved by the BPSO algorithm is close to the optimal (ESA) and is better than other algorithms for a wide range SNR. Obviously,
BPSO is highly likely to yield a better solution if the algorithm runs more iteration. There is a tradeoff between the population size and the number of iterations required to achieve a specified performance of the final solution. One can use this tradeoff to configure the algorithms to available hardware; e.g., for hardware with a large memory, a large population size is suitable. Figs. 5 and 6 show the performance BPSO, ESA, Gershman,
Gorokhov, and decoupled algorithm for different numbers of selected antennas. In Figs. 5 and 6 , BPSO population is generated randomly. The figures show 10% outage capacity versus N r
N  X  3, N R  X  14. The population size of BPSO is 14 and the number of 20 dB respectively According to Figs. 5 and 6 , the outage capacity achieved by the proposed algorithm is close to the optimal (ESA) and is better than other algorithms for all values of N r

BPSO with random population has randomly chosen initial population; while BPSO with Best Norm and BPSO with Adjacent feed have initial population generated by cyclic shifts. Simulation results show that performance of BPSO with Best Norm and BPSO with Adjacent feed is better than BPSO with randomly chosen population and genetic algorithm.

As a measure of computational complexity, we considered the number of complex multiplications and additions (CMAA). The exhaustive search algorithm needs to compute complex determinants and each determinant require 1/3 n 3 plex multiplications and additions ( Golub et al., 1983 ). Norm based method require 2 N R N T CMAA. GA and BPSO requires Gorokhov algorithm requires ( N R N r N t 3 )  X  ( N T N t decoupled algorithm needs to compute nants. Gershman algorithm requires 2  X  N T N R  X  N R N
N r  X  N 2 R N t  X  CMAA. In Table 1 , we converted these numbers of complex multiplications and additions to processing times for the experimental settings that yielded results of Figs. 3 X 7 . As dedi-cated DSP processors are often used for complex multiplications and additions in modern communication, the computational times are calculated for Texas Instruments DSP processor C67XX series with 500 millions multiplications and additions per second (MMACS) capability 1 ( Texas Instruments, 2010 ). It is clear from the computational complexity and performance comparison that BPSO is more suitable algorithm than ESA and other algorithms. The Norm-Based method often requires less computation than
BPSO. However, its performance (the sum-rate capacity achieved by the solution) is worse than that of BPSOs. 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we presented BPSO algorithms for a joint transmit and receive antenna selection problem. The BPSO for the antenna selection problem requires very low computation and its performance is close to that of the exhaustive search.
BPSO, as an evolutionary computing has a simple evolution model, resistance to trap in local minima, and low implementa-tion complexity. This paper indicates that BPSO is a suitable candidate for solving complex communication problems like the joint antenna selection.
