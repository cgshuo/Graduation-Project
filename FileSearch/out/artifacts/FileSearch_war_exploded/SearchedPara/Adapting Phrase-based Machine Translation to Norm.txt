 of voice of the patient data about experience in terms of benefits and side-effects of drugs and treatments (O X  X onnor et al., 2014). However, natural language understanding from social me-dia messages is a difficult task because of the lexical and grammatical variability of the lan-guage (Baldwin et al., 2013; O X  X onnor et al., 2014). Indeed, language understanding by ma-chines requires the ability to recognise when a phrase refers to a particular concept. Given a variable length phrase, an effective system should return a concept with the most similar mean-ing. Table 1 shows examples of mappings be-tween Twitter phrases and medical concepts. For example, a Twitter phrase  X  X o way I X  X  gettin any sleep 2nite X  might be mapped to the med-ical concept  X  X nsomnia X  (SNOMED:193462001), when using the SNOMED-CT ontology (Spack-man et al., 1997). The success of the mapping between social media phrases and formal medi-cal concepts would enable an automatic integra-tion between patient experiences and biomedical databases (Limsopatham and Collier, 2015). We refer to this mapping from social media phrases to medical concepts as medical term normalisation , which aims to determine the unique identifier of a medical concept that is mentioned in different forms in a free-text (Morgan et al., 2008).
Existing works, e.g. (Elkin et al., 2012; Gob-bel et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2009), mostly fo-cused on identifying medical concepts in medi-cal documents. For example, Gobbel et al. (2014) proposed a na  X   X ve Bayesian-based technique to map phrases from clinical notes to medical con-cepts in the SNOMED-CT ontology. Wang et al. (2009) identified medical concepts regarding adverse drug events in electronic medical records. On the other hand, O X  X onnor et al. (2014) in-vestigated the normalisation of medical terms in Twitter messages. In particular, they proposed to cal concepts that could be potentially mapped to a given Twitter phrase, when mapping between Twitter phrases and medical concepts.

In contrast, we argue that the medical text nor-malisation task can be achieved by using well-established phrase-based MT techniques, where we translate a text written in a social media lan-guage (e.g.  X  X o way I X  X  gettin any sleep 2nite X ) to a text written in a formal medical language (e.g.  X  X nsomnia X ) and then calculate the similarity be-tween the translated phrase and the description of a medical concept. Indeed, in this work we investi-gate an effective adaptation of phrase-based MT to map a Twitter phrase to a medical concept. More-over, we propose to combine the adapted phrase-based MT technique and the similarity between word vector representations to effectively map a Twitter phrase to a medical concept.

The main contributions of this paper are three-fold: 1. We investigate the adaptation of phrase-based 2. We propose to combine our adaptation of 3. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed ap-Phrase-based MT models, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), have been shown to be effec-tive in translation between languages, as they learn local term dependencies, such as collocations, re-orderings, insertions and deletions. Koehn et al. (2003) showed that a phrase-based MT tech-nique markedly outperformed traditional word-based MT techniques on several benchmarks. In this work, we adapt the phrase-based MT tech-nique of Koehn et al. (2003) for the medical text normalisation task. In particular, we use the phrase-based MT technique to translate phrases from Twitter language to formal medical lan-guage , before mapping the translated phrases to medical concepts based on the ranked similarity of their word vector representations.

Traditional approaches for creating word vec-tor representations treated words as atomic units (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Turian et al., 2010). For instance, the one-hot representation used a vector with a length of the size of the vocabu-lary, where one dimension is on, to represent a particular word (Turian et al., 2010). Recently, techniques for learning high-quality word vec-tor representations (i.e. distributed word repre-sentations) that could capture the semantic sim-ilarity between words, such as continuous bags of words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013b) and global vectors (GloVe) (Pennington et al., 2014), have been proposed. Indeed, these distributed word representations have been effectively ap-plied in different systems that achieve state-of-the-art performances for several NLP tasks, such as MT (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and named entity recognition (Passos et al., 2014). In this work, be-side using word vector representations to measure the similarity between translated Twitter phrases and the description of medical concepts, we use the similarity between word vector representations of the original Twitter phrase and the descrip-tion of a medical concept to augment the adapted phrase-based MT technique. We discuss our adaptation of phrase-based MT for medical text normalisation in Section 3.1. Sec-tion 3.2 introduces our proposed approach for combining similarity score of word vector repre-sentations with the adapted phrase-based MT tech-nique. 3.1 Adapting Phrase-based MT We aim to learn a translation between a Twitter phrase (i.e. a phrase from a Twitter message) and a formal medical phrase (i.e. the description of a medical concept). For a given Twitter phrase phr t , we find a suitable medical phrase phr m using a translation score , based on a phrase-based model, as follows: where p ( phr m | phr t ) can be calculated using any phrase-based MT technique, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). We then rank trans-lated phrases phr m based on this translation score. The top-k translated phrases are used for identify-ing the corresponding medical concept.

However, the translated phrase phr m may not be exactly matched with the description of any target medical concepts. We propose two tech-niques to deal with this problem. For the first technique, we rank the target concepts based on the cosine similarity between the vector represen-tation of phr m and the vector representation of the description of each concept desc c : where V phr tations of phr m and desc c , respectively. Any technique for creating word vector representations (e.g. one-hot, CBOW and GloVe) can be used. Note that if a phrase (e.g. phr m ) contains several terms, we create a vector representation by sum-ming the value of the same dimension of the vec-tor representation of each word (i.e. element-wise addition).

On the other hand, the second technique also incorporates the ranked position r of the trans-lated phrase phr m when translated from the orig-inal phrase phr t using Equation (1). Indeed, the second technique calculates the similarity score as follows: 3.2 Combining Similarity Score with As discussed in Section 2, word vector represen-tations (e.g. created by CBOW or GloVe) can cap-ture semantic similarity between words by itself. Hence, we propose to map a Twitter phrase phr t to a medical concept c , which is represented with a description desc c , by linearly combining the co-sine similarity, between vector representations of the Twitter phrase phr t and the description desc c , with the similarity score computed using one of the adapted phrased-based MT techniques (intro-duced in Section 3.1), as follows: where M T a ( phr t , desc c ) is calculated using one of the adapted phrase-based MT techniques de-scribed in Section 3.1. To evaluate our approach, we use a collection of 25 million tweets related to adverse drug reac-tions (ADRs), from cognitive enhancers (Hanson et al., 2013) and anti-depressants (Schneeweiss et al., 2010). These tweets were collected using the of a particular set of drugs that can have adverse reactions to the patients. Note that terms regard-ing adverse drug reaction (e.g. insomnia) were not used for capturing tweets. From this collec-tion, we use 201 ADR phrases and their corre-sponding SNOMED-CT concepts annotated by a PhD-level computational linguist. These phrases were anonymised by replacing numbers, user IDs, URIs, locations, email addresses, dates and drug names with appropriate tokens e.g. NUMBER . 4.2 Evaluation Approach We conduct experiments using 10-fold cross val-idation, where the Twitter phrases are randomly divided into 10 separated folds. We address this task as a ranking task, where we aim to rank the medical concept with the highest similarity score, e.g. calculated using Equation (2), at the top rank. Hence, we evaluate our approach using Mean Re-ciprocal Rank (MRR) measure (Craswell, 2009), which is an information retrieval measure based on the user model where the user wants to see only one relevant concept. In particular, MRR is based on the the reciprocal of the rank at which the first relevant concept is viewed in the rank-ing (e.g. MRR = 0.5 if the first mapped concept is wrong but the second is correct). We limit our evaluation at top 5 of the ranking (i.e. MRR-5). In addition, we compare the significant difference be-tween the performance achieved by our proposed approach and the baselines using the paired t-test ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ). 4.3 Word Vector Representation We use three different techniques, including one-hot, CBOW and GloVe, to create word vector representations used in our approach (see Sec-tion 3). In particular, the vocabulary for creating the one-hot representation includes all terms in the Twitter phrases and the descriptions of the target SNOMED-CT concepts. Meanwhile, we create word vector representations based on CBOW and mentations. We learn the vector representations from the collections of tweets and medical arti-cles, respectively, using window size of 10 words. The tweet collection (denoted Twitter ) contains 419,702,147 English tweets, which are related to 11 drug names and 6 cities, while the medical ar-ticle collection (denoted BMC ) includes all med-CBOW and GloVe, we create vector representa-tions with vector sizes 50 and 200, respectively. 4.4 Learning Phrase-based Model We use the phrase-based MT technique of Koehn et al. (2003), as implemented in the Moses to learn to translate from the Twitter language to the medical language. In particular, when train-ing the translator, we show the learner pairs of the Twitter phrases and descriptions of the corre-sponding SNOMED-CT concepts. We evaluate 6 different instantiations of the pro-posed approach discussed in Section 3, including: 1. bestMT : set k = 1 , when finding the trans-2. top5MT : similar to bestMT , but set k = 5 . 3. top5MTr : similar to top5MT , but also con-4. bestMT+vSim : incorporate with the ranking 5. top5MT+vSim : similar to bestMT+vSim , but 6. top5MTr+vSim : similar to bestMT+vSim , but Another baseline is vSim , where we consider only the cosine similarity between the vector represen-tations of the Twitter phrase phr t and the descrip-tion desc c of target medical concepts.

Table 2 compares the performance of these 6 instantiations and the vSim baseline in terms of MRR-5. We firstly observe that for the vSim base-line, excepting for word vector representation with vector size 50 learned using GloVe from the Twit-ter collection, word vector representations learned using either CBOW or GloVe are more effective than the one-hot representation. However, the dif-ference between the MRR-5 performance is not statistically significant ( p &gt; 0 . 05 , paired t-test). In addition, word vector representations learned ei-ther using CBOW or GloVe with vector size 200 is more effective than those with vector size 50.
Next, we find that our adaptation of phrase-based MT (i.e. bestMT , top5MT and top5MTr ) sig-nificantly ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ) outperforms the vSim base-line. For example, with the one-hot representation, top5MT (MRR-5 0.2491) and top5MTr (MRR-5 0.2458) perform significantly ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ) better than vSim (MRR-5 0.1675) by up to 49%. Mean-while, when using word vector representations with the vector size 200 learned using GloVe from the BMC collection, top5MT (MRR-5 0.2638) sig-nificantly ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ) outperforms vSim with either the GloVe vector representation (MRR-5 0.1869) or the one-hot representation (MRR-5 0.1675). We observe the similar trends in performance when using vector representations learned from the Twitter collection. These results show that our adapted phrase-based MT techniques are effective for the medical term normalisation task.

In addition, we observe the effectiveness of our combined approach (i.e. bestMT+vSim , top5MT+vSim and top5MTr+vSim ), as it further improves the performance of the adapted phrase-based MT (i.e. bestMT , top5MT and top5MTr , re-spectively), when using the one-hot representa-tion. For example, top5MTr+vSim achieves the MRR-5 of 0.2594, while the MRR-5 of top5MTr is 0.2458. However, the performance difference is not statistically significant. Meanwhile, when us-ing the CBOW and GloVe vectors, the achieved performance is varied based on the collection (i.e. BMC or Twitter) used for learning the vectors and the size of the vectors. We have introduced our approach that adapts a phrase-based MT technique to normalise medical terms in Twitter messages. We evaluate our pro-posed approach using a collection of phrases from tweets related to ADRs. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly out-performs an effective baseline by up to 55%. For future work, we aim to investigate the modelling of learned vector representation, such as CBOW and GloVe, within a phrase-based MT model when normalising medical terms.
