 The most common way of framing the search problem is as an exchange between a user and a database, where the user issues queries and the data base replies with results that satisfy constraints imposed by the query but that also optimize some notion of relevance. There are several variations to this basic model that augment the dial ogue between humans and machines through query refinement, relevance feedback, a nd other mechanism. However, rare ly is this problem ever posed in a way in which the properties of the client and server are fundamentally different and in a way in which exploiting the differences can be used to yield substantially different experiences. I propose a reframing of the basic search problem which presupposes that servers are scalable on most dimensions but su ffer from low communication latencies while clients have lower scalability but support vastly richer user interactions beca use of lower communication latencies. Framed in this manner, there is clear utility in refactoring the search problem so that user interactions are processed fluidly by a client while the server is re legated to pre-computing the properties of a result set that cannot be efficiently left to the client. I will demonstrate Pivot , an experimental client application that allows the user to visually interact with thousands of search results at once, while using facetted-based expl oration in a zoomable interface. I will argue that the evolving struct ure of the Web will tend to push all IR-based applications in a similar direct ion, which has the algorithmic intelligence increasingly split between clients and servers. Put another way, my claim is that future client s will be neither thin nor dumb.
