 This demonstration presents an XML IR system that allows users to give feedback of different granularities and types, using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence to compute ex-panded and reweighted queries.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Relevance feedback Algorithms relevance feedback, XML IR, dempster shafer theory Relevance Feedback is an important way to enhance retrieval quality by integrating relevance information provided by a user. In XML retrieval, existing feedback engines usually generate an expanded keyword query from the content of el-ements marked as relevant or nonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IR completely ignores the semistructured nature of XML.

The system presented in this demonstration exploits ad-vanced user feedback beyond simple per-result feedback. In-stead of supplying a single relevance value for a complete result element, the user may give feedback with different granularities and types. For example, the user may like a section in an article for content, but dislike the entire ar-ticle for structure and also dislike a specific paragraph for content within the good section. We maintain a pool of possible query refinements (i.e., reweighing, adding or re-moving terms, structural constraints, or ontological expan-sions). Following earlier work by Ruthven and Lalmas [1] for text retrieval, we combine for each possible refinement candidate the relevance value for the result as delivered by the search engine, the initial weight of the candidate and the user feedback (with tunable weights according to granularity and type) using the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence [2]. We then use the Transferable Belief Model [3] to compute,
