 The aim of this research is to understand collaborative work practices in global software development companies with a special emphasis on knowledge cr eation in global software development (GSD) teams. The research is based on a work place study of a Danish software company working with a Philippine offshore department. So far I ha ve found that miscommunication and misunderstandings between the Danish and the Philippine developers in the project are partly grounded in different social worlds. Next step is to investig ate the role of knowledge creation and describe in further detail how these misunderstandings occur in the everyday work practice.

 Human Factors Global software development (GSD), work practice, work place study My research is situated within the field of Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and the initial research question was  X  How can we understand the complications of knowledge creation in collaborative work practices of global software development?  X  This research question is described in fairly broad terms to allow an inductive research approach where the data material can shape my research. This study is part of an overall research project called  X  X SD -Next Generation Technology for Global Software Development X . The project seeks to develop next generation technologies  X  infrastructure, tools, and methods  X  that bridge geographical, Development. The research is relevant for the field of CSCW because it aims at describing specific cooperative practices in GSD and identify interesting areas of research in order to develop guidelines and new designs to alleviate the cost and effort involved in coordinating the work, which have recently been described by other researchers[1, 2]. This research is based on a work place Our recent research [8] describes how differences in social worlds [9] between geographically distributed developers become salient in their everyday interactions. We focused on communication breakdowns that occurred in the collaboration between the Danes and the Philippines. The challenge arises from the fact that GlobalSoft primarily have Danish clients from both the private and public sector. The initial negotiations of the scope and specific requirements of the project are handled by the Danish side of GlobalSoft together with the client with little or no involvement from the outsourcing partners. When the initial scope of the project is defined, the project is spilt into different tasks outsourcing department. Our initial data analysis suggests that taken-for-granted knowledge and context based info rmation is not easily conveyed across geographical distance. We argue that misinterpretations and misunderstandings often is a re sult of differences in social worlds. A Danish project manager in the GSD Company illustrates the current situation: Advanced Project Manager:  X  X e tell them that there is something called retirement wage and a retirement age and it will begin at the age of 62 or something like that and then we have the Interviewer :  X  X s it not just 62 and 64 that are the central numbers? X  Advanced Project Manager:  X  X es, it is  X  X ust X . Would you...you are welcome. That is this issu e with words such as  X  X ust X  and  X  X imply X  and in combination it is even worse. It requires a firm understanding. X  Advanced Project Manager The advanced project manager in the above quote is talking about how complex it is to communicate specific details in the project. In this case we talk about Danish pension systems and how it is not just about the numbers, but that it requires a more firm understanding of the context in or der to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretation. By an alysing both interviews and observations we identified two types of situations where social worlds become salient in the everyday interactions between developers working at different geographical locations: 1) the divergence of concept and meaning and 2) the convergence of concept but divergence of meaning. We have argued that these situations are grounded in social worlds and pose a challenge to work practices in the form of miscommunications and misinterpretations of shared tasks in GSD. These results have been presented to the project team and they more or less agree with these initial findings. My next step is to describe in further detail how these misunderstandings occur and conceptualize new processes or tools to facilitate knowledge creation instead of the current paradigm of knowledge transfer that seems to exist in the company. The notion of knowledge creation draws on the idea that knowledge is not a thing that can be transferred between individuals. Orlikowski (2002) proposes  X  that knowing is not a static embedded capability or stable disposition of actors, but
