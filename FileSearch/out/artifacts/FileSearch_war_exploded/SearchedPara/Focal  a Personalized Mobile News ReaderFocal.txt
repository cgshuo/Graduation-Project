 Traditionally in mobile apps, news articles and recommen-dations are presented to the users as an ordered list. This ordering often reflects the freshness of the stories. Although most users are satisfied with such presentation, some users have different expectations and want to read stories related to some specific topics.

In this demo, we depart from the classic list-view layout and aim at exploring other ways to present news stories to the users. We introduce Focal , a personalized mobile news reader, which implements a fisheye-inspired interface. We briefly describe its system architecture and interface.

The proliferation of online news creates a need for filtering interesting articles. Most mobile news apps present to the users articles and their associated recommendations as an ordered list. The ordering often reflects one dimension of the articles such as the freshness. However, news articles have more than one dimension like popularity or relevance [3].
Although most users are satisfied with such presentation, some users have different expectations and want to read news that are either popular, or related to some specific topics. It is thus desirable to have a single interface that captures all these dimensions at a glance [6].

A list-view interface constrains the users into extensive scrolling while browsing the list. In addition, items at the bottom have a smaller chance of being clicked [1]. As a re-sult, researchers have looked at the issue of visualization of
Figure 1 gives a brief overview of the main components interacting with Focal. When a user clicks on a news story, Focal sends the click to the PEN recsys framework [4]. The PEN recsys framework will assign randomly a recommender system and provide recommendations. It has a set of imple-mented recommender algorithms which are designed to take into account one or many dimensions of the news domain. For instance, a content-based recommender will only take into account the relevance between stories, while others rec-ommend only the most popular articles. The PEN recsys framework also periodically gets the latest stories from the newspaper website. This architecture is very flexible and can be adapted to multiple news sources.
Figure 2(a) shows Focal X  X  main panel. The user can easily recognize the 3 dimensions of a story: freshness, popularity and relevance.
 Freshness is illustrated as the transparency of the node. When a node is very transparent, the associated story is old. Popularity is modelled as the size of the node. A large node represents a very popular story. Relevance is designed as the thickness of the edges between two articles. When an edge is very thick, the two associated stories have a high relevance.
A picture may not always be representative of the topic of a story. Thus, it is possible to slide the graph to the right or left such that story titles will appear (see Figure 2(b)). Finally, the user can double-tap on the node or tap on the read button to access the reading panel (Figure 2(c)). The more button moves the selected story to the central node and generates new recommendations. That way, the user moves the focus to another region of the news graph. Hence, a user
