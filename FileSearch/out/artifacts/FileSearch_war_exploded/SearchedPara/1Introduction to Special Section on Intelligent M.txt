 Advances in wireless communication mobile-information infrastructures such as GPS, WiFi, and mobile phone technologies have enabled us to collect, process, and manage massive amounts of mobile data from diverse information sources. These mobile data are fine-grained, information-rich, and provide unparalleled opportunities for us to un-derstand mobile user behaviours and generate useful knowledge, which in turn allows the delivery of intelligence for real-time decision making in various real-world appli-cations. In this context, knowledge discovery is the process of automatic extraction of interesting and useful knowledge from large amounts of mobile data, whereas knowl-edge management consists of a range of strategies and practices to identify, create, represent, distribute, and enable the adoption of novel insights and experiences for decision making. There is a critical emerging need to investigate knowledge discovery and management issues in the mobile context.
 The objective of this special section on Intelligent Mobile Knowledge Discovery and Management Systems is to bring together top-quality articles on the art and practice of mobile knowledge discovery and management systems that exhibit a level of intelli-gence. We received a total of 12 submissions from which 3 articles have been selected for publication after an extensive peer-review process.
 The first article, entitled  X  X ining Geographic-Temporal-Semantic Patterns in Trajectories for Location Prediction X  by Ying et al., has a focus on location predic-tion by mining human location traces. A unique perspective of this article is to exploit a user X  X  geographic, temporal, and semantic information simultaneously for estimat-ing the probability of a traveler in visiting a location. The key idea underlying this study is the discovery of user trajectory patterns, which are used to capture frequent movements triggered by the user X  X  geographic, temporal, and semantic intentions. The article  X  X  Framework of Traveling Companion Discovery on Trajectory Data Streams X  by Tang et al. studies the problem of discovering object groups which travel together (i.e., traveling companions) from trajectory data streams. Since the solution of this problem requires a large computational cost because of expensive spatial oper-ations, the authors propose a smart data structure to facilitate scalable and flexible companion discovery from location traces.
 The article  X  X ondrian Tree: A Fast Index for Spatial Alarm Processing X  authored by M. Doo and L. Liu promotes the efficient process of spatial alarms, which remind us of the arrival of a future spatial event. A key research challenge in scaling spatial alarm processing is how to efficiently compute alarm-free regions and alarm-free periods so that people can identify relevant spatial alarms and whether they are in an alarm-free region more efficiently. To this end, the article presents a region partitioning tree, named Mondrian Tree, for indexing both spatial alarms and alarm-free regions. This tree can help to efficiently search for spatial alarms.

We would like to acknowledge the authors of the submitted articles and the reviewers who actively collaborated in reaching the careful selection of articles in this section. In addition, we would like to thank the Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Qiang Yang, for his help and strong support on this special section!
