 1. Introduction
It is time consuming and laborious for individuals to detect a new event and track news articles reporting et al., 2004 ).

Time information has been used in TDT. Based on the observation that articles reporting on a particular automatically extract time information embedded in news article text and use it in determining whether the event described in an article refers to the event being tracked ( Kim et al., 2004; Mani et al., 2000 ). tested extensively for usefulness in TDT. Possible reasons are:
Time information such as publication dates is easily available from news articles, but place information needs to be extracted from news article text.

Time information is one-dimensional and thus relatively easy to represent and compare, but place informa-mation is represented in a hierarchical way, for example, we should consider not only a parent X  X hild relationship (e.g., Korea X  X eoul) but also a sibling relationship (Seoul X  X ncheon).
Compared to time information processing, place names seem to be more difficult to process because of the variety of expressions and ambiguities (e.g., Washington can be a person name or a state name, and there are several places with the name Rome in world geography).

Since our current work focuses on the use of place information for TDT, not on the techniques for extract-made use of some portal sites, such as Naver, 1 Paran 2 and ESRI. name information, such as hierarchical information and/or location on a map for a given place name. This service is useful for determining the spatial relationship between two place names. a new article, we can increase the chance of associating a place name with an event. In sum, the contributions made in the research are as follows: We analyzed news articles to find important characteristics of how place information is used. We developed a novel event tracking method that incorporates the characteristics of place information.
We demonstrated the value of place information in event tracking. 2. Related work
Research on distinguishing place and organization names as part of named entity recognition was reported in Message Understanding Conference (MUC)-6 ( Sundheim et al., 1995 ). With the goal of better utilizing 2004 ). Categorization of place names helps determining whether two names refer to the same location. For in the state of New York X  X  and  X  X  X he accident in Geneva X  X  may be considered the same event with a detailed place name tagging.

A few papers addressed the issue of using place information to improve effectiveness of TDT. Smith (2002) used place information for tracking similar historical events in unstructured history documents, not news paper articles. Documents containing the same dates and places, which were identified by named entity rec-the four types. The similarity between two documents was computed based on four vectors that were treated names were used as element of the vector. 3.

Concentration on a short time window mation is used ( Allan, 2000, 2002; Juha et al., 2004 ), it can be used when place names are used for TDT because a place name for an event also tends to be concentrated within the time window.

 appear within three month and even six month windows. Given that 67% of the events are  X  X  X ong-term X  X , a tracking system needs features other than time to decide whether two articles report on the same event. 3.2. Decreasing levels of detail
We observed that descriptions of place names tend to be maximally precise at the time of the event and become simpler often at a higher level of abstraction. For example,  X  X  X ire on A Street, Albany, New York X  X  abstraction) at a later time.
 of place names; 23% use partial or simpler descriptions and 8% have no place names.
In order to take advantage of this tendency, we should be able to form an equivalence class of place names event because the street names conflict each other in the same city. 3.3. Locations of place names It was observed that a majority of place names for the main event occur at the beginning of news articles. described in the article.

Fig. 3 depicts the tendency described above. As shown in the graph, the majority of place names occur at the beginning of articles. This tendency becomes useful information when we develop an algorithm for han-ning part of an article would be more likely to be related to the main event of the article. 3.4. The number of place names in an article
The number of place name occurrences in an article is an indication of whether the article describes an without making references to other places.
 4. Topic tracking using place names names were identified, extracted, and canonicalized, and then explain how place name-based similarity was computed between a target class and a news article. Finally, we show how the total score was computed between a class and a news article. 4.1. Place name extraction
Place names are not always extractable unambiguously because a word or phrase can be a place name, organization name, or a person name depending on the contexts. For example,  X  X  X ashington X  X  in English tical to verb stems, making it even more difficult to recognize them. For example, (Booyuh), a city name, can be the stem of a verb, (Booyuh X  X ada) although their meanings are not related at all.
For Korean text, we used the named entity recognizer (NER) ( Lee &amp; Lee, 2004 ) borrowed from ETRI to automatically extract place names from Korean news papers. This NER is a hybrid system combining both pattern rules and statistical techniques, with the following 13 place name tags: COUNTRY, PROVINCE, CITY, CAPITALCITY, COUNTY, CONTINENT, MOUNTAIN, OCEAN, RIVER, ISLAND, TOPOG-
RAPHY, CANYON, and BAY. The NER tagger accepts a news article and tags each place name with one of the 13 place names. The performance of the NER tagger was known to be 81.8% in F -measure.
For English text, place name recognition was done with MITRE X  X  Alembic-workbench. the tagging standard of MUC-5 and MUC-6 to produce named entity tags in XML. In this tool, person, place, and organization names are tagged as well as time information, with 85.2% accuracy in F -measure ( David et al., 1997 ). Compared to the Korean NER tagger, place name tags are not so specific? 4.2. Canonicalization and place hierarchy
Once place names are recognized and tagged with the labels, at least two problems need to be handled a Korean news article, for example, (Gabokdong) is used as the name of the specific place for an acci-dent, but (Goonsan city), the name of the city that covers the specific place, may be used in a later
The second issue is related with abbreviated form of place names, which are used when a place name is mentioned multiple times or referred to in a later article for a known event. For example, a province name person names (e.g., Mike for Michael). We call this process as canonicalization.
 information about the place such as restaurants, motels, banks, etc.

Basically, the same methodology was employed for canonicalization of English place names. We used the the site, and the HTML pages returned results were parsed to obtain the necessary information. 4.3. Similarity calculation using place names 4.3.1. Similarity based on a place name hierarchy attempt to compute the degree to which a place name appearing in a news article matches the target place name. The computation specified below can be seen as measuring semantic distance between two nodes in n document, is defined as is  X  X  X  Street in Albany, New York, X  X  n t = X  X  D Street  X  X ,  X  X  Albany  X  X ,  X  X  New York  X  X  whereas n place name in a new article is  X  X  X lbany X  X . The similarity between n value. It should be noted that  X  X  X onflict X  X  means similarity becomes zero if n 4.3.2. Using the position of place names the degree of certainty that a place name refers to the main event in an article as follows: where j d j is the number of sentences in the news article where the place name appears and Pos( n tence, for example, Pos( n d ) is 0 and Loc( n d ) becomes the maximum value being 1. 4.3.3. Calculating coherence of place names
We discriminate against a news article containing many place names that seem to suggest that it does not where article, we used 0.5 as the constant value based on preliminary analysis. 4.4. Combining three features
Given an event description and an article, evidence gathered from the hierarchical information, position name similarity with hierarchical information is the most crucial for matching, we use it as the basis and try to adjust it with the two feature values to compute the final similarity value Sim ristics we used: the event being described. 4.5. Final similarity
The final similarity value between a given event category and a news article can be obtained by combining the content similarity, Sim content , and place based similarity, Sim processed with the standard indexing method including stemming, removal of stop words, and TFIDF to com-pute the weights of terms. Details are described below. 4.6. Baseline system event-representing news article t and an incoming news article d sure (Formula (4) ) based on TF * IDF with Okapi X  X  weighting scheme (Formula (5) )( Robertson, Walker, Jones, Hancock-Beaulieu, &amp; Gaford, 1995 ): where tf : term frequency in the document; df : the number of documents containing the term;
N : the number of documents in the collection; docLength: term length of the document; avgDocLength: the average document length in the collection.
 used. 5. Evaluation with Korean news articles using 110,000 Korean news articles published in 2002 by Chosunilbo, which has the largest number of sub-scribers in Korea.

Among the 70 topics constructed for this collection, we selected 20 that include place names and use them articles. Table 1 shows a sample of the event topics and the number of  X  X  X nswer X  X  documents. 5.1. Evaluation of place name feature
Before we finalize our event tracking system with explicit place information, we tested the efficiency of would help us finalize our method of combining pieces of evidence coming from different aspects of place information and test our initial hypotheses based on the characteristics of place names in news articles. implemented the method used in Juha et al. (2004) to validate our approaches. Following are all the cases compared: -Baseline: event tracking based on topical content only, -Case A: baseline + use of hierarchical information of place names, -Case B: baseline + position of place names, -Case C: baseline + coherence of place names, -CaseD:A+B+C, -Case E: the method in Juha et al. (2004) .

As shown in Table 2 , the results are promising in that each feature appears to make some contribution and ation when place information is used in combination with the content of articles. 5.2. Evaluation with place and time information
We ran experiments to investigate on the complementary aspects of place and time information. With two et al. (2004) , we investigated three different cases: Case 1: use of both place and time information (extracted from text), Case 2: use of publication dates (time information only), Case 3: use of both place information and publication dates, Case 4: use of both extracted time and publication dates (time information only), Case 5: use all the three kinds of information.
 more useful than the time information extracted from the news paper text. Comparing Case 2 and Case 3, adding place information improved effectiveness by about 2%, whereas the improvement from Case 4 to Case 5 shows a slightly less improvement. We feel that the amounts of improvement over the use of time informa-using all the three types of information as in Case 5, we obtained the best performance. This implies that although the improvements we get from individual sources may be small, their combination can make a sig-nificant improvement. 5.3. Success and failure analysis
As an effort to understand individual contributions to and/or failures of the place name features in performance increases, we analyzed their roles in some events. Biggest improvements were possible when the place information in the target events was clearly described, particularly with the hierarchical information. For instance, the improvement was more than 30% with the event containing  X  X   X  X , which includes the province, city, town, apartment, and the name of the mountain behind the apartment, as the place name.
 However, the event tracking task for some events was negatively influenced by our method as in Table 4 .
The first two below are the problems caused by place name ambiguities, and the third one is caused by the difficulty of even extracting place information: Similar events occurred in the same place
When two distinct events occurred in the same place, two articles describing them respectively should be separated and fallen into two different event categories. However, Place information makes two separate where the games took place is the same. As a result, a variety of news articles on Olympic Games would be incorrectly classified into a very specific event when the place names are given too big a weight.
The place name not specified or fixedAlthough two articles mention the same event, the place name found in the text may be too generic like  X  X   X  X  (North Korean Navy X  X  attack in the West articles with different names like NIT or Northern Boundary.

Unless such a complex noun is decomposed into simple nes) in the event title  X  X   X  X  (awards in Cannes Film Festival) is the place where the film festival name unless noun segmentation is done first. 6. Evaluation with English news articles For generalizability and extensibility of the proposed approach, we ran experiments using English corpus. facto standard test collection that has been used in TDT research.
 and TV news. Only six sources containing English documents were used for our experiments. Out of 64,527 grams). Table 5 shows some statistics of the test documents used for our experiments. of relevant documents is 2161.

In a TDT system, a target story can be correctly detected (labeled as  X  X  X orrect(+) X  X  below), or missed incorrectly ( X  X  X alse Alarm X  X ). The relationship of the four different categories is shown in Fig. 5 . 6.1. Baseline evaluation
Unless baseline performance is at a reasonable level, any improvement over the baseline acquired with a new method would be meaningless. In order to ensure that our baseline system performance is comparable with that of other state-of-art systems, we evaluated our system in terms of P described in Juha et al. (2004) is particularly meaningful because it uses both time and place information enough to proceed to test the proposed method using place information. 6.2. Evaluation of place information
The goals of the experiments using the English collection are basically the same as those with the Korean tion and then attempted to measure the improvement from explicitly using place information. The only dif-ference in the experimental setup is that the case E was not considered because the experimental design in Following are all the cases compared: -Baseline: event tracking based on topical content only, -Case A: baseline + use of hierarchical information of place names, -Case B: baseline + position of place names, -Case C: baseline + coherence of place names, -Case D: A + B + C.
 much as 14.5% in Case D where all the features are used together. One reason for the larger magnitude of improvement than that of the experiment with the Korean corpus is that English corpus contains many inter-national events that can be identified with a mention of the country name.
 experiments with the English corpus. The results in Table 8 show that the maximum performance (74.07) was obtained when both time and place information was used. Although the magnitude of the improvement over
Put differently, the time information was not helpful when place information was used. Our analysis shows making it unnecessary to use either place or time information.

Finally, we attempted to compare the performance of our approach with that of the previous one ( Juha error-rate based precision and recall, named P 1 and R 1 . Three different cases were compared: Case A: the approach in Juha et al. (2004) , Case B: our approach with place information, Case C: our approach with both time and place information.

As in Table 9 , use of place information alone gave a marginal improvement over the previous approach, but other words, there were more training documents for ( Juha et al., 2004 ) than our system. 7. Conclusion
We addressed the issues related to using place names extracted automatically from news paper articles in name occurrences such as their relative locations and coherence in a news article.
As an effort to measure the impact of using place information separately from time information used in our events where time information is not very critical in identifying an event.

Our limited qualitative analysis indicates that relative contributions of time and place information vary mation in computing similarity values depending on the nature of the events is the future work. References
