 In this poster we present a study of cross-media challenges for an organization that has recently moved from traditional newspaper production to production involving the integrated digital produc-tion of newspaper, TV, radio and web-news. The poster shows problems of integrating work pace and contents of the different media. In this poster we will focus on how the rhythms of different media work together and apart and how these rhythms can be supported by different coordinating and planning tools. K4.3. Organizational Impacts. H4.3. Communication applica-tions. Coordination artifacts, complex objects of work. At present, media companies worldwide are facing the challenge of cross-media production. Digitalization gives possibilities of synergy by simultaneously producing content for several media. This calls for new understandings of how to integrate different media work processes and a focus on artifacts that could ease the planning and coordination in this new structure. Our focus is on the organizational implementation of cross-media production and how it is supported through collaborative technol-ogy. In their study of editorial newspaper work, Forsberg &amp; Ljungberg [3] describe news as either news stories with short deadlines, or feature pages, with background articles and longer time span. They conclude that content, time and context are the most important factors of editorial work. The factors are connected to resources available, media types, external and internal time, physical and logical structures of the media. In spite of our focus on several media, this perspective is still relevant. However, the complexity has changed remarkably because of the increased number of media types. Belotti &amp; Rogers [2] analyze editorial work processes in a news-paper organization producing for both paper and web. Their focus is on www-publishing and their paper identifies six characteristics The transformation from newspaper to cross-media company was carried out by gathering the different media in the same building. Reporters from all media moved into the newspaper editorial building and the old building was restructured, introducing the Superdesk as a physical and organizational meeting place for all media. Two new roles were introduced: For each media, a media editor has the responsibility for filling the  X  X p ace X  of the particu-lar media. The media conductor maintains the general view and coordinates stories across media platforms. Physically the media editors and media conductor are pl aced in the Superdesk, and all reporters are placed thematically ar ound this (Figure 1). The Superdesk is round and allows all editors to work at their workstations while turning their backs to each other, or to face the meeting table in the middle. The formal meetings of the editorial staff take place ar ound this table. Our empirical data show:  X  Problems with the rhythm of the media, at times not  X  A hierarchy of media in the priority of production: 1.  X  Problems with planning and coordinating the many media Analytically we view the above stated three main tendencies as interrelated: The rhythms of the different media do not supplement each other well. This causes problems when planning and coordinating the process of work. Accordingly, reporters and editors turn to well-known procedures of work, i.e. the newspaper production rhythm. In our analysis we  X  compare the internal structures of each media: deadlines,
