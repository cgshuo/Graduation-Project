Preliminaries point t j ,in T . Let T ij and T kl be two intervals of T . T describe the amount of an event p during a time interval T time period.

A hot spot of an event p is a time interval T ij that has the highest discrepancy score. 3.1. Fuzzy set theory f : A  X  [0,1].

We de fi ne a basic topic p as a list of pairs, {( kw i , w which are the values of each w i  X  (0,1]. We require that the sum of all w the weight of that keyword is 1.

We use the function S kw ( p ) to obtain the set of keywords in the given topic p . Function Ex ( kw kw appears in the document d j ; if it exists, the function returns a 1, otherwise it returns a 0.

The presence measure of a complex topic is de fi ned similarly. Let Rt document set D . Then the presence measure of p over D is simply the sum of mb ( p , d Example 4.1 . Presence measure of basic and complex topics
Suppose the document set and topics are given as: D ={ a , b , c , d , e , f }, p ( congress ,0.5)}.
 Suppose Bill is contained by { a , b , d , f }, Clinton by { b , f }, and congress by { b , d , e } . For basic topics, we get:
So the presence measure of topic  X  Bill Clinton  X  is greater than the presence measure of topic When using Eqs. (7)  X  (9) , we get:
Hence, the presence measure of the topic p 1  X  p 2 is less than the presence measure of the topic p presence measure of p 1  X  p 2 .

We can use the presence measure of a topic on the document set m ( p , D ) to describe the degree of af 4.2. Computing the presence measure of a topic at a time point
To compute the presence measure of a topic in an interval, we time point of the interval. According to the de fi nition in the previous section, the related document set, Rt computed fi rst at each time point t using the set of documents appearing in that time point. In Rt documents in Rt p , D . point. Each keyword in the index points to a list containing the document IDs in which it appears. which we refer to as the membership list . Let doc  X  mbv denote a pair consisting of where each time point connects to a list of doc  X  mbv pairs. The doc presence measure of the basic topic at a time point is the sum of every mbv value in doc
A typical complex topic has the format of p = p h op p j , where p of subtopics p h and p j are available. For every time point t appears in the doc  X  mbv ( t i ) lists of both p j and p h membership values of d k from both lists, and the result are stored as the new membership value of d the complex topic p .If d k appears in only one list, the operation is applied to the membership value of d doc  X  mbv ( t i ) lists of p h and p j at each point, we have a new membership list for p with a doc 4.3. Computing the presence measure of a topic in a interval
The presence measure of a topic p in a interval T ij is the sum of its presence measure at each time point in T measure of a topic p in each interval can be computed as follows:
We fi rst compute the presence measure of p in each time point t these values in the mlist of p which stores the pairs ( i , m value of p at time point t i .

Based on the mlist , we build a list clist containing cumulative presence measure values. The i only those time points in the mlist with non-zero presence measures of the topic. Let fi rst element in clist is b 1, m 1 N , because cm 1 = m 1 . And cm time point, showing how the other elements are determined.

We use the clist to retrieve the value of presence measure of the topic in any interval T

For any time point that contains a zero presence measure of topic p but may contain some baseline value or m b  X  0, we call it the zero-presence-measure point. It is easy to show that it always can measure point as its starting or ending point.

Proof . For a given time interval T ij , it is assumed that time point i and the density of time period ( i 0 , j 0 ), m i 0 j 0 b score function, it is decreasing with b if m is fi xed, so ds ( m a zero-presence-measure point is higher or equal to those that do not, and so we can always with non-zero measure points.
