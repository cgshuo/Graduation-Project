 As part of the recent surge of research on large, complex networks, attention has been devoted to the computational analysis of complex networks [1-4]. Complex networks, such as social networks and biological networks, are all highly dynamic objects which grow and change quickly over time. These networks have a common feature, namely  X  X ommunity structure X . Communities, also known as clusters or modules, are groups of graph [5]. Finding community structure and clustering vertices in the complex network, Through the analysis of community structure, researchers have achieved a lot results, the main page; in [10, 11], Moody et al . identified the social organizations to evolve over time and so on. known, modularity optimization is able to find community structure in both unipartite and bipartite networks by the maximum or minimum eigenvalue separately. Then, some scientists have sought to detect the community in bipartite networks like Michael J. Barber [14]. BRIM proposed by Barber and his colleagues can determine the number of communities of a bipartite network. Furthermore, in [15], Barber and Clark use the label-propagation algorithm (LPA) for identifying network communities. However, [14, 15] can not be used without knowing the type of network. adopted frequently in finding community structures, in which vertices are grouped into communities that further are subdivided into smaller communities, and so forth, as in [12]. Clauset, Moore and Newman propose HRG [16] using the maximum likelihood methods perform remarkably in clear hierarchy network, but not so impressive under computational complexity. In 2009, Roger Guimera and Marta Sales-Pardo proposed a stochastic block model [17] based on HRG. Different from traditional concept which divide network by principle of  X  X nside connection dense outside sparse X , in [17], the probability that two vertices are connected depends on the blocks to which they belong. probability is not accurate. Recently, Karrer and Newman [18] also proposed a stochastic block model which considers the variation in vertex degree. This stochastic block model solves the heterogeneous vertex degrees problem and got a better result networks, but different types of networks should be dealt with separately none the less. example, when we know the interaction of vertex in the protein network, we may have no knowledge of the network structure type. Moreover, when we get a network which consists of people X  X  relationships in schools, the type of network may not be sure. It is network; or if links exist between students and teachers, the network will be a bipartite one. An effective method used for finding community structure in both unipartite and bipartite networks is needed. different types of the network structure. Unipartite networks assume that connections between the vertices in same community are dense, and between the communities are sparse, such as Social network [19], biochemical network [20] and information network networks [23], plant-animal mutualistic networks [24], scientific publication networks [25], etc. Although the properties of  X  X dges X  in the two types of networks are different, vertices in the same communities should be similar because vertices in same communities have similar properties. In this paper, we develop a uniform VSP model which is based on the vertex similarity. Therefore, the VSP model can be used in any model gets ideal result both by theoreti cal proof and experimental analysis. suitable for finding community structure. We present the VSP model and the method to group network into two communities in section 3. In section 4, we make the experiment VSP model is an accurate uniform model which can find community structure without prior knowledge of type of the network structure. Finally, we draw our conclusions. The concept of community informs that ver tices in the same community should share common properties no matter in unipartite or bipartite network. It means that vertices in the same community should be similar, although edges in different type of the network  X  X dges X  to  X  X ertices X  for finding communities. similarity, or other similarity types. It is a basic premise of research on networks that connects, so it is reasonable that meaningful structural similarity measures might exist [26]. In general, if two vertices have a number of common neighbors, we believe that vertices have similar properties and should be grouped in the same community. are directly connected to x via an edge. Then neighbors of x and y . Common neighbor index, Salton index, Jaccard index, Sorenson index, LHN (Leicht-Holme-Newman) index, and Adamic-Adar index [27-31] are five famous methods for vertex similarity. Many researchers have analyzed and compared measurement  X  X ommon neighbor index X  performs surprisingly well. We use  X  X ommon neighbor index X  to measure the vertex similarity in our VSP model. common neighbor of pair( x, y ). inside a community are the more common neighbors they have. The number of common neighbors 
The sum of common neighbors with vertices in same communities in N is given by given by community is to get max( ) the network R is given by If there is an edge joining vertices i and j , 1 vector of A , so as A can be rewritten as [] A = vertex k is a common neighbor of vertices i and j . Therefore when i and j are two different vertices. As i k  X = ii aa , matrix N is where To analyze the relationship between a vertex x and common neighbor index, we define the function as a common neighbor degree index, denoted as ckk = X  . Therefore, neighbors in same communities plus the number of common neighbors different communities, R also can be written as structure is suitable in both unipartite networks and bipartite networks. 2.1 Common Neighbor Index in Unipartite Network different communities is
The task is to minimize there are 1 are almost in the same community. As a result, for i , most of its neighbor should be in the same community with i except j (if j is a neighbor of i ). As shown in Fig. 1. number of common neighbors with pairs of vertices in different communities is 
A is symmetric which allows us to rewrite Eq.(2) as If there is an edge between i and j , kk + X  X  X  , we consider getting min( ) basic principles of the unipartite network community detection. 2.2 Common Neighbor Index in Bipartite Network communities are sparse, outside are dense X . The task is to maximize For a pair of vertices which are in the same community, the common neighbor should be in a different community, as shown in Fig. 2. have 2 be counted (2)
A is symmetric which allows us to rewrite Eq.(4) as means getting max( ) with the basic principles of the bipartite network community detection. networks. Newman et al. proved that a good division of a network in to communities  X  X n which the number of edges inside groups is bigger than expected X . It can get a better result than the measures based on pure numbers of edges between communities. Similarly, a common neighbors within communities is bigger than expected. Let stronger community structure. We build a random network in which vertices have same expected number of common neighbors as the number in the random network. In section 2, we have proved that common neighbor index can be used to find network. The probability of a random vertex to be a common neighbor of a particular of a random vertex to be a common neighbor of two vertices are independent on each and neighbor degrees, where the functions must be the same since fc Cc = for some constant C, complex network, 
The VSP model can be written, 
Thus, Let 
B is the VSP matrix, and same community. It can be applied to both unipartite networks and bipartite networks without knowing the exact type of network structure in advance. It is more flexible than the previous methods which deal with the gr ouping separately according to the type of the network structure. studied by Lusseau et al . [35]. The bipartite networks show the interactions of women Interlock in early twentieth century [37]. accuracy of the VSP model by directly comparing with the known communities. We take use of the normalized mutual information I normn [38] for the comparison. When the independent of the real ones, we have I norm = 0. Modularity model, where Q is the edges within communities minus expected number of such edges, written as Q-Modularity ; and I norm . 4.1 Finding Community Structure in Unipartite Network model maximizes Q-VSP to find the community structure, while the Modularity model maximizes Q-Modularity . this network represent 62 bottlenose dolphins living in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, with social ties between dolphin pairs established by direct observation over a period of several years. It is used a lot in communi ty detection because the dolphin group split into two smaller subgroups following the departure of the population. Fig.3 shows the clustering results using the VSP model and the Modularity model respectively. three red vertices are grouped into the gr een community in the Modularity model. I norm close to 1. Properties of the dolphin social network are shown in Table.1. It shows that two properties of VSP model are better than the Modularity model in this unipartite network. Q-Modularity of the VSP model is 0.381 which is approximately equal to the one of the Modularity model. The VSP model performs well in unipartite networks. The dotted curve represents the division of the Modularity model.
 4.2 Finding Community Structu re in Bipartite Network In a bipartite network, the VSP model also maximizes Q-VSP to find the community structure, the Modularity model minimizes Q-Modularity , which is contrary to in the unipartite network. events constitute a bipartite network; and an edge exists between a woman and a social event if the woman was in attendance at the event. We use this network here to group it into two communities, shown in Fig.4. It shows that the VSP model groups the network accurately into two communities of  X  X omen X  and  X  X vents X . because the southern women network is a bipartite network. firm. The data set includes only those board members who held multiple directorships, totaling 136 individuals. Unlike the Southern women network, the Scotland corporate interlock is not connected. We got the division of one community with 102 vertices and the other with 142 vertices when Q-VSP is the maximum value. Edges outside communities should be large; Q-Modularity should be small; I norm close properties of the VSP model are better than the Modularity model. It proves that the VSP model also finds community structure accurately in bipartite networks. community structure only with the topology of the network, even when we have no idea of the type of the network structure. In this paper, we define a VSP model for finding the community structure in complex networks. The VSP model is based on the vertex similarity using the common neighbor similarity methods in complex network, it is applied to the VSP model to measure the vertex similarity. We prove that calculating the common neighbor inside communities network. Then we give the expectation of the common neighbor between any two network, Southern women event network and Scotland corporate interlock network structure without the need of the network structure type.
