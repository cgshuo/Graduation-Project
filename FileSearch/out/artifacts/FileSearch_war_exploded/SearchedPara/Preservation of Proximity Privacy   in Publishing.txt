 The information age has witnessed a tremendous growth of personal data that can be collected and analyzed, including a great deal of released microdata (i.e. data in raw, non-aggregated format) [12].These released microdata offer significant advantages in terms of information availability, which is particularly suitable for ad hoc analysis in a variety of domains, such as medical research. 
However, the publication of microdata lead s to the concerns of individual private information. For example, the medical ins titute and its cooperative organization need example. One straightforward approach to achie ve this is to exclude unique identifier leakage under linking-attack [1-3]. Suppose the attacker has known about Andy with attribute values &lt;age=5, sex=M, zip=12k&gt;, then according to Table 1, s/he can deduce Andy X  X  disease, which is pneumonia. Such combination of Age, Zipcode and Sex can be potentially used to identify an individual in Table 1 and is called a quasi-identifier (QI for short) in literatures. 
To avoid linking attack, numerous approaches have been proposed. Generalization semantically consistent values X  Achieving k-anonymity privacy protection using the method of L. Sweeney [1]. Consequently, more records will have the same set of QI-values, in which are indistinguishable from each other. For example, Table 2 is 3-anonymized by generalizing QI-values in Table 1. Age=5, Zipcode=12k and Sex =M of Andy have been replaced with intervals [5-9], [12 k -18 k ] and M respectively. Clear-projection on the quasi-identifier as QI-Group. 1.1 Motivation Recently, there are many works to address the problem of privacy preserving data publishing. However, most of them ignore the case that there may exist semantically proximity for sensitive categorical data. For example, an adversary possessing the QI-values of Andy is able to find out that Andy X  X  record is in the first QI-group of Table 2. Without further information, assume that each tuple in the group has an equal chance of being owned by an adversary, s/he can conclude that Andy suffers from some respiratory infection disease with 2/3 probability. 
The existing anonymization principles fall short of solving such proximity privacy leakage in our setting, which is a privacy threat specific to categorical sensitive attribute (i.e. pneumonia in Table 2). To address the issue, this paper proposes a new anonymization principle termed as m-Color constraint. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The previously related work is re-viewed in Section 2. Section 3 clarifies the basic concepts and problem definition. Section 4 discusses the properties of m-Color constraint, and Section 5 elaborates the generalization algorithm. In Section 6, we experimentally evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our techniques. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 7. In this section, previous related work will be surveyed. All the privacy-preserving transformation of the microdata is referred to as recoding, which can be classified into two classes of models: global recoding and local recoding[11,16]. In global recoding, a particular detailed value must be mapped to the same generalized value in all records. Local recoding allows the same detailed values being mapped to different generalized values of different QI-groups. Obviously, global recoding is a more spe-cial case of local recoding. Efficient gr eedy solutions following certain heuristics have been proposed [7],[9],[11],[15] to obtain a near optimal solution. Incognito [8] provides a practical framework for implementing full-domain generalization, borrow-ing ideas from frequent item set mining, while Mondrian [9] takes a partitioning ap-proach reminiscent of kd -trees. To achieve k -anonymity, Ghinita [16] presents a framework mapping the multi-dimensional quasi-identifiers to 1-Dimensional(1-D) used for anonymization [17]. The idea of non-homogeneous generalization was first introduced in k -anonymization revisited [18], which studies techniques with a guaran-but suffer additional types of attack. Authors of paper [19] proposed a randomization method that prevents such type of attack and showed that k -anonymity is not com-promised by the attack, but its partitioning algorithm is only a special of the top-down algorithm presented in [11]. However, in our algorithm, we mainly discuss privacy preservation of categorical sensitive attributes over m-Color constraint. Let T be a microdata table that contains the private information of a set of individuals. several subsets G i (1  X  i  X  k ) of T , such that each tuple in T belongs to exactly one sub-Definition 1.

In reality, an attacker with sufficient background knowledge [10] may be able to deduce a concrete QI-group. Assume that adversary deduce the sensitive attribute record appears in the first QI-group of Table 2, an adversary derives P[ X = s ] = 1/3, where X models the disease of Andy, and s can be any disease (i.e., Pneumonia, Pul-monary embolism, Flu) in that group. 3.1 Problem Definition In our anonymization framework, we present a new anonymization method, which eliminates proximity privacy leakage in publishing categorical sensitive attributes. In trees. We simply divide these diseases into four classes, and color each class with red, black. disease but take colors as the sensitive values. From the Table 3, we can observe that the generalization algorithm will not cause any information loss in sensitive attribute values while the personality privacy [5] was not. We may label the tuples whose sen-the same color class-tags into different Q I-groups to prevent the problem of proximity privacy leakage. Hence, m-Color constraint is introduced. fulfills m-Color constraint, if in this table, each QI-group satisfies m-Color constraint. Without considering the information loss, we can provide a possible partition of Color constraint. 
In our paper, m-Color constraint is used to solve the categorical attribute proximity privacy problem, which limits proximity privacy leakage effectively. Given table T and m , after each tuple was labeled different color class-tags, we won-lized T * that fulfills m-Color constraint? This question is equivalent to the following definition 5. Hence, the results are given as follows. Definition 3. Given table T and m , if there exists a partition that each QI-group has at unique. We refer to such table as m-eligible . Theorem 1. T is a m-eligible , if and only if the number of tuples with the same sensi-tive values is no more than 1/ m the total number of tuples in the table T . The principle of generalization algorithm is to partition the microdata into QI-groups and to reduce the information loss of table as much as possible. Here, the whole algo-top-down algorithm [11], we can reduce the scale of questions continuously. Second-ly, we partition each sub-table, which comes from the first step, into buckets. The last step, the buckets were partitioned into QI-groups. 5.1 Top-Down Partitioning Algorithm The algorithm framework is shown in ALG 1 . To keep the algorithm simple, we con-whether the both subsets satisfy the m-Color constraint. Otherwise, after trying k times in the first step 1-5, we use the Assign algorithm to create the buckets.

Random Shuffler the set T ; domly, then to choose t 1 to minimize NCP( t 1 , u ) (see the definition 3). We can scan all tuples once to find tuple t 2 that maximizes NCP( t 1 , t 2 ). Step 2: For each tuple w in table T , we compute the  X  1 = NCP( w  X  S 1 )-NCP( S 1 ), and 2 =NCP( w  X  S 2 )-NCP( S 2 ), and distribute w to the group that leads to a lower infor-mation loss. Step 3: If  X  1 =  X  2 , then w was put to the group with less cardinality. partition T are tried K times and tuples of G are randomly shuffled for each time. In the second step, we use assign algorithm [3] to create the set of buckets. 5.2 Split Algorithm In this section, we use buckets passed from the assign algorithm to generate QI-into two disjoint buk 1 and buk 2 , and each bucket has the same signature. The process ponds to one tuple. dimension of QI-attributes. Among all the d partitions, we pick the one that minimizes the sum of NCP(buk 1 ) and NCP(buk 2 ) as the final partition. In this section, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In our paper, the experiments run on AMD Dual Core CPU 1.9GHZ, RAM 1GB, Window 2003 Server machine. Our experimentation deploys a real database INCOME from http://ipums.org. We treat the first five columns as QI-attributes, and Income as the sensitive attr ibute. We compare our algorithm (denoted by m-Color ) with perturbation technique [21] (perturbation in short). 
We measure utility by answering aggregate queries on published anonymous data, since such queries are the basic operations for many database tasks. Specifically, we use queries of the following form: select count(*) from INC where A 1  X  b 1 And A
In the experiment, we compare our algorithm with perturbation technique [21]. We fixed s as 0.1 and the dimensionality of queries is two. The technique of perturbation from about 40% to about 280%, the results of our paper are not to exceed 10%, seeing the Fig 3. 
Fig 4 illustrates the cost of our anonymous algorithm, while the perturbation tech-nique is finished in less than 1 second (omitted from the Fig 4). The executing time of generalization algorithm probably decreases from 350s to 110s when m from 4 to 30. The weakness of k-anonymity motivates us to develop a novel anonymization prin-ciple called categorical sensitive attributes m-Color constraint, which provides better privacy preservation in order to prevent the same categorical sensitive attributes prox-imity privacy leakage. We systematically analyze the theoretic properties of this new technique and propose a corresponding algorithm. As verified by extensive experi-ments, our algorithm supports more effective query and data analysis, and simulta-neously providing enough privacy preservation. Acknowledgement.
