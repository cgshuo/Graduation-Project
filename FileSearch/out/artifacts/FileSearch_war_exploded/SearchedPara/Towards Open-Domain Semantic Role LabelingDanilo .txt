 The availability of large scale semantic lexicons, such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), allowed the adoption of a wide family of learning paradigms in the automation of semantic parsing. Building upon the so called frame semantic model (Fill-more, 1985), the Berkeley FrameNet project has developed a semantic lexicon for the core vocab-ulary of English, since 1997. A frame is evoked in texts through the occurrence of its lexical units ( LU ), i.e. predicate words such verbs, nouns, or adjectives, and specifies the participants and prop-erties of the situation it describes, the so called frame elements ( FEs ).

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of automatic recognition of individual predicates to-gether with their major roles (e.g. frame ele-ments) as they are grammatically realized in in-put sentences. It has been a popular task since the availability of the PropBank and FrameNet an-notated corpora (Palmer et al., 2005), the seminal work of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) and the suc-cessful CoNLL evaluation campaigns (Carreras and M ` arquez, 2005). Statistical machine learning methods, ranging from joint probabilistic models to support vector machines, have been success-fully adopted to provide very accurate semantic labeling, e.g. (Carreras and M ` arquez, 2005).
SRL based on FrameNet is thus not a novel task, although very few systems are known capable of completing a general frame-based annotation pro-cess over raw texts, noticeable exceptions being discussed for example in (Erk and Pado, 2006), (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) and (Coppola et al., 2009). Some critical limitations have been out-lined in literature, some of them independent from the underlying semantic paradigm.

Parsing Accuracy. Most of the employed learning algorithms are based on complex sets of syntagmatic features, as deeply investigated in (Jo-hansson and Nugues, 2008b). The resulting recog-nition is thus highly dependent on the accuracy of the underlying parser , whereas wrong structures returned by the parser usually imply large misclas-sification errors.

Annotation costs. Statistical learning ap-proaches applied to SRL are very demanding with respect to the amount and quality of the train-ing material . The complex SRL architectures proposed (usually combining local and global, i.e. joint, models of argument classification, e.g. (Toutanova et al., 2008)) require a large number of annotated examples. The amount and quality of the training data required to reach a significant ac-curacy is a serious limitation to the exploitation of SRL in many NLP applications.

Limited Linguistic Generalization. Several studies showed that even when large training sets exist the corresponding learning exhibits poor generalization power . Most of the CoNLL 2005 systems show a significant performance drop when the tested corpus, i.e. Brown, differs from the training one (i.e. Wall Street Journal), e.g. (Toutanova et al., 2008). More recently, the state-of-art frame-based semantic role labeling system discussed in (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) re-ports a 19% drop in accuracy for the argument classification task when a different test domain is targeted (i.e. NTI corpus). Out-of-domain tests seem to suggest the models trained on BNC do not generalize well to novel grammatical and lexical phenomena. As also suggested in (Pradhan et al., 2008), the major drawback is the poor generaliza-tion power affecting lexical features. Notice how this is also a general problem of statistical learning processes, as large fine grain feature sets are more exposed to the risks of overfitting.

The above problems are particularly critical for frame-based shallow semantic parsing where, as opposed to more syntactic-oriented semantic labeling schemes (as Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005)), a significant mismatch exists between the semantic descriptors and the underlying syntac-tic annotation level . In (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) an upper bound of about 83.9% for the ac-curacy of the argument identification task is re-ported, it is due to the complexity in projecting frame element boundaries out from the depen-dency graph: more than 16% of the roles in the annotated material lack of a clear grammatical sta-tus.

The limited level of linguistic generalization outlined above is still an open research problem. Existing solutions have been proposed in litera-ture along different lines. Learning from richer linguistic descriptions of more complex structures is proposed in (Toutanova et al., 2008). Limit-ing the cost required for developing large domain-specific training data sets has been also studied, e.g., (F  X  urstenau and Lapata, 2009). Finally, the ap-plication of semi-supervised learning is attempted to increase the lexical expressiveness of the model, e.g. (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2009).

In this paper, this last direction is pursued. A semi-supervised statistical model exploiting use-ful lexical information from unlabeled corpora is proposed. The model adopts a simple feature space by relying on a limited set of grammati-cal properties, thus reducing its learning capac-ity. Moreover, it generalizes lexical information about the annotated examples by applying a ge-ometrical model, in a Latent Semantic Analysis style, inspired by a distributional paradigm (Pado and Lapata, 2007). As we will see, the accu-racy reachable through a restricted feature space is still quite close to the state-of-art, but interestingly the performance drops in out-of-domain tests are avoided.

In the following, after discussing existing ap-proaches to SRL (Section 2), a distributional ap-proach is defined in Section 3. Section 3.2 dis-cusses the proposed HMM-based treatment of joint inferences in argument classification. The large scale experiments described in Section 4 will allow to draw the conclusions of Section 5. State-of-art approaches to frame-based SRL are based on Support Vector Machines, trained over linear models of syntactic features, e.g. (Jo-hansson and Nugues, 2008b), or tree-kernels, e.g. (Coppola et al., 2009). SRL proceeds through two main steps: the localization of arguments in a sen-tence, called boundary detection (BD) , and the as-signment of the proper role to the detected con-stituents, that is the argument classification, (AC) step. In (Toutanova et al., 2008) a SRL model over Propbank that effectively exploits the seman-tic argument frame as a joint structure, is pre-sented. It incorporates strong dependencies within a comprehensive statistical joint model with a rich set of features over multiple argument phrases. This approach effectively introduces a new step in SRL, also called Joint Re-ranking, (RR) , e.g. (Toutanova et al., 2008) or (Moschitti et al., 2008). First local models are applied to produce role labels over individual arguments, then the joint model is used to decide the entire argument se-quence among the set of the n -best competing solutions. While these approaches increase the expressive power of the models to capture more general linguistic properties, they rely on com-plex feature sets, are more demanding about the amount of training information and increase the overall exposure to overfitting effects.

In (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) the impact of different grammatical representations on the task of frame-based shallow semantic parsing is stud-ied and the poor lexical generalization problem is outlined. An argument classification accuracy of 89.9% over the FrameNet (i.e. BNC) dataset is shown to decrease to 71.1% when a different test domain is evaluated (i.e. the Nuclear Threat Initiative corpus). The argument classification component is thus shown to be heavily domain-dependent whereas the inclusion of grammatical function features is just able to mitigate this sen-sitivity. In line with (Pradhan et al., 2008), it is suggested that lexical features are domain specific and their suitable generalization is not achieved.
The lack of suitable lexical information is also discussed in (F  X  urstenau and Lapata, 2009) through an approach aiming to support the creation of novel annotated resources. Accordingly a semi-supervised approach for reducing the costs of the manual annotation effort is proposed. Through a graph alignment algorithm triggered by annotated resources, the method acquires training instances from an unlabeled corpus also for verbs not listed as existing FrameNet predicates. 2.1 The role of Lexical Semantic Information It is widely accepted that lexical information (as features directly derived from word forms) is cru-cial for training accurate systems in a number of NLP tasks. Indeed, all the best systems in the CoNLL shared task competitions (e.g. Chunk-ing (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000)) make extensive use of lexical information. Also lexi-cal features are beneficial in SRL usually either for systems on Propbank as well as for FrameNet-based annotation.

In (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2009), a different strategy to incorporate lexical features into clas-sification models is proposed. A more expres-sive training algorithm (i.e. anchored SVM) cou-pled with an aggressive feature pruning strategy is shown to achieve high accuracy over a chunk-ing and named entity recognition task. The sug-gested perspective here is that effective semantic knowledge can be collected from sources exter-nal to the annotated corpora (very large unanno-tated corpora or on manually constructed lexical resources) rather than learned from the raw lexi-cal counts of the annotated corpus. Notice how this is also the strategy pursued in recent work on deep learning approaches to NLP tasks. In (Col-lobert and Weston, 2008) a unified architecture for Natural Language Processing that learns fea-tures relevant to the tasks at hand given very lim-ited prior knowledge is presented. It embodies the idea that a multitask learning architecture coupled with semi-supervised learning can be effectively applied even to complex linguistic tasks such as SRL. In particular, (Collobert and Weston, 2008) proposes an embedding of lexical information us-ing Wikipedia as source, and exploiting the result-ing language model within the multitask learning process. The idea of (Collobert and Weston, 2008) to obtain an embedding of lexical information by acquiring a language model from unlabeled data is an interesting approach to the problem of perfor-mance degradation in out-of-domain tests, as al-ready pursued by (Deschacht and Moens, 2009). The extensive use of unlabeled texts allows to achieve a significant level of lexical generalization that seems better capitalize the smaller annotated data sets. High quality lexical information is crucial for ro-bust open-domain SRL, as semantic generaliza-tion highly depends on lexical information. For example, the following two sentences evoke the S
TATEMENT frame, through the LUs say and state , where the FEs, S PEAKER and M EDIUM , are shown.
In sentence (1), for example, President Kennedy is the grammatical subject of the verb say and this justifies its role of S PEAKER . However, syn-tax does not entirely characterize argument seman-tics. In (1) and (2), the same syntactic relation is observed. It is the semantics of the grammatical heads, i.e. report and Kennedy , the main respon-sible for the difference between the two resulting proto-agentive roles, S PEAKER and M EDIUM . In this work we explore two different aspects. First, we propose a model that does not depend on complex syntactic information in order to min-imize the risk of overfitting. Second, we improve the lexical semantic information available to the learning algorithm. The proposed  X  X inimalistic X  approach will consider only two independent fea-tures:  X  the semantic head ( h ) of a role, as it can  X  the dependency relation ( r ) connecting the
In the rest of the section the distributional model for the argument classification step is presented. A lexicalized model for individual semantic roles is first defined in order to achieve robust seman-tic classification local to each argument. Then a Hidden Markov Model is introduced in order to exploit the local probability estimators, sensitive to lexical similarity, as well as the global informa-tion on the entire argument sequence. 3.1 Distributional Local Models As the classification of semantic roles is strictly related to the lexical meaning of argument heads, we adopt a distributional perspective, where the meaning is described by the set of textual con-texts in which words appear. In distributional models, words are thus represented through vec-tors built over these observable contexts: similar vectors suggest semantic relatedness as a func-tion of the distance between two words, capturing paradigmatic (e.g. synonymy) or syntagmatic re-lations (Pado, 2007). Vectors an adjacency matrix M , whose rows describe tar-get words ( h ) and whose columns describe their corpus contexts. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), is then applied to M to acquire meaningful representations exploits the linear transformation called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and produces an ap-proximation of the original matrix M , capturing (semantic) dependencies between context vectors. M is replaced by a lower dimensional matrix M l , capturing the same statistical information in a new l -dimensional space, where each dimension is a linear combination of some of the original fea-tures (i.e. contexts). These derived features may be thought as artificial concepts, each one repre-senting an emerging meaning component, as the linear combination of many different words.

In the argument classification task, the similar-ity between two argument heads h 1 and h 2 ob-served in FrameNet can be computed over  X  X  X  h . The model for a given frame element FE k is built around the semantic heads h observed in the role FE k : they form a set denoted by H FE k . These LSA vectors notated examples as they are immerse in the LSA Table 1: Clusters of semantic heads in the Subj position for the frame S TATEMENT with  X  = 0.5 space acquired from the unlabeled texts. More-over, given FE k , a model for each individual syn-tactic relation r (i.e. that links h labeled as FE k to their corresponding predicates) is a partition of the set H FE k called H FE k r , i.e. the subset of H FE k produced by examples of the relation r (e.g. Subj ). Given the annotated sentence (2), we have
As the LSA vectors mantic heads h , a vector representation the role FE k can be obtained from the annotated data. However, one single vector is a too simplis-tic representation given the rich nature of seman-tic roles FE k . In order to better represent FE k , multiple regions in the semantic space are used. They are obtained by a clustering process applied to the set H FE k r according to the Quality Thresh-old (QT) algorithm (Heyer et al., 1999). QT is a generalization of k -mean where a variable number of clusters can be obtained. This number depends on the minimal value of intra-cluster similarity ac-cepted by the algorithm and controlled by a pa-rameter,  X  : lower values of  X  correspond to more heterogeneous (i.e. larger grain) clusters, while values close to 1 characterize stricter policies and more fine-grained results. Given a syntactic rela-tion r , C FE k r denotes the clusters derived by QT clustering over H FE k r . Each cluster c  X  C FE k r is represented by a vector  X  X  X  c , computed as the geometric centroid of its semantic heads h  X  c . For a frame F , clusters define a geometric model of every frame elements FE k : it consists of cen-troids  X  X  X  c with c  X  H FE k r . Each c represents FE k through a set of similar heads, as role fillers ob-served in FrameNet. Table 1 represents clusters for the heads H FE k Subj of the S TATEMENT frame.
In argument classification we assume that the evoking predicate word for the frame F in an input sentence s is known. A sentence s can be seen as a sequence of role-relation pairs: s = { ( r 1 ,h 1 ) , ..., ( r n ,h n ) } where the heads h are in the syntactic relation r i with the underlying lexical unit of F .

For every head h in s , the vector used to estimate its similarity with the different candidate roles FE k . Given the syntactic relation r , the clusters c  X  C FE k r whose centroid vector ~c is closer to ~ h are selected. D r,h is the set of the representations semantically related to h : where the similarity between the j -th cluster for the FE k , i.e. c kj  X  C FE k r , and h is the usual cosine similarity : sim cos ( h,c kj ) =
Then, through a k-nearest neighbours ( k -NN) strategy within D r,h , the m clusters c kj most simi-lar to h are retained in the set D ( m ) r,h . A probabilis-tic preference for the role FE k is estimated for h through a cluster-based voting scheme, or, alternatively, an instance-based one over D ( m ) r,h
In Fig. 1 the preference estimation for the incoming head h = professor connected to a LU by the Subj relation is shown. Clus-ters for the heads in Table 1 are also reported. First, in the set of clusters whose similarity with professor is higher than a threshold  X  the m = 5 most similar clusters are selected. Ac-cordingly, the preferences given by Eq. 4 are eled by Eq. 5 amplifies the role of larger tional , the model that applies Eq. 5 to the source ( r,h ) arguments, by rejecting cases only when no information about the head h is available from the unlabeled corpus or no example of relation r for the role FE k is available from the annotated cor-pus. Eq. 4 and 5 in fact do not cover all possible cases. Often the incoming head h or the relation r may be unavailable: 1. If the head h has never been met in the un-2. If the relation r can not be properly located Both prob ( FE k | r ) and prob ( FE k ) can be esti-mated from the training set and smoothing can be also applied 1 . A more robust argument preference function for all arguments ( r i ,h i )  X  s of the frame F is thus given by: prob ( FE k | r i ,h i ) =  X  1 prob ( FE k | r i ,h i ) + where weights  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X  3 can be heuristically as-signed or estimated from the training set 2 . The resulting model is hereafter called Backoff model : although simply based on a single feature (i.e. the syntactic relation r ), it accounts for information at different reliability degrees. 3.2 A Joint Model for Argument Eq. 6 defines roles preferences local to individual arguments ( r i ,h i ) . However, an argument frame is a joint structure, with strong dependencies be-tween arguments. We thus propose to model the reranking phase ( RR ) as a HMM sequence label-ing task. It defines a stochastic inference over multiple (locally justified) alternative sequences through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). It in-fers the best sequence FE ( k 1 ,...,k n ) over all the possible hidden state sequences (i.e. made by the the arguments ( r i ,h i ) . Viterbi inference is applied to build the best (role) interpretation for the input sentence.

Once Eq. 6 is available, the best frame element can be selected by defining the function  X  (  X  ) that maps arguments ( r i ,h i )  X  s to frame elements FE k :
Notice that different transfer functions  X  (  X  ) are usually possible. By computing their prob-ability we can solve the SRL task by select-ing the most likely interpretation, b  X  (  X  ) , via argmax  X  P  X  (  X  ) | s , as follows: In Eq. 8, the emission probability P s |  X  (  X  ) and the transition probability P  X  (  X  ) are explicit. No-tice that the emission probability corresponds to an argument interpretation (e.g. Eq. 5) and it is assigned independently from the rest of the sen-tence. On the other hand, transition probabilities model role sequences and support the expectations about argument frames of a sentence.
 The emission probability is approximated as:
P s |  X  (1) ... X  ( n )  X  as it is made independent from previous states in a Viterbi path. Again the emission probability can be rewritten as:
Since P ( r i ,h i ) does not depend on the role la-beling, maximizing Eq. 10 corresponds to maxi-mize: whereas P ( FE  X  ( i ) | r i ,h i ) is thus estimated through Eq. 6.
 The transition probability, estimated through accounts FEs sequence via a 3 -gram model 3 . The aim of the evaluation is to measure the reach-able accuracy of the simple model proposed and to compare its impact over in-domain and out-of-domain semantic role labeling tasks. In particular, we will evaluate the argument classification (AC) task in Section 4.2.

Experimental Set-Up . The in-domain test has been run over the FrameNet annotated corpus, de-rived from the British National Corpus (BNC). The splitting between train and test set is 90%-10% according to the same data set of (Johans-son and Nugues, 2008b). In all experiments, the FrameNet 1.3 version and the dependency-based system using the LTH parser (Johansson and Nugues, 2008a) have been employed. Out-of-domain tests are run over the two training cor-pora as made available by the Semeval 2007 Task 19 4 (Baker et al., 2007): the Nuclear Threat Ini-tiative (NTI) and the American National Corpus (ANC) 5 . Table 2 shows the predicates and argu-ments in each data set. All null-instantiated ar-guments were removed from the training and test sets.

Vectors ~ h representing semantic heads have been computed according to the  X  X ependency-based X  vector space discussed in (Pado and La-pata, 2007). The entire BNC corpus has been parsed and the dependency graphs derived from individual sentences provided the basic observ-able contexts: every co-occurrence is thus syntac-tically justified by a dependency arc. The most frequent 30,000 basic features, i.e. (syntactic re-lation,lemma) pairs, have been used to build the matrix M , vector components corresponding to point-wise mutual information scores. Finally, the final space is obtained by applying the SVD reduc-tion over M , with a dimensionality cut of l = 250 .
In the evaluation of the AC task, accuracy is computed over the nodes of the dependency graph, in line with (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) or (Coppola et al., 2009). Accordingly, also recall, precision and F-measure are reported on a per node basis, against the binary BD task or for the full BD + AC chain. 4.1 The Role of Lexical Clustering The first study aims at detecting the impact of dif-ferent clustering policies on the resulting AC ac-curacy. Clustering, as discussed in Section 3.1, allows to generalize lexical information: similar heads within the latent semantic space are built from the annotated examples and they allow to predict the behavior of new unseen words as found in the test sentences. The system performances have been here measured under different cluster-ing conditions, i.e. grains at which the clustering of annotated examples is applied. This grain is de-termined by the parameter  X  of the applied Quality Threshold algorithm (Heyer et al., 1999). Notice that small values of  X  imply large clusters, while if Table 3: Accuracy on Arg classification tasks wrt different clustering policies  X   X  1 then many singleton clusters are promoted (i.e. one cluster for each example). By varying the threshold  X  we thus account for prototype-based as well exemplar-based strategies, as discussed in (Erk, 2009).

We measured the performance on the argument classification tasks of different models obtained by combing different choices of  X  with Eq. (4) or (5). Results are reported in Table 3. The leftmost col-umn reports the different clustering settings, while in the remaining columns we see performances over test sentences related to different frames: we selected frames for which an increasing number of annotated examples are available: from all frames (for more than 0 examples) to the only frame (i.e. S
ELF MOTION ) that has more than 5,000 exam-ples in our training data set.

The reported accuracies suggest that Eq. (5), promoting an example driven strategy, better cap-tures the role preference, as it always outperforms alternative settings (i.e. more prototype oriented methods). It limits overgeneralization and pro-motes fine grained clusters. An interesting result is that a per-node accuracy of 86.3 (i.e. only 3 points under the state of-the art on the same data set, (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b)) is achieved. All the remaining tests have been run with the clus-tering configuration characterized by Eq. (5) and  X  = 0 . 85 . 4.2 Argument Classification Accuracy In these experiments we evaluate the quality of the argument classification step against the lexi-cal knowledge acquired from unlabeled texts and the reranking step. The accuracy reachable on the gold standard argument boundaries has been com-pared across several experimental settings. Two baseline systems have been obtained. The Local Prior model outputs the sequence that maximizes the prior probability locally to individual argu-ments. The Global Prior model is obtained by ap-plying re-ranking (Section 3.2) to the best n = 10 candidates provided by the Local Prior model. Fi-nally, the application of the backoff strategies (as in Eq. 6) and the HMM-based reranking character-ize the final two configurations. Table 4 reports the accuracy results obtained over the three corpora (defined as in Table 2): the accuracy scores are av-eraged over different values of m in Eq. 5, ranging from 3 to 30. In the in-domain scenario, i.e. the FN-BNC dataset reported in column 2, it is worth noticing that the proposed model, with backoff and global reranking, is quite effective with respect to the state-of-the-art.

Although results on the FN-BNC do not outper-form the state-of-the-art for the FrameNet corpus, we still need to study the generalization capabil-ity of our SRL model in out-of-domain conditions. In a further experiment, we applied the same sys-tem, as trained over the FN-BNC data, to the other corpora, i.e. NTI and ANC, used entirely as test sets. Results, reported in column 3 and 4 of Ta-ble 4 and shown in Figure 2, confirm that no ma-jor drop in performance is observed. Notice how the positive impact of the backoff models and the HMM reranking policy is similarly reflected by all the collections. Moreover, the results on the NTI corpus are even better than those obtained on the BNC, with a resulting 90.5% accuracy on the AC task. Figure 2: Accuracy of the AC task over different corpora 4.3 Discussion The above empirical findings are relevant if com-pared with the outcome of a similar test on the NTI collection, discussed in (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) 6 . There, under the same training condi-tions, a performance drop of about -19% is re-ported (from 89.9 to 71.1%) over gold standard argument boundaries. The model proposed in this paper exhibits no such drop in any collection (NTI and ANC). This seems to confirm the hypothesis that the model is able to properly generalize the required lexical information across different do-mains.

It is interesting to outline that the individual stages of the proposed model play different roles in the different domains, as Table 4 suggests. Al-though the positive contributions of the individual processing stages are uniformly confirmed, some differences can be outlined:  X  The beneficial impact of the lexical informa- X  The complexity of the three test sets is dif- X  The role of HMM reranking is an effective
The significant performance of the AC model here presented suggest to test it when integrated within a full SRL architecture. Table 5 reports the results of the processing cascade over three col-lections. Results on the Boundary Detection BD task are obtained by training an SVM model on the same feature set presented in (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) and are slightly below the state-of-the art BD accuracy reported in (Coppola et al., 2009). However, the accuracy of the complete BD + AC + RR chain (i.e. 68%) improves the corresponding results of (Coppola et al., 2009). Given the relatively simple feature set adopted here, this result is very significant as for its result-ing efficiency. The overall BD recognition pro-cess is, on a standard architecture, performed at about 6.74 sentences per second, that is basically Table 5: Accuracy of the full cascade of the SRL system over three domain the same as the time needed for applying the en-tire BD + AC + RR chain, i.e. 6.21 sentence per second. In this paper, a distributional approach for acquir-ing a semi-supervised model of argument classi-fication ( AC ) preferences has been proposed. It aims at improving the generalization capability of the inductive SRL approach by reducing the com-plexity of the employed grammatical features and through a distributional representation of lexical features. The obtained results are close to the state-of-art in FrameNet semantic parsing. State of the art accuracy is obtained instead in out-of-domain experiments. The model seems to cap-italize from simple methods of lexical modeling (i.e. the estimation of lexico-grammatical pref-erences through distributional analysis over unla-beled data), estimation (through syntactic or lexi-cal back-off where necessary) and reranking. The result is an accurate and highly portable SRL cas-cade. Experiments on the integrated SRL archi-tecture (i.e. BD + AC + RR chain) show that state-of-art accuracy (i.e. 68%) can be obtained on raw texts. This result is also very significant as for the achieved efficiency. The system is able to apply the entire BD + AC + RR chain at a speed of 6.21 sentences per second. This signif-icant efficiency confirms the applicability of the SRL approach proposed here in large scale NLP applications. Future work will study the appli-cation of the flexible SRL method proposed to other languages, for which less resources are avail-able and worst training conditions are the norm. Moreover, dimensionality reduction methods al-ternative to LSA, as currently studied on semi-supervised spectral learning (Johnson and Zhang, 2008), will be experimented.
