 With massive amounts of data being generated and stored ubiquitously in every discipline and every aspect of our daily life, how to handle such big data poses many challenging is-sues to researchers in data and information systems. The participants of CIKM 2013 are active researchers on large-scale data, information and knowledge management, from multiple disciplines, including database systems, data min-ing, information retrieval, human-computer interaction, and knowledge or information management. The commonly raised questions may include: Do we need a sea change to our current data and in-formation systems in order to handle Big Data? What are the biggest challenges to solve the data del-uge problem  X  data storage, transmission, manage-ment, information extraction, search, structure discov-ery, analytics, or diversity of applications? Am I also in the Big Data camp if my company or research does not have really really big data in the scale like Google or Microsoft or we are not technologically savvy enough to use the  X  X ypical X  Big Data systems? Will Big Data call for rather different games in in-formation industry (such as searching on the web) vs. science and engineering (such as analyzing biological data)? How may Big Data impact data analytics? Is the tra-ditional hypothesis-driven research dead in science and be replaced by data-driven approach, in biology, medicine, public policy, social sciences, and humanities? Big Data/Data Analytics are everywhere  X  in every company and every field of science, what are the prob-lems that computer science people can solve? and what are the problems that belong to other sciences? Data generation by massive instrumentation and col-laboration will need to bare huge storage and bandwidth costs. How can we design methods that help address the balance between exhaustive instrumentation and overly conservative instrumentation? For what kind of search/learning problems, Big Data or the complete set of data must be used, and for what kind of problems, sampling will work just fine? Can we commoditize the analytics and knowledge dis-covery so  X  X n-the-shelf X  products can be systematically developed, or it can never be done? What are the most critical research issues on data and information systems in the Big Data age ? How can our research make differences to the devel-opment of new generations of data and information systems for Big Data?
